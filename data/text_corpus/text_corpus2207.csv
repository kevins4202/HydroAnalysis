11035,many countries are suffering from water resource constraints due to rising demands from different water consuming sectors and a changing climate in some countries such as spain operators of agricultural irrigation are under increasing pressure to improve efficiency accordingly accurate forecasts of water demand are a pre requisite for the successful implementation of water resources planning and management tools in irrigated areas however forecasting approaches based on traditional neural networks have challenges to capture temporal dependencies that generally characterize irrigation flow time series in this study for the first time a recurrent long short term memory network lstm was coupled with the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transformation modwt and bootstrap techniques for accurate and robust irrigation flow forecasting for comparative purposes the study also explored the ability of an artificial neural network ann a least squares support vector regression lssvr an extreme learning machine elm and a multi linear regression mlr to forecast irrigation flow in palos de la frontera an irrigation district located in huelva southern spain for a one day lead time the autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function determined the most significant lagged time series of irrigation flow to be used as model inputs the wavelet lstm w lstm

and bootstrap techniques were benchmarked and could be further explored for forecasting other water resources variables in different climatic regions and for multi step lead time forecasting keywords time series analysis long short term network forecasting irrigation flow machine learning 1 introduction population growth increasing water scarcity and a changing climate have increased pressure to improve water use efficiency as the world s largest user of water the irrigated agriculture sector accounts for 69 of consumptive water use schlosser et al 2014 accordingly information regarding water demand in irrigated areas is a basic prerequisite for the development and implementation of successful water resources management tools onu 1997 sumpsi et al 1998 this has become a critical issue in countries such as spain where the water demand for irrigated agriculture is steadily growing and water resources are limited rodriguez díaz et al 2007 in this context spain has modernized its hydraulic infrastructures and switched from old open channel distribution networks to pressurized distribution networks these new systems allow for the use of more efficient on farm sprinklers and drip systems and provide on demand water to farmers plusquellec 2009 the quality of these distribution network services however depends on management related factors and infrastructure related factors urrestarazu 2007 accurately forecasting irrigation water requirements is also one of the main tools required for the design management and modernization of water supply and distribution systems in irrigation districts pulido calvo et al 2003 tiwari and adamowski 2017 irrigation flow forecasting systems can be developed based on daily weekly or monthly lead times a number of studies have shown that effective water resources management systems require daily time scale water flow forecasts kişi 2010 londhe and gavraskar 2015 pandey and srinivas 2015 in particular daily lead time stream flow forecasts are a prerequisite for the effective management of water resources at hydraulic structures in river basins and for the development of early warning systems guven 2009 pandey and srinivas 2015 yaseen et al 2016 such early warning systems provide data useful in different research areas from water quality assessment to water pricing and water allocation strategy development yaseen et al 2016 most irrigation water distribution systems involve storage operations based on a daily cycle as demands vary over the day and energy prices change as a function of the time of day pulido calvo et al 2003 therefore this study focused on daily irrigation flow forecasting methodologies for water resources modelling and forecasting include conceptual physical models modelling and system theoretical modelling data driven models conceptual models are usually based on continuous measurements of relevant soil characteristics and include empirical or functional models doorenbos and kassam 1979 allen et al 1998 as well as mechanistic models van aelst et al 1988 in contrast system theoretical models do not examine the internal structure of the physical processes in detail but instead use discrete data to learn accurate input output mapping in identifying a direct mapping between commonly available input variables e g temperature or precipitation and relevant output variables e g flow rate volume these models are often considered better suited for operational forecasting applications compared to conceptual physics based models pulido calvo et al 2007 the development of such approaches was discussed in a review of the water demand forecasting literature from 2000 to 2010 donkor et al 2012 however despite the field s progress over the last several decades there remains a mismatch between the water requirements calculated for irrigation planning and the actual irrigation demand in the field pulido calvo et al 2007 this discrepancy is attributable to changing weather conditions or farmer s behavior influencing the actual amounts of water used urrestarazu 2007 in fact actual water management in some irrigation districts is guided by practical experience and intuition of the administrator which can be imprecise pulido calvo et al 2007 accordingly there remains a need to improve the accuracy of forecasts of daily water requirements for crop irrigation water demand modelling over the last several decades can be classified into parametric and nonparametric approaches parametric models include various time series models such as the widely applied autoregressive integrated moving average arima model common non parametric methods or soft computing techniques include artificial neural networks anns and their variants pulido calvo et al 2007 ghiassi et al 2008 jain et al 2001 adamowski et al 2012 mouatadid et al 2015 gagliardi et al 2017 as well as other approaches such as least squares support vector regression lssvr msiza et al 2008 herrera et al 2010 in addition the extreme learning approach elm has gained popularity in time series forecasting because it requires significantly less computational time than traditional ann models these computational gains are achieved by randomly assigning the input weights and hidden layer biases while training the model huang et al 2006 moreover the elm modeling technique satisfies the universal approximation condition and typically provides good generalization performance huang et al 2006 and is therefore a suitable machine learning approach for water resources variable forecasting mouatadid and adamowski 2016 yadav et al 2018 tiwari and kumar 2018 more recently long short term memory lstm networks a special case of recurrent neural networks rnn has started to gain momentum in the deep learning literature goodfellow et al 2016 lstms were proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 to address the vanishing gradient issue of conventional rnns compared to classical neural networks lstms model temporal sequences and their long range dependencies with greater accuracy in real life applications they have shown a greater ability to learn long range dependencies compared to standard rnns and traditional anns lipton et al 2015 davidson et al 2007 demonstrated that a single layer lstm can identify lapses in attention based on electroencephalogram spectral data better than a tapped delay line multilayer perceptron mlp in a survey of deep learning applications in agriculture kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018 discussed the dynamic temporal learning behavior of lstms and their performance when applied to various tasks from winter vegetation mapping minh et al 2017 to crop type classification rußwurm and körner 2017 a more recent study applied lstms to predict sewer overflow water levels and found them to outperform multilayer perceptrons wavelet neural networks and gated recurrent unit models zhang et al 2018a lstms are only beginning to be explored for hydrological and water resources modelling fang et al 2017 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 they have not previously been explored as irrigation flow forecasting models nor have they been benchmarked against other prevalent models e g ann lssvr elm etc in the hydrological modelling literature this study addresses this research gap by exploring the forecasting skill of lstms compared to ann lssvr and elm models models such as ann lssvr and elm have been extensively applied in the context of hydrological forecasting studies deka 2014 nayak et al 2013 in aksoy et al 2007 it was argued that the lack of input pre processing during the development of machine learning based hydrological models prevented these models from accounting for the physics of hydrological processes since flow dynamics are characterized by non linearity trends and seasonal variations caused by underlying physical processes tiwari and chatterjee 2010a tiwari et al 2013 the present study exploits the ability of wavelet transformations as input pre processors to capture frequency and location in time information to improve the accuracy of the developed models in the hydrology literature to the best knowledge of the authors w lstm bootstrap lstm b lstm or wavelet bootstrap lstm wb lstm hybrid models have not been explored as a tool to forecast time series therefore all these models are proposed and their performances are benchmarked for irrigation water demand forecasting in this study seasonal variations and trends significantly affect the modeling of time series data and generally lead to poor predictive ability virili and freisleben 2000 wavelet transformations provide an analysis of time series data in both time and frequency domains and yield a time frequency representation of the signal under study wavelet analysis uses a mother wavelet function to decompose time series data into multiple scale specific time series filtering and separating otherwise noisy signals nalley et al 2013 in addition wavelet analysis provides significant information about the physical structure of the time series data daubechies 1990 discrete wavelet transforms dwts are characterized by simpler computation and development compared to continuous wavelet transforms cwts the popularity of dwt in water resources research has grown in recent years with studies investigating regional drought forecasting belayneh et al 2014 rainfall runoff forecasting anctil and tape 2004 nourani et al 2009 monthly and daily streamflow forecasting kişi 2009 maheswaran and khosa 2012a tiwari et al 2013 monthly groundwater level forecasting moosavi et al 2013 short term urban water demand forecasting tiwari et al 2013 reservoir inflow forecasting kumar et al 2015 and medium term water demand forecasting tiwari and adamowski 2017 among other applications however further development of wavelet based soft computing techniques is required to improve the model performance in terms of accuracy and reliability in water demand forecasting applications hybrid methods proposed in the water resources forecasting literature are the bootstrap based neural networks b nn tiwari and chatterjee 2010a b fuzzy neural networks alvisi and franchini 2011 and grey neural networks alvisi and franchini 2012 besides reducing uncertainty in the variance by mimicking randomness efron and tibshirani 1993 b nns were found to be simpler and easier to use in addressing uncertainty in an operational setting compared to bayesian approaches isukapalli and georgopoulos 2001 several studies showed b nn models to outperform conventional neural networks abrahart 2003 tiwari and chatterjee 2010a b tiwari and adamowski 2017 wavelet based neural networks w nn and b nn hybrid approaches can be combined to form a wavelet bootstrap nn wb nn model with the potential ability to achieve greater accuracy and reliability in water demand forecasting tiwari and adamowski 2017 the present study explores for the first time the use of lstm and wavelet bootstrap lstm models for irrigation flow forecasting and compares their accuracies to that of other data driven models mlr ann lssvr and elm along with their counterparts developed using bootstrap analysis and wavelet transformation the developed models were used to forecast daily irrigation flow in palos de la frontera an irrigation district located in huelva southern spain for a one day ahead lead time as a tool to improve water distribution management in irrigation districts 2 theoretical framework in this section we provide a brief overview of the theory useful in the development of the lstm model developed in this study and also describe the wavelet theory used to develop the hybrid counterpart models the remaining methods are well described in the literature mlr glantz and slinker 2001 ann bishop 1994 lssvr suykens and vandewalle 1999 and elm huang et al 2006 the bootstrap resampling technique is explained in efron and tibshirani 1993 2 1 long short term memory networks recurrent neural networks rnns are neural networks with closed loop connections fausett 1994 introduced in the 1980s rnns were designed to process sequences rumelhart et al 1985 however they struggled to perform tasks where temporal dependencies between the input output sequences spanned long intervals and suffered from the vanishing gradient problem bengio et al 1994 lstms were introduced to address this problem hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the key idea of an lstm is a relatively new structure called a memory cell c t that can store information over an arbitrary time this cell contains a neuron with a self recurrent connection and three self parametrized controlling gates input output and forget these gates depending on their activations allow or prevent the flow of information into and out of c t for every new input the activation of the input gate i t allows the new information to be accumulated in the memory cell the forget gate f t controls whether the past cell status c t 1 is deleted or forgotten the output gate o t decides if the latest cell output will be propagated to the final state h t an lstm block is illustrated in fig 1 graves 2013 in this study we follow the lstm formulation proposed by graves 2013 1 i t σ w x i x t w h i h t 1 w c i c t 1 b i 2 f t σ w x f x t w h f h t 1 w c f c t 1 b f 3 c t

respectively the cell activation input feature and hidden output vectors are represented by c t x t and h t respectively the weight parameters are w x i w x f w x c w x o w h i w h f w h c and w h o the bias terms are b i b f b c and b o while w c i w c f and w c o are optional connection weights in addition σ is the logistic sigmoid function t a n h is the hyperbolic tangent function and is the hadamard product 2 2 maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt wavelet analysis is a mathematical model formalized by grossmann and morlet 1984 the goal behind wavelet transformation is to obtain a time scale representation of localized and transient phenomena taking place at different time scales wavelet analysis identifies frequency content of a signal and the associated temporal variations heil and walnut 1989 it can be performed using two types of wavelet transforms the continuous wavelet transform cwt and the discrete wavelet transform dwt the cwt is usually used for smooth continuous functions while dwt operates on scales with discrete numbers based on a dyadic arrangement despite the ability of cwt to locate specific events in a signal that may not be obvious its disadvantage remains the complicated construction of its inverse fugal 2009 which can be an obstacle since signal reconstructions are needed for signal forecasting applications fugal 2009 consequently the dwt is better suited for the transformation of discrete multi scale irrigation flow signals however the dwt still presents drawbacks including i restrictions on data sample size which must be a multiple of 2 j where j n is the wavelet decomposition level and ii the decimation effect that potentially forces loss of information in the model training process and a consequent induction of bias in the forecasts shensa 1992 maheswaran and khosa 2012b to address these issues a non orthogonal variant of the dwt the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt percival and walden 2000 was implemented the modwt can be applied to any sample size and is translation invariant as shifts in the signal do not influence the pattern of coefficients it allows an equal number of wavelets scaling coefficients and observations at every level of the transform consequently it is unlikely that the commencement point will influence the outcome of the decomposed data a modwt yields discrete wavelet coefficients applying high and low pass filters to the input time series given a dwt with wavelet h j l and scaling g j l filters length of filter l 1 l and j t h decomposition level the modwt wavelet h j l and scaling g j l filters can be defined as percival and walden 2000 6 h j l h j l 2 j 2 7 g j l g j l 2 j 2 the modwt wavelet coefficients and filters for a given time series x x t t 0 1 2 n 1 are then defined as percival and walden 2000 8 w j t l 0 l j 1 h j l x t l m o d n 9 v j t l 0 l j 1 g j l x t l m o d n with l j 2 j 1 l 1 1 more details on the modwt theory and algorithm can be found in earlier studies percival and walden 2000 zhu et al 2014 3 data collection and study area irrigation flow data were collected for palos de la frontera in the southwestern spanish province of huelva palos de la frontera is an irrigation district covering 3343 ha mainly covered by strawberry crops the district is supplied by a pressurized on demand irrigation network which consists of 513 pipes and 227 hydrants garcía et al 2016 the network is connected to a remote control system which provides volume data as well as flow and pressure in real time the irrigated surface area is divided into three sectors with each sector containing 5 vertical pumps allowing a maximum flow and minimum pressure in the outlets of 1584 l s and 8 5 atm for sector i 1056 l s and 4 5 atm for sector ii and 1372 l s and 5 5 atm for sector iii urrestarazu et al 2009 daily irrigation flow data from 1 january 2006 to 31 december 2013 were collected from the irrigation district of palos de la frontera and represented the total flow pumped to the three pumping stations of the irrigation area under study 4 model development 4 1 feature selection the first step in developing data driven forecasting models is the selection of appropriate input variables to feed the different models tiwari and chatterjee 2010a b pramanik et al 2011 since there is no direct method to select model inputs for forecasting applications deo et al 2017 this study adopted the statistical approach recommended by sudheer et al 2002 to select significant input variables the method consisted of examining autocorrelation functions acf and partial autocorrelation functions pacf to obtain prior knowledge of input variable dynamics which have been implemented in a range of hydrological studies maier and dandy 2000 maier et al 2014 yaseen et al 2015 in the present study the first step used acf and pacf functions to analyze patterns in the observed irrigation flow data and select the significant inputs from the irrigation flow lags for daily irrigation flow forecasting the acf and pacf functions were estimated for time lagged information from the flow q time series to assess the temporal dependencies between the irrigation flow for a current day q d and the irrigation flow values at a given point in the past i e a time lag q d 1 q d 2 etc these dependencies in the time series were analyzed for lags from q d 1 up to q d 12 fig a1 shows the acf and pacf along with a 95 confidence band the pacf in fig a1 reveals a significant correlation between the target and irrigation flow lags up to eight days before as they fall within the confidence band therefore the variables used as model inputs included q d q d 1 q d 2 q d 3 q d 6 q d 7 and q d 8 the next step was based on a trial and error approach where all different combinations of the pre selected lags without repetition were used as model inputs for all 5 different modelling techniques a total of 127 versions of each type of model were developed using 127 combinations of input variables from the preselected irrigation flow lags the combination of variables that led to the best performance for each machine learning technique was used as the optimal input variables for that model the available data were partitioned into training cross validation and testing sets for all models developed 10 of the dataset was used to test the models the models parameter check was performed using a cross validation dataset 10 to avoid over fitting the last step consisted of scaling the input variables the maximum and minimum of the training inputs were used to scale the training data between 0 and 1 the same information was likewise used to scale the validation and testing inputs by following this approach to data scaling the calibrated model parameters are not influenced by the validation and test set data which are kept for the purpose of model selection and assessing model generalization respectively hastie et al 2009 in the following subsections the abbreviation ml models will be used to refer to the machine learning models namely the ann lssvr elm and lstm models 4 2 mlr and ml model development the predictand of the mlr models was the observed irrigation flow at day q d 1 and the predictors were the significant lagged values of the irrigation flow time series as identified by the correlation analysis followed by a trial and error method the final combination of irrigation flow lags selected included the following input variables q d q d 1 and q d 2 in a manner similar to the mlr models the optimal combination of input variables for the ann models was selected by correlation analysis followed by a trial and error approach as a result the following irrigation flow lags were selected as the ann models inputs q d q d 2 and q d 7 the second most important design question when developing ann models is the identification of the optimal model structure i e determining the optimal number of neurons in each model layer in this case the input layer consisted of three neurons as there were three lags selected as inputs and the output layer consisted of one neuron since there was only one variable to be forecasted i e q d 1 for the hidden layer wanas et al 1998 empirically determined the optimal number of hidden nodes to be equal to l o g n where n is the number of training samples while mishra and desai 2006 found the optimal number of hidden neurons is equal to 2 n 1 where n is the number of input neurons in this study the network s architecture was varied by changing the number of hidden neurons starting from 3 i e l o g n and incrementing it by 1 up to 15 i e 2 n 1 the number of hidden neurons resulting in the lowest validation error was deemed the optimal ann structure the developed ann models were based on a feed forward multi layer perceptron ff mlp architecture and were trained using the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm the input variables q d and q d 1 were identified as the most significant input variables for the lssvr models as determined through the same correlation analysis trial and error procedure as the ann models in this case the numbers of input and output neurons were two and one respectively corresponding to the number of input lags i e q d and q d 1 and the number of forecasted variables i e irrigation flow for the next day q d 1 all lssvr models used the radial basis function rbf as a kernel function and were characterized by two parameters c and σ 2 the regularization parameter c determines the trade off between the training error minimization and smoothness and σ 2 denotes the squared bandwidth used for the gaussian rbf kernel suykens et al 2002 the values of the two parameters were selected through cross validation and corresponded to the combination of parameters leading to the lowest rmse and mae values see section 4 6 for the validation set all lssvr models were developed based on code in suykens et al 2002 the elm models were based on a three layer architecture the elm input layer had two neurons representing the input variables selected through correlation analysis followed by trial and error namely q d and q d 1 the output layer consisted of one neuron representing the forecasted irrigation flow for one day ahead lead time q d 1 as for the hidden layer there is no direct method to select the optimal number of hidden neurons and effective models are usually determined by varying the number of hidden neurons barzegar et al 2017 therefore a trial and error approach was adopted where a maximum number of 150 hidden neurons was tested starting from 5 and incrementing by 5 five different model activation functions were tested sigmoid sine hard limit triangular basis and the radial basis function the optimal elm architectures were identified as those that performed the best in the validation phase and are reported in table a2 all elm models were developed based on code from huang 2015 similarly the lstm models were based on a three layer architecture the number of neurons was equal to one for both the input and output layers the single input neuron represented the irrigation flow time series on the current day in fact since lstms implicitly use memory to forecast the irrigation flow on the next day there was no need to use time lags as input variables the neuron in the output layer represented the irrigation flow to be forecasted q d 1 in addition the number of hidden neurons was gradually increased from 2 to 100 by increments of 2 an optimal number of 40 hidden neurons was selected as it resulted in the lowest generalization error during validation a key hyperparameter characterizing lstms is the size of the look back window which denotes the number of previous time steps to use as input variables in order to predict the next time step in this case q d 1 in this study the size of the look back window the number of epochs and the number of batches were determined via a grid search and a size of 30 a number of 50 and a number of 20 were selected respectively the lstm models were developed using the tensorflow library in python 3 5 4 3 bootstrap model development once the mlr and ml models were developed the best models for each learning method were selected based on the highest accuracy values for the validation set the input combinations used in each of these best models were used to develop bootstrap and wavelet based mlr and ml models these input combinations were referred to as the original time series for bootstrap based models the original calibration set which is later split into training and validation sets was used to generate 100 bootstrap resamples by drawing samples with replacement from the initial calibration set each new input time series consisted of a calibration set and a testing set which was kept the exact same as the non bootstrap based models the calibration set represented 90 of the total time series and corresponded to a particular bootstrap resample which was further split into training and validation examples the testing set represented 10 of the total time series and consisted of those elements in the original time series that were not included in the bootstrap resamples i e the same test examples as the non bootstrap based models one hundred bootstrap input sets were generated this way for each learning method and were used to train validate and test 100 machine learning models the performance of these 100 models during the testing phase was then averaged and represented the performance of the bootstrap model the bootstrap models were developed in matlab r2017a for the mlr ann lssvr and elm models and in python 3 5 for the lstm models in order to generate the training sets for the bootstrap and wavelet bootstrap models the excel add in bootstrap xla was used barreto and howland 2005 4 4 modwt model development to develop the wavelet based models the modwt was used to avoid a limitation of certain wavelet transforms such as the cwt namely the future data problem using the modwt wavelet transform in the context of forecasting models allows one to use data only known in the present and past which is the case in a real world scenario during the calibration validation and testing of the forecasting models using the modwt avoids the future data issue and ensures only information from the past and present are used during wavelet decomposition quilty and adamowski 2018 since no single wavelet filter or decomposition level is universally optimal for water resources forecasting models maheswaran and khosa 2012b four different wavelet families were tested haar daubechies including db2 db3 db4 db5 and db6 coiflets coif1 and symlets sym3 in addition following the methodology used by tiwari et al 2013 and belayneh et al 2016 five levels of decomposition were tested to ensure that five was a reasonable maximum decomposition level it was necessary to identify which wavelet and scaling coefficients at the beginning of the time series record were affected by boundary conditions basta 2014 quilty and adamowski 2018 this was done by determining l j the number of wavelet coefficients affected by uncertainty bašta 2014 10 l j 2 j m a x 1 l 1 1 where j m a x is the decomposition level and l is the wavelet filter length following best practices outlined in quilty and adamowski 2018 the first lj wavelet and scaling coefficients are removed to address the boundary conditions to ensure that there are enough observations from which to calibrate a modwt based model it is important to select wavelet filter s and decomposition level s that respect l j n where n is the number of available data points if this is not the case then the wavelet filters are deemed too wide and or the decomposition levels too high relative to the size of the time series records and should be changed in the case of the wavelet filters used in this study we set the largest wavelet filter length at 6 i e haar coif1 sym3 db2 db3 db4 db5 and db6 as used by quilty and adamowski 2018 while the maximum decomposition level was 5 and thereby identified 156 coefficients affected by boundary conditions i e l j 2 5 1 6 1 1 156 since l j n n 2753 the above mentioned wavelet filters and the maximum decomposition level of 5 were considered reasonable and adopted accordingly consequently the first 156 wavelet and scaling coefficients were removed from the beginning of the wavelet and scaling coefficient sub series in the present study a direct approach was followed where the obtained modwt wavelet and scaling coefficient sub series were used as inputs for the data driven models to forecast the original flow signal to achieve consistency among all mlr ann lssvr elm and lstm models developed the same number of training examples i e l j was deleted from the beginning of each input time series the optimal input combinations identified when developing the mlr and ml models were decomposed using wavelet transforms into wavelet coefficients and scaling coefficients representing high and low frequency information respectively each one of the resulting sub series corresponding to the optimal wavelet filter and decomposition level played a role in describing the original irrigation flow time series thus these sub series wavelet and scaling coefficients were used together to develop the wavelet based mlr and ml models respectively 4 5 coupled wavelet bootstrap model development the last step consisted of developing coupled wavelet bootstrap models in this case the bootstrap technique was applied to the input sub series obtained from the wavelet decomposition the methodology followed was similar to that used for the development of the bootstrap models in other words the wavelet bootstrap models consisted of ensembles of 100 bootstrap resamples of wavelet sub time series instead of the original time series model training cross validation and testing were completed in a similar way to the bootstrap models 4 6 performance measures to compare the relative performance of the developed models the following statistical indicators were used root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 mean relative error mre mean absolute relative error mare willmott s index wi as well as the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nash these indices are defined as follows 11 r m s e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 12 m a e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 13 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 14 m r e 1 n i 1 n p i o i o i 15 m a r e 1 n i 1

mean of the observed irrigation flow and n is the size of the dataset rmse measures the variance of errors independently of sample size and indicates the discrepancy between observed and forecasted values rmse is always greater than or equal to 0 with 0 occurring when the model fits the data perfectly mae is the average of the absolute errors and indicates how close forecasted values are to observed values the value of r 2 reflects the degree of linear association between observations and forecasts values for r 2 range from 0 to 1 with 1 showing perfect forecasting skill assuming the slope and ordinate intercept to be 1 and 0 respectively the value of w i measures the degree to which the observed variable is accurately estimated by the simulated variable values for w i range from 0 to 1 where a value of 1 shows perfect agreement between predictions and observations willmott 1981 5 results and discussion the performance of the best mlr ann lssvr elm and lstm models along with their bootstrap wavelet and wavelet bootstrap counterparts is presented in table 1 additional accuracy metrics are shown in table a3 and include the mean relative error mre the mean absolute relative error mare willmott s index and nash sutcliffe efficiency index nash the inputs and parameters characterizing the best mlr and ml models used to develop their bootstrap wavelet and wavelet bootstrap counterparts are shown in tables a1 and a2 fig 2 shows the absolute values of the prediction errors for the five modelling techniques tested all data driven models were effective at forecasting irrigation flow at day d 1 as measured by the four performance metrics table 1 fig 2 the best performing models were the lstm ann and elm models showed varying accuracies depending on the data augmentation and transformation techniques employed when the coupled wavelet bootstrap technique was used the overall best testing phase performance was obtained by the ann model r 2 0 9432 on the other hand the lssvr model and its variants i e bootstrap wavelet and wavelet bootstrap resulted in less accurate irrigation flow forecasts compared to the remaining machine learning models this could be due to the lssvr models hyper parameter sensitivity yu et al 2017 interestingly although the r2 value for the lstm model is higher than that of the mlr model using the mre and mare as error metrics leads to a contradictory conclusion the results in table a3 show lower mre and mare errors achieved by the mlr model in comparison with the lstm model this result might be explained by the fact that metrics based on relative errors put a heavier penalty on negative errors than on positive errors as a result accuracy metrics such as mre and mare are biased in selecting models predicting lower values than the observations makridakis 1993 the high mre and mare values obtained by the lstm might be an indication that the lstm forecasts are lower than observations while the mlr forecasts are higher than observations on the other hand comparing lstm to mlr and the remaining ml models using nash as an accuracy metric shows comparative performances while comparing lstm using rmse mae r2 and wi shows that regular lstms and w lstms significantly outperform their counterparts models these findings suggest that using lstms and w lstms can provide more accurate forecasts compared to mlr and competing ml models when the goal is to minimize any one of the following metrics rmse mae r2 or wi boxplots of observations and forecasts for each of the best models fig 3 allowed for a comparison of the statistical distributions of the observed and forecasted irrigation flow values aided in quantifying the degree of overall spread in each time series and assessed the level of agreement between the data examples pairs of observed and forecasted values except for the mlr models the distribution generated by the different forecasting models closely matched that of the observed irrigation flow values this was especially true for wavelet based models in all cases the median was almost at the same level as that of the observation time series the lower flow values were more accurately simulated than the higher flow values as the bottom lines for the forecast boxplots resembled the bottom line of the observations boxplot the higher flow values seemed to be slightly underestimated overall the machine learning models performed better when the wavelet transformation technique was used this indicated that the wavelet analysis extracted useful time frequency information from the input time series that was not captured in the non wavelet based models tiwari and adamowski 2014 the trends and multi scale components of the irrigation flow time series are likely to represent the sum of the sub eprocesses associated with the original time series data these components are extracted through wavelet decomposition facilitating the ability of the wavelet coupled models to extract non linear and complex patterns in the data more easily fitting these components to the target data leading to a better performance compared to mlr models developed using raw data sets in general the haar wavelet provided better performance than the other mother wavelets that wer tested see table a2 apart from the lstm all model performances were improved over the regular models when bootstrapping was implemented using the bootstrap the parameter uncertainty associated with the different irrigation flow forecasting models was quantified and assessed through ensemble forecasts reducing the forecast error compared to the non bootstrap based models the wb nn models provided the most accurate results as exhibited by rmse and r 2 metrics see table 1 training 100 w nn models gave an idea of the ensemble model s parameter uncertainty and indicated how the model was expected to generalize on unseen data consequently the wavelet bootstrap models were more robust and stable than the individual regular models given different data patterns in fact as highlighted in tiwari et al 2013 the ensemble of w nn models may represent different processes associated with the irrigation flow signals at different time scales while b nn models provide an average over the errors which results in more accurate forecasts when wavelets and the bootstrap are combined with ann the wb nn models which leverage the ability of wavelet analysis and bootstrap resampling to capture time frequency information and reduce forecast error respectively led to the highest accuracy when compared to the wavelet bootstrap based lstm lssvr and elm models the proposed wavelet bootstrap models addressed two issues common to irrigation flow forecasting accuracy and uncertainty this advantage came at the price of generating bootstrap resamples and training bootstrap ensemble models which is computationally expensive for lengthy datasets tiwari and adamowski 2014 the bootstrap based lstm models did not perform as well as the remaining b mlr and wb mlr models the lstm exception could be explained by the fact that lstms are sequential models which rely on information from i e previous time steps to forecast the next time step when bootstrapping is employed the training resamples are drawn with replacement in a random manner which destroys the past sequence and causes the lstm performance to drop methods such as the moving block bootstrap lahiri 1993 preserve to a certain extent time correlations and might be useful to study with the lstm in the future however for the regular and wavelet based models and based on all performance metrics employed the lstm models performed better than the ann elm lssvr and mlr models the ability of lstm models to learn temporal dependencies in sequential datasets enables a memory mechanism where the network looks a few steps back in this case 30 days back as shown in table a2 and uses information about past calculations to inform the decision of whether or not this information should be passed along to the next iteration this characteristic explained the better performance of lstms compared to classical neural networks where the inputs are assumed to be independent of each other mouatadid et al 2017 the elm models despite achieving the second best performance presented computational advantages in comparison to the remaining benchmarking models the relative accuracy and the fast learning times of the elm models makes them an attractive modelling option when designing decision making and real time forecasting applications such as flood warning systems the reason behind the elm s fast computational time is that the input weights and biases are randomized and the output weights have a unique minimum norm least squares solution solved by the moore penrose generalized inverse function huang et al 2006 as opposed to anns where the weights and biases are tuned through the iterative back propagation process as a result elm models do not require parameter tuning which saves time during the models training phase additionally it is interesting to note the poor performance of the lssvr models compared to the remaining machine learning based models considering that lssvr models are also characterized by very slow training times due to the additional constraint of identifying the most accurate set of hyper parameters we do not recommend the use of lssvr models for forecasting applications involving large data set sizes especially in applications where computational efficiency is an important pre requisite this conclusion added to the results of deo et al 2017 where the longer run time requirement of lssvr was discussed finally the least accurate benchmarking model was the mlr as its linear structure struggled to capture the non linear relationships that characterized the data overall the results from this study confirmed that the lstm elm and ann models could be effectively applied to the forecasting of irrigation flow signals depending on whether the emphasis is placed on high accuracy or on slightly less accurate flow forecasts but fast computations the lstm based or the wb elm models could be used respectively these results were obtained despite the limited set of inputs used i e irrigation flow lags only compared to previous studies rasouli et al 2012 rezaeianzadeh et al 2014 which considered a large set of input variables e g discharge precipitation temperature relative humidity etc for streamflow forecasting with no automated variable selection or input pre processing this study was based on using only the irrigation flow signals at a given day d and at lagged periods as inputs to the forecasting models this was made possible by a careful acf and pacf analysis which allowed for the selection of appropriate input combinations of the irrigation flow signal with zero lag and with lags of 1 2 and 7 days table a1 to develop robust data driven models this study s results reflect the skill of machine learning models for daily irrigation forecasts however for many water resources decisions long term forecasting i e season and year ahead forecasts is more pertinent vogel 2000 long term forecasting covers time horizons from six months to ten years this type of forecasting is useful for developing robust planning strategies such as capacity expansion capital investment and revenue analysis al saba and el amin 1999 however due to the inherent uncertainties of the future long term forecasting is considered a very challenging task and most of the literature about seasonal forecasts focuses on 1 2 or 3 season ahead forecasts based on seasonal means in the future we plan to explore the topic of long term water resources forecasting several studies have looked at seasonal forecasts by aggregating daily data into seasonal estimates and forecasting these estimates one step where the step equals one month one season or one year ahead for example the ability of ann for long term forecasting was explored for annual runoff time series forecasting wang et al 2015 annual peak load forecasting al saba and el amin 1999 monthly and seasonal solar radiation deo and sahin 2017 and seasonal rainfall forecasting babel et al 2017 similarly several studies explored the use of svr models for medium and long term forecasting tasks such as forecasting the annual spi drought index belayneh et al 2014 forecasting the improved spei drought index for 3 and 12 month lead times mouatadid et al 2018 and forecasting monthly seasonal and annual runoff volumes liang et al 2018 with promising results elm models were compared to ann models for forecasting monthly groundwater fluctuations and were found to outperform anns at modelling long term fluctuations alizamir et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 explored the use of the recurrent neural network and lstm in modelling monthly runoff data and found it to outperform lssvm models in all these studies the forecasting horizon was 1 2 or 3 steps ahead another interesting area of research would be to forecast multi steps into the future as is the case for sub seasonal forecasts with three week horizons webb et al 2017 without aggregating data into monthly seasonal or annual means and losing useful information this is a challenge that has just started to garner attention in the deep learning community performance of the state of the art lstm model decays as the forecasting horizon extends beyond a few steps ahead addressing this problem by making the lstm network deeper comes with a high computational cost as an alternative one recent study leveraged ideas from the dynamic belief network literature and proposed an improved lstm architecture that incorporates expectation bias ismail et al 2018 in the future we plan to explore different lstm architectures for forecasting a wide variety of water resources that require forecasts for a large number of time steps beyond the observed records 6 conclusions irrigation flow forecasting can be effectively used for the sustainable planning and management of water resources in particular these applications include the sustainable management of agriculture and irrigation operations the optimization of water resources allocations pricing and water quality assessment as well as the analysis of water conservation strategies and drought conditions yet the task of forecasting irrigation flow is a challenging one as it involves complex non linear dynamics between multi scale features that are further subject to uncertainty the framework proposed in this study used the coupling of an lstm model and a wavelet decomposition technique to accurately forecast daily irrigation flow this study addressed this question by exploring the forecasting skill of lstms compared to ann lssvr and elm models this study used the ability of wavelet transformations to capture time frequency information to improve the accuracy of the developed models the results of the study showed that the wavelet coupled models whether based on lstm ann lssvr or elm algorithms led to a higher accuracy compared to their regular counterparts in particular the w lstm and wb ann models led to the most accurate forecasts for most cases the bootstrap resampling technique further improved the accuracy of the developed models the proposed wavelet lstm methodology for irrigation flow forecasting has been shown to provide better performance than standalone lstm as well as benchmark methods such as mlr lssvr elm and ann along with their wavelet bootstrap based counterparts for the study site in huelva spain therefore lstm networks and wavelet lstm networks in particular are promising new methods that deserve further exploration in the field of water resources forecasting acknowledgments we would like to acknowledge and thank inmaculada pulido calvo who provided the high quality irrigation flow dataset

11035,many countries are suffering from water resource constraints due to rising demands from different water consuming sectors and a changing climate in some countries such as spain operators of agricultural irrigation are under increasing pressure to improve efficiency accordingly accurate forecasts of water demand are a pre requisite for the successful implementation of water resources planning and management tools in irrigated areas however forecasting approaches based on traditional neural networks have challenges to capture temporal dependencies that generally characterize irrigation flow time series in this study for the first time a recurrent long short term memory network lstm was coupled with the maximum overlap discrete wavelet transformation modwt and bootstrap techniques for accurate and robust irrigation flow forecasting for comparative purposes the study also explored the ability of an artificial neural network ann a least squares support vector regression lssvr an extreme learning machine elm and a multi linear regression mlr to forecast irrigation flow in palos de la frontera an irrigation district located in huelva southern spain for a one day lead time the autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function determined the most significant lagged time series of irrigation flow to be used as model inputs the wavelet lstm w lstm and waveletbootstrap ann models wb ann had the most accurate forecasts as measured by statistical metrics including the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 mean relative error mre mean absolute relative error mare willmott s index and nash sutcliffe efficiency index nash in this study the capabilities of lstms along with the modwt transform analysis and bootstrap techniques were benchmarked and could be further explored for forecasting other water resources variables in different climatic regions and for multi step lead time forecasting keywords time series analysis long short term network forecasting irrigation flow machine learning 1 introduction population growth increasing water scarcity and a changing climate have increased pressure to improve water use efficiency as the world s largest user of water the irrigated agriculture sector accounts for 69 of consumptive water use schlosser et al 2014 accordingly information regarding water demand in irrigated areas is a basic prerequisite for the development and implementation of successful water resources management tools onu 1997 sumpsi et al 1998 this has become a critical issue in countries such as spain where the water demand for irrigated agriculture is steadily growing and water resources are limited rodriguez díaz et al 2007 in this context spain has modernized its hydraulic infrastructures and switched from old open channel distribution networks to pressurized distribution networks these new systems allow for the use of more efficient on farm sprinklers and drip systems and provide on demand water to farmers plusquellec 2009 the quality of these distribution network services however depends on management related factors and infrastructure related factors urrestarazu 2007 accurately forecasting irrigation water requirements is also one of the main tools required for the design management and modernization of water supply and distribution systems in irrigation districts pulido calvo et al 2003 tiwari and adamowski 2017 irrigation flow forecasting systems can be developed based on daily weekly or monthly lead times a number of studies have shown that effective water resources management systems require daily time scale water flow forecasts kişi 2010 londhe and gavraskar 2015 pandey and srinivas 2015 in particular daily lead time stream flow forecasts are a prerequisite for the effective management of water resources at hydraulic structures in river basins and for the development of early warning systems guven 2009 pandey and srinivas 2015 yaseen et al 2016 such early warning systems provide data useful in different research areas from water quality assessment to water pricing and water allocation strategy development yaseen et al 2016 most irrigation water distribution systems involve storage operations based on a daily cycle as demands vary over the day and energy prices change as a function of the time of day pulido calvo et al 2003 therefore this study focused on daily irrigation flow forecasting methodologies for water resources modelling and forecasting include conceptual physical models modelling and system theoretical modelling data driven models conceptual models are usually based on continuous measurements of relevant soil characteristics and include empirical or functional models doorenbos and kassam 1979 allen et al 1998 as well as mechanistic models van aelst et al 1988 in contrast system theoretical models do not examine the internal structure of the physical processes in detail but instead use discrete data to learn accurate input output mapping in identifying a direct mapping between commonly available input variables e g temperature or precipitation and relevant output variables e g flow rate volume these models are often considered better suited for operational forecasting applications compared to conceptual physics based models pulido calvo et al 2007 the development of such approaches was discussed in a review of the water demand forecasting literature from 2000 to 2010 donkor et al 2012 however despite the field s progress over the last several decades there remains a mismatch between the water requirements calculated for irrigation planning and the actual irrigation demand in the field pulido calvo et al 2007 this discrepancy is attributable to changing weather conditions or farmer s behavior influencing the actual amounts of water used urrestarazu 2007 in fact actual water management in some irrigation districts is guided by practical experience and intuition of the administrator which can be imprecise pulido calvo et al 2007 accordingly there remains a need to improve the accuracy of forecasts of daily water requirements for crop irrigation water demand modelling over the last several decades can be classified into parametric and nonparametric approaches parametric models include various time series models such as the widely applied autoregressive integrated moving average arima model common non parametric methods or soft computing techniques include artificial neural networks anns and their variants pulido calvo et al 2007 ghiassi et al 2008 jain et al 2001 adamowski et al 2012 mouatadid et al 2015 gagliardi et al 2017 as well as other approaches such as least squares support vector regression lssvr msiza et al 2008 herrera et al 2010 in addition the extreme learning approach elm has gained popularity in time series forecasting because it requires significantly less computational time than traditional ann models these computational gains are achieved by randomly assigning the input weights and hidden layer biases while training the model huang et al 2006 moreover the elm modeling technique satisfies the universal approximation condition and typically provides good generalization performance huang et al 2006 and is therefore a suitable machine learning approach for water resources variable forecasting mouatadid and adamowski 2016 yadav et al 2018 tiwari and kumar 2018 more recently long short term memory lstm networks a special case of recurrent neural networks rnn has started to gain momentum in the deep learning literature goodfellow et al 2016 lstms were proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 to address the vanishing gradient issue of conventional rnns compared to classical neural networks lstms model temporal sequences and their long range dependencies with greater accuracy in real life applications they have shown a greater ability to learn long range dependencies compared to standard rnns and traditional anns lipton et al 2015 davidson et al 2007 demonstrated that a single layer lstm can identify lapses in attention based on electroencephalogram spectral data better than a tapped delay line multilayer perceptron mlp in a survey of deep learning applications in agriculture kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018 discussed the dynamic temporal learning behavior of lstms and their performance when applied to various tasks from winter vegetation mapping minh et al 2017 to crop type classification rußwurm and körner 2017 a more recent study applied lstms to predict sewer overflow water levels and found them to outperform multilayer perceptrons wavelet neural networks and gated recurrent unit models zhang et al 2018a lstms are only beginning to be explored for hydrological and water resources modelling fang et al 2017 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 they have not previously been explored as irrigation flow forecasting models nor have they been benchmarked against other prevalent models e g ann lssvr elm etc in the hydrological modelling literature this study addresses this research gap by exploring the forecasting skill of lstms compared to ann lssvr and elm models models such as ann lssvr and elm have been extensively applied in the context of hydrological forecasting studies deka 2014 nayak et al 2013 in aksoy et al 2007 it was argued that the lack of input pre processing during the development of machine learning based hydrological models prevented these models from accounting for the physics of hydrological processes since flow dynamics are characterized by non linearity trends and seasonal variations caused by underlying physical processes tiwari and chatterjee 2010a tiwari et al 2013 the present study exploits the ability of wavelet transformations as input pre processors to capture frequency and location in time information to improve the accuracy of the developed models in the hydrology literature to the best knowledge of the authors w lstm bootstrap lstm b lstm or wavelet bootstrap lstm wb lstm hybrid models have not been explored as a tool to forecast time series therefore all these models are proposed and their performances are benchmarked for irrigation water demand forecasting in this study seasonal variations and trends significantly affect the modeling of time series data and generally lead to poor predictive ability virili and freisleben 2000 wavelet transformations provide an analysis of time series data in both time and frequency domains and yield a time frequency representation of the signal under study wavelet analysis uses a mother wavelet function to decompose time series data into multiple scale specific time series filtering and separating otherwise noisy signals nalley et al 2013 in addition wavelet analysis provides significant information about the physical structure of the time series data daubechies 1990 discrete wavelet transforms dwts are characterized by simpler computation and development compared to continuous wavelet transforms cwts the popularity of dwt in water resources research has grown in recent years with studies investigating regional drought forecasting belayneh et al 2014 rainfall runoff forecasting anctil and tape 2004 nourani et al 2009 monthly and daily streamflow forecasting kişi 2009 maheswaran and khosa 2012a tiwari et al 2013 monthly groundwater level forecasting moosavi et al 2013 short term urban water demand forecasting tiwari et al 2013 reservoir inflow forecasting kumar et al 2015 and medium term water demand forecasting tiwari and adamowski 2017 among other applications however further development of wavelet based soft computing techniques is required to improve the model performance in terms of accuracy and reliability in water demand forecasting applications hybrid methods proposed in the water resources forecasting literature are the bootstrap based neural networks b nn tiwari and chatterjee 2010a b fuzzy neural networks alvisi and franchini 2011 and grey neural networks alvisi and franchini 2012 besides reducing uncertainty in the variance by mimicking randomness efron and tibshirani 1993 b nns were found to be simpler and easier to use in addressing uncertainty in an operational setting compared to bayesian approaches isukapalli and georgopoulos 2001 several studies showed b nn models to outperform conventional neural networks abrahart 2003 tiwari and chatterjee 2010a b tiwari and adamowski 2017 wavelet based neural networks w nn and b nn hybrid approaches can be combined to form a wavelet bootstrap nn wb nn model with the potential ability to achieve greater accuracy and reliability in water demand forecasting tiwari and adamowski 2017 the present study explores for the first time the use of lstm and wavelet bootstrap lstm models for irrigation flow forecasting and compares their accuracies to that of other data driven models mlr ann lssvr and elm along with their counterparts developed using bootstrap analysis and wavelet transformation the developed models were used to forecast daily irrigation flow in palos de la frontera an irrigation district located in huelva southern spain for a one day ahead lead time as a tool to improve water distribution management in irrigation districts 2 theoretical framework in this section we provide a brief overview of the theory useful in the development of the lstm model developed in this study and also describe the wavelet theory used to develop the hybrid counterpart models the remaining methods are well described in the literature mlr glantz and slinker 2001 ann bishop 1994 lssvr suykens and vandewalle 1999 and elm huang et al 2006 the bootstrap resampling technique is explained in efron and tibshirani 1993 2 1 long short term memory networks recurrent neural networks rnns are neural networks with closed loop connections fausett 1994 introduced in the 1980s rnns were designed to process sequences rumelhart et al 1985 however they struggled to perform tasks where temporal dependencies between the input output sequences spanned long intervals and suffered from the vanishing gradient problem bengio et al 1994 lstms were introduced to address this problem hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the key idea of an lstm is a relatively new structure called a memory cell c t that can store information over an arbitrary time this cell contains a neuron with a self recurrent connection and three self parametrized controlling gates input output and forget these gates depending on their activations allow or prevent the flow of information into and out of c t for every new input the activation of the input gate i t allows the new information to be accumulated in the memory cell the forget gate f t controls whether the past cell status c t 1 is deleted or forgotten the output gate o t decides if the latest cell output will be propagated to the final state h t an lstm block is illustrated in fig 1 graves 2013 in this study we follow the lstm formulation proposed by graves 2013 1 i t σ w x i x t w h i h t 1 w c i c t 1 b i 2 f t σ w x f x t w h f h t 1 w c f c t 1 b f 3 c t

respectively the cell activation input feature and hidden output vectors are represented by c t x t and h t respectively the weight parameters are w x i w x f w x c w x o w h i w h f w h c and w h o the bias terms are b i b f b c and b o while w c i w c f and w c o are optional connection weights in addition σ is the logistic sigmoid function t a n h is the hyperbolic tangent function and is the hadamard product 2 2 maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt wavelet analysis is a mathematical model formalized by grossmann and morlet 1984 the goal behind wavelet transformation is to obtain a time scale representation of localized and transient phenomena taking place at different time scales wavelet analysis identifies frequency content of a signal and the associated temporal variations heil and walnut 1989 it can be performed using two types of wavelet transforms the continuous wavelet transform cwt and the discrete wavelet transform dwt the cwt is usually used for smooth continuous functions while dwt operates on scales with discrete numbers based on a dyadic arrangement despite the ability of cwt to locate specific events in a signal that may not be obvious its disadvantage remains the complicated construction of its inverse fugal 2009 which can be an obstacle since signal reconstructions are needed for signal forecasting applications fugal 2009 consequently the dwt is better suited for the transformation of discrete multi scale irrigation flow signals however the dwt still presents drawbacks including i restrictions on data sample size which must be a multiple of 2 j where j n is the wavelet decomposition level and ii the decimation effect that potentially forces loss of information in the model training process and a consequent induction of bias in the forecasts shensa 1992 maheswaran and khosa 2012b to address these issues a non orthogonal variant of the dwt the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt percival and walden 2000 was implemented the modwt can be applied to any sample size and is translation invariant as shifts in the signal do not influence the pattern of coefficients it allows an equal number of wavelets scaling coefficients and observations at every level of the transform consequently it is unlikely that the commencement point will influence the outcome of the decomposed data a modwt yields discrete wavelet coefficients applying high and low pass filters to the input time series given a dwt with wavelet h j l and scaling g j l filters length of filter l 1 l and j t h decomposition level the modwt wavelet h j l and scaling g j l filters can be defined as percival and walden 2000 6 h j l h j l 2 j 2 7 g j l g j l 2 j 2 the modwt wavelet coefficients and filters for a given time series x x t t 0 1 2 n 1 are then defined as percival and walden 2000 8 w j t l 0 l j 1 h j l x t l m o d n 9 v j t l 0 l j 1 g j l x t l m o d n with l j 2 j 1 l 1 1 more details on the modwt theory and algorithm can be found in earlier studies percival and walden 2000 zhu et al 2014 3 data collection and study area irrigation flow data were collected for palos de la frontera in the southwestern spanish province of huelva palos de la frontera is an irrigation district covering 3343 ha mainly covered by strawberry crops the district is supplied by a pressurized on demand irrigation network which consists of 513 pipes and 227 hydrants garcía et al 2016 the network is connected to a remote control system which provides volume data as well as flow and pressure in real time the irrigated surface area is divided into three sectors with each sector containing 5 vertical pumps allowing a maximum flow and minimum pressure in the outlets of 1584 l s and 8 5 atm for sector i 1056 l s and 4 5 atm for sector ii and 1372 l s and 5 5 atm for sector iii urrestarazu et al 2009 daily irrigation flow data from 1 january 2006 to 31 december 2013 were collected from the irrigation district of palos de la frontera and represented the total flow pumped to the three pumping stations of the irrigation area under study 4 model development 4 1 feature selection the first step in developing data driven forecasting models is the selection of appropriate input variables to feed the different models tiwari and chatterjee 2010a b pramanik et al 2011 since there is no direct method to select model inputs for forecasting applications deo et al 2017 this study adopted the statistical approach recommended by sudheer et al 2002 to select significant input variables the method consisted of examining autocorrelation functions acf and partial autocorrelation functions pacf to obtain prior knowledge of input variable dynamics which have been implemented in a range of hydrological studies maier and dandy 2000 maier et al 2014 yaseen et al 2015 in the present study the first step used acf and pacf functions to analyze patterns in the observed irrigation flow data and select the significant inputs from the irrigation flow lags for daily irrigation flow forecasting the acf and pacf functions were estimated for time lagged information from the flow q time series to assess the temporal dependencies between the irrigation flow for a current day q d and the irrigation flow values at a given point in the past i e a time lag q d 1 q d 2 etc these dependencies in the time series were analyzed for lags from q d 1 up to q d 12 fig a1 shows the acf and pacf along with a 95 confidence band the pacf in fig a1 reveals a significant correlation between the target and irrigation flow lags up to eight days before as they fall within the confidence band therefore the variables used as model inputs included q d q d 1 q d 2 q d 3 q d 6 q d 7 and q d 8 the next step was based on a trial and error approach where all different combinations of the pre selected lags without repetition were used as model inputs for all 5 different modelling techniques a total of 127 versions of each type of model were developed using 127 combinations of input variables from the preselected irrigation flow lags the combination of variables that led to the best performance for each machine learning technique was used as the optimal input variables for that model the available data were partitioned into training cross validation and testing sets for all models developed 10 of the dataset was used to test the models the models parameter check was performed using a cross validation dataset 10 to avoid over fitting the last step consisted of scaling the input variables the maximum and minimum of the training inputs were used to scale the training data between 0 and 1 the same information was likewise used to scale the validation and testing inputs by following this approach to data scaling the calibrated model parameters are not influenced by the validation and test set data which are kept for the purpose of model selection and assessing model generalization respectively hastie et al 2009 in the following subsections the abbreviation ml models will be used to refer to the machine learning models namely the ann lssvr elm and lstm models 4 2 mlr and ml model development the predictand of the mlr models was the observed irrigation flow at day q d 1 and the predictors were the significant lagged values of the irrigation flow time series as identified by the correlation analysis followed by a trial and error method the final combination of irrigation flow lags selected included the following input variables q d q d 1 and q d 2 in a manner similar to the mlr models the optimal combination of input variables for the ann models was selected by correlation analysis followed by a trial and error approach as a result the following irrigation flow lags were selected as the ann models inputs q d q d 2 and q d 7 the second most important design question when developing ann models is the identification of the optimal model structure i e determining the optimal number of neurons in each model layer in this case the input layer consisted of three neurons as there were three lags selected as inputs and the output layer consisted of one neuron since there was only one variable to be forecasted i e q d 1 for the hidden layer wanas et al 1998 empirically determined the optimal number of hidden nodes to be equal to l o g n where n is the number of training samples while mishra and desai 2006 found the optimal number of hidden neurons is equal to 2 n 1 where n is the number of input neurons in this study the network s architecture was varied by changing the number of hidden neurons starting from 3 i e l o g n and incrementing it by 1 up to 15 i e 2 n 1 the number of hidden neurons resulting in the lowest validation error was deemed the optimal ann structure the developed ann models were based on a feed forward multi layer perceptron ff mlp architecture and were trained using the levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm the input variables q d and q d 1 were identified as the most significant input variables for the lssvr models as determined through the same correlation analysis trial and error procedure as the ann models in this case the numbers of input and output neurons were two and one respectively corresponding to the number of input lags i e q d and q d 1 and the number of forecasted variables i e irrigation flow for the next day q d 1 all lssvr models used the radial basis function rbf as a kernel function and were characterized by two parameters c and σ 2 the regularization parameter c determines the trade off between the training error minimization and smoothness and σ 2 denotes the squared bandwidth used for the gaussian rbf kernel suykens et al 2002 the values of the two parameters were selected through cross validation and corresponded to the combination of parameters leading to the lowest rmse and mae values see section 4 6 for the validation set all lssvr models were developed based on code in suykens et al 2002 the elm models were based on a three layer architecture the elm input layer had two neurons representing the input variables selected through correlation analysis followed by trial and error namely q d and q d 1 the output layer consisted of one neuron representing the forecasted irrigation flow for one day ahead lead time q d 1 as for the hidden layer there is no direct method to select the optimal number of hidden neurons and effective models are usually determined by varying the number of hidden neurons barzegar et al 2017 therefore a trial and error approach was adopted where a maximum number of 150 hidden neurons was tested starting from 5 and incrementing by 5 five different model activation functions were tested sigmoid sine hard limit triangular basis and the radial basis function the optimal elm architectures were identified as those that performed the best in the validation phase and are reported in table a2 all elm models were developed based on code from huang 2015 similarly the lstm models were based on a three layer architecture the number of neurons was equal to one for both the input and output layers the single input neuron represented the irrigation flow time series on the current day in fact since lstms implicitly use memory to forecast the irrigation flow on the next day there was no need to use time lags as input variables the neuron in the output layer represented the irrigation flow to be forecasted q d 1 in addition the number of hidden neurons was gradually increased from 2 to 100 by increments of 2 an optimal number of 40 hidden neurons was selected as it resulted in the lowest generalization error during validation a key hyperparameter characterizing lstms is the size of the look back window which denotes the number of previous time steps to use as input variables in order to predict the next time step in this case q d 1 in this study the size of the look back window the number of epochs and the number of batches were determined via a grid search and a size of 30 a number of 50 and a number of 20 were selected respectively the lstm models were developed using the tensorflow library in python 3 5 4 3 bootstrap model development once the mlr and ml models were developed the best models for each learning method were selected based on the highest accuracy values for the validation set the input combinations used in each of these best models were used to develop bootstrap and wavelet based mlr and ml models these input combinations were referred to as the original time series for bootstrap based models the original calibration set which is later split into training and validation sets was used to generate 100 bootstrap resamples by drawing samples with replacement from the initial calibration set each new input time series consisted of a calibration set and a testing set which was kept the exact same as the non bootstrap based models the calibration set represented 90 of the total time series and corresponded to a particular bootstrap resample which was further split into training and validation examples the testing set represented 10 of the total time series and consisted of those elements in the original time series that were not included in the bootstrap resamples i e the same test examples as the non bootstrap based models one hundred bootstrap input sets were generated this way for each learning method and were used to train validate and test 100 machine learning models the performance of these 100 models during the testing phase was then averaged and represented the performance of the bootstrap model the bootstrap models were developed in matlab r2017a for the mlr ann lssvr and elm models and in python 3 5 for the lstm models in order to generate the training sets for the bootstrap and wavelet bootstrap models the excel add in bootstrap xla was used barreto and howland 2005 4 4 modwt model development to develop the wavelet based models the modwt was used to avoid a limitation of certain wavelet transforms such as the cwt namely the future data problem using the modwt wavelet transform in the context of forecasting models allows one to use data only known in the present and past which is the case in a real world scenario during the calibration validation and testing of the forecasting models using the modwt avoids the future data issue and ensures only information from the past and present are used during wavelet decomposition quilty and adamowski 2018 since no single wavelet filter or decomposition level is universally optimal for water resources forecasting models maheswaran and khosa 2012b four different wavelet families were tested haar daubechies including db2 db3 db4 db5 and db6 coiflets coif1 and symlets sym3 in addition following the methodology used by tiwari et al 2013 and belayneh et al 2016 five levels of decomposition were tested to ensure that five was a reasonable maximum decomposition level it was necessary to identify which wavelet and scaling coefficients at the beginning of the time series record were affected by boundary conditions basta 2014 quilty and adamowski 2018 this was done by determining l j the number of wavelet coefficients affected by uncertainty bašta 2014 10 l j 2 j m a x 1 l 1 1 where j m a x is the decomposition level and l is the wavelet filter length following best practices outlined in quilty and adamowski 2018 the first lj wavelet and scaling coefficients are removed to address the boundary conditions to ensure that there are enough observations from which to calibrate a modwt based model it is important to select wavelet filter s and decomposition level s that respect l j n where n is the number of available data points if this is not the case then the wavelet filters are deemed too wide and or the decomposition levels too high relative to the size of the time series records and should be changed in the case of the wavelet filters used in this study we set the largest wavelet filter length at 6 i e haar coif1 sym3 db2 db3 db4 db5 and db6 as used by quilty and adamowski 2018 while the maximum decomposition level was 5 and thereby identified 156 coefficients affected by boundary conditions i e l j 2 5 1 6 1 1 156 since l j n n 2753 the above mentioned wavelet filters and the maximum decomposition level of 5 were considered reasonable and adopted accordingly consequently the first 156 wavelet and scaling coefficients were removed from the beginning of the wavelet and scaling coefficient sub series in the present study a direct approach was followed where the obtained modwt wavelet and scaling coefficient sub series were used as inputs for the data driven models to forecast the original flow signal to achieve consistency among all mlr ann lssvr elm and lstm models developed the same number of training examples i e l j was deleted from the beginning of each input time series the optimal input combinations identified when developing the mlr and ml models were decomposed using wavelet transforms into wavelet coefficients and scaling coefficients representing high and low frequency information respectively each one of the resulting sub series corresponding to the optimal wavelet filter and decomposition level played a role in describing the original irrigation flow time series thus these sub series wavelet and scaling coefficients were used together to develop the wavelet based mlr and ml models respectively 4 5 coupled wavelet bootstrap model development the last step consisted of developing coupled wavelet bootstrap models in this case the bootstrap technique was applied to the input sub series obtained from the wavelet decomposition the methodology followed was similar to that used for the development of the bootstrap models in other words the wavelet bootstrap models consisted of ensembles of 100 bootstrap resamples of wavelet sub time series instead of the original time series model training cross validation and testing were completed in a similar way to the bootstrap models 4 6 performance measures to compare the relative performance of the developed models the following statistical indicators were used root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 mean relative error mre mean absolute relative error mare willmott s index wi as well as the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nash these indices are defined as follows 11 r m s e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 12 m a e 1 n i 1 n o i p i 13 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 14 m r e 1 n i 1 n p i o i o i 15 m a r e 1 n i 1

mean of the observed irrigation flow and n is the size of the dataset rmse measures the variance of errors independently of sample size and indicates the discrepancy between observed and forecasted values rmse is always greater than or equal to 0 with 0 occurring when the model fits the data perfectly mae is the average of the absolute errors and indicates how close forecasted values are to observed values the value of r 2 reflects the degree of linear association between observations and forecasts values for r 2 range from 0 to 1 with 1 showing perfect forecasting skill assuming the slope and ordinate intercept to be 1 and 0 respectively the value of w i measures the degree to which the observed variable is accurately estimated by the simulated variable values for w i range from 0 to 1 where a value of 1 shows perfect agreement between predictions and observations willmott 1981 5 results and discussion the performance of the best mlr ann lssvr elm and lstm models along with their bootstrap wavelet and wavelet bootstrap counterparts is presented in table 1 additional accuracy metrics are shown in table a3 and include the mean relative error mre the mean absolute relative error mare willmott s index and nash sutcliffe efficiency index nash the inputs and parameters characterizing the best mlr and ml models used to develop their bootstrap wavelet and wavelet bootstrap counterparts are shown in tables a1 and a2 fig 2 shows the absolute values of the prediction errors for the five modelling techniques tested all data driven models were effective at forecasting irrigation flow at day d 1 as measured by the four performance metrics table 1 fig 2 the best performing models were the lstm ann and elm models showed varying accuracies depending on the data augmentation and transformation techniques employed when the coupled wavelet bootstrap technique was used the overall best testing phase performance was obtained by the ann model r 2 0 9432 on the other hand the lssvr model and its variants i e bootstrap wavelet and wavelet bootstrap resulted in less accurate irrigation flow forecasts compared to the remaining machine learning models this could be due to the lssvr models hyper parameter sensitivity yu et al 2017 interestingly although the r2 value for the lstm model is higher than that of the mlr model using the mre and mare as error metrics leads to a contradictory conclusion the results in table a3 show lower mre and mare errors achieved by the mlr model in comparison with the lstm model this result might be explained by the fact that metrics based on relative errors put a heavier penalty on negative errors than on positive errors as a result accuracy metrics such as mre and mare are biased in selecting models predicting lower values than the observations makridakis 1993 the high mre and mare values obtained by the lstm might be an indication that the lstm forecasts are lower than observations while the mlr forecasts are higher than observations on the other hand comparing lstm to mlr and the remaining ml models using nash as an accuracy metric shows comparative performances while comparing lstm using rmse mae r2 and wi shows that regular lstms and w lstms significantly outperform their counterparts models these findings suggest that using lstms and w lstms can provide more accurate forecasts compared to mlr and competing ml models when the goal is to minimize any one of the following metrics rmse mae r2 or wi boxplots of observations and forecasts for each of the best models fig 3 allowed for a comparison of the statistical distributions of the observed and forecasted irrigation flow values aided in quantifying the degree of overall spread in each time series and assessed the level of agreement between the data examples pairs of observed and forecasted values except for the mlr models the distribution generated by the different forecasting models closely matched that of the observed irrigation flow values this was especially true for wavelet based models in all cases the median was almost at the same level as that of the observation time series the lower flow values were more accurately simulated than the higher flow values as the bottom lines for the forecast boxplots resembled the bottom line of the observations boxplot the higher flow values seemed to be slightly underestimated overall the machine learning models performed better when the wavelet transformation technique was used this indicated that the wavelet analysis extracted useful time frequency information from the input time series that was not captured in the non wavelet based models tiwari and adamowski 2014 the trends and multi scale components of the irrigation flow time series are likely to represent the sum of the sub eprocesses associated with the original time series data these components are extracted through wavelet decomposition facilitating the ability of the wavelet coupled models to extract non linear and complex patterns in the data more easily fitting these components to the target data leading to a better performance compared to mlr models developed using raw data sets in general the haar wavelet provided better performance than the other mother wavelets that wer tested see table a2 apart from the lstm all model performances were improved over the regular models when bootstrapping was implemented using the bootstrap the parameter uncertainty associated with the different irrigation flow forecasting models was quantified and assessed through ensemble forecasts reducing the forecast error compared to the non bootstrap based models the wb nn models provided the most accurate results as exhibited by rmse and r 2 metrics see table 1 training 100 w nn models gave an idea of the ensemble model s parameter uncertainty and indicated how the model was expected to generalize on unseen data consequently the wavelet bootstrap models were more robust and stable than the individual regular models given different data patterns in fact as highlighted in tiwari et al 2013 the ensemble of w nn models may represent different processes associated with the irrigation flow signals at different time scales while b nn models provide an average over the errors which results in more accurate forecasts when wavelets and the bootstrap are combined with ann the wb nn models which leverage the ability of wavelet analysis and bootstrap resampling to capture time frequency information and reduce forecast error respectively led to the highest accuracy when compared to the wavelet bootstrap based lstm lssvr and elm models the proposed wavelet bootstrap models addressed two issues common to irrigation flow forecasting accuracy and uncertainty this advantage came at the price of generating bootstrap resamples and training bootstrap ensemble models which is computationally expensive for lengthy datasets tiwari and adamowski 2014 the bootstrap based lstm models did not perform as well as the remaining b mlr and wb mlr models the lstm exception could be explained by the fact that lstms are sequential models which rely on information from i e previous time steps to forecast the next time step when bootstrapping is employed the training resamples are drawn with replacement in a random manner which destroys the past sequence and causes the lstm performance to drop methods such as the moving block bootstrap lahiri 1993 preserve to a certain extent time correlations and might be useful to study with the lstm in the future however for the regular and wavelet based models and based on all performance metrics employed the lstm models performed better than the ann elm lssvr and mlr models the ability of lstm models to learn temporal dependencies in sequential datasets enables a memory mechanism where the network looks a few steps back in this case 30 days back as shown in table a2 and uses information about past calculations to inform the decision of whether or not this information should be passed along to the next iteration this characteristic explained the better performance of lstms compared to classical neural networks where the inputs are assumed to be independent of each other mouatadid et al 2017 the elm models despite achieving the second best performance presented computational advantages in comparison to the remaining benchmarking models the relative accuracy and the fast learning times of the elm models makes them an attractive modelling option when designing decision making and real time forecasting applications such as flood warning systems the reason behind the elm s fast computational time is that the input weights and biases are randomized and the output weights have a unique minimum norm least squares solution solved by the moore penrose generalized inverse function huang et al 2006 as opposed to anns where the weights and biases are tuned through the iterative back propagation process as a result elm models do not require parameter tuning which saves time during the models training phase additionally it is interesting to note the poor performance of the lssvr models compared to the remaining machine learning based models considering that lssvr models are also characterized by very slow training times due to the additional constraint of identifying the most accurate set of hyper parameters we do not recommend the use of lssvr models for forecasting applications involving large data set sizes especially in applications where computational efficiency is an important pre requisite this conclusion added to the results of deo et al 2017 where the longer run time requirement of lssvr was discussed finally the least accurate benchmarking model was the mlr as its linear structure struggled to capture the non linear relationships that characterized the data overall the results from this study confirmed that the lstm elm and ann models could be effectively applied to the forecasting of irrigation flow signals depending on whether the emphasis is placed on high accuracy or on slightly less accurate flow forecasts but fast computations the lstm based or the wb elm models could be used respectively these results were obtained despite the limited set of inputs used i e irrigation flow lags only compared to previous studies rasouli et al 2012 rezaeianzadeh et al 2014 which considered a large set of input variables e g discharge precipitation temperature relative humidity etc for streamflow forecasting with no automated variable selection or input pre processing this study was based on using only the irrigation flow signals at a given day d and at lagged periods as inputs to the forecasting models this was made possible by a careful acf and pacf analysis which allowed for the selection of appropriate input combinations of the irrigation flow signal with zero lag and with lags of 1 2 and 7 days table a1 to develop robust data driven models this study s results reflect the skill of machine learning models for daily irrigation forecasts however for many water resources decisions long term forecasting i e season and year ahead forecasts is more pertinent vogel 2000 long term forecasting covers time horizons from six months to ten years this type of forecasting is useful for developing robust planning strategies such as capacity expansion capital investment and revenue analysis al saba and el amin 1999 however due to the inherent uncertainties of the future long term forecasting is considered a very challenging task and most of the literature about seasonal forecasts focuses on 1 2 or 3 season ahead forecasts based on seasonal means in the future we plan to explore the topic of long term water resources forecasting several studies have looked at seasonal forecasts by aggregating daily data into seasonal estimates and forecasting these estimates one step where the step equals one month one season or one year ahead for example the ability of ann for long term forecasting was explored for annual runoff time series forecasting wang et al 2015 annual peak load forecasting al saba and el amin 1999 monthly and seasonal solar radiation deo and sahin 2017 and seasonal rainfall forecasting babel et al 2017 similarly several studies explored the use of svr models for medium and long term forecasting tasks such as forecasting the annual spi drought index belayneh et al 2014 forecasting the improved spei drought index for 3 and 12 month lead times mouatadid et al 2018 and forecasting monthly seasonal and annual runoff volumes liang et al 2018 with promising results elm models were compared to ann models for forecasting monthly groundwater fluctuations and were found to outperform anns at modelling long term fluctuations alizamir et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 explored the use of the recurrent neural network and lstm in modelling monthly runoff data and found it to outperform lssvm models in all these studies the forecasting horizon was 1 2 or 3 steps ahead another interesting area of research would be to forecast multi steps into the future as is the case for sub seasonal forecasts with three week horizons webb et al 2017 without aggregating data into monthly seasonal or annual means and losing useful information this is a challenge that has just started to garner attention in the deep learning community performance of the state of the art lstm model decays as the forecasting horizon extends beyond a few steps ahead addressing this problem by making the lstm network deeper comes with a high computational cost as an alternative one recent study leveraged ideas from the dynamic belief network literature and proposed an improved lstm architecture that incorporates expectation bias ismail et al 2018 in the future we plan to explore different lstm architectures for forecasting a wide variety of water resources that require forecasts for a large number of time steps beyond the observed records 6 conclusions irrigation flow forecasting can be effectively used for the sustainable planning and management of water resources in particular these applications include the sustainable management of agriculture and irrigation operations the optimization of water resources allocations pricing and water quality assessment as well as the analysis of water conservation strategies and drought conditions yet the task of forecasting irrigation flow is a challenging one as it involves complex non linear dynamics between multi scale features that are further subject to uncertainty the framework proposed in this study used the coupling of an lstm model and a wavelet decomposition technique to accurately forecast daily irrigation flow this study addressed this question by exploring the forecasting skill of lstms compared to ann lssvr and elm models this study used the ability of wavelet transformations to capture time frequency information to improve the accuracy of the developed models the results of the study showed that the wavelet coupled models whether based on lstm ann lssvr or elm algorithms led to a higher accuracy compared to their regular counterparts in particular the w lstm and wb ann models led to the most accurate forecasts for most cases the bootstrap resampling technique further improved the accuracy of the developed models the proposed wavelet lstm methodology for irrigation flow forecasting has been shown to provide better performance than standalone lstm as well as benchmark methods such as mlr lssvr elm and ann along with their wavelet bootstrap based counterparts for the study site in huelva spain therefore lstm networks and wavelet lstm networks in particular are promising new methods that deserve

growth and grape quality and for ensuring vineyard sustainability imposing an appropriate drought stress at a suitable phenological stage can improve wine quality with almost no yield reduction a comprehensive irrigation model enabling precise vineyard irrigation should be based on changes in vine water consumption as a function of climate conditions and canopy area in 2011 six drainage lysimeters were constructed within a commercial cabernet sauvignon vineyard located in the central mountains of israel data were collected during six successive years from 2012 2017 the daily vine water consumption etc l day 1 was calculated by subtracting the amount of collected drainage over a 24 h period from the amount of applied irrigation during the same time period seasonal water consumption etc was 715 mm season 1 on average while seasonal calculated reference evapotranspiration eto was 1237 mm season 1 on average maximal crop coefficient kc was 0 8 0 9 meaning that actual water consumption was lower than the calculated reference evapotranspiration maximal leaf area index lai was 0 9 to 1 7 m2 m 2 the multi seasonal linear correlation between lai and kc was strongly positive and significant the robust multiyear relationship between lai kc proves that measuring canopy area of wine grapevines is a reliable approach for estimating their kc the lai to kc relationship

can improve wine quality with almost no yield reduction girona et al 2009 intrigliolo and castel 2010 munitz et al 2016 romero et al 2013 williams and araujo 2002 conversely imposing severe drought

1990 medrano et al 2003 munitz et al 2016 continuous severe drought stress will dramatically reduce vegetative growth and shorten the lifespan of the vineyard a non stress irrigation strategy is also problematic since excessive irrigation is costly and may cause vigorous vegetative growth that leads to shading of clusters and reduced quality bureau et al 2000 chorti et al 2010 gao and cahoon 1994 morrison and noble 1990 in addition over irrigating may increase the need for canopy management practices and also lead to percolation of water below the root zone leaching nitrates and other chemicals into groundwater reservoirs di and cameron 2002 keller 2005 watts et al 1991 moreover excessive irrigation may lead to fungal infection and cluster rotting a comprehensive irrigation model

mountain region of israel lat 32 2 n long 35 1 e 759 m above sea level the climate at the experimental site is characterized as semi arid with predominant winter rainfall of 415 mm warm days maximum

commercial vineyard was planted during 2007 with vitis vinifera cv cabernet sauvignon vines grafted onto 110 richter rootstock during 2011 similar four year old vines were replanted one in each of the

comprising two buds except for irrigation lysimeter vines were treated by following the local commercial vineyard growing practices pest and weed control canopy management pruning 2 2 lysimeters structure and maintenance each of the six lysimeter tanks was 1 2 m in diameter and 1 3 m in height for a total volume of 1 47 m3 the lysimeters were filled with local soil terra rossa packed to the original bulk density while conserving soil layers in order to avoid edge row effects the lysimeters tanks were located in the second row of the vineyard s1 2 to ensure drainage of water from the lysimeter tank into the receiver tank the bottom of each lysimeter tank was packed with 30 cm of rock wool the lysimeters were buried in the ground with their top surfaces aligned with the soil surface two 10 m long drainage pipe lines 50 8 mm in diameter connected to the base of each lysimeter tank led to a 2 5 m deep underground tunnel located 7 m outside the vineyard for more technical details about lysimeter construction see the supplementary information s1 3 each lysimeter was irrigated separately with a tailor made computer controlled system crystal vision kibbutz samar israel to ensure optimum soil water conditions allen et al 2006 the daily irrigation amount exceeded the vines estimated daily water consumption eto by 5 10 during 2011 2012 daily irrigation began at 6 00 am

vines and of the six adjacent field grown vines was measured weekly during each growing season using a canopy analysis system sunscan model ss1 r3 bf3 delta t devices cambridge uk this system which uses a line quantum sensor array of 64 sensors sensitive to photosynthetic active radiation par was operated using the standard protocol recommended by the manufacturer and all measurements were conducted while the zenith angle was below 30 each sample comprised 16 equally spaced observations 10 cm apart starting from the center of the row to half the distance between adjacent rows with the sensor array positioned parallel to the rows the lai values obtained by this method were compared with measurements obtained after destructive defoliation of leaves from 39 vines 3 cultivars from 6 sites using an area meter model 3100 li cor lincoln nebraska the two measurement methods were found to be highly correlated with a linear relationship s4 r2 0 922 p 0 001 for more information about

considerable technical difficulties were expected this approach reflected our desire to measure water consumption of wine grapevines in a way that most accurately represents water consumption of real vines growing in real commercial vineyard conditions similarly canopy area and water status were always compared between lysimeter vines and field vines 4 1 crop and reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient the etc of 715 mm season 1 recorded in this study was measured in a region with total eto of 1237 mm season 1 thus the seasonal etc eto ratio is 0 58 this level of water consumption is in the range reported in the literature for wine grapevines lópez urrea et al 2012 reported water consumption using weighting lysimeters of 477 mm season 1 for tempranillo grapevines grown under climatic conditions of eto of 895 mm season 1 giving an etc eto ratio of 0 53 for the same grape cultivar picón toro et al 2012 obtained using weighting lysimeters water consumption of 834 mm season 1 with eto of 1159 mm season 1 giving an etc eto ratio of 0 72 it is important to note that both lópez urrea et al 2012 and picón toro et al 2012 measured minimal evaporation of dry soil while in the current study the soil was always completely wet accepted procedure for drainage lysimeters irrigated at 1 hour intervals for comparison evans et al 1993 reported seasonal water consumption using drainage lysimeters of 387 431 432 mm season 1 for white riesling chenin blanc and cabernet sauvignon the cumulative seasonal eto was 908 mm season 1 giving etc eto ratios of 0 43 0 47 and 0 48 respectively based primarily on the results of gravimetric soil sampling doorenbos and pruitt 1977 reported that vineyard etc may vary from 650 to 1000 mm year 1 the maximal kc values below 1 obtained in this study are reasonable for vsp trained wine grapevines with limited canopy area our maximal kc values of 0 8 0 9 are in good agreement with other reported kc values for wine grapevine cultivars picón toro et al 2012 reported maximal kcb dry soil values around 1 for tempranillo using weighting lysimeters intrigliolo et al 2009 obtained maximal kcb values of 0 55 for field grown riesling using a canopy chamber dragoni et al 2006 calculated maximal kcb values of 1 1 2 for field grown vitis labruscana concord vines but their canopy was very wide lai 2 5 m2 m 2 carrasco benavides et al 2012 calculated using eddy correlation maximal kc values of 0 7 for field grown merlot vines allen and pereira 2009 calculated maximal kc values of 0 7 0 75 for wine grapes using a stress factor of 0 7 higher values of kc above 1 have been reported for table grapes with a much wider canopy lai 5 m2 m 2 netzer et al 2009 in thompson seedless williams et al 2003 found maximal kc above 1 and in superior seedless netzer et al 2009 and wang et al 2018 reported maximal kc of 1 2 1 3 4 2 leaf area index and water potential grapevine canopy development occurring mainly from bud break till the end of stage i bunch closure as observed in this study is consistent with our former results munitz et al 2016 and has also been reported by others ben asher et al 2006 edwards and clingeleffer 2013 peacock et al 1987 picón toro et al 2012 romero et al 2010 similar lai values of lysimeter and field vines indicate that the lysimeter vines are well representative of field grown vines the maximal lai values measured in this study 0 9 to 1 7 m2 m 2 are in the range of lai values of field grown vines trained on a vsp trellis system reported by others who used different measuring methods intrigliolo and castel 2010 reported lai of 0 6 to 1 6 m2 m 2 in tempranillo vines romero et al 2010 measured maximal lai of 2 2 m2 m 2 in monastrell vines edwards and clingeleffer 2013 reported lai in the range 1 7 to 2 9 m2 m 2 in cabernet sauvignon vines johnson et al 2003 obtained lai in the range 0 4 2 8 m2 m 2 in four different cultivars chardonnay cabernet sauvignon cabernet franc and sangiovese buesa et al 2017 measured lai in the range 0 9 to 2 1 m2 m 2 in muscat of alexandria intrigliolo et al 2009 reported maximal lai of 1 5 m2 m 2 in riesling picón toro et al 2012 reported lai values above 4 m2 m 2 in tempranillo vsp trained vines these authors stated that the development of their vineyard is greater than in most winemaking areas but their values are almost double those mentioned above and seem to be a bit overestimated the range of ψs values measured in this study in the lysimeter vines 0 3 to 0 65 mpa are typical for non stressed grapevines picón toro et al 2012 reported ψs of 0 35 to 0 8 mpa in non stressed tempranillo vines patakas et al 2005 obtained ψs of 0 4 to 0 6 mpa in non stressed malagouzia vines buesa et al 2017 measured ψs of 0 4 to 0 8 mpa in non stressed muscat of alexandria vines picón toro et al 2012 calculated that in grapevines evapotranspiration is maximal down to ψs of 0 5 to 0 6 mpa and then begins to decrease our lysimeter vines maintained ψs of 0 6 mpa and higher throughout all growing seasons meaning that their evapotranspiration was kept maximal as required by fao paper 56 for etc calculation allen et al 1998 the seasonal curve of declining ψs measured in this study in the field grown vines is typical for deficit irrigated vineyards located in semi arid regions intrigliolo and castel 2010 munitz et al 2016 romero et al 2010 the similar ψs of field grown vines and lysimeter vines during the spring period demonstrates that lysimeter vines represent field grown vines during high water availability periods 4 3 leaf area index and crop coefficient relationship the linear correlation between lai and kc reported in this study has a steeper slope higher kc for similar lai than that of relationships reported for table grapes netzer et al 2009 williams and ayars 2005 this is because the vsp trellis systems used for wine grapes receive much greater sun exposure compared to the open gable overhead trellis systems used for table grapes as mentioned above kc is affected by canopy shape and trellising architecture williams and ayars 2005 williams and fidelibus 2016 we converted the canopy cover percentage data of lópez urrea et al 2012 to lai using correlations from williams and ayars 2005 and converted their basal crop coefficient kcb only transpiration to crop coefficient kc transpiration evaporation using their own data the resulting lai kc relationship resembles our correlation but with a decline in the slope the slope of the lai kcb relationship obtained for wine grapes by picón toro et al 2012 is quite similar to slopes reported previously for table grapes netzer et al 2009 williams and ayars 2005 even after adding 18 to kcb in order to transform it to kc 18 of average evaporation from total evapotranspiration according to our data in table 3 the slope of the picón toro et al 2012 lai kc relationship is still quite similar to that of table grapes this shift can be caused by overestimation of lai as mentioned above 4 4 evaporation and transpiration relationship the average percent evaporation from total evapotranspiration measured in this study was 18 this is in good agreement with evaporation values reported by others in vineyards in tempranillo vines montoro et al 2016 calculated 26 31 evaporation using fao 56 methodology from total evapotranspiration in cabernet sauvignon vines kool et al 2014 reported 8 17 evaporation using eddy correlation of total evapotranspiration in table grapes with a much wider canopy that shades the soil lower evaporation evapotranspiration ratios were found in thompson seedless 13 was reported williams and fidelibus 2016 and in superior seedless 7 netzer et al 2009 it is important to note that our evaporation results overestimate vineyard evaporation since our lysimeter soil was always wet nevertheless our evaporation results underestimate vineyard evaporation since our lysimeter soil surface is only 1 1 m2 while the soil surface per vine in the vineyard is 4 5 m2 5 conclusions the water potential and all vegetative parameters measured in this study clearly show that our lysimeter vines demonstrate similar physiological performance to that of field grown vines under high water availability conditions and can serve as a reference model vines for field grown grapevine irrigation the robust multiyear relationship between lai and kc proves that measuring the canopy area of wine grapevines is a reliable approach for estimating their kc the lai to kc relationship established in this study can be used as a basis for developing a comprehensive irrigation model for wine grapevines that integrates both climatic conditions and canopy area measuring canopy area in a vineyard and converting it to kc combined with meteorological data from an adjacent weather station eto will enable calculation of the etc of the vineyard using the equation etc eto kc applying this irrigation model to wine grapevines in which a certain drought stress is desirable requires the incorporation of a stress factor ks as explained by munitz et al 2016 acknowledgments this study was sponsored by the ministry of

growth and grape quality and for ensuring vineyard sustainability imposing an appropriate drought stress at a suitable phenological stage can improve wine quality with almost no yield reduction a comprehensive irrigation model enabling precise vineyard irrigation should be based on changes in vine water consumption as a function of climate conditions and canopy area in 2011 six drainage lysimeters were constructed within a commercial cabernet sauvignon vineyard located in the central mountains of israel data were collected during six successive years from 2012 2017 the daily vine water consumption etc l day 1 was calculated by subtracting the amount of collected drainage over a 24 h period from the amount of applied irrigation during the same time period seasonal water consumption etc was 715 mm season 1 on average while seasonal calculated reference evapotranspiration eto was 1237 mm season 1 on average maximal crop coefficient kc was 0 8 0 9 meaning that actual water consumption was lower than the calculated reference evapotranspiration maximal leaf area index lai was 0 9 to 1 7 m2 m 2 the multi seasonal linear correlation between lai and kc was strongly positive and significant the robust multiyear relationship between lai kc proves that measuring canopy area of wine grapevines is a reliable approach for estimating their kc the lai to kc relationship

resources are scarce chaves et al 2007 precise vineyard water management is essential in those areas to enable sustainable production of grapevines fereres and evans 2006 romero et al 2010 in wine

can improve wine quality with almost no yield reduction girona et al 2009 intrigliolo and castel 2010 munitz et al 2016 romero et al 2013 williams and araujo 2002 conversely imposing severe drought

1990 medrano et al 2003 munitz et al 2016 continuous severe drought stress will dramatically reduce vegetative growth and shorten the lifespan of the vineyard a non stress irrigation strategy is also problematic since excessive irrigation is costly and may cause vigorous vegetative growth that leads to shading of clusters and reduced quality bureau et al 2000 chorti et al 2010 gao and cahoon 1994 morrison and noble 1990 in addition over irrigating may increase the need for canopy management practices and also lead to percolation of water below the root zone leaching nitrates and other chemicals into groundwater reservoirs di and cameron 2002 keller 2005 watts et al 1991 moreover excessive irrigation may lead to fungal infection and cluster rotting a comprehensive irrigation model

mountain region of israel lat 32 2 n long 35 1 e 759 m above sea level the climate at the experimental site is characterized as semi arid with predominant winter rainfall of 415 mm warm days maximum 30 c and relatively cool nights minimum 20 c during the growing season the soil is deep stone free terra rossa comprising 36 4 sand 30 6 silt and 33 clay with bulk density of 1 25 g cm 3 the commercial vineyard was planted during 2007 with vitis vinifera cv cabernet sauvignon vines grafted onto 110 richter rootstock during 2011 similar four year old vines were replanted one in each of the six lysimeter tanks vine spacing was 3 m between rows and 1 5 m between vines i e 2222 vines per hectare lysimeters were constructed while conserving commercial vineyard spacing row orientation was east west and the vines were trained to a vsp training system with two foliage wires the vines were designed as a bi lateral cordon and pruned during the winter to 16 spurs 8 per cordon each comprising two buds except for irrigation lysimeter vines were treated by following the local commercial vineyard growing practices pest and weed control canopy management pruning 2 2 lysimeters structure and maintenance each of the six lysimeter tanks was 1 2 m in diameter and 1 3 m in height for a total volume of 1 47 m3 the lysimeters were filled with local soil terra rossa packed to the original bulk density while conserving soil layers in order to avoid edge row effects the lysimeters tanks were located in the second row of the vineyard s1 2 to ensure drainage of water from the lysimeter tank into the receiver tank the bottom of each lysimeter tank was packed with 30 cm of rock wool the lysimeters were buried in the ground with their top surfaces aligned with the soil surface two 10 m long drainage pipe lines 50 8 mm in diameter connected to the base of each lysimeter tank led to a 2 5 m deep underground tunnel located 7 m outside the vineyard for more technical details about lysimeter construction see the supplementary information s1 3 each lysimeter was irrigated separately with a tailor made computer controlled system crystal vision kibbutz samar israel to ensure optimum soil water conditions allen et al 2006 the daily irrigation amount exceeded the vines estimated daily water consumption eto by 5 10 during 2011 2012 daily irrigation began at 6 00 am and lasted for 4 8 hours depending on the amount of water that was applied during 2013 2017 irrigation was set on an hourly basis i e 24 irrigations pulses per day the drip line of each lysimeter was connected to a separate high precision flowmeter rs pro turbine flow meter rs components ltd birchington road corby northants nn17 9rs uk and equipped with four cnl compensated non leakage 1 l h 1 drip emitters spaced 30 cm apart netafim israel the drainage water from each lysimeter was collected separately in a receiver tank tailor made 30 l round container placed on a scale load cell model 1042 vishay measurements group rayleigh nc usa and its weight was recorded every 15 min s3 the drainage tank was automatically emptied each day between 11 46 and 11 59 pm the data were recorded on the system data logger and downloaded on a daily basis via cellular communication the drainage scales and the high precision flowmeters were calibrated manually twice a week 2 3 crop and reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient calculations the daily vine water consumption etc l day 1 was calculated by subtracting the amount of water collected as drainage in the receiver tank over a 24

uses a line quantum sensor array of 64 sensors sensitive to photosynthetic active radiation par was operated using the standard protocol recommended by the manufacturer and all measurements were conducted while the zenith angle was below 30 each sample comprised 16 equally spaced observations 10 cm apart starting from the center of the row to half the distance between adjacent rows with the sensor array positioned parallel to the rows the lai values obtained by this method were compared with measurements obtained after destructive defoliation of leaves from 39 vines 3 cultivars from 6 sites using an area meter model 3100 li cor lincoln nebraska the two measurement methods were found to be highly correlated with a linear relationship s4 r2 0 922 p 0 001 for more information about

field grown vines measurements were conducted at the same time one day before irrigation irrigation was applied once a week 2 6 phenological stages the growing season was divided into three phenological stages as defined by kennedy 2002 stage i from full bloom to bunch closure stage ii from bunch closure to veraison color change to red and stage iii from veraison to harvest 2 7 soil evaporation measurements on two different occasions during each growing season the soil surface of three lysimeter tanks was covered with white plastic sheets while the soil surface of the other three lysimeter tanks remained uncovered soil evaporation in all lysimeters was measured for four days subsequently the covers were transferred to the uncovered lysimeter tanks and the next day another four days of soil evaporation were measured soil evaporation was measured by subtracting the average water consumption of the three covered lysimeters from the average water consumption of the three uncovered lysimeters 2 8 yield must composition and pruning mass each of the six lysimeter grown vines and the six adjacent field grown vines were harvested separately total yield was weighed and the number of bunches per vine was recorded one hundred berries from lysimeter grown vines and from field grown vines were randomly sampled and berry mass was determined after weighing the berries they were crushed and the ph and sugar content tss of the must was measured after filtration during the winter period the pruning mass of each of the lysimeter grown and field grown vines was recorded

seasonal linear correlation between lai and kc was strong and significant fig 4 r2 0 66 p 0 0001 since as described above there is a rapid increase in leaf area followed by stabilization most of the lai values used in the correlation are in the range of 0 8 1 3 m2 m 2 3 5 evaporation and transpiration relationship evaporation remained relatively stable during the growing season 1 5 3 7 l day 1 and the average percent evaporation from total water consumption was 18 table 3 at the beginning and end of the growing season april october when evapotranspiration values were low 7 0 7 5 l day 1 the percent evaporation from total water consumption was 21 38 table 3 while during the main growing period may to september when et was high 9 9 25 5 l day 1 the percent evaporation from total evapotranspiration was 9 15 table 3 4 discussion this experiment was intentionally conducted in a commercial vineyard and avoiding construction of lysimeters in the first border row even though considerable technical difficulties were expected this approach reflected our desire to measure water consumption of wine grapevines in a way that most accurately represents water consumption of real vines growing in real commercial vineyard conditions similarly canopy area and water status were always compared between lysimeter vines and field vines 4 1 crop and reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient the etc of 715 mm season 1 recorded in this study was measured in a region with total eto of 1237 mm season 1 thus the seasonal etc eto ratio is 0 58 this level of water consumption is in the range reported in the literature for wine grapevines lópez urrea et al 2012 reported water consumption using weighting lysimeters of 477 mm season 1 for tempranillo grapevines grown under climatic conditions of eto of 895 mm season 1 giving an etc eto ratio of 0 53 for the same grape cultivar picón toro et al 2012 obtained using weighting lysimeters water consumption of 834 mm season 1 with eto of 1159 mm season 1 giving an etc eto ratio of 0 72 it is important to note that both lópez urrea et al 2012 and picón toro et al 2012 measured minimal evaporation of dry soil while in the current study the soil was always completely wet accepted procedure for drainage lysimeters irrigated at 1 hour intervals for comparison evans et al 1993 reported seasonal water consumption using drainage lysimeters of 387 431 432 mm season 1 for white riesling chenin blanc and cabernet sauvignon the cumulative seasonal eto was 908 mm season 1 giving etc eto ratios of 0 43 0 47 and 0 48 respectively based primarily on the results of gravimetric soil sampling doorenbos and pruitt 1977 reported that vineyard etc may vary from 650 to 1000 mm year 1 the maximal kc values below 1 obtained in this study are reasonable for vsp trained wine grapevines with limited canopy area our maximal kc values of 0 8 0 9 are in good agreement with other reported kc values for wine grapevine cultivars picón toro et al 2012 reported maximal kcb dry soil values around 1 for tempranillo using weighting lysimeters intrigliolo et al 2009 obtained maximal kcb values of 0 55 for field grown riesling using a canopy chamber dragoni et al 2006 calculated maximal kcb values of 1 1 2 for field grown vitis labruscana concord vines but their canopy was very wide lai 2 5 m2 m 2 carrasco benavides et al 2012 calculated using eddy correlation maximal kc values of 0 7 for field grown merlot vines allen and pereira 2009 calculated maximal kc values of 0 7 0 75 for wine grapes using a stress factor of 0 7 higher values of kc above 1 have been reported for table grapes with a much wider canopy lai 5 m2 m 2 netzer et al 2009 in thompson seedless williams et al 2003 found maximal kc above 1 and in superior seedless netzer et al 2009 and wang et al 2018 reported maximal kc of 1 2 1 3 4 2 leaf area index and water potential grapevine canopy development occurring mainly from bud break till the end of stage i bunch closure as observed in this study is consistent with our former results munitz et al 2016 and has also been reported by others ben asher et al 2006 edwards and clingeleffer 2013 peacock et al 1987 picón toro et al 2012 romero et al 2010 similar lai values of lysimeter and field vines indicate that the lysimeter vines are well representative of field grown vines the maximal lai values measured in this study 0 9 to 1 7 m2 m 2 are in the range of lai values of field grown vines trained on a vsp trellis system reported by others who used different measuring methods intrigliolo and castel 2010 reported lai of 0 6 to 1 6 m2 m 2 in tempranillo vines romero et al 2010 measured maximal lai of 2 2 m2 m 2 in monastrell vines edwards and clingeleffer 2013 reported lai in the range 1 7 to 2 9 m2 m 2 in cabernet sauvignon vines johnson et al 2003 obtained lai in the range 0 4 2 8 m2 m 2 in four different cultivars chardonnay cabernet sauvignon cabernet franc and sangiovese buesa et al 2017 measured lai in the range 0 9 to 2 1 m2 m 2 in muscat of alexandria intrigliolo et al 2009 reported maximal lai of 1 5 m2 m 2 in riesling picón toro et al 2012 reported lai values above 4 m2 m 2 in tempranillo vsp trained vines these authors stated that the development of their vineyard is greater than in most winemaking areas but their values are almost double those mentioned above and seem to be a bit overestimated the range of ψs values measured in this study in the lysimeter vines 0 3 to 0 65 mpa are typical for non stressed grapevines picón toro et al 2012 reported ψs of 0 35 to 0 8 mpa in non stressed tempranillo vines patakas et al 2005 obtained ψs of 0 4 to 0 6 mpa in non stressed malagouzia vines buesa et al 2017 measured ψs of 0 4 to 0 8 mpa in non stressed muscat of alexandria vines picón toro et al 2012 calculated that in grapevines evapotranspiration is maximal down to ψs of 0 5 to 0 6 mpa and then begins to decrease our lysimeter vines maintained ψs of 0 6 mpa and higher throughout all growing seasons meaning that their evapotranspiration was kept maximal as required by fao paper 56 for etc calculation allen et al 1998 the seasonal curve of declining ψs measured in this study in the field grown vines is typical for deficit irrigated vineyards located in semi arid regions intrigliolo and castel 2010 munitz et al 2016 romero et al 2010 the similar ψs of field grown vines and lysimeter vines during the spring period demonstrates that lysimeter vines represent field grown vines during high water availability periods 4 3 leaf area index and crop coefficient relationship the linear correlation between lai and kc reported in this study has a steeper slope higher kc for similar lai than that of relationships reported for table grapes netzer et al 2009 williams and ayars 2005 this is because the vsp trellis systems used for wine grapes receive much greater sun exposure compared to the open gable overhead trellis systems used for table grapes as mentioned above kc is affected by canopy shape and trellising architecture williams and ayars 2005 williams and fidelibus 2016 we converted the canopy cover percentage data of lópez urrea et al 2012 to lai using correlations from williams and ayars 2005 and converted their basal crop coefficient kcb only transpiration to crop coefficient kc transpiration evaporation using their own data the resulting lai kc relationship resembles our correlation but with a decline in the slope the slope of the lai kcb relationship obtained for wine grapes by picón toro et al 2012 is quite similar to slopes reported previously for table grapes netzer et al 2009 williams and ayars 2005 even after adding 18 to kcb in order to transform it to kc 18 of average evaporation from total evapotranspiration according to our data in table 3 the slope of the picón toro et al 2012 lai kc relationship is still quite similar to that of table grapes this shift can be caused by overestimation of lai as mentioned above 4 4 evaporation and transpiration relationship the average percent evaporation from total evapotranspiration measured in this study was 18 this is in good agreement with evaporation values reported by others in vineyards in tempranillo vines montoro et al 2016 calculated 26 31 evaporation using fao 56 methodology from total evapotranspiration in cabernet sauvignon vines kool et al 2014 reported 8 17 evaporation using eddy correlation of total evapotranspiration in table grapes with a much wider canopy that shades the soil lower evaporation evapotranspiration ratios were found in thompson seedless 13 was reported williams and fidelibus 2016 and in superior seedless 7 netzer et al 2009 it is important to note that our evaporation results overestimate vineyard evaporation since our lysimeter soil was always wet nevertheless our evaporation results underestimate vineyard evaporation since our lysimeter soil surface is only 1 1 m2 while the soil surface per vine in the vineyard is 4 5 m2 5 conclusions the water potential and all vegetative parameters measured in this study clearly show that our lysimeter vines demonstrate similar physiological performance to that of field grown vines under high water availability conditions and can serve as a reference model vines for field grown grapevine irrigation the robust multiyear relationship between lai and kc proves that measuring the canopy area of wine grapevines is a reliable approach for estimating their kc the lai to kc relationship established in this study can be used as a basis for developing a comprehensive irrigation model for wine grapevines that integrates both climatic conditions and canopy area measuring canopy area in a vineyard and converting it to kc combined with meteorological data from an adjacent weather station eto will enable calculation of the etc of the vineyard using the equation etc eto kc applying this irrigation model to wine grapevines in which a certain drought stress is desirable requires the incorporation of a stress factor ks as explained by munitz et al 2016 acknowledgments this study was sponsored by the ministry of

11037,water is the lifeline for crop production worldwide however the changing climate is causing erratic rains and frequent episodes of drought and a continuous decline in freshwater resources this situation requires strategies for water efficient crop production wise use of water in crop production and improved crop water use efficiency may help to produce more crop per drop this review discusses physiological and agronomic considerations for improving water use efficiency in crop plants which primarily depend on canopy size leaf morphology leaf and shoot anatomy root architecture water uptake capacity and maintenance of tissue water status developing genotypes with improved water productivity and modified planting times seeding rates and planting geometries will improve water use efficiency in crop plants improved irrigation scheduling use of high efficiency irrigation systems better soil fertility management and mulching to reduce soil evaporation and manage weeds should further improve crop water use efficiency in the field research and development gaps for increasing our understanding of the physiological responses of plants to water supply using novel approaches linked to environmental physiology are also explored keywords nutrient management planting time root architecture weed management 1 introduction with the increasing population comes an increased demand for food and feed but the threats of climate change are challenging crop production crop intensification to produce more food fiber and feed needs more water but water resources are limited elliott et al 2014 compared 10 global hydrological models and six global gridded crop models for water demand and supply and reported that by the end of century limited freshwater availability could revert 20 60 mha of irrigated croplands to rainfed croplands which may result in losses of 600 2900 pcal 1012 kcal of food production in the western united states china and west south and central asia in a study on the effect of climate change on asian water resources immerzeel et al 2010 projected that reduced water flow in the brahmaputra and indus basins would create food security issues for more than 60 million people new strategies to manage water resources particularly the wise use of water for crop production are crucial for moving forward under water deficit conditions reductions in crop growth and productivity are attributed to slow physiological processes which in turn slow down growth processes key physiological and morphological processes that are more sensitive to water stress need to be identified so that alternatives can be developed to manage those processes changes in root behavior under water stress also need to be investigated aroca et al 2011 kato and okami 2010 studied the root dynamics of rice oryza sativa l under flooded and aerobic conditions under flooded conditions root biomass tended to accumulate in the upper soil layer and was significantly less than that of aerobically grown rice which collects more water from relatively deeper soils bengough et al 2011 reported the importance of root hairs and other root tip traits to maintain water relations under water stress therefore it is important to understand the physiological behavior of plants especially roots and leaves to manage water use in stress conditions water use efficiency wue is an important attribute that describes the efficiency of crop plants to use available water for carbon fixation bramley et al 2013 defined it as a ratio of above ground biomass or economic yield to the evapotranspiration or total water use by the crop here evapotranspiration or water use is denominator which means that decreasing the transpiration water use will increase the wue blum 2009 analyzed and reported that under well water conditions improvement in wue will lead to reduced yield as the cultivars with higher wue will have less transpiration water use which results in less co2 assimilation therefore wue better related to the drought tolerance as under limited water conditions water use efficient crops genotypes cope with stress and produce better that the crops genotypes which are not water use efficient it is noteworthy not to mix the terms wue transpirational efficiency and drought tolerance as wue deals evapotranspiration transpirational efficiency deals with only water use by transpiration and drought tolerance deals with the avoidance of water stress by any physiological or phenological mean future agriculture is threatened by drought and heat stress in the current climate scenario where increased wue of crops is vital for sustainable production scientists use various techniques ranging from agronomic to genetic and transgenic to improve crop wue blum 2009 suggested improving transpirational efficiency in well watered areas and wue in dryland areas to improve crop productivity there are substantial opportunities to improve wue using different irrigation and soil water management techniques blum 2009 molden et al 2010 many researchers have reported the use of deficit irrigation and nutrient management ul allah et al 2018 to improve wue and water productivity in different agro climatic regions du et al 2010 fang et al 2010 2017 the literature has investigated plant water use wue water productivity and the effect of water scarcity on crop growth and physiology blum 2009 du et al 2010 fang et al 2010 kato and okami 2010 sade et al 2010 ul allah et al 2015 hussain et al 2018 but these studies have focused on limited aspects studies that comprehensively describe how to improve crop wue especially in relation to climate change are rare furthermore relationship of wue and the crop yield under different conditions and the economic impact of wue improvement have often been ignored in the discussion of wue which have been covered in this review in the climate change scenario changes are expected in plant anatomy and physiology therefore this review assessed the role of the crop canopy leaf morphology and anatomy and root architecture for tailoring water efficient crops moreover different management options including re evaluating the crop calendar seeding rate planting geometry and better nutrient weed and water management to improve the wue of crops in well watered and water limited conditions are also discussed 2 physiology of plant water use 2 1 plant canopy size plant density and crop canopy size should be optimized to maximize the economic yield of crops the crop canopy is also important for plant water use a dense canopy will shade the soil surface reduce evapotranspiration and soil temperature and hence control soil evaporation canopy architecture is important for light interception and its penetration into the soil light can penetrate and reflect from more leaves in erectophile canopies where leaves are erect than planophile canopies with horizontal leaves wang et al 2009 bramley et al 2013 soil evaporation is higher during early crop growth as light can easily penetrate the soil and increase soil temperature soil evaporation declines later in the season when the canopy has developed and less light can penetrate the soil thus early vigor traits such as early canopy development will reduce soil evaporation and increase wue determinate and indeterminate plants differ in their canopy development indeterminate non tillering plants such as faba bean vicia faba l rely on leaf weight and number while determinate tillering plants are regulated by stem number per unit area stützel and aufhammer 1991 kholová et al 2014 investigated the effect of plant water use on stay green characteristics in sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench cultivated in the post rainy season the smaller canopy size improved grain yield under severe drought but compromised stover yield under mild drought borrell et al 2014b studied the role of stay green alleles in modifying canopy size in sorghum under drought stress and reported that stay green alleles conferred adaptation to terminal drought by reducing pre anthesis canopy size to save soil moisture for post anthesis grain development borrell et al 2014a reported that stay green alleles modified canopy size by 1 reducing tiller number and enhancing lower leaf size 2 reducing upper leaf area and 3 decreasing leaf number on the main culm in a simulation study of historical maize zea mays l yield events hammer et al 2009 reported that root system architecture had influenced wue more than canopy architecture but according to borrell et al 2014a canopy development is related to root architecture so also impacts crop water use a small leaf canopy and deep root system in limited irrigation treatments reduced evapotranspiration loss and improved wue when compared with well watered conditions xu et al 2016 reduction in canopy size reduce the water demand for transpiration which reduces plant water use during vegetative growth and saves soil moisture for grain filling an effective use of water and the key to improving yields in drought prone regions blum 2009 moreover sinclair 2018 simulated different transpiration efficiency te traits and other water use traits such as water vapor deficit and stomatal closure he stated that te has less scope for improvement than the wue while vapor pressure deficit is an environmental variable that has a direct impact on te and other water use traits therefore he stressed to improve effective water use of the plant instead of mere te in conclusion canopy development is directly related with water use as evaporation is a just loss of water and transpiration is directly related with co2 fixation therefore early canopy development is beneficial as it reduces the soil evaporation but transpiration will be more under water limited conditions moderate or smaller canopies may be desired to reduce water use and to improve wue 2 2 leaf morphology and anatomy leaves are the food factory of plants and play a central role in water and nutrient use and co2 fixation leaf orientation leaf angle leaf morphology leaf structure and the orientation of internal leaf tissues are important traits for leaf water use and thus crop wue cereals can be screened on leaf angle for better performance under water deficit semi erect leaves have greater transpirational water requirements than droopy leaves erect leaves have better wue than droopy or semi erect leaves saadalla 2008 bogale et al 2011 lonbani and arzani 2011 yang et al 2016 araus et al 1993 studied genetic variation in the leaf posture of wheat triticum aestivum l and its relationship with water use and yield related traits the authors reported that erect leaves had higher transpiration rates stomatal conductance and carbon isotope discrimination and lower wue than droopy leaves however cultivars with erect leaves had higher grain yields than those from droopy leaves due to the positive impact of erect leaves on other yield related traits both erect and droopy leaves are positively correlated with some yield related traits and negatively correlated with others therefore selecting an intermediate genotype could maximize wue for example a genotype with erect pre flag leaves that ensure maximum light penetration to the ground along with more fertile tillers per unit area and terminal droopy flag leaves that intercept maximum light during later growth when older leaves start to dry off should improve wue medrano et al 2015 investigated the effects of leaf position on wue in grape wines and reported that eastern leaves have higher wue which decreases from bottom to top and western leaves have lower wue relative to the eastern side which increases from bottom to top plant physiological processes such as transpiration osmotic potential turgor potential and photosynthesis are closely related to water availability limited water availability will greatly affect these processes which will vary from genotype to genotype and species to species leaf gas exchange characteristics play an important role in the manipulation of water use anyia and herzog 2004 sade et al 2010 reported higher wue in tobacco nicotiana tabacum l plants under drought due to stress induced aquaporin1 that regulates plant physiological processes such as stomatal conductance photosynthesis and transpiration and makes efficient use of water lawson and blatt 2014 investigated variations in the stomatal response to co2 uptake and water use and reported that the manipulation of guard cells for stomatal conductance could improve plant water use without affecting carbon fixation for photosynthesis furthermore moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 reported stomatal regulation and water use strategies as an inherent characteristic of plants for domestication in contrasting climates they proposed a systematic screening of carbon and oxygen isotopes in stomatal conductance to better understand the climate change challenges for efficient water use the stomatal density of leaves plays an important role in plant water use due to its direct link with transpiration manipulating stomatal density has improved wue in various crops khazaei et al 2010 yoo et al 2010 cao et al 2012 franks et al 2015 the upper side of leaves receive direct sunlight and is prone to more water loss than the lower side which does not receive direct sunlight yoo et al 2010 studied changes in the gtl1 transcription factor and reported that glt1 improves wue by lowering abaxial stomatal density without affecting adaxial stomatal density or having a negative impact on co2 fixation borrell et al 2014a investigated the role of stay green alleles for plant water use in sorghum and reported that these alleles could modify the stomatal index and thus reduce transpiration rate i e increasing the stomatal index reduced leaf size to neutralize the high transpiration of stomata franks et al 2015 studied epidermal patterning factor mutants of arabidopsis and reported that reducing stomatal conductance improved wue with little effect on photosynthetic capacity manipulating stomatal density and the opening and closing of stomata with water availability regulates plant water use and leads to sustained growth and production and improved wue anyia and herzog 2004 guerfel et al 2009 investigated structural adaptations in olive olea europaea l tree leaves for manipulating water use under water stress they reported that efficient water use was associated with thicker palisade parenchyma and higher trichome and stomatal density of foliar tissue which lead to lower reductions in carbon fixation under water stress thicker and smaller leaves are associated with moisture stress tolerance in many species leaf expansion declines under moisture stress and leads to smaller and thicker leaves shao et al 2008 skirycz and inzé 2010 anjum et al 2011 which store more water than normal leaves a thicker leaf is associated with a thicker boundary layer which reduces transpiration and increases photosynthetic rate due to the increased photosynthetic apparatus that improves transpirational efficiency and ultimately wue bramley et al 2013 the leaf trichome is also associated with leaf transpiration an increase in trichomes results in cooling effects for the leaf due to transpiration and light reflectance that reduces overall leaf transpiration konrad et al 2015 and in some species trichome density increases with increased moisture stress huttunen et al 2010 ennajeh et al 2010 reported a drought tolerant olive cultivar that increased spongy parenchyma and upper palisade by 22 and 17 respectively under drought moreover the stomatal and trichome densities increased which improved co2 uptake and increased the thickness of the lower and upper epidermis by 25 and 32 respectively bañon et al 2004 investigated anatomical and morphological manipulations in lotus lotus creticus l leaves adaptations to water stress included osmotic adjustment reduced leaf area and more leaf hairs han et al 2016 identified significant positive correlations between photosynthetic rate and both mesophyll conductance and wue in cotton gossypium hirsutum l under drought pretreatment which was stronger than the association between stomatal conductance and these traits despite of all the mechanism discussed above timing of the day also has impact on leaf morphology anatomy and finally canopy structure for example in summer plants have fully expanded leaves and do not show any symptoms of wilting but as temperature and sunshine increases leaves become rolled incept minimum light and reduce transpiration anyia and herzog 2004 tardieu et al 2018 likewise water stress at different stages impact water relations differently chaves et al 2009 fereres and soriano 2006 tardieu et al 2018 reported rapid fluctuation of water potential up to 1 mpa of a diurnal plant for one hour they reported that during summer plant can feel normal in the morning due to lower temperature and same plant can feel water stressed at noon due to excessive transpiration to compensate high temperature in conclusion leaf morphology physiology and anatomy play an important role in plant water use and transpirational efficiency and must be considered when developing drought tolerant and water use efficient cultivars 2 3 root architecture and anatomy the first organ developed from the plant embryo is the radicle which develops into roots roots uptake water and nutrients for shoot growth and development root traits such as deep roots high root density wide xylem diameters and long root hairs may enhance water and nutrient uptake siddique et al 2015 factors that influence root growth development architecture and anatomy include plant stress soil structure soil fertility symbiotic relationship with microbes hormonal balance water availability and the genetic architecture of the plant sharp 2002 giuliani et al 2005 lópez bucio et al 2005 yang et al 2009 rolli et al 2015 tron et al 2015 gao and lynch 2016 alvarez flores et al 2018 colombi et al 2018 root architecture and anatomy are important in major crops as they are directly related to water and nutrient uptake root development is sensitive to water availability but it is regulated by hormones root architecture and its spatial distribution in the soil are associated with root length and branching bramley et al 2013 abscisic acid aba accumulates in roots in response to water stress and affects root development sharp 2002 alvarez flores et al 2018 giuliani et al 2005 developed near isogenic hybrids of maize through backcross derived lines and investigated the role of leaf aba qtls on stomatal conductance and root architecture the study concluded that leaf aba qtls affect root architecture due to their pleiotropic effect on root architecture later a model was developed that proposed a direct effect of leaf aba qtls on root architecture giuliani et al 2005 genotypes differ in their localization of root biomass at different depths under water and nutrient stress conditions tolerant genotypes produce deeper and more vigorous roots in the search for water and nutrients ho et al 2005 investigated the localization of root biomass in common beans phaseolus vulgaris l under phosphorus p deficiency and water stress conditions and reported a tradeoff in root architecture for p and water acquisition lópez bucio et al 2005 investigated the regulatory mechanism involved in altering root development of arabidopsis in response to p availability and reported that the big gene and auxin transport play a role in pericycle cell activation to form lateral root primordia that further promote root hair elongation in the direction of p availability a similar mechanism may be involved in root development in response to soil moisture availability manschadi et al 2006 studied root architectural traits in the adaptation of wheat to water limited conditions using a drought tolerant and drought susceptible genotype the tolerant genotype developed a compact vertical root system allowing it to extract less water during early growth stages but more as the crop matured while the susceptible cultivar produced roots to the same depth as the tolerant one most of its root biomass remained closer to the soil surface which limited water uptake during later stages of growth as the surface soil dried similarly gao and lynch 2016 reported deeper roots with higher water acquisition which was associated with fewer crown roots aziz et al 2016 reported that improvements in wheat yield over five decades were correlated with root length density not root length or root biomass alvarez flores et al 2018 investigated the plasticity of quinoa chenopodium quinoa willd in dry and wet soils and reported that drier soil accelerated tap root growth more than wet soil to enable water uptake at depth tron et al 2015 modeled the transpiration of 48 root architecture types under 16 drought scenarios and different soil structures and textures they reported that root architecture did not fully explain plant water use and suggested relating specific root architecture with genotype soil hydrological and other characteristics along with root architectural changes in response to water availability knowledge of root anatomical characteristics is important changes in anatomical traits in genotypes exposed to wet and dry soils lead to efficient water use under optimal and water limited conditions xylem tissue is directly linked to water uptake therefore its importance cannot be denied the amount and diameter of xylem tissue are responsive to the external environment in rice xylem diameter decreased in response to drought to avoid cavitation henry et al 2012 tree root biomass is distributed both in the shallow and deep soil zones where shallow roots have smaller xylem diameters due to the higher chance of water stress and deeper roots have larger xylem diameters due to the increased availability of water at depth mcelrone et al 2004 the variation in xylem vessels in response to drought could be used as a selection criterion for breeding drought tolerance jaramillo et al 2013 reported an association between root respiration and root cortical aerenchyma rca and living cortical area lca lca declined with drought tolerance due to axial root growth and root segment respiration water stress can induce rca which increase water uptake by reducing the metabolic cost of soil exploration and improve yield jaramillo et al 2013 lynch et al 2014 root cortical senescence rcs is another root trait associated with soil moisture regulation causing cell death in relatively older roots wenzel and mccully 1991 like rca rcs save metabolic energy and increase the radial conductivity of nutrients and water as the outer layer of the endodermis has been lost lynch et al 2014 root hydraulic properties are also important when selecting genotypes for higher te hydraulic conductance determines which regions of the root take up water and nutrients for example in cereals only the root tips are involved in water and nutrient uptake whereas the whole root is involved in legumes bramley et al 2009 hence total root length is important in legumes whereas root branching is important in cereals in conclusion the manipulation of root architecture and anatomy could contribute to water stress tolerance due to improved water and nutrient uptake from the soil as water use and wue are inversely proportional therefore less water use will lead to higher wue 2 4 osmoregulation and maintenance of tissue water status osmoregulation is the dynamic regulation of water use by the plant for transpiration and other functions to prevent plant fluids from becoming too dilute or too thick xylem plays a key role in the uptake of water from the soil to fulfill the needs of transpiration xylem is the main channel of water to all parts of the plant from the soil xylem water interactions play an important role in regulating plant water use the xylem and phloem work together and their interaction under water stress impacts plant performance savage et al 2016 studies on xylem phloem interactions have shown that xylem acts as a water reservoir for phloem jyske and hölttä 2015 pfautsch et al 2015 savage et al 2016 however under water stress when xylem does not extract enough water from the soil phloem tissue acts as a water reservoir for xylem to sustain plant growth savage et al 2016 similarly sevanto 2018 reported that the response of phloem is critical for plant survival under water stress secchi et al 2017 demonstrated that xylem parenchyma cells also known as vessel associated cells are involved in the regulation of xylem transport and tracheid functionality during stress and the subsequent recovery xylem and phloem keep the water balance outside cells the internal cell water balance is maintained by vacuoles that transport potassium ions k into and out of the vacuole through the membrane tonoplast the concentration of organic solutes especially proline glycine betaine and glycerol plays an important role in osmoregulation and the maintenance of turgor pressure and water potential in tissues proline is an excellent osmolyte but under osmotic stress it maintains cell water status by preventing cell electrolyte leakage and oxidative bursts through membrane stabilization and keeping the concentration of reactive oxygen species in a normal range slama et al 2015 proline also triggers the modulation of mitochondrial function activation of stress responsive genes and regulation of cellular redox reactions szabados and savoure 2010 liang et al 2013 but high concentrations can be toxic verbruggen et al 2008 increasing osmolyte accumulation in plant tissues by introducing new genes and exogenous application is a vital strategy to cope with drought stress slama et al 2015 the concentration of certain ions across the cell membrane and in intercellular spaces regulates cellular homeostasis when exposed to stress abscisic acid is normally produced in shoots and roots in response to osmotic stress and induces a series of signaling cascades blum 2011 osakabe et al 2014 to maintain internal osmotic pressure an increase in aba concentration slows plant metabolic processes by reducing leaf gas exchange due to stomatal closure osakabe et al 2014 thus plants maintain their water status at the cost of their growth pang et al 2017a investigated the response of chickpea cicer arietinum l to terminal drought and identified that aba produced during terminal drought affects seed set either directly by the abortion of developing seeds pods or indirectly by reducing photosynthesis through stomatal closure and reducing assimilate supply to reproductive parts stomatal closure related to aba is further associated with k transporters nhx1 nhx2 tpk1 localized in the tonoplast where the release of k from the vacuole leads to stomatal closure ward and schroeder 1994 barragán et al 2012 isner et al 2018 barragán et al 2012 identified two na h exchangers nhx1 and nhx2 in the regulation of k uptake through the tonoplast for stomatal and turgor regulation in a recent study isner et al 2018 reported that stomatal closure in response to stress mainly depends on k release by the vacuole into the cytoplasm and vacuolar k efflux which is mediated by negative potential of the tonoplast that extrudes it from the vacuole this leads to the release of salt to the guard cell which loses turgor and stomatal closure reduced leaf water potential has a primary role in osmoregulation and maintenance of plant tissue water status blum 2011 under water stress aba is produced in shoot and root tissue and starts ionic regulation of water status at cell and tissue levels therefore it is a combination of osmotic stress hormonal metabolism and ionic regulation that maintains plant water status at the cost of plant growth and leads to osmoregulation nonetheless osmoregulation at the cost of plant growth is acceptable under dry environments to make the crops drought tolerant and water use efficient even with less yield 2 5 water use efficiency and crop yield wue and crop yield always go side by side for the crop researcher but relationship between the two has not been properly cleared although wue has positive correlation with yield but increase in wue does not always correspond to increase in the yield wue is normally measured as ratio of crop water used applied irrigation water and crop yield values of wue are often higher under drought water stress condition than under normal irrigation conditions ul allah et al 2015 reported the higher wues of forage crops for dry matter yield and protein yield under water stress condition but corresponding yields were higher under normal irrigation conditions likewise similar findings were reported for grain yield of wheat ul allah et al 2018 kang et al 2000 reported improvement in wue with regular deficit irrigation but yield was higher with regular irrigation in all abovementioned studies the researcher used flooded irrigation where a lot of water lost due to leaching and soil evaporation resulting in lower wues while in case of water stress alternative irrigation was missed which resulted in lower yield but relative higher wue application of nutrients under constant water supply lead to higher wues alkhader and rayyan 2013 chongtham et al 2015 ul allah et al 2018 where higher wues attributed to higher yield in response to crop nutrition growth stage of the crop and the timing of the day also affects wues and its impact on yield as discussed earlier a plant may not feel stress at summer morning but can feel severe stress at noon due to high transpirational requirements anyia and herzog 2004 tardieu et al 2018 similarly a plant can withstand drought stress at vegetative stage due to the regulation of transpiration and reduced growth but cannot develop seed due to pollen mortality and abortion of reproductive organs smith and zhao 2016 turc and tardieu 2018 therefore it is very critical to analyze the response of water deficit at different growth stages as severe water stress at reproductive phase may be lethal for grain crops under such situations cultivars with more wue at reproductive stages may result in higher yields although wue is related to the yield but it does never mean that higher water use efficient genotypes can produce higher yields in actual genotypes with higher wue reduce transpiration and crop water use and thus perform well under water deficit conditions but does not improve crop yield blum 2009 introduced the term effective use of water to produce more with a drop of water by reducing non transpirational losses instead of wue where plant reduce water use he also demonstrated that selection for higher wue lead to lower crop yields in crux higher wue is important only when there is need of balanced crop water use under limited water reserves on the cost of yield yield is directly related with transpiration i e higher transpiration leads to higher co2 assimilation blum 2009 but wue efficiency is inversely proportional to water use which results in less yield under normal irrigation different physiological and morphological attributes of improved wue are presented in fig 1 3 management strategies for improving water use efficiency water use is crucial for any crop especially under the current climate change scenario where freshwater resources are endangered and future crop production and food security are becoming a challenge for agricultural scientists in this situation crops with higher wue will be the only viable option there are many management options including crop improvement and selection adjustment of the planting calendar and seeding rates and proper irrigation nutrient and weed management which can be used to improve crop wue xu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2017a ma et al 2018 tables 1 3 fig 2 these strategies are briefly described below 3 1 crop improvement and crop selection improvement in wue is vital in all regions and under all climatic conditions to save water for future generations but it is more crucial in semi arid areas where sustainability is compromised with supplementary irrigation genetic improvement of crops for enhanced wue is a sustainable approach that requires nothing but seed after a genotype has been developed in various crops plant breeders have developed and selected crop varieties with improved wue based on both economic yield and co2 fixation krupnik et al 2012 saradadevi et al 2014 ul allah et al 2018 significant genetic variation exists among crops or within genotypes of the same crop for wue which is needed to tailor more water efficient genotypes for example medium spike cultivar jm22 had 4 2 9 3 higher wue than large wm8 and small hs4399 spike cultivars of wheat mainly due to better post anthesis biomass accretion and more water mining from deeper soil wang et al 2016 saradadevi et al 2014 2017a 2017b reported the differential ability of wheat genotypes to produce aba under drought and described the exploitation of genotypic differences in aba production for the management of drought stress and improved wue pang et al 2017b reported that chickpea genotypes with lower transpiration during early phases of drought stress and higher transpiration during later stages of development tend to be drought tolerant and have higher wues than other genotypes with similar transpiration rates during the entire water stress turner et al 2001 2005 identified morphological physiological and biochemical traits related to high yields under water stress and proposed the selection of chickpea genotypes based on those traits for maximum wue various breeding techniques are being used to genetically improve field crops for higher wue including trait identification evaluation and selection of genotypes and the use of wild relatives to incorporate new genes for improved wue wang et al 2016 2017b pour aboughadareh et al 2017 ul allah et al 2018 ul allah et al 2018 compared 20 bread wheat genotypes for wue based on yield and applied irrigation water the wue ranged from 1 15 to 1 40 kg grain yield m 3 of water applied which improved in all genotypes under water stress dingkuhn et al 1991 compared 28 contrasting rice genotypes for carbon isotope discrimination and wue variation in both traits was observedwith a strong negative correlation between carbon isotope discrimination and wue the authors suggested using carbon isotope discrimination to select crop genotypes with higher wue liu et al 2016 compared a drought tolerant and drought susceptible genotype for physiological traits associated with high wue mild water stress improved wue in both genotypes more so in the tolerant genotype the drought tolerant genotype had a relatively stable net photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance and transpiration rate under water stress resulting in a higher wue bota et al 2016 reported variation in grapevine genotypes for carbon isotope discrimination photosynthetic rate leaf level wue and stomatal conductance the drought tolerant genotypes had higher photosynthetic rates coupled with lower stomatal conductance resulting in a high wue saranga et al 1998 also reported photosynthetic rate and carbon isotope ratio as a tool for selecting cotton genotypes with higher wue wild relatives of field crops are usually well adapted to climatic conditions and have biotic and abiotic stress tolerant traits traits related to higher wue could be introduced to cultivated genotypes using interspecific breeding mihoub et al 2017 investigated two algerian wild species of safflower carthamus strictus and c chouletteanus for different traits the authors reported higher wue values in c chouletteanus and suggested using this species as a source of genes for higher wue in cultivated safflower saranga et al 1998 reported that american cotton gossypium hirsutum l had a higher wue than egyptian cotton gossypium barbadense l they showed that by interspecific hybridization higher wue could be obtained nevo and chen 2010 reported the potential of ovate goatgrass aegilops geniculate roth for improving drought and heat tolerance in cultivated wheat and the potential of emmer wheat triticum dicoccoides schrank and wild barley hordeum spontaneum l for improving drought tolerance and wue in both emmer wheat and wild barley crop wild relatives are becoming more important especially for tolerant traits but their contribution to developing new cultivars has been low in the future as genetic resources of cultivated crops are narrowed down wild relatives will become a major source of variability for drought and wue traits and their contribution to the development of new cultivars will increase 3 2 planting calendar site specific manipulation of sowing time of any crop under the best growing conditions is an important agronomic strategy to improve crop wue numerous studies conducted in different parts of the world under a variety of growing conditions with various crops have identified that crop wue can improve when planted at the appropriate time table 1 early sown crops generally have a higher wue than late sown crops due to their longer life cycle table 1 agronomists recommend specific sowing times in each geographical location for maximum crop output the planting calendar of any cropping system must be primarily based on wue to produce the maximum output from each drop of water and to save water for future generations late sowing is not solely responsible for reductions in yield and wue the crop type and environmental conditions impact the decision on whether to sow early or late feyzbakhsh et al 2015 investigated the effect of soil water management and sowing dates on wue in maize under semi arid conditions late sown maize had better grain yield and wue than early sown maize however in this case late sown maize took longer to reach maturity than early sown maize regan et al 1997 reported that very early maturing genotypes of wheat use less water pre anthesis and save water for the reproductive phase which improved grain yield and wue similar findings were reported by mwanamwenge et al 1998 for faba bean in a mediterranean type environment siddique et al 1990 conducted a study in western australia using old and new wheat cultivars and reported higher wue in modern cultivars than old cultivars due to differential water use patterns the old cultivars used more water pre anthesis while modern cultivars used less water during early growth and more water post anthesis meshram 2014 reported that short duration rice cultivars had higher wue when sown late while the medium to long duration cultivars had higher wue when sown early late sown wheat at a high seeding rate had a higher wue 2 07 kg m 3 than early sown wheat 1 83 kg m 3 which was credited to the shorter vegetative stage and lower pre anthesis et the late sown wheat also had a higher photosynthetic rate during grain filling than the early sown wheat due to more soil water availability that leads to a higher wue hence late sowing with a high seeding rate can maximize wue in wheat wang et al 2017b newly developed genotypes should be evaluated under late and early sowing for maximum output and optimal sowing time with minimal water use this will lead to save the water which can be used for other parallel crops or next crops furthermore economic value of wue must be kept in mind as under unlimited water availability crops having more water use may be more economical than the crops having more wue in developing new genotypes optimum sowing time and plant populations should be evaluated along with other traits 3 3 seeding rate and planting geometry seeding rate and planting geometry are important for improving water and nutrient use efficiencies in all crops if the plant population is more than optimal then competition for space water and nutrients will not allow plants to reach their potential similarly if the plant population is less than optimal then there will be free space which is not used by the plants and production per unit area will decrease planting geometry is more important for water use water is used more efficiently with furrow and bed sowing than flat sowing an increased seeding rate substantially reduced wue in wheat due to elevated soil water depletion higher et and more infertile tillers ma et al 2018 under water limited conditions a higher seeding rate reduced wue in wheat due to more et losses and correspondingly reduced yield hu et al 2018 similarly mahmood et al 2002 reported higher wue in wheat sown at 125 kg ha 1 than at 100 and 150 kg ha 1 however when sowing was delayed wue in wheat increased with increasing seeding rate wang et al 2017b planting pattern geometry has a direct effect on crop growth and development due to its impact on solar energy capture root growth water saving and shading effects which reduce evaporation for instance the wue of wheat sown on raised beds was 54 4 higher than wheat sown on a flat surface due to 50 7 less water being consumed soomro et al 2017 similarly hussain et al 2010 reported a higher wue in ridge sown sunflower helianthus annuus l compared with flat surface sowing in another study chickpea sown on furrow irrigated raised beds 75 cm wide had higher wue than chickpea sown on a flatbed which was linked to water saving of up to 33 3 in the raised bed crop kumar et al 2015 ridge sown maize also recorded higher wue than that sown on a flat surface which was primarily due to the well developed root system deep roots with more lateral root proliferation of the ridge sown crop that could explore more soil volume to uptake water khan et al 2012 a ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system improved wue and riwue rainfall irrigation wue with 200 mm simulated precipitation and 150 mm deficit irrigation due to notable improvements in soil water storage at 0 200 cm depth coupled with reduced et in the field and higher grain filling rate in wheat ali et al 2017 in conclusion seeding rate and planting geometry are basic agronomic management strategies to improve water and nutrient use efficiencies and enable crops to reach their potential under optimal plant populations and proper planting patterns 3 4 water management under the climate change scenario freshwater resources are endangered and there is strong competition for water use between agriculture and other industries judicious use of water is required various water management strategies have been proposed by agricultural scientists for the efficient use of applied water evans and sadler 2008 ram et al 2013 chai et al 2014 jha et al 2016 crop wue could be improved by limiting the current frequent irrigations ram et al 2013 chai et al 2014 in a three year study ram et al 2013 observed higher wue in wheat with only two irrigations at crown root initiation and booting and rice straw mulching at 6 t ha 1 increasing the irrigations from two to six resulted in a gradual decline in wue under various mulch treatments which might be due to less biomass partitioning to grain at higher irrigations similarly maurya and singh 2008 reported higher wue in wheat with more frequent irrigation and lower grain yields with the rise in et in another three year field study the wue after one irrigation 75 mm at jointing was 7 5 higher than after two irrigations 75 mm each at jointing and anthesis in three late sown winter wheat cultivars in the north china plain wang et al 2016 in another study winter wheat sown with one irrigation had higher wue than wheat with three irrigations xu et al 2016 the limited irrigation encouraged roots to explore deeper soil layers which increased water uptake but reduced leaf expansion and transpiration and had a small negative effect on grain yield xu et al 2016 irrigating crops at critical growth stages is another way to improve wue mwanamwenge et al 1999 li et al 2010 for instance frequent irrigations at 75 asw depletion produced a much lower wue in field grown wheat and barley than irrigating only at critical growth stages the yield increase with more frequent irrigations did not equate to the extra water use singh and kumar 1981 application of 120 mm in one irrigation at jointing or three irrigations at jointing heading and milking stages 40 mm each produced lower wue in winter wheat than two irrigations at jointing and heading 60 mm each li et al 2010 the use of modern gps based irrigation techniques such as automated sprinklers and high efficiency drip irrigation systems enables farmers to use water more efficiently by applying small quantities of water in accordance with soil and crop needs evans and sadler 2008 in a recent study conducted at three sites in nepal drip irrigation of two fodder crops teosinte euchlaena mexicana schrad and cowpea vigna unguiculata l walp produced 3 99 times higher wue than furrow irrigation which was primarily linked to lower soil percolation and evaporation losses as drip irrigation used 73 less water than furrow irrigation jha et al 2016 however kanani et al 2016 reported higher iwue and wue in corn with a buried porous clay capsule irrigation system than the surface drip and subsurface drip irrigation systems in semi arid regions similarly a raised bed furrow irrigation system recorded 54 4 higher wue in wheat than a conventional check basin irrigation system because it consumed 50 7 less water soomro et al 2017 conventionally flooded transplanted rice and full irrigation systems are less efficient for water use than deficit irrigation systems the adoption of alternate wetting and drying and aerobic production systems in rice re evaluation of existing irrigation systems with a range of deficit irrigation systems and the use of modern irrigation techniques such as high efficiency drip irrigation systems are needed to maximize wue 3 5 soil fertility management soil fertility management is an important factor influencing wue in field crops to achieve maximum yields from every drop of applied water the soil must be enriched with balanced macro and micronutrients fertilizer application improved the irrigation wue in irrigated and water stressed soils but the effect was more prominent under water limited conditions ul allah et al 2015 several studies have reported increases in wue in a variety of crops including wheat rice maize potato solanum tuberosum l chickpea and mungbean vigna radiata l after application of macro and micronutrients under optimal and less than optimal water conditions table 2 potassium and zn are known to ameliorate drought effects and improve wue in normal and water stressed conditions khan et al 2003 cakmak 2005 hussain et al 2018 martineau et al 2017 investigated the role of k nutrition for improving wue in maize in a large scale experiment under three levels of k low normal and high and two water supplies control and water balance model based on 30 deficit potassium supply at optimum rates improved maize tolerance to drought which was attributed to better wue 30 higher with k application due to lower leaf evapotranspiration potassium also causes leaf rolling which reduces et and ultimately saves water martineau et al 2017 in a two year field study under rainfed conditions in west africa k application in k deficient soils enhanced wue and radiation use efficiency by 36 41 in cassava ezui et al 2016 however the best response occurred with k application during the vegetative stage of cassava growth suggesting that the timely application of required nutrients and planting to make the best use of rainfall will achieve higher yields ezui et al 2016 similarly alkhader and rayyan 2013 reported significant increases in fresh biomass and wue with higher levels of applied p in lettuce lactuca sativa l in three growing seasons high rates of n application to high yielding rice increased wue in conventionally flooded cf and awd rice more so in cf rice zhang et al 2012 in a three year field study under dryland farming sensitive and drought tolerant wheat cultivars had higher wue in the two dry years as n levels increased to 180 kg ha 1 above this the effect was non significant due to more water absorption from deeper soil layers in the wet year the effects of n application were not significant zhong and shangguan 2014 nitrogen application at 90 kg n ha 1 improved wue in wheat and barley due to a sizeable increase in grain yield with minimal increase in water use additional water was extracted from deeper soil layers 60 90 cm in wheat and 31 120 cm in barley due to increased root development in response to applied n singh and kumar 1981 in conclusion wue is not only dependent on transpiration but also depends on co2 assimilation which in turn is dependent on nutrient availability thus application of both micro and macronutrients help to increase wue in most crops grown under well watered and water limited environments 3 6 mulching for reduced soil evaporation much of the applied water to soil is wasted due to evaporation instead of being used for crop growth which lowers the crop wue various management practices can be used to control evaporation including split applications of water drip irrigation and mulching mulching is the most economical and efficient method for controlling water losses due to evaporation and increasing the wue of arable crops for instance rice straw mulching improved wue by 10 in winter wheat by reducing soil evaporation in the top 40 mm of soil zhang and oweis 1999 in a three year field study in northwest india different levels of rice straw mulch improved wheat wue by 14 7 34 2 compared with no mulch under various irrigation regimes the improvement in wue was more evident with limited irrigation treatments primarily due to reduced soil temperature and weed infestation ram et al 2013 in a two year field study in a rainfed environment application of wheat straw mulch at 6 and 12 t ha 1 improved soil moisture contents at 20 80 cm soil depth in both years and enhanced wue in chaoshi1 a compact type maize cultivar in the second year but had no effect on danyu86 a flat type maize cultivar shen et al 2012 they further reported improvement in soil moisture contents of 20 60 deep soil with mulching during anthesis silking period but at maturity soil moisture contents were same ass non mulched ram et al 2013 reported saving of up to 29 mm of water with straw mulching in wheat saving of water by the mulching may be attributed to less light interception to the ground resulting in less temperature of the soil ram et al 2013 and ultimately less soil evaporation therefore mulching may be more effective during summer than winter thus under irrigated and rainfed conditions mulching in inter row spaces and on bare spaces of soil can reduce water losses and weed infestations which will ultimately improve crop yield and wue 3 7 weed management weeds are unwanted plants that compete with crops for space nutrients and water which can ultimately result in huge losses in crop yield and wue table 3 controlling weeds will increase yields due to increased water and resource use efficiencies subramanyam et al 2007 chauhan et al 2015b reported 54 614 higher yields with weed control however weed control is challenging due to fast infestation and genetic diversity weeds have a clear advantage over crops because they can uptake more water at depth abouziena et al 2014 moreover weeds use more water than crop plants to produce one unit of biomass for instance one pound of dry biomass of common lambsquarters chenopodium album l required 658 pounds of water compared with 557 and 349 pounds of water for wheat and corn plants respectively parker 2003 weed scientists have proposed various weed control strategies in various crops a sustainable method to control weeds is biological control blubaugh et al 2016 weed et al 2018 weed et al 2018 analyzed nine years of data based on citizen monitoring and reported a decline in broadleaf toadflax dalmatian toadflax l mill invasive weed with the release of mecinus janthiniformis a stem mining weevil but proposed other weed management methods to be used alongside biological control for more efficient results blubaugh et al 2016 observed that cover crops increased the population of omnivores the natural enemy of weeds which reduced the weed seeds by 73 the use of allelochemicals present in plants or crops to control weeds is an ecological method for integrated weed management in a sustainable way farooq et al 2011 głąb et al 2017 rawat et al 2017 manual weed control is also ecological and beneficial keller et al 2014 but requires a large labor force and is not applicable to large areas an alternative to manual weed control is mechanical weed control where tractor mounted instruments are mostly used in row sown crops the most efficient way to control weeds is by using chemicals but it has detrimental effects on the environment increases in wue 12 91 5 in different crops by managing weeds with pre and post emergence herbicides and hand weeding under a variety of growing conditions are given in table 3 in conclusion the best way to control weeds sustainably is the integrated use of weed management practices chauhan et al 2015a malarkodi 2015 proper weed management irrespective of the method used helps to improve wue in all arable crops under a variety of growing conditions 3 8 economic feasibility management to improve wue is very important for better production especially in water limited areas for better profitability economic feasibility of the management practice is also very important all management strategies may not be feasible in all areas and all the management strategies are not economical when used together crop improvement through breeding is a sustainable way to produce more water use efficient crops as after the development of a variety it does not cost anything in the field except seed wise use of planting calendar improves water use efficiency and crop production in water limited areas and results in higher benefits taheripour et al 2016 investigated the economic impact of improvement in wue in south asian countries and reported that in india sri lanka and bangladesh up to 40 improvement in wue is economically viable and in nepal it is beneficial only up to 20 in pakistan and other south asian countries they reported that improvement in wue is beneficial only up to 30 and after that economic gain started to decline as after this particular increase in wue cost of management increased that yield benefits the different rages of economical viable wue improvement may corresponds to different capital cost of different countries some management strategies do not cost or cost only small labor for example on farm water management by alternate irrigations ul allah et al 2015 2018 alternate furrow irrigation abd el halim 2013 etc but improve the economical impact abd el halim 2013 used different irrigation techniques to improve the wue and reported alternate furrow irrigation most economical viable as befit cost ratio of this technique was observed as 1 6 sometimes yield is also reduced in response to improvement in wue ul allah et al 2015 2018 in this situation benefit cost ratio must be considered to have maximum economic impact economic feasibility of any management strategies depends on the cost of operations and respective increase in yield in response to specific operation therefore management strategies should be adopted carefully to have maximum cost benefits 4 conclusions and future research needs under the climate change scenario the availability of sufficient water for crop production is becoming a problem and it is time to improve the wue of crops by agronomic or genetic means water efficient genotypes can be tailored based on well suited canopy size and orientation leaf morphology orientation and anatomy and root architecture to improve wue for instance a small leaf canopy with a deep root system in limited irrigation environments can reduce evapotranspiration losses and improve wue the major objective of any agriculture based research should be maximum production per drop of water applied agronomic management techniques to improve wue include adjusting the planting calendar according to water availability at critical crop growth stages controlling weeds that use considerable water soil fertility management mulching interplant spaces in crops to control evaporation and on farm water management to save water for future generations and increase crop production by using less water water use efficient crops varieties are needed along with integrated management techniques economic impacts must be considered before adopting any technique to improve wue 
11037,water is the lifeline for crop production worldwide however the changing climate is causing erratic rains and frequent episodes of drought and a continuous decline in freshwater resources this situation requires strategies for water efficient crop production wise use of water in crop production and improved crop water use efficiency may help to produce more crop per drop this review discusses physiological and agronomic considerations for improving water use efficiency in crop plants which primarily depend on canopy size leaf morphology leaf and shoot anatomy root architecture water uptake capacity and maintenance of tissue water status developing genotypes with improved water productivity and modified planting times seeding rates and planting geometries will improve water use efficiency in crop plants improved irrigation scheduling use of high efficiency irrigation systems better soil fertility management and mulching to reduce soil evaporation and manage weeds should further improve crop water use efficiency in the field research and development gaps for increasing our understanding of the physiological responses of plants to water supply using novel approaches linked to environmental physiology are also explored keywords nutrient management planting time root architecture weed management 1 introduction with the increasing population comes an increased demand for food and feed but the threats of climate change are challenging crop production crop intensification to produce more food fiber and feed needs more water but water resources are limited elliott et al 2014 compared 10 global hydrological models and six global gridded crop models for water demand and supply and reported that by the end of century limited freshwater availability could revert 20 60 mha of irrigated croplands to rainfed croplands which may result in losses of 600 2900 pcal 1012 kcal of food production in the western united states china and west south and central asia in a study on the effect of climate change on asian water resources immerzeel et al 2010 projected that reduced water flow in the brahmaputra and indus basins would create food security issues for more than 60 million people new strategies to manage water resources particularly the wise use of water for crop production are crucial for moving forward under water deficit conditions reductions in crop growth and productivity are attributed to slow physiological processes which in turn slow down growth processes key physiological and morphological processes that are more sensitive to water stress need to be identified so that alternatives can be developed to manage those processes changes in root behavior under water stress also need to be investigated aroca et al 2011 kato and okami 2010 studied the root dynamics of rice oryza sativa l under flooded and aerobic conditions under flooded conditions root biomass tended to accumulate in the upper soil layer and was significantly less than that of aerobically grown rice which collects more water from relatively deeper soils bengough et al 2011 reported the importance of root hairs and other root tip traits to maintain water relations under water stress therefore it is important to understand the physiological behavior of plants especially roots and leaves to manage water use in stress conditions water use efficiency wue is an important attribute that describes the efficiency of crop plants to use available water for carbon fixation bramley et al 2013 defined it as a ratio of above ground biomass or economic yield to the evapotranspiration or total water use by the crop here evapotranspiration or water use is denominator which means that decreasing the transpiration water use will increase the wue blum 2009 analyzed and reported that under well water conditions improvement in wue will lead to reduced yield as the cultivars with higher wue will have less transpiration water use which results in less co2 assimilation therefore wue better related to the drought tolerance as under limited water conditions water use efficient crops genotypes cope with stress and produce better that the crops genotypes which are not water use efficient it is noteworthy not to mix the terms wue transpirational efficiency and drought tolerance as wue deals evapotranspiration transpirational efficiency deals with only water use by transpiration and drought tolerance deals with the avoidance of water stress by any physiological or phenological mean future agriculture is threatened by drought and heat stress in the current climate scenario where increased wue of crops is vital for sustainable production scientists use various techniques ranging from agronomic to genetic and transgenic to improve crop wue blum 2009 suggested improving transpirational efficiency in well watered areas and wue in dryland areas to improve crop productivity there are substantial opportunities to improve wue using different irrigation and soil water management techniques blum 2009 molden et al 2010 many researchers have reported the use of deficit irrigation and nutrient management ul allah et al 2018 to improve wue and water productivity in different agro climatic regions du et al 2010 fang et al 2010 2017 the literature has investigated plant water use wue water productivity and the effect of water scarcity on crop growth and physiology blum 2009 du et al 2010 fang et al 2010 kato and okami 2010 sade et al 2010 ul allah et al 2015 hussain et al 2018 but these studies have focused on limited aspects studies that comprehensively describe how to improve crop wue especially in relation to climate change are rare furthermore relationship of wue and the crop yield under different conditions and the economic impact of wue improvement have often been ignored in the discussion of wue which have been covered in this review in the climate change scenario changes are expected in plant anatomy and physiology therefore this review assessed the role of the crop canopy leaf morphology and anatomy and root architecture for tailoring water efficient crops moreover different management options including re evaluating the crop calendar seeding rate planting geometry and better nutrient weed and water management to improve the wue of crops in well watered and water limited conditions are also discussed 2 physiology of plant water use 2 1 plant canopy size plant density and crop canopy size should be optimized to maximize the economic yield of crops the crop canopy is also important for plant water use a dense canopy will shade the soil surface reduce evapotranspiration and soil temperature and hence control soil evaporation canopy architecture is important for light interception and its penetration into the soil light can penetrate and reflect from more leaves in erectophile canopies where leaves are erect than planophile canopies with horizontal leaves wang et al 2009 bramley et al 2013 soil evaporation is higher during early crop growth as light can easily penetrate the soil and increase soil temperature soil evaporation declines later in the season when the canopy has developed and less light can penetrate the soil thus early vigor traits such as early canopy development will reduce soil evaporation and increase wue determinate and indeterminate plants differ in their canopy development indeterminate non tillering plants such as faba bean vicia faba l rely on leaf weight and number while determinate tillering plants are regulated by stem number per unit area stützel and aufhammer 1991 kholová et al 2014 investigated the effect of plant water use on stay green characteristics in sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench cultivated in the post rainy season the smaller canopy size improved grain yield under severe drought but compromised stover yield under mild drought borrell et al 2014b studied the role of stay green alleles in modifying canopy size in sorghum under drought stress and reported that stay green alleles conferred adaptation to terminal drought by reducing pre anthesis canopy size to save soil moisture for post anthesis grain development borrell et al 2014a reported that stay green alleles modified canopy size by 1 reducing tiller number and enhancing lower leaf size 2 reducing upper leaf area and 3 decreasing leaf number on the main culm in a simulation study of historical maize zea mays l yield events hammer et al 2009 reported that root system architecture had influenced wue more than canopy architecture but according to borrell et al 2014a canopy development is related to root architecture so also impacts crop water use a small leaf canopy and deep root system in limited irrigation treatments reduced evapotranspiration loss and improved wue when compared with well watered conditions xu et al 2016 reduction in canopy size reduce the water demand for transpiration which reduces plant water use during vegetative growth and saves soil moisture for grain filling an effective use of water and the key to improving yields in drought prone regions blum 2009 moreover sinclair 2018 simulated different transpiration efficiency te traits and other water use traits such as water vapor deficit and stomatal closure he stated that te has less scope for improvement than the wue while vapor pressure deficit is an environmental variable that has a direct impact on te and other water use traits therefore he stressed to improve effective water use of the plant instead of mere te in conclusion canopy development is directly related with water use as evaporation is a just loss of water and transpiration is directly related with co2 fixation therefore early canopy development is beneficial as it reduces the soil evaporation but transpiration will be more under water limited conditions moderate or smaller canopies may be desired to reduce water use and to improve wue 2 2 leaf morphology and anatomy leaves are the food factory of plants and play a central role in water and nutrient use and co2 fixation leaf orientation leaf angle leaf morphology leaf structure and the orientation of internal leaf tissues are important traits for leaf water use and thus crop wue cereals can be screened on leaf angle for better performance under water deficit semi erect leaves have greater transpirational water requirements than droopy leaves erect leaves have better wue than droopy or semi erect leaves saadalla 2008 bogale et al 2011 lonbani and arzani 2011 yang et al 2016 araus et al 1993 studied genetic variation in the leaf posture of wheat triticum aestivum l and its relationship with water use and yield related traits the authors reported that erect leaves had higher transpiration rates stomatal conductance and carbon isotope discrimination and lower wue than droopy leaves however cultivars with erect leaves had higher grain yields than those from droopy leaves due to the positive impact of erect leaves on other yield related traits both erect and droopy leaves are positively correlated with some yield related traits and negatively correlated with others therefore selecting an intermediate genotype could maximize wue for example a genotype with erect pre flag leaves that ensure maximum light penetration to the ground along with more fertile tillers per unit area and terminal droopy flag leaves that intercept maximum light during later growth when older leaves start to dry off should improve wue medrano et al 2015 investigated the effects of leaf position on wue in grape wines and reported that eastern leaves have higher wue which decreases from bottom to top and western leaves have lower wue relative to the eastern side which increases from bottom to top plant physiological processes such as transpiration osmotic potential turgor potential and photosynthesis are closely related to water availability limited water availability will greatly affect these processes which will vary from genotype to genotype and species to species leaf gas exchange characteristics play an important role in the manipulation of water use anyia and herzog 2004 sade et al 2010 reported higher wue in tobacco nicotiana tabacum l plants under drought due to stress induced aquaporin1 that regulates plant physiological processes such as stomatal conductance photosynthesis and transpiration and makes efficient use of water lawson and blatt 2014 investigated variations in the stomatal response to co2 uptake and water use and reported that the manipulation of guard cells for stomatal conductance could improve plant water use without affecting carbon fixation for photosynthesis furthermore moreno gutiérrez et al 2012 reported stomatal regulation and water use strategies as an inherent characteristic of plants for domestication in contrasting climates they proposed a systematic screening of carbon and oxygen isotopes in stomatal conductance to better understand the climate change challenges for efficient water use the stomatal density of leaves plays an important role in plant water use due to its direct link with transpiration manipulating stomatal density has improved wue in various crops khazaei et al 2010 yoo et al 2010 cao et al 2012 franks et al 2015 the upper side of leaves receive direct sunlight and is prone to more water loss than the lower side which does not receive direct sunlight yoo et al 2010 studied changes in the gtl1 transcription factor and reported that glt1 improves wue by lowering abaxial stomatal density without affecting adaxial stomatal density or having a negative impact on co2 fixation borrell et al 2014a investigated the role of stay green alleles for plant water use in sorghum and reported that these alleles could modify the stomatal index and thus reduce transpiration rate i e increasing the stomatal index reduced leaf size to neutralize the high transpiration of stomata franks et al 2015 studied epidermal patterning factor mutants of arabidopsis and reported that reducing stomatal conductance improved wue with little effect on photosynthetic capacity manipulating stomatal density and the opening and closing of stomata with water availability regulates plant water use and leads to sustained growth and production and improved wue anyia and herzog 2004 guerfel et al 2009 investigated structural adaptations in olive olea europaea l tree leaves for manipulating water use under water stress they reported that efficient water use was associated with thicker palisade parenchyma and higher trichome and stomatal density of foliar tissue which lead to lower reductions in carbon fixation under water stress thicker and smaller leaves are associated with moisture stress tolerance in many species leaf expansion declines under moisture stress and leads to smaller and thicker leaves shao et al 2008 skirycz and inzé 2010 anjum et al 2011 which store more water than normal leaves a thicker leaf is associated with a thicker boundary layer which reduces transpiration and increases photosynthetic rate due to the increased photosynthetic apparatus that improves transpirational efficiency and ultimately wue bramley et al 2013 the leaf trichome is also associated with leaf transpiration an increase in trichomes results in cooling effects for the leaf due to transpiration and light reflectance that reduces overall leaf transpiration konrad et al 2015 and in some species trichome density increases with increased moisture stress huttunen et al 2010 ennajeh et al 2010 reported a drought tolerant olive cultivar that increased spongy parenchyma and upper palisade by 22 and 17 respectively under drought moreover the stomatal and trichome densities increased which improved co2 uptake and increased the thickness of the lower and upper epidermis by 25 and 32 respectively bañon et al 2004 investigated anatomical and morphological manipulations in lotus lotus creticus l leaves adaptations to water stress included osmotic adjustment reduced leaf area and more leaf hairs han et al 2016 identified significant positive correlations between photosynthetic rate and both mesophyll conductance and wue in cotton gossypium hirsutum l under drought pretreatment which was stronger than the association between stomatal conductance and these traits despite of all the mechanism discussed above timing of the day also has impact on leaf morphology anatomy and finally canopy structure for example in summer plants have fully expanded leaves and do not show any symptoms of wilting but as temperature and sunshine increases leaves become rolled incept minimum light and reduce transpiration anyia and herzog 2004 tardieu et al 2018 likewise water stress at different stages impact water relations differently chaves et al 2009 fereres and soriano 2006 tardieu et al 2018 reported rapid fluctuation of water potential up to 1 mpa of a diurnal plant for one hour they reported that during summer plant can feel normal in the morning due to lower temperature and same plant can feel water stressed at noon due to excessive transpiration to compensate high temperature in conclusion leaf morphology physiology and anatomy play an important role in plant water use and transpirational efficiency and must be considered when developing drought tolerant and water use efficient cultivars 2 3 root architecture and anatomy the first organ developed from the plant embryo is the radicle which develops into roots roots uptake water and nutrients for shoot growth and development root traits such as deep roots high root density wide xylem diameters and long root hairs may enhance water and nutrient uptake siddique et al 2015 factors that influence root growth development architecture and anatomy include plant stress soil structure soil fertility symbiotic relationship with microbes hormonal balance water availability and the genetic architecture of the plant sharp 2002 giuliani et al 2005 lópez bucio et al 2005 yang et al 2009 rolli et al 2015 tron et al 2015 gao and lynch 2016 alvarez flores et al 2018 colombi et al 2018 root architecture and anatomy are important in major crops as they are directly related to water and nutrient uptake root development is sensitive to water availability but it is regulated by hormones root architecture and its spatial distribution in the soil are associated with root length and branching bramley et al 2013 abscisic acid aba accumulates in roots in response to water stress and affects root development sharp 2002 alvarez flores et al 2018 giuliani et al 2005 developed near isogenic hybrids of maize through backcross derived lines and investigated the role of leaf aba qtls on stomatal conductance and root architecture the study concluded that leaf aba qtls affect root architecture due to their pleiotropic effect on root architecture later a model was developed that proposed a direct effect of leaf aba qtls on root architecture giuliani et al 2005 genotypes differ in their localization of root biomass at different depths under water and nutrient stress conditions tolerant genotypes produce deeper and more vigorous roots in the search for water and nutrients ho et al 2005 investigated the localization of root biomass in common beans phaseolus vulgaris l under phosphorus p deficiency and water stress conditions and reported a tradeoff in root architecture for p and water acquisition lópez bucio et al 2005 investigated the regulatory mechanism involved in altering root development of arabidopsis in response to p availability and reported that the big gene and auxin transport play a role in pericycle cell activation to form lateral root primordia that further promote root hair elongation in the direction of p availability a similar mechanism may be involved in root development in response to soil moisture availability manschadi et al 2006 studied root architectural traits in the adaptation of wheat to water limited conditions using a drought tolerant and drought susceptible genotype the tolerant genotype developed a compact vertical root system allowing it to extract less water during early growth stages but more as the crop matured while the susceptible cultivar produced roots to the same depth as the tolerant one most of its root biomass remained closer to the soil surface which limited water uptake during later stages of growth as the surface soil dried similarly gao and lynch 2016 reported deeper roots with higher water acquisition which was associated with fewer crown roots aziz et al 2016 reported that improvements in wheat yield over five decades were correlated with root length density not root length or root biomass alvarez flores et al 2018 investigated the plasticity of quinoa chenopodium quinoa willd in dry and wet soils and reported that drier soil accelerated tap root growth more than wet soil to enable water uptake at depth tron et al 2015 modeled the transpiration of 48 root architecture types under 16 drought scenarios and different soil structures and textures they reported that root architecture did not fully explain plant water use and suggested relating specific root architecture with genotype soil hydrological and other characteristics along with root architectural changes in response to water availability knowledge of root anatomical characteristics is important changes in anatomical traits in genotypes exposed to wet and dry soils lead to efficient water use under optimal and water limited conditions xylem tissue is directly linked to water uptake therefore its importance cannot be denied the amount and diameter of xylem tissue are responsive to the external environment in rice xylem diameter decreased in response to drought to avoid cavitation henry et al 2012 tree root biomass is distributed both in the shallow and deep soil zones where shallow roots have smaller xylem diameters due to the higher chance of water stress and deeper roots have larger xylem diameters due to the increased availability of water at depth mcelrone et al 2004 the variation in xylem vessels in response to drought could be used as a selection criterion for breeding drought tolerance jaramillo et al 2013 reported an association between root respiration and root cortical aerenchyma rca and living cortical area lca lca declined with drought tolerance due to axial root growth and root segment respiration water stress can induce rca which increase water uptake by reducing the metabolic cost of soil exploration and improve yield jaramillo et al 2013 lynch et al 2014 root cortical senescence rcs is another root trait associated with soil moisture regulation causing cell death in relatively older roots wenzel and mccully 1991 like rca rcs save metabolic energy and increase the radial conductivity of nutrients and water as the outer layer of the endodermis has been lost lynch et al 2014 root hydraulic properties are also important when selecting genotypes for higher te hydraulic conductance determines which regions of the root take up water and nutrients for example in cereals only the root tips are involved in water and nutrient uptake whereas the whole root is involved in legumes bramley et al 2009 hence total root length is important in legumes whereas root branching is important in cereals in conclusion the manipulation of root architecture and anatomy could contribute to water stress tolerance due to improved water and nutrient uptake from the soil as water use and wue are inversely proportional therefore less water use will lead to higher wue 2 4 osmoregulation and maintenance of tissue water status osmoregulation is the dynamic regulation of water use by the plant for transpiration and other functions to prevent plant fluids from becoming too dilute or too thick xylem plays a key role in the uptake of water from the soil to fulfill the needs of transpiration xylem is the main channel of water to all parts of the plant from the soil xylem water interactions play an important role in regulating plant water use the xylem and phloem work together and their interaction under water stress impacts plant performance savage et al 2016 studies on xylem phloem interactions have shown that xylem acts as a water reservoir for phloem jyske and hölttä 2015 pfautsch et al 2015 savage et al 2016 however under water stress when xylem does not extract enough water from the soil phloem tissue acts as a water reservoir for xylem to sustain plant growth savage et al 2016 similarly sevanto 2018 reported that the response of phloem is critical for plant survival under water stress secchi et al 2017 demonstrated that xylem parenchyma cells also known as vessel associated cells are involved in the regulation of xylem transport and tracheid functionality during stress and the subsequent recovery xylem and phloem keep the water balance outside cells the internal cell water balance is maintained by vacuoles that transport potassium ions k into and out of the vacuole through the membrane tonoplast the concentration of organic solutes especially proline glycine betaine and glycerol plays an important role in osmoregulation and the maintenance of turgor pressure and water potential in tissues proline is an excellent osmolyte but under osmotic stress it maintains cell water status by preventing cell electrolyte leakage and oxidative bursts through membrane stabilization and keeping the concentration of reactive oxygen species in a normal range slama et al 2015 proline also triggers the modulation of mitochondrial function activation of stress responsive genes and regulation of cellular redox reactions szabados and savoure 2010 liang et al 2013 but high concentrations can be toxic verbruggen et al 2008 increasing osmolyte accumulation in plant tissues by introducing new genes and exogenous application is a vital strategy to cope with drought stress slama et al 2015 the concentration of certain ions across the cell membrane and in intercellular spaces regulates cellular homeostasis when exposed to stress abscisic acid is normally produced in shoots and roots in response to osmotic stress and induces a series of signaling cascades blum 2011 osakabe et al 2014 to maintain internal osmotic pressure an increase in aba concentration slows plant metabolic processes by reducing leaf gas exchange due to stomatal closure osakabe et al 2014 thus plants maintain their water status at the cost of their growth pang et al 2017a investigated the response of chickpea cicer arietinum l to terminal drought and identified that aba produced during terminal drought affects seed set either directly by the abortion of developing seeds pods or indirectly by reducing photosynthesis through stomatal closure and reducing assimilate supply to reproductive parts stomatal closure related to aba is further associated with k transporters nhx1 nhx2 tpk1 localized in the tonoplast where the release of k from the vacuole leads to stomatal closure ward and schroeder 1994 barragán et al 2012 isner et al 2018 barragán et al 2012 identified two na h exchangers nhx1 and nhx2 in the regulation of k uptake through the tonoplast for stomatal and turgor regulation in a recent study isner et al 2018 reported that stomatal closure in response to stress mainly depends on k release by the vacuole into the cytoplasm and vacuolar k efflux which is mediated by negative potential of the tonoplast that extrudes it from the vacuole this leads to the release of salt to the guard cell which loses turgor and stomatal closure reduced leaf water potential has a primary role in osmoregulation and maintenance of plant tissue water status blum 2011 under water stress aba is produced in shoot and root tissue and starts ionic regulation of water status at cell and tissue levels therefore it is a combination of osmotic stress hormonal metabolism and ionic regulation that maintains plant water status at the cost of plant growth and leads to osmoregulation nonetheless osmoregulation at the cost of plant growth is acceptable under dry environments to make the crops drought tolerant and water use efficient even with less yield 2 5 water use efficiency and crop yield wue and crop yield always go side by side for the crop researcher but relationship between the two has not been properly cleared although wue has positive correlation with yield but increase in wue does not always correspond to increase in the yield wue is normally measured as ratio of crop water used applied irrigation water and crop yield values of wue are often higher under drought water stress condition than under normal irrigation conditions ul allah et al 2015 reported the higher wues of forage crops for dry matter yield and protein yield under water stress condition but corresponding yields were higher under normal irrigation conditions likewise similar findings were reported for grain yield of wheat ul allah et al 2018 kang et al 2000 reported improvement in wue with regular deficit irrigation but yield was higher with regular irrigation in all abovementioned studies the researcher used flooded irrigation where a lot of water lost due to leaching and soil evaporation resulting in lower wues while in case of water stress alternative irrigation was missed which resulted in lower yield but relative higher wue application of nutrients under constant water supply lead to higher wues alkhader and rayyan 2013 chongtham et al 2015 ul allah et al 2018 where higher wues attributed to higher yield in response to crop nutrition growth stage of the crop and the timing of the day also affects wues and its impact on yield as discussed earlier a plant may not feel stress at summer morning but can feel severe stress at noon due to high transpirational requirements anyia and herzog 2004 tardieu et al 2018 similarly a plant can withstand drought stress at vegetative stage due to the regulation of transpiration and reduced growth but cannot develop seed due to pollen mortality and abortion of reproductive organs smith and zhao 2016 turc and tardieu 2018 therefore it is very critical to analyze the response of water deficit at different growth stages as severe water stress at reproductive phase may be lethal for grain crops under such situations cultivars with more wue at reproductive stages may result in higher yields although wue is related to the yield but it does never mean that higher water use efficient genotypes can produce higher yields in actual genotypes with higher wue reduce transpiration and crop water use and thus perform well under water deficit conditions but does not improve crop yield blum 2009 introduced the term effective use of water to produce more with a drop of water by reducing non transpirational losses instead of wue where plant reduce water use he also demonstrated that selection for higher wue lead to lower crop yields in crux higher wue is important only when there is need of balanced crop water use under limited water reserves on the cost of yield yield is directly related with transpiration i e higher transpiration leads to higher co2 assimilation blum 2009 but wue efficiency is inversely proportional to water use which results in less yield under normal irrigation different physiological and morphological attributes of improved wue are presented in fig 1 3 management strategies for improving water use efficiency water use is crucial for any crop especially under the current climate change scenario where freshwater resources are endangered and future crop production and food security are becoming a challenge for agricultural scientists in this situation crops with higher wue will be the only viable option there are many management options including crop improvement and selection adjustment of the planting calendar and seeding rates and proper irrigation nutrient and weed management which can be used to improve crop wue xu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2017a ma et al 2018 tables 1 3 fig 2 these strategies are briefly described below 3 1 crop improvement and crop selection improvement in wue is vital in all regions and under all climatic conditions to save water for future generations but it is more crucial in semi arid areas where sustainability is compromised with supplementary irrigation genetic improvement of crops for enhanced wue is a sustainable approach that requires nothing but seed after a genotype has been developed in various crops plant breeders have developed and selected crop varieties with improved wue based on both economic yield and co2 fixation krupnik et al 2012 saradadevi et al 2014 ul allah et al 2018 significant genetic variation exists among crops or within genotypes of the same crop for wue which is needed to tailor more water efficient genotypes for example medium spike cultivar jm22 had 4 2 9 3 higher wue than large wm8 and small hs4399 spike cultivars of wheat mainly due to better post anthesis biomass accretion and more water mining from deeper soil wang et al 2016 saradadevi et al 2014 2017a 2017b reported the differential ability of wheat genotypes to produce aba under drought and described the exploitation of genotypic differences in aba production for the management of drought stress and improved wue pang et al 2017b reported that chickpea genotypes with lower transpiration during early phases of drought stress and higher transpiration during later stages of development tend to be drought tolerant and have higher wues than other genotypes with similar transpiration rates during the entire water stress turner et al 2001 2005 identified morphological physiological and biochemical traits related to high yields under water stress and proposed the selection of chickpea genotypes based on those traits for maximum wue various breeding techniques are being used to genetically improve field crops for higher wue including trait identification evaluation and selection of genotypes and the use of wild relatives to incorporate new genes for improved wue wang et al 2016 2017b pour aboughadareh et al 2017 ul allah et al 2018 ul allah et al 2018 compared 20 bread wheat genotypes for wue based on yield and applied irrigation water the wue ranged from 1 15 to 1 40 kg grain yield m 3 of water applied which improved in all genotypes under water stress dingkuhn et al 1991 compared 28 contrasting rice genotypes for carbon isotope discrimination and wue variation in both traits was observedwith a strong negative correlation between carbon isotope discrimination and wue the authors suggested using carbon isotope discrimination to select crop genotypes with higher wue liu et al 2016 compared a drought tolerant and drought susceptible genotype for physiological traits associated with high wue mild water stress improved wue in both genotypes more so in the tolerant genotype the drought tolerant genotype had a relatively stable net photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance and transpiration rate under water stress resulting in a higher wue bota et al 2016 reported variation in grapevine genotypes for carbon isotope discrimination photosynthetic rate leaf level wue and stomatal conductance the drought tolerant genotypes had higher photosynthetic rates coupled with lower stomatal conductance resulting in a high wue saranga et al 1998 also reported photosynthetic rate and carbon isotope ratio as a tool for selecting cotton genotypes with higher wue wild relatives of field crops are usually well adapted to climatic conditions and have biotic and abiotic stress tolerant traits traits related to higher wue could be introduced to cultivated genotypes using interspecific breeding mihoub et al 2017 investigated two algerian wild species of safflower carthamus strictus and c chouletteanus for different traits the authors reported higher wue values in c chouletteanus and suggested using this species as a source of genes for higher wue in cultivated safflower saranga et al 1998 reported that american cotton gossypium hirsutum l had a higher wue than egyptian cotton gossypium barbadense l they showed that by interspecific hybridization higher wue could be obtained nevo and chen 2010 reported the potential of ovate goatgrass aegilops geniculate roth for improving drought and heat tolerance in cultivated wheat and the potential of emmer wheat triticum dicoccoides schrank and wild barley hordeum spontaneum l for improving drought tolerance and wue in both emmer wheat and wild barley crop wild relatives are becoming more important especially for tolerant traits but their contribution to developing new cultivars has been low in the future as genetic resources of cultivated crops are narrowed down wild relatives will become a major source of variability for drought and wue traits and their contribution to the development of new cultivars will increase 3 2 planting calendar site specific manipulation of sowing time of any crop under the best growing conditions is an important agronomic strategy to improve crop wue numerous studies conducted in different parts of the world under a variety of growing conditions with various crops have identified that crop wue can improve when planted at the appropriate time table 1 early sown crops generally have a higher wue than late sown crops due to their longer life cycle table 1 agronomists recommend specific sowing times in each geographical location for maximum crop output the planting calendar of any cropping system must be primarily based on wue to produce the maximum output from each drop of water and to save water for future generations late sowing is not solely responsible for reductions in yield and wue the crop type and environmental conditions impact the decision on whether to sow early or late feyzbakhsh et al 2015 investigated the effect of soil water management and sowing dates on wue in maize under semi arid conditions late sown maize had better grain yield and wue than early sown maize however in this case late sown maize took longer to reach maturity than early sown maize regan et al 1997 reported that very early maturing genotypes of wheat use less water pre anthesis and save water for the reproductive phase which improved grain yield and wue similar findings were reported by mwanamwenge et al 1998 for faba bean in a mediterranean type environment siddique et al 1990 conducted a study in western australia using old and new wheat cultivars and reported higher wue in modern cultivars than old cultivars due to differential water use patterns the old cultivars used more water pre anthesis while modern cultivars used less water during early growth and more water post anthesis meshram 2014 reported that short duration rice cultivars had higher wue when sown late while the medium to long duration cultivars had higher wue when sown early late sown wheat at a high seeding rate had a higher wue 2 07 kg m 3 than early sown wheat 1 83 kg m 3 which was credited to the shorter vegetative stage and lower pre anthesis et the late sown wheat also had a higher photosynthetic rate during grain filling than the early sown wheat due to more soil water availability that leads to a higher wue hence late sowing with a high seeding rate can maximize wue in wheat wang et al 2017b newly developed genotypes should be evaluated under late and early sowing for maximum output and optimal sowing time with minimal water use this will lead to save the water which can be used for other parallel crops or next crops furthermore economic value of wue must be kept in mind as under unlimited water availability crops having more water use may be more economical than the crops having more wue in developing new genotypes optimum sowing time and plant populations should be evaluated along with other traits 3 3 seeding rate and planting geometry seeding rate and planting geometry are important for improving water and nutrient use efficiencies in all crops if the plant population is more than optimal then competition for space water and nutrients will not allow plants to reach their potential similarly if the plant population is less than optimal then there will be free space which is not used by the plants and production per unit area will decrease planting geometry is more important for water use water is used more efficiently with furrow and bed sowing than flat sowing an increased seeding rate substantially reduced wue in wheat due to elevated soil water depletion higher et and more infertile tillers ma et al 2018 under water limited conditions a higher seeding rate reduced wue in wheat due to more et losses and correspondingly reduced yield hu et al 2018 similarly mahmood et al 2002 reported higher wue in wheat sown at 125 kg ha 1 than at 100 and 150 kg ha 1 however when sowing was delayed wue in wheat increased with increasing seeding rate wang et al 2017b planting pattern geometry has a direct effect on crop growth and development due to its impact on solar energy capture root growth water saving and shading effects which reduce evaporation for instance the wue of wheat sown on raised beds was 54 4 higher than wheat sown on a flat surface due to 50 7 less water being consumed soomro et al 2017 similarly hussain et al 2010 reported a higher wue in ridge sown sunflower helianthus annuus l compared with flat surface sowing in another study chickpea sown on furrow irrigated raised beds 75 cm wide had higher wue than chickpea sown on a flatbed which was linked to water saving of up to 33 3 in the raised bed crop kumar et al 2015 ridge sown maize also recorded higher wue than that sown on a flat surface which was primarily due to the well developed root system deep roots with more lateral root proliferation of the ridge sown crop that could explore more soil volume to uptake water khan et al 2012 a ridge furrow rainwater harvesting system improved wue and riwue rainfall irrigation wue with 200 mm simulated precipitation and 150 mm deficit irrigation due to notable improvements in soil water storage at 0 200 cm depth coupled with reduced et in the field and higher grain filling rate in wheat ali et al 2017 in conclusion seeding rate and planting geometry are basic agronomic management strategies to improve water and nutrient use efficiencies and enable crops to reach their potential under optimal plant populations and proper planting patterns 3 4 water management under the climate change scenario freshwater resources are endangered and there is strong competition for water use between agriculture and other industries judicious use of water is required various water management strategies have been proposed by agricultural scientists for the efficient use of applied water evans and sadler 2008 ram et al 2013 chai et al 2014 jha et al 2016 crop wue could be improved by limiting the current frequent irrigations ram et al 2013 chai et al 2014 in a three year study ram et al 2013 observed higher wue in wheat with only two irrigations at crown root initiation and booting and rice straw mulching at 6 t ha 1 increasing the irrigations from two to six resulted in a gradual decline in wue under various mulch treatments which might be due to less biomass partitioning to grain at higher irrigations similarly maurya and singh 2008 reported higher wue in wheat with more frequent irrigation and lower grain yields with the rise in et in another three year field study the wue after one irrigation 75 mm at jointing was 7 5 higher than after two irrigations 75 mm each at jointing and anthesis in three late sown winter wheat cultivars in the north china plain wang et al 2016 in another study winter wheat sown with one irrigation had higher wue than wheat with three irrigations xu et al 2016 the limited irrigation encouraged roots to explore deeper soil layers which increased water uptake but reduced leaf expansion and transpiration and had a small negative effect on grain yield xu et al 2016 irrigating crops at critical growth stages is another way to improve wue mwanamwenge et al 1999 li et al 2010 for instance frequent irrigations at 75 asw depletion produced a much lower wue in field grown wheat and barley than irrigating only at critical growth stages the yield increase with more frequent irrigations did not equate to the extra water use singh and kumar 1981 application of 120 mm in one irrigation at jointing or three irrigations at jointing heading and milking stages 40 mm each produced lower wue in winter wheat than two irrigations at jointing and heading 60 mm each li et al 2010 the use of modern gps based irrigation techniques such as automated sprinklers and high efficiency drip irrigation systems enables farmers to use water more efficiently by applying small quantities of water in accordance with soil and crop needs evans and sadler 2008 in a recent study conducted at three sites in nepal drip irrigation of two fodder crops teosinte euchlaena mexicana schrad and cowpea vigna unguiculata l walp produced 3 99 times higher wue than furrow irrigation which was primarily linked to lower soil percolation and evaporation losses as drip irrigation used 73 less water than furrow irrigation jha et al 2016 however kanani et al 2016 reported higher iwue and wue in corn with a buried porous clay capsule irrigation system than the surface drip and subsurface drip irrigation systems in semi arid regions similarly a raised bed furrow irrigation system recorded 54 4 higher wue in wheat than a conventional check basin irrigation system because it consumed 50 7 less water soomro et al 2017 conventionally flooded transplanted rice and full irrigation systems are less efficient for water use than deficit irrigation systems the adoption of alternate wetting and drying and aerobic production systems in rice re evaluation of existing irrigation systems with a range of deficit irrigation systems and the use of modern irrigation techniques such as high efficiency drip irrigation systems are needed to maximize wue 3 5 soil fertility management soil fertility management is an important factor influencing wue in field crops to achieve maximum yields from every drop of applied water the soil must be enriched with balanced macro and micronutrients fertilizer application improved the irrigation wue in irrigated and water stressed soils but the effect was more prominent under water limited conditions ul allah et al 2015 several studies have reported increases in wue in a variety of crops including wheat rice maize potato solanum tuberosum l chickpea and mungbean vigna radiata l after application of macro and micronutrients under optimal and less than optimal water conditions table 2 potassium and zn are known to ameliorate drought effects and improve wue in normal and water stressed conditions khan et al 2003 cakmak 2005 hussain et al 2018 martineau et al 2017 investigated the role of k nutrition for improving wue in maize in a large scale experiment under three levels of k low normal and high and two water supplies control and water balance model based on 30 deficit potassium supply at optimum rates improved maize tolerance to drought which was attributed to better wue 30 higher with k application due to lower leaf evapotranspiration potassium also causes leaf rolling which reduces et and ultimately saves water martineau et al 2017 in a two year field study under rainfed conditions in west africa k application in k deficient soils enhanced wue and radiation use efficiency by 36 41 in cassava ezui et al 2016 however the best response occurred with k application during the vegetative stage of cassava growth suggesting that the timely application of required nutrients and planting to make the best use of rainfall will achieve higher yields ezui et al 2016 similarly alkhader and rayyan 2013 reported significant increases in fresh biomass and wue with higher levels of applied p in lettuce lactuca sativa l in three growing seasons high rates of n application to high yielding rice increased wue in conventionally flooded cf and awd rice more so in cf rice zhang et al 2012 in a three year field study under dryland farming sensitive and drought tolerant wheat cultivars had higher wue in the two dry years as n levels increased to 180 kg ha 1 above this the effect was non significant due to more water absorption from deeper soil layers in the wet year the effects of n application were not significant zhong and shangguan 2014 nitrogen application at 90 kg n ha 1 improved wue in wheat and barley due to a sizeable increase in grain yield with minimal increase in water use additional water was extracted from deeper soil layers 60 90 cm in wheat and 31 120 cm in barley due to increased root development in response to applied n singh and kumar 1981 in conclusion wue is not only dependent on transpiration but also depends on co2 assimilation which in turn is dependent on nutrient availability thus application of both micro and macronutrients help to increase wue in most crops grown under well watered and water limited environments 3 6 mulching for reduced soil evaporation much of the applied water to soil is wasted due to evaporation instead of being used for crop growth which lowers the crop wue various management practices can be used to control evaporation including split applications of water drip irrigation and mulching mulching is the most economical and efficient method for controlling water losses due to evaporation and increasing the wue of arable crops for instance rice straw mulching improved wue by 10 in winter wheat by reducing soil evaporation in the top 40 mm of soil zhang and oweis 1999 in a three year field study in northwest india different levels of rice straw mulch improved wheat wue by 14 7 34 2 compared with no mulch under various irrigation regimes the improvement in wue was more evident with limited irrigation treatments primarily due to reduced soil temperature and weed infestation ram et al 2013 in a two year field study in a rainfed environment application of wheat straw mulch at 6 and 12 t ha 1 improved soil moisture contents at 20 80 cm soil depth in both years and enhanced wue in chaoshi1 a compact type maize cultivar in the second year but had no effect on danyu86 a flat type maize cultivar shen et al 2012 they further reported improvement in soil moisture contents of 20 60 deep soil with mulching during anthesis silking period but at maturity soil moisture contents were same ass non mulched ram et al 2013 reported saving of up to 29 mm of water with straw mulching in wheat saving of water by the mulching may be attributed to less light interception to the ground resulting in less temperature of the soil ram et al 2013 and ultimately less soil evaporation therefore mulching may be more effective during summer than winter thus under irrigated and rainfed conditions mulching in inter row spaces and on bare spaces of soil can reduce water losses and weed infestations which will ultimately improve crop yield and wue 3 7 weed management weeds are unwanted plants that compete with crops for space nutrients and water which can ultimately result in huge losses in crop yield and wue table 3 controlling weeds will increase yields due to increased water and resource use efficiencies subramanyam et al 2007 chauhan et al 2015b reported 54 614 higher yields with weed control however weed control is challenging due to fast infestation and genetic diversity weeds have a clear advantage over crops because they can uptake more water at depth abouziena et al 2014 moreover weeds use more water than crop plants to produce one unit of biomass for instance one pound of dry biomass of common lambsquarters chenopodium album l required 658 pounds of water compared with 557 and 349 pounds of water for wheat and corn plants respectively parker 2003 weed scientists have proposed various weed control strategies in various crops a sustainable method to control weeds is biological control blubaugh et al 2016 weed et al 2018 weed et al 2018 analyzed nine years of data based on citizen monitoring and reported a decline in broadleaf toadflax dalmatian toadflax l mill invasive weed with the release of mecinus janthiniformis a stem mining weevil but proposed other weed management methods to be used alongside biological control for more efficient results blubaugh et al 2016 observed that cover crops increased the population of omnivores the natural enemy of weeds which reduced the weed seeds by 73 the use of allelochemicals present in plants or crops to control weeds is an ecological method for integrated weed management in a sustainable way farooq et al 2011 głąb et al 2017 rawat et al 2017 manual weed control is also ecological and beneficial keller et al 2014 but requires a large labor force and is not applicable to large areas an alternative to manual weed control is mechanical weed control where tractor mounted instruments are mostly used in row sown crops the most efficient way to control weeds is by using chemicals but it has detrimental effects on the environment increases in wue 12 91 5 in different crops by managing weeds with pre and post emergence herbicides and hand weeding under a variety of growing conditions are given in table 3 in conclusion the best way to control weeds sustainably is the integrated use of weed management practices chauhan et al 2015a malarkodi 2015 proper weed management irrespective of the method used helps to improve wue in all arable crops under a variety of growing conditions 3 8 economic feasibility management to improve wue is very important for better production especially in water limited areas for better profitability economic feasibility of the management practice is also very important all management strategies may not be feasible in all areas and all the management strategies are not economical when used together crop improvement through breeding is a sustainable way to produce more water use efficient crops as after the development of a variety it does not cost anything in the field except seed wise use of planting calendar improves water use efficiency and crop production in water limited areas and results in higher benefits taheripour et al 2016 investigated the economic impact of improvement in wue in south asian countries and reported that in india sri lanka and bangladesh up to 40 improvement in wue is economically viable and in nepal it is beneficial only up to 20 in pakistan and other south asian countries they reported that improvement in wue is beneficial only up to 30 and after that economic gain started to decline as after this particular increase in wue cost of management increased that yield benefits the different rages of economical viable wue improvement may corresponds to different capital cost of different countries some management strategies do not cost or cost only small labor for example on farm water management by alternate irrigations ul allah et al 2015 2018 alternate furrow irrigation abd el halim 2013 etc but improve the economical impact abd el halim 2013 used different irrigation techniques to improve the wue and reported alternate furrow irrigation most economical viable as befit cost ratio of this technique was observed as 1 6 sometimes yield is also reduced in response to improvement in wue ul allah et al 2015 2018 in this situation benefit cost ratio must be considered to have maximum economic impact economic feasibility of any management strategies depends on the cost of operations and respective increase in yield in response to specific operation therefore management strategies should be adopted carefully to have maximum cost benefits 4 conclusions and future research needs under the climate change scenario the availability of sufficient water for crop production is becoming a problem and it is time to improve the wue of crops by agronomic or genetic means water efficient genotypes can be tailored based on well suited canopy size and orientation leaf morphology orientation and anatomy and root architecture to improve wue for instance a small leaf canopy with a deep root system in limited irrigation environments can reduce evapotranspiration losses and improve wue the major objective of any agriculture based research should be maximum production per drop of water applied agronomic management techniques to improve wue include adjusting the planting calendar according to water availability at critical crop growth stages controlling weeds that use considerable water soil fertility management mulching interplant spaces in crops to control evaporation and on farm water management to save water for future generations and increase crop production by using less water water use efficient crops varieties are needed along with integrated management techniques economic impacts must be considered before adopting any technique to improve wue 
11038,mungbean vigna radiata l is an economically important food legume grown in tropics and subtropics and consumed by more than billion people in the world there is limited information on water requirements of and irrigation strategies for mungbean the objective of this study was to investigate water extraction patterns of mungbean grown under rainfed and irrigated conditions in narrow or wide row spacing treatments in two diverse environments the two test environments i e emerald agricultural college eac and hermitage research station hrs in queensland were characterised by contrasting seasonal average temperatures and vapour deficits vpd the amount of water extracted by irrigated and rainfed crops during early growth phase was lower but similar excepting for hrs in 2015 16 season compared to reproductive phase where water extraction was significantly higher the narrow row spacing treatment 0 25 m extracted more water than 1 0 m row spacing treatment during early phases of crop growth only crops at hrs extracted greater amounts of water compared to eac with bulk of the water extraction occurring from the top 50 cm and 75 cm zones in rainfed and irrigated crops respectively however at hrs maximum water was extracted from the top 75 cm zone data pooled across environments revealed an exponentially negative relationship between seasonal vapour pressure deficit and the amount of water extracted there was a significantly positive relationship between the total dry matter and yield and the total water extracted the findings of this study highlighted the variation in crop water requirements of mungbean at different phenophases and the depth of water extraction this information will be useful for developing irrigation management practices to optimise mungbean productivity keywords temperature vapour pressure deficit phenophases shoot dry matter yield mungbean 1 introduction drought and high temperature stress are the major constraints to crop yields in many agricultural regions mungbean vigna radiata l is an important food legume cultivated on 6 2 million ha across wide range of environments between 40 n or s latitudes faostat 2015 the crop is predominantly grown as a summer rainfed crop with india alone accounting for 65 of the world production hanumantharao et al 2016 summer seasons in semi arid tropics and subtropics are characterized by elevated temperatures 35 c kaur et al 2015 and insufficient rainfall muchow 1985 irrigation is scarce in majority of the dryland regions however there is little information on optimal irrigation strategies to achieve high water use efficiency in mungbean pannu and singh 1993 in view of the importance of mungbean as a crop for human diet as well as cash there is a need to explore economically viable and environmentally sustainable solutions to improve rainfed or irrigated water use efficiency to combat drought effects earlier studies reported that mungbean crop could tolerate drought by either forced maturity or stomatal closure pannu and singh 1993 earlier studies investigated the effect of irrigation timing and frequency on productivity of legumes lawn 1982 muchow 1985 pannu and singh 1993 sadeghipour 2008 increased frequency of irrigations enhanced evapotranspiration both in moderately hot and humid environments muchow 1985 and in hot and dry environments phogat et al 1984 although the water use efficiency wue for dry matter production remained unchanged in the former but decreased in the latter environments while weekly irrigation of 50 60 mm resulted in highest grain yield of grain legumes including mungbean muchow 1985 a transient moisture stress conditions in early and mid phases of crop growth also resulted in higher productivity nageswara rao et al 1985 turner 1990 sengupta et al 2011 most of the earlier work on mungbean focussed on the effects of drought lawn 1982 muchow 1985 high temperature kaur et al 2015 patriyawaty et al 2018 or irrigation timing and frequency pannu and sing 1993 sadeghipour 2008 on shoot dry matter and yield using old cultivars however there is little information on water extraction pattern and depth of water extraction by current commercial cultivar of mungbean grown in diverse environments lawn 1982 sim et al 2017 there is also a need to understand the effects of seasonal temperature and vapour pressure deficits on water extraction ability of mungbean the objectives of the present investigation therefore were to evaluate the effects of various management practices such as irrigation row spacing on water extraction and its relation with productivity of mungbean this information will add to the current knowledge on crop water requirements at different growth phases as well as developing appropriate management practices to optimise mungbean productivity in diverse environments 2 material and methods 2 1 sites field experiments were conducted during the summer dec may seasons of the years 2015 16 and 2016 17 at the department of agriculture and fisheries daf research facilities located at emerald agricultural college eac 23 3 s 148 1 e and hermitage hrs 28 2 s 152 1 e in queensland australia the soils at the two sites were deep brown hrs or black vertisols eac with 120 cm depth the two experimental sites represented typical mungbean production environments in cereal legume based cropping systems in the queensland australia 2 2 crop husbandry pure seed of jade obtained from the australian mungbean breeding program was used at the two sites in both years conventionally mungbean has been planted at 1 0 m row spacing in australia mainly to suit the planting machinery available it has also been argued that the 1 0 m inter row spacing would reduce the risk of dry spells as it allows the crop to extract water from inter row space in times of dry spells the current research has been designed to examine the effects of two row spacing treatments on crops productivity and efficiency of water extraction by mungbean at each site the trials were laid out as split plot designs with irrigation irr or rainfed rf treatments as whole plots and three row spacing rsp 1 0 m 0 5 m 0 25 m treatments as sub plots with three replications rep each sub plot was 12 m long and either 4 m at eac or 2 m wide at hrs at least a 12 m buffer crop sown at 50 cm row spacing separated the irr and rf treatments while a 6 m buffer separated rsp treatments all buffers were planted with jade a plant population of approximately 30 4 plants m2 was maintained in all trials prior to sowing seeds were pre treated with a peat slurry of bradyrhizobium spp inoculant group i specific to mungbean http pulseaus com au growing pulses publications pulse inoculation a starter dose of a commercial formulation of zinc n 11 0 p 21 8 s 4 0 and zn 1 0 at a rate of 30 kg ha was applied as part of a standard practice crops were planted at non limiting water condition and subsequently rainfed and supplementary irrigated treatments were established at hrs irrigation was applied using a surface drip system operated by a pressure pump while at eac an overhead sprinkler irrigation system was used at hrs two drip lines of 12 m length with 120 drippers per plot were laid out with each dripper emitting 1 1 l of water per hr amount of water delivered for each plot was calculated as pump time emitting rate dripper hr number of drippers per plot at eac the irrigation amount was estimated by multiplying a pre calibrated rate mm hr for the overhead system with the pumping time the trial details including the sowing and harvesting dates crop duration in crop rainfall and irrigation applied are presented in table 1 appropriate plant protection measures were implemented to maintain the trials pest and disease free 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 weather daily weather maximum temperature maxt minimum temperature mint rainfall and solar radiation parameters were collected from an automatic weather station installed within 1 km from each experimental site figs 1 and 2 the vapour pressure deficits were calculated using daily maximum and minimum temperatures 2 3 2 soil moisture soil moisture was measured at the centres of 25 cm 45 cm 65 cm 85 cm 105 cm and 125 cm depths using a neutron moisture meter nmm 503 dr hydroprobe cpn international at eac and cpn 503 elite hydrobe instrotek inc at hrs in the 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons aluminium tubes of 150 cm length and 50 mm diameter were sunk in the centre rows of sub plots when the crop was around 20 day old and capped to protect from rain two access tubes one between the plants within the row and the other in the middle of two rows inter row were installed in each sub plot to examine the effects of treatments on water extraction however at eac two different neutron moisture meters were used for the 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons at eac during 2015 16 an nmm calibration already available for the experimental site which accounted for 84 of the variation in soil moisture was used and the tubes were installed only in the inter row during 2016 17 season six to eight extra access tubes were installed in the sorghum buffer either crop at eac site or un cropped area hrs site around the experimental site for neutron probe calibration the nmm was calibrated by regressing the volumetric metric soil water content measured at each depth eight to ten times during the season the soil moisture content in the top 0 10 cm layer was simultaneously sampled gravimetrically the data was converted into volumetric units and added to the 25 cm reading made by the hydroprobe the nmm readings accounted for 69 and 74 of variation in soil moisture content at eac and hrs sites respectively the soil moisture was recorded from 4 leaf stage until crop desiccation at 4 5 day intervals in both the seasons at both sites the nmm measurements were made before and after each irrigation or rainfall event the total water extracted at each phenophases was calculated as indicated in eq 1 1 w e x d 1 d 6 t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 where wex was the water extracted from 125 cm soil profile in a given phenophase d1 and d6 were the depths t1 and t2 were plant available water content pawc in the soil measured at time 1 time 2 and so on the water extracted from each depth in volumetric terms was computed for each phenophase and then accumulated for the 6 depths to arrive at the total water extracted from the 125 cm soil profile 2 3 3 shoot biomass the peak shoot biomass at the end of the seed filling phase and before the start of leaf senescence was harvested from a measured ground area in each plot at eac the peak shoot biomass was recorded on 18 apr 2016 95 das and 06 apr 2017 79 das during the 2015 16 season and 2016 17 seasons respectively at hrs the shoot biomass was recorded on 18 feb 2016 72 das and 17 mar 2017 70 das during the 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons respectively plants were hand harvested from 1 m2 ground area in each plot and plant count recorded the harvested plants were dried in a fan forced oven at 80 c for 48 h before recording shoot leaves stems pods dry weight 2 3 4 grain yield the trials were harvested when 90 of plants had about 80 mature pods as indicated by dark brown pod wall the remaining plot area following the peak dry matter harvest was measured and machine harvested plants were desiccated by applying a foliar spray of glyphosate at 2 l ha 5 7 days prior to machine harvesting the grain samples collected from the mechanical harvester were cleaned to remove any extraneous matter and dried to 12 moisture content before weighing 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was conducted using r program r team core 2017 to quantify the patterns of soil water extraction from different depths at different phenophases a separate analysis was conducted for each site and season means were separated using a tukey test tukey 1949 however for variables having only two mean values were separated using student s t test sigma plot 10 0 systat software san jose ca and r software program were used for graphs 3 results 3 1 weather the mean temperature radiation and cumulative rainfall during 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons at eac and hrs sites are presented in figs 1 and 2 respectively the mean temperatures ranged between 30 35 c during most of the season in both years at eac fig 1 while at hrs the mean temperature during 2015 16 was around 23 c but steadily declined from 25 c to 10 c during 2016 17 season daily radiation varied between 10 and 25 mj m2 day at both sites the radiation declined to 10 mj m2 in the last 3 weeks before final harvest during 2015 16 season at eac while at hrs such a declining trend was observed in the 2016 17 season the total in crop rain at eac was 218 and 262 mm during 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons respectively but majority of the rain fell during pre flowering phase in 2015 16 and pod filling phase in 2016 17 at hrs however the in crop rainfall was well distributed through the season in both years although in the later season significant rain 100 mm fell during pod set phase the rainfall coupled with a decline in temperature and radiation resulted in extended crop duration at hrs there were marked differences in the seasonal vapour pressure deficit vpd between the sites presented as inserts in the figs 1 and 2 the seasonal vpds at eac ranged between 2 and 4 kpa during the 2015 16 season but steadily declined from 3 to 1 kpa during 2016 17 season the seasonal vpd was much lower at hrs ranging around 1 kpa in both years however there were occasional spikes during later stages of crop growth in 2015 16 and early stages in 2016 17 at hrs 3 2 water extraction by roots the crops in irrigated and rainfed treatments extracted similar amounts of water during early growth phases but the water extraction in the irrigation treatment was significantly higher than the rainfed treatment during reproductive phases at eac tables 2 and 3 by contrast the water extraction pattern was different during pre flowering phase at hrs in 2015 16 with the rainfed crops extracting significantly greater amount of water compared to the irrigated crops only during pre flowering phase table 3 however during late pod filling phase the irrigated crops extracted more water compared to rainfed crops tables 2 and 3 the rates of water extraction from within and in between rows were not significant and hence the values were pooled for a given row spacing the 0 25 m row spacing treatments extracted greater amounts of water during the pre flowering phase at both sites tables 2 and 3 however the row spacing treatment differences continued to be significant even in pod set phase during 2015 16 season at eac with 0 25 m row spacing treatment generally extracting greater amounts of water compared to 1 0 m spacing the water extraction varied significantly with depth in all phenophases in both years and sites table 2 in the 2015 16 season at eac relatively more water was extracted during pod filling pod f and maturity p mat phases particularly in the irrigated treatment fig 3 a there was a clear separation of irr and rf treatments by pod filling phase water extraction front reached to 100 cm depth in 0 25 m row spacing treatment while in the 1 m row spacing water extraction front reached only just over 75 cm by maturity phase in the 2016 17 season however greater water extraction was observed in both irr and rf treatments during pre flowering phase with little or no water extraction below 75 cm fig 3b the a and b letters in each of the figs 3 and 4 represent the 2015 16 and 2016 17 cropping seasons respectively for each of the two sites at hrs during 2015 16 season the rainfed crops extracted more water from the top 50 cm zone particularly in 0 25 m row spacing treatment during pre flowering phase fig 4a interestingly by pod set phase the water extraction front in rainfed crops moved to 75 cm zone in 0 25 cm row spacing while in 1 m row spacing water extraction was limited to 50 cm zone in irrigated crops maximum water extraction occurred from the top to 75 cm by pod set phase in both row spacing treatments by pod filling phase the water extraction front reached 110 cm although the maximum water extraction was from 75 to 100 cm zone fig 4a at hrs in the 2016 17 season the maximum water extraction occurred from the top 50 cm zone during pre flowering phase in all treatments fig 4b however by pod filling phase the extraction front moved below 100 cm with crops in irrigated treatment extracting significantly greater amount of water than the rainfed treatment in both row spacing treatments similar trend continued through the maturity phase although small amounts of water was extracted from 125 cm depth fig 4b the irrigated treatments in general extracted more water than rainfed treatments at both sites table 4 the percentage contribution of water from each of the soil layer to the total water extracted in the row spacing treatments is presented in table 4 it was clear that the contribution from the top layer was the greatest and reduced linearly with the depth in both sites and row spacing treatments vapour pressure deficit vpd is one of the environmental variables that influence the stomatal conductance which in turn affects transpirational pull by plants the vpds ranged from 0 6 to 1 8 kpa at hrs and from 1 5 to 2 8 kpa at eac respectively fig 5 there was an exponentially negative relationship between vpd and the total water extracted the water extraction by roots increased exponentially as the vpd declined with the response being more pronounced at hrs 3 3 shoot dry matter and yield the average shoot dry matter tdm and yield for the irrigated and rainfed as well as the two row spacing treatments for the eac and hrs sites were presented in table 5 irrigation had significant effect on tdm and yields at both sites excepting for hrs where there was a little difference between irrigated and rainfed crops in the 2015 16 season the grain yields were significantly higher in 0 25 m row spacing compared to 1 0 m row spacing treatment in both years and both sites table 5 pooled analysis of the data from all the treatments years and sites revealed a significantly positive relationship p 0 001 between total dry matter tdm r2 0 67 p 0 01 and yield r2 0 73 p 0 01 and the total water extracted during the crop growth fig 6 this analysis revealed water use efficiency of 2 57 g mm for tdm and 1 15 g mm for grain yield 4 discussion the information on soil water extraction by mungbean is limited pannu and singh 1993 most of the earlier research focussed on popular grain legumes such as soybean dugas et al 1990 ren et al 2017 rahman et al 2017 peanut nageswara rao et al 1989 wright et al 1994 udaykumar et al 1998 songsri et al 2009 tahngthong et al 2016 and pasture legumes such as lucerne sim et al 2017 the current study investigated water extraction patterns of mungbean grown under irrigated or rainfed conditions in narrow or wide row spacing treatments in two diverse environments with contrasting seasonal temperatures and vpds figs 1 and 2 the amount of water extracted by irrigated and rainfed crops was similar during early growth phases excepting for hrs in 2015 16 season but differed significantly at reproductive phases pod filling and maturity tables 2 and 3 at both sites highlighting greater demand for water during reproductive phases of the crop the irrigated crops extracted significantly greater amounts of water than rainfed crops during reproductive phases tables 2 and 3 by reproductive phase crops would have attained maximum functional leaf area to transpire water to meet crop s demand as well as enable co2 exchange roder et al 1989 interestingly crops in 0 25 m row spacing treatment extracted more water compared to crops in 1 0 m row spacing during early phase compared to later phases of crop growth in both years and both sites tables 2 and 3 although the differences were not significant the higher water extraction rates by narrow row spacing treatment during early growth phase could be possibly due to greater demand for water from rapidly growing canopy coupled with reduced soil evaporation losses resulting in higher water use efficiency rachaputi et al 2015 the crop simulation scenarios developed using the agricultural production systems simulator model apsim showed that mungbean planted in 0 25 m rows intercepted more solar radiation accessed greater amounts of soil water during early stages of crop growth compared to crops planted in 1 m wide rows rachaputi et al 2015 in general irrigated crops extracted higher amounts of water at both sites in both years tables 2 and 3 although there were significant differences between the two sites for the patterns of water extraction figs 3 and 4 in 2015 16 season less water extraction during pre flowering phase compared to that in reproductive phases at eac was in contrast to greater water extraction during pre flowering phase hrs in the same season tables 2 and 3 however in 2016 17 season reverse trend was observed at hrs with less water extraction at pre flowering phase compared to that at eac the differences in seasonal vapour pressure deficits vpds and temperatures between the sites could have played a key role in differences in water uptake the seasonal average temperatures 30 35 c and vpd 2 3 kpa were markedly higher at eac compared to hrs which had lower average temperatures 25 c and vpds 1 2 kpa inserts in figs 1 and 2 an exponentially negative relationship between vpd and water extraction revealed that higher vpds at eac could partly be responsible for reduced water extraction while low vpds at hrs site would have facilitated greater water extraction fig 5 particularly in 2016 17 season these findings are supported by shirke and pathre 2004 oguntunde 2005 and patanè 2011 who observed the inhibitory effects of high vpds within a range of 2 4 kpa on stomatal conductance in a number of plant species under well watered conditions

water extraction occurred from the top 50 cm zone in the rainfed crops while in irrigated crops the water extraction front reached to 75 cm depth by maturity there was no water extraction beyond 75 cm depth these findings are in support of earlier studies by lawn 1982 who reported little water extraction by mungbean crops from below 70 cm depth in soils and season similar to that of eac however at the hrs site maximum water extraction occurred between 50 75 cm zone for most of the crop growth although some water extraction occurred from 100 cm depth at maturity phase in 2016 17 season at hrs fig 4 data on rooting depth was not collected in the present study but the water extraction patterns indirectly suggest that mungbean might have a root system which accesses water only up to 75 cm

evaporation and deep drainage were not factored in to the computation of water uptake further the water uptake during the rainy days was not measured although the soil moisture was measured before and

11038,mungbean vigna radiata l is an economically important food legume grown in tropics and subtropics and consumed by more than billion people in the world there is limited information on water requirements of and irrigation strategies for mungbean the objective of this study was to investigate water extraction patterns of mungbean grown under rainfed and irrigated conditions in narrow or wide row spacing treatments in two diverse environments the two test environments i e emerald agricultural college eac and hermitage research station hrs in queensland were characterised by contrasting seasonal average temperatures and vapour deficits vpd the amount of water extracted by irrigated and rainfed crops during early growth phase was lower but similar excepting for hrs in 2015 16 season compared to reproductive phase where water extraction was significantly higher the narrow row spacing treatment 0 25 m extracted more water than 1 0 m row spacing treatment during early phases of crop growth only crops at hrs extracted greater amounts of water compared to eac with bulk of the water extraction occurring from the top 50 cm and 75 cm zones in rainfed and irrigated crops respectively however at hrs maximum water was extracted from the top 75 cm zone data pooled across environments revealed an exponentially negative relationship between seasonal vapour pressure deficit and the amount of water extracted there was a significantly positive relationship between the total dry matter and yield and the total water extracted the findings of this study highlighted the variation in crop water requirements of mungbean at different phenophases and the depth of water extraction this information will be useful for developing irrigation management practices to optimise mungbean productivity keywords temperature vapour pressure deficit phenophases shoot dry matter yield mungbean 1 introduction drought and high temperature stress are the major constraints to crop yields in many agricultural regions mungbean vigna radiata l is an important food legume cultivated on 6 2 million ha across wide range of environments between 40 n or s latitudes faostat 2015 the crop is predominantly grown as a summer rainfed crop with india alone accounting for 65 of the world production hanumantharao et al 2016 summer seasons in semi arid tropics and subtropics are characterized by elevated temperatures 35 c kaur et al 2015 and insufficient rainfall muchow 1985 irrigation is scarce in majority of the dryland regions however there is little information on optimal irrigation strategies to achieve high water use efficiency in mungbean pannu and singh 1993 in view of the importance of mungbean as a crop for human diet as well as cash there is a need to explore economically viable and environmentally sustainable solutions to improve rainfed or irrigated water use efficiency to combat drought effects earlier studies reported that mungbean crop could tolerate drought by either forced maturity or stomatal closure pannu and singh 1993 earlier studies investigated the effect of irrigation timing and frequency on productivity of legumes lawn 1982 muchow 1985

al 1984 although the water use efficiency wue for dry matter production remained unchanged in the former but decreased in the latter environments while weekly irrigation of 50 60 mm resulted in highest grain yield of grain legumes including mungbean muchow 1985 a transient moisture stress conditions in early and mid phases of crop growth also resulted in higher productivity nageswara rao et

water extraction by current commercial cultivar of mungbean grown in diverse environments lawn 1982 sim et al 2017 there is also a need to understand the effects of seasonal temperature and vapour pressure deficits on water extraction ability of mungbean the objectives of the present investigation therefore were to evaluate the effects of various management practices such as irrigation row spacing on water extraction and its relation with productivity of mungbean this information will add to the current knowledge on crop water requirements at different growth phases as well as developing appropriate management practices to optimise mungbean productivity in diverse environments 2 material and methods 2 1 sites field experiments were conducted during the summer dec may seasons of the years 2015 16 and 2016 17 at the department of agriculture and fisheries daf research facilities located at emerald agricultural college eac 23 3 s 148 1 e and hermitage hrs 28 2 s 152 1 e in queensland australia the soils at the two sites were deep brown hrs or black vertisols eac with 120 cm depth the two experimental sites represented typical mungbean production environments in cereal legume based cropping systems in the queensland australia 2 2 crop husbandry pure seed of jade obtained from the australian mungbean breeding program was used at the two sites in both years conventionally mungbean has been planted at 1 0 m row spacing in australia mainly to suit the planting machinery available it has also been argued that the 1 0 m inter row spacing would reduce the risk of dry spells as it allows the crop to extract water from inter row space in times of dry spells the current research has been designed to examine the effects of two row spacing treatments on crops productivity and efficiency of water extraction by mungbean at each site the trials were laid out as split plot designs with irrigation irr or rainfed rf treatments as whole plots and three row spacing rsp 1 0 m 0 5 m 0 25 m treatments as sub plots with three replications rep each sub plot was 12 m long and either 4 m at eac or 2 m wide at hrs at least a 12 m buffer crop sown at 50 cm row spacing separated the irr and rf treatments while a 6 m buffer separated rsp treatments all buffers were planted with jade a plant population of approximately 30 4 plants m2 was maintained in all trials prior to sowing seeds were pre treated with a peat slurry of bradyrhizobium spp inoculant group i specific to mungbean http pulseaus com au growing pulses publications pulse inoculation a starter dose of a commercial formulation of zinc n 11 0 p 21 8 s 4 0 and zn 1 0 at a rate of 30 kg ha was applied as part of a standard practice crops were planted at non limiting water condition and subsequently rainfed and supplementary irrigated treatments were established at hrs irrigation was applied using a surface drip system operated by a pressure pump while at eac an overhead sprinkler irrigation system was used at hrs two drip lines of 12 m length with 120 drippers per plot were laid out with each dripper emitting 1 1 l of water per hr amount of water delivered for each plot was calculated as pump time emitting rate dripper hr number of drippers per plot at eac the irrigation amount was estimated by multiplying a pre calibrated rate mm hr for the overhead system with the pumping time the trial details including the sowing and harvesting dates crop duration in crop rainfall and irrigation applied are presented in table 1 appropriate plant protection measures were implemented to maintain the trials pest and disease free 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 weather daily weather maximum temperature maxt minimum temperature mint rainfall and solar radiation parameters were collected from an automatic weather station installed within 1 km from each experimental site figs 1 and 2 the vapour pressure deficits were calculated using daily maximum and minimum temperatures 2 3 2 soil moisture soil moisture was measured at the centres of 25 cm 45 cm 65 cm 85 cm 105 cm and 125 cm depths using a neutron moisture meter nmm 503 dr hydroprobe cpn international at eac and cpn 503 elite hydrobe instrotek inc at hrs in the 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons aluminium tubes of 150 cm length and 50 mm diameter were sunk in the centre rows of sub plots when the crop was around 20 day old and capped to protect from rain two access tubes one between the plants within the row and the other in the middle of two rows inter row were installed in each sub plot to examine the effects of treatments on water extraction however at eac two different neutron moisture meters were used for the 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons at eac during 2015 16 an nmm calibration already available for the experimental site which accounted for 84 of the variation in soil moisture was used and the tubes were installed only in the inter row during 2016 17 season six to eight extra access tubes were installed in the sorghum buffer either crop at eac site or un cropped area hrs site around the experimental site for neutron probe calibration the nmm was calibrated by regressing the volumetric metric soil water content measured at each depth eight to ten times during the season the soil moisture content in the top 0 10 cm layer was simultaneously sampled gravimetrically the data was converted into volumetric units and added to the 25 cm reading made by the hydroprobe the nmm readings accounted for 69 and 74 of variation in soil moisture content at eac and hrs sites respectively the soil moisture was recorded from 4 leaf stage until crop desiccation at 4 5 day intervals in both the seasons at both sites the nmm measurements were made before and after each irrigation or rainfall event the total water extracted at each phenophases was calculated as indicated in eq 1 1 w e x d 1 d 6 t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 t 5 where wex was the water extracted from 125 cm soil profile in a given phenophase d1 and d6 were the depths t1 and t2 were plant available water content pawc in the soil measured at time 1 time 2 and so on the water extracted from each depth in volumetric terms was computed for each phenophase and then accumulated for the 6 depths to arrive at the total water extracted from the 125 cm soil profile 2 3 3 shoot biomass the peak shoot biomass at the end of the seed filling phase and before the start of leaf senescence was harvested from a measured ground area in each plot at eac the peak shoot biomass was recorded on 18 apr 2016 95 das and 06 apr 2017 79 das during the 2015 16 season and 2016 17 seasons respectively at hrs the shoot biomass was recorded on 18 feb 2016 72 das and 17 mar 2017 70 das during the 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons respectively plants were hand harvested from 1 m2 ground area in each plot and plant count recorded the harvested plants were dried in a fan forced oven at 80 c for 48 h before recording shoot leaves stems pods dry weight 2 3 4 grain yield the trials were harvested when 90 of plants had about 80 mature pods as indicated by dark brown pod wall the remaining plot area following the peak dry matter harvest was measured and machine harvested plants were desiccated by applying a foliar spray of glyphosate at 2 l ha 5 7 days prior to machine harvesting the grain samples collected from the mechanical harvester were cleaned to remove any extraneous matter and dried to 12 moisture content before weighing 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was conducted using r program r team core 2017 to quantify the patterns of soil water extraction from different depths at different phenophases a separate analysis was conducted for each site and season means were separated using a tukey test tukey 1949 however for variables having only two mean values were separated using student s t test sigma plot 10 0 systat software san jose ca and r software program were used for graphs 3 results 3 1 weather the mean temperature radiation and cumulative rainfall during 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons at eac and hrs sites are presented in figs 1 and 2 respectively the mean temperatures ranged between 30 35 c during most of the season in both years at eac fig 1 while at hrs the mean temperature during 2015 16 was around 23 c but steadily declined from 25 c to 10 c during 2016 17 season daily radiation varied between 10 and 25 mj m2 day at both sites the radiation declined to 10 mj m2 in the last 3 weeks before final harvest during 2015 16 season at eac while at hrs such a declining trend was observed in the 2016 17 season the total in crop rain at eac was 218 and 262 mm during 2015 16 and 2016 17 seasons respectively but majority of the rain fell during pre flowering phase in 2015 16 and pod filling phase in 2016 17 at hrs however the in crop rainfall was well distributed through the season in both years although in the later season significant rain 100 mm fell during pod set phase the rainfall coupled with a decline in temperature and radiation resulted in extended crop duration at hrs there were marked differences in the seasonal vapour pressure deficit vpd between the sites presented as inserts in the figs 1 and 2 the seasonal vpds at eac ranged between 2 and 4 kpa during the 2015 16 season but steadily declined from 3 to 1 kpa during 2016 17 season the seasonal vpd was much lower at hrs ranging around 1 kpa in both years however there were occasional spikes during later stages of crop growth in 2015 16 and early stages in 2016 17 at hrs 3 2 water extraction by roots the crops in irrigated and rainfed treatments extracted similar amounts of water during early growth phases but the water extraction in the irrigation treatment was significantly higher than the rainfed treatment during reproductive phases at eac tables 2 and 3 by contrast the water extraction pattern was different during pre flowering phase at hrs in 2015 16 with the rainfed crops extracting significantly greater amount of water compared to the irrigated crops only during pre flowering phase table 3 however during late pod filling phase the irrigated crops extracted more water compared to rainfed crops tables 2 and 3 the rates of water extraction from within and in between rows were not significant and hence the values were pooled for a given row spacing the 0 25 m row spacing treatments extracted greater amounts of water during the pre flowering phase at both sites tables 2 and 3 however the row spacing treatment differences continued to be significant even in pod set phase during 2015 16 season at eac with 0 25 m row spacing treatment generally extracting greater amounts of water compared to 1 0 m spacing the water extraction varied significantly with depth in all phenophases in both years and sites table 2 in the 2015 16 season at eac relatively more water was extracted during pod filling pod f and maturity p mat phases particularly in the irrigated treatment fig 3 a there was a clear separation of irr and rf treatments by pod filling phase water extraction front reached to 100 cm depth in 0 25 m row spacing treatment while in the 1 m row spacing water extraction front reached only just over 75 cm by maturity phase in the 2016 17 season however greater water extraction was observed in both irr and rf treatments during pre flowering phase with little or no water extraction below 75 cm fig 3b the a and b letters in each of the figs 3 and 4 represent the 2015 16 and 2016 17 cropping seasons respectively for each of the two sites at hrs during 2015 16 season the rainfed crops extracted more water from the top 50 cm zone particularly in 0 25 m row spacing treatment during pre flowering phase fig 4a interestingly by pod set phase the water extraction front in rainfed crops moved to 75 cm zone in 0 25 cm row spacing while in 1 m row spacing water extraction was limited to 50 cm zone in irrigated crops maximum water extraction occurred from the top to 75 cm by pod set phase in both row spacing treatments by pod filling phase the water extraction front reached 110 cm although the maximum water extraction was from 75 to 100 cm zone fig 4a at hrs in the 2016 17 season the maximum water extraction occurred from the top 50 cm zone during pre flowering phase in all treatments fig 4b however by pod filling phase the extraction front moved below 100 cm with crops in irrigated treatment extracting significantly greater amount of water than the rainfed treatment in both row spacing treatments similar trend continued through the maturity phase although small amounts of water was extracted from 125 cm depth fig 4b the irrigated treatments in general extracted more water than rainfed treatments at both sites table 4 the percentage contribution of water from each of the soil layer to the total water extracted in the row spacing treatments is presented in table 4 it was clear that the contribution from the top layer was the greatest and reduced linearly with the depth in both sites and row spacing treatments vapour pressure deficit vpd is one of the environmental variables that influence the stomatal conductance which in turn affects transpirational pull by plants the vpds ranged from 0 6 to 1 8 kpa at hrs and from 1 5 to 2 8 kpa at eac respectively fig 5 there was an exponentially negative relationship between vpd and the total water extracted the water extraction by roots increased exponentially as the vpd declined with the response being more pronounced at hrs 3 3 shoot dry matter and yield the average shoot dry matter tdm and yield for the irrigated and rainfed as well as the two row spacing treatments for the eac and hrs sites were presented in table 5 irrigation had significant effect on tdm and yields at both sites excepting for hrs where there was a little difference between irrigated and rainfed crops in the 2015 16 season the grain yields were significantly higher in 0 25 m row spacing compared to 1 0 m row spacing treatment in both years and both sites table 5 pooled analysis of the data from all the treatments years and sites revealed a significantly positive relationship p 0 001 between total dry matter tdm r2 0 67 p 0 01 and yield r2 0 73 p 0 01 and the total water extracted during the crop growth fig 6 this analysis revealed water use efficiency of 2 57 g mm for tdm and 1 15 g mm for grain yield 4 discussion the information on soil water extraction by mungbean is limited pannu and singh 1993 most of the earlier research focussed on popular grain legumes such as soybean dugas et al 1990 ren et al 2017 rahman et al 2017 peanut nageswara rao et al 1989 wright et al 1994 udaykumar et al 1998 songsri et al 2009 tahngthong et al 2016 and pasture legumes such as lucerne sim et al 2017 the current study investigated water extraction patterns of mungbean grown under irrigated or rainfed conditions in narrow or wide row spacing treatments in two diverse environments with contrasting seasonal temperatures and vpds figs 1 and 2 the amount of water extracted by irrigated and rainfed crops was similar during early growth phases excepting for hrs in 2015 16 season but differed significantly at reproductive phases pod filling and maturity tables 2 and 3 at both sites highlighting greater demand for water during reproductive phases of the crop the irrigated crops extracted significantly greater amounts of water than rainfed crops during reproductive phases tables 2 and 3 by reproductive phase crops would have attained maximum functional leaf area to transpire water to meet crop s demand as well as enable co2 exchange roder et al 1989 interestingly crops in 0 25 m row spacing treatment extracted more water compared to crops in 1 0 m row spacing during early phase compared to later phases of crop growth in both years and both sites tables 2 and 3 although the differences were not significant the higher water extraction rates by narrow row spacing treatment during early growth phase could be possibly due to greater demand for water from rapidly growing canopy coupled with reduced soil evaporation losses resulting in higher water use

temperatures between the sites could have played a key role in differences in water uptake the seasonal average temperatures 30 35 c and vpd 2 3 kpa were markedly higher at eac compared to hrs which

11039,the lack of base information on crop water requirements under tropical conditions is one of the causes for inefficient water use and inadequate irrigation management the crop coefficient kc approach is universally adopted for scheduling and quantifying the water management and recently its relation with the evaporative atmosphere demand has been included in this approach to improve the decision making on irrigation management in this paper we measured crop evapotranspiration etc in two experiments as evaporative heat flux from a centre pivot irrigated soybean plantations in tropical brazil to quantify the crop water needs irrigation requirements were determined by comparing etc with reference evapotranspiration eto derived from fao 56 allen et al 1998 in this study the average kc value obtained was 0 92 which is nearly 20 lower than those recommended by the fao 56 allen et al 1998 and varied inversely as a function of eto based on aerodynamic and leaf diffusive resistance rs data ω was computed and presented values relatively high compared to other crops which means a relatively poor coupling of soybean canopies to the atmosphere throughout both experiments the kc value

increased the demand for permissions to establish new irrigated soybean fields thereby increasing soybean yields in the tropics kuss et al 2008 garcia y garcia et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 the brazilian national water agency ana agência nacional das águas 2014 has reported that in 2014 new permissions were given to irrigate more than 28 000 land hectares of soybean crops under central pivot systems suitable irrigation practices must be established on the basis of how to use the available water resources more efficiently to achieve higher yields the lack of basic information on crop water needs under tropical conditions is one of the causes for inefficient agricultural water use and inadequate irrigation management in this sense crop water consumption mensuration can be obtained by the product of the reference evapotranspiration eto and the crop coefficient kc resulting is estimated crop evapotranspiration etc allen et al 1998 this approach has been universally adopted for scheduling and quantifying the water amount to be applied to the crops and has been supported by long term data in brazil the increase in irrigated soybean crops urges farmers to improve their irrigation management this approach has been proven useful for practical purposes and several studies have been performed to provide kc values for global soybean production ortega farias et al 2004 karam et al 2005 suyker and verma 2009 payero and irmak 2013 kamble et al 2013 however information about brazilian soybean crops in terms of irrigation management improvement is still scarce previous

common crop variables influence kc e g crop phenology and arrangements ecophysiology characteristics the level of eto during the days prior to irrigation should also be taken into account in this paper we measured etc of an irrigated tropical soybean crop throughout two seasons to a provide kc values based on current soybean crops for improving irrigation management and b to evaluate to what degree the kc values would be affected by atmospheric evaporative demand and to determine the effects of the crop coefficient reference evapotranspiration approach 2 material and methods two soybean crop experiments were conducted at the experimental area of the university of são paulo usp luiz de queiroz college of agriculture esalq piracicaba são paulo state brazil latitude 22 42 s longitude 47

local climate is cwa high altitude tropical climate with rainy summers and dry winters annual average temperature and precipitation are 22 c and 1280 mm respectively both experiments were irrigated by centre pivot sprinklers i wob up3 senninger irrigation inc irrigation frequency and water amount were scheduled based on an agrometeorological water balance model ensuring that soil moisture content exceeded 80 of field capacity and preventing the formation of a shallow root system that would lead to a water supply insufficient to match the atmospheric demand effective root depth was assumed to be 0 50 m for both experiments the 3 ha experimental field was planted with the soybean cultivar brs399 rr at a row spacing of 0 45 m and with 18 seeds per linear metre resulting in a plant density of 35 5 plants m 2 the soil was classified as an eutric rhodic ferralic nitisol with 3 9 organic matter content bulk density of 1480 kg m 3 clay texture sand 286 g kg 1 silt 114 g kg 1 clay 600 g kg 1 and water contents at field capacity and permanent wilting point of 0 338 and 0 249 m3 m 3 respectively crop evapotranspiration etc was determined during the growing seasons by the surface energy balance using the bowen ratio β method based on vertical differences in air temperature δ t and vapour pressure δ e a the reliability of the method was tested following the algorithm presented by perez et al 1999 as this method can show some variation when the variability exceeded 2 h these periods were discarded and interpolations for gap fillings were conducted also data for the entire day were discarded when periods of such undesirable variability exceed 2 h the bowen ratio systems were installed in the centre of each experimental plot measuring the following weather variables surface

standard weather station campbell scientific inc model cr1000 and such sensors located near the experimental field to evaluate the ecophysiological responses of the crop to the weather we measured the diurnal courses of leaf diffusive resistance to water vapour rs which is the inverse of leaf diffusive conductance gs 1 rs with a well calibrated cycling porometer delta t inc model ap4 this was determined during 2 days of the vegetative stage v2 and v5 and 3 days of the reproductive stage r1 r3 and r6 for exp 1 and during 1 day of the vegetative stage v5 and 2 days of the reproductive stage r1 and r2 for exp 2 the rs was measured in three exposed leaves from five different plants from 0800 h to 1800 h local time boundary lines and regression analyses were made using sigmaplot systat software inc version 12 0 to obtain the relationships between the upper limit of the scattering in the diagrams and to indicate the hypothetical response of each independent variable when the other independent ones are not limiting jarvis 1976 jones 1994 mean rs values were also used to compute the decoupling factor ω which was defined by eq 4 and described by mcnaughton and jarvis 1983 the ω is a useful indicator on how the canopy interacts with the atmosphere and hence controls the plant transpiration as responding to weather conceptually ω can be interpreted by analysis of its extreme values as ω tends to unity ω 1 as rs ra 0 this means that the net radiation is the main contributor to the evapotranspiration process and the crop is considered to be decoupled from the atmospheric conditions if ω tends to zero ω 0 as rs ra it indicates the complete coupling of the crop to the atmosphere that is the evapotranspiration process is greatly influenced by the vapour pressure deficit

the duration period of the phenological stages in both experiments irrigation was managed to meet the crop water requirements which were 277 and 378 mm for exp 1 and exp 2 respectively based on the water balance and the possibility of water uptake from deeper layers evapotranspiration in both crops was nonlimited ensuring maximum e t c rates along the soybean crop of exp 1 fig 1a etc was systematically lower than eto with average values of 2 57 0 07 and 3 87 0 09 mm d 1 respectively for exp 1 relative air humidity r h was higher than 76 while average air temperature t was 23 c under these conditions average etc was 4 0 mm d 1 reaching a peak of 5 03 mm d 1 and stayed above 4 0 mm d 1 over a period of 13 days 12 of total length in exp 1 the exp 2 period was relatively warmer with average t and rh values of 23 7 c and 78 6 respectively average values of etc and eto were 3 97 0 10 and 3 50 0 07 mm d 1 respectively fig 1b the etc in exp 2 was generally higher because of the availability of water associated with a high atmospheric demand from the prevailing dry air mass with temperatures ranging from 25 to 35 c and a mean air relative humidity below 73 the etc reached a peak of 6 49 mm d 1 and remained above 4 0 mm d 1 over a period of 55 days 51 of total length for exp 2 the ratio between etc and eto represents the kc value and is determined from the slope of the straight line forced to pass through the origin when considering the whole data across the entire period of the two experiments and separating them by phenological stages the mean kc value of 0 79 0 03 ranging from 0 26 to 1 78 fig 2 a during the initial stages of the reproductive development including blooming and pod development r1 to r4 the mean kc value was 1 12 0 03 ranging from 0 63 to 2 06 fig 2c from the beginning to the end of grain filling stages r5 to r6 etc eto ratio was 0 82 ranging from 0 32 to 1 55 fig 2e indeed the overall mean value of kc was 0 92 0 02 with a statistically significant p 0 001 inverse relationship between kc and eto in both experiments and all phenological phases analized fig 2b d and f angular coefficients of linear regression analysis between gs and weather variables as well as for eto values were negative for all of them but none were statistically significant at 10 however gs in turm responded in a nonlinear manner to air temperature wind speed vpd and solar radiation as showed by boundary lines in fig 3 and respective equations shown in table 1 we found statistically significant p 0 001 inverse relationships between kc values and eto fig 2b d and based on these we proposed kc values for different phenological stages and eto ranges for the two experiments table 2 by comparing the kc values ranging from eto 2 and eto 4 mm d 1 crop water requirements decreased by 44 8 18 4 and 24 2 for vegetative reproductive r1 to r4 and r5 to r6 stages respectively table 2 the average ω value was 0 59 at vegetative stage v1 at the vegetative stage v2 average ω values of 0 88 and 0 70 were obtained for exp 1 and exp 2 respectively for later stages ω decreased to 0 55 in average but still showing a relatively weak canopy atmosphere coupling level table 3 fig 4 shows patterns of hourly variation of gs throughout the two experimental period and the duration period of the phenological stages in both experiments there was a sharp drop in gs over the last hours of the day and gs data was remarkable variable along the daylength mainly in exp 1 fig 4a exp 1 showed relatively higher average gs values along the measurements days excepting for the phenological stage v5 4 discussion the soybean crop kc values agreed with those reported for the same climatic conditions such as the brazilian southern summer doorenbos and pruitt 1977 allen et al 1998 suyker and verma 2009 payero and irmak 2013 however kc values found here were nearly 20 lower than those recommended by the fao 56 allen et al 1998 the kc decreased as eto increased for both experiments and all phenological stages at p 0 001 suggesting that keeping the same kc levels for irrigation management would imply in water and energy waste for growers as well as in unnecessary use of natural water reservoirs due to the increase in aerodynamic resistance or stomatal closure ω tends to be higher in vegetation with less roughness because of an increase in the aerodynamic resistance of the canopy in general ω values showed soybean relatively decoupled to the atmosphere table 2 compared to coffee marin et al 2005 citrus marin et al 2011 sugarcane nassif et al 2014 marin et al 2016 nassif et al 2019 and maize sobenko et al 2018 in those previous papers we hypothesized that one possible explanation for the decline of kc with eto increases is the high level of canopy atmosphere coupling found for those crops under such conditions there would be a feed back between plants and their immediate aerial environment which may diminish the dependence of transpiration on stomatal conductance jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 steduto et al 2009 however for soybean the overall average values of ω 0 59 but the inverse eto kc relationship was also observed casting doubt on our previous hypothesis on gs controlling the crop transpiration as the inverse eto kc relationship occurred regardless of coupling level for canopies completely decoupled from the atmosphere the values of gs were higher than the canopy boundary layer conductance i e the inverse of bulk aerodynamic resistance ra which means that changes in gs will have only a slight effect on transpiration rate and incoming solar radiation would be the primary driver of transpiration in this case despite stomatal control of transpiration is weaker than form highly coupled canopies for ω 0 59 as found herein it is reasonable to accept gs playing some role on the crop transpiration control meinzer et al 1997 meyer and green 1981 stated that soybean gs at approximately the same time each day are subject to a considerable amount of variability even for very high level of available soil water this agrees with gs measuments made for other crops e g rochette et al 1991 angelocci et al 2004 as well as with our dataset the maximum gs values however reached peak values with some optimum combination values for these weather variables rapidly decreasing thereafter as the atmosphere evaporative demand increases teare and kanemasu 1972 sionit and kramer 1976 choudhury 1983 oosterhuis and walker 1987 buttery et al 1993 denmead and shaw 1962 and grantz and zeiger 1986 reported that with high atmospheric water demand even at a high soil water content the relationship between gs and meteorological variables demonstrated that leaves restrict water loss mainly through stomatal closure therefore the relationship between etc and eto seems to be due to an increase in inner resistance to water transport in plants when subjected to conditions of high atmospheric demand for water due to an opposing tendency for transpiration and stomatal movement in relation to increased free air vpd mcnaughton and jarvis 1983 based on the relationships among gs and weather variables fig 3 we selected 30 3 c 1 1 kpa 2 12 m s 1 and 644 w m 2 respectively for air temperature vpd wind speed and solar radiation as corresponding values for the highest gs estimating eto allen et al 1998 from these values a daily rate of 5 17 mm d 1 was found these estimations were based on the assumption that net radiation was 50 of incoming solar radiation and that the photoperiod was 12 h boundary functions showed gs decreases when the atmospheric demand is high corroborating the hypothesis that soybean plants partially control transpiration rates as eto increases allen et al 1998 have claimed that kc values must be used under standard climatic conditions sub humid climate minimum relative humidity of 45 and wind speeds averaging 2 m s 1 and that variations in wind speed may alter aerodynamic resistance and hence kc they also pointed out that kc tends to increase under conditions of high wind speed and air temperatures and low relative humidity our data showed that high air temperature vpd and wind speed tended to restrict soybean transpiration along with changing kc values as eto varied yet we measured etc throughout two irrigated soybean cycles to update kc values specifically for brazilian cultivars and those dataset suggested that the irrigation management procedures suggested by allen et al 1998 should be updated as the use of conventional kc values proposed by allen et al 1998 might lead to a crop water requirement higher than necessary 5 conclusions we measured etc along two irrigated soybean crop plots to update kc values for irrigation management in accordance with the current technologies and practices in southern brazil and discussed the paradigm involving the crop coefficient reference evapotranspiration approach the average kc value obtained was 0 92 and the maximum average value of 1 12 was found between the reproductive stages r1 and r4 representing a value 20 lower than those suggested by allen et al 1998 the kc values decreased as eto at statiscally significant values p 0 001 for both experiment and all phenological stages soybean leaves reduced the stomatal conductance under high air temperature wind speed vpd and mainly solar radiation even with high soil water availability based on these results we proposed that the kc recommendation for practical purposes should take into account the eto values of the previous days before irrigation

11039,the lack of base information on crop water requirements under tropical conditions is one of the causes for inefficient water use and inadequate irrigation management the crop coefficient kc

data ω was computed and presented values relatively high compared to other crops which means a relatively poor coupling of soybean canopies to the atmosphere throughout both experiments the kc value

atmosphere coupling found for those crops under such conditions there would be a feed back between plants and their immediate aerial environment which may diminish the dependence of transpiration on stomatal conductance jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 steduto et al 2009 however for soybean the overall average values of ω 0 59 but the inverse eto kc relationship was also observed casting doubt on our previous hypothesis on gs controlling the crop transpiration as the inverse eto kc relationship occurred regardless of coupling level for canopies completely decoupled from the atmosphere the values of gs were higher than the canopy boundary layer conductance i e the inverse of bulk aerodynamic resistance ra which means that changes in gs will have only a slight effect on transpiration rate and incoming solar radiation would be the primary driver of transpiration in this case despite stomatal control of transpiration is weaker than form highly coupled canopies for ω 0 59 as found herein it is reasonable to accept gs playing some role on the crop transpiration control meinzer et al 1997 meyer and green 1981 stated that soybean gs at approximately the same time each day are subject to a considerable amount of variability even for very high level of available soil water this agrees with gs measuments made for other crops e g rochette et al 1991 angelocci et al 2004 as well as with our dataset the maximum gs values however reached peak values with some optimum combination values for these weather variables rapidly decreasing thereafter as the atmosphere evaporative demand increases teare and kanemasu 1972 sionit and kramer 1976 choudhury 1983 oosterhuis and walker 1987 buttery et al 1993 denmead and shaw 1962 and grantz and zeiger 1986 reported that with high atmospheric water demand even at a high soil water content the relationship between gs and meteorological variables demonstrated that leaves restrict water loss mainly through stomatal closure therefore the relationship between etc and eto seems to be due to an increase in inner resistance to water transport in plants when subjected to conditions of high atmospheric demand for water due to an opposing tendency for transpiration and stomatal movement in relation to increased free air vpd mcnaughton and jarvis 1983 based on the relationships among gs and weather variables fig 3 we selected 30 3 c 1 1 kpa 2 12 m s 1 and 644 w m 2 respectively for air temperature vpd wind speed and solar radiation as corresponding values for the highest gs estimating eto allen et al 1998 from these values a daily rate of 5 17 mm d 1 was found these estimations were based on the assumption that net radiation was 50 of incoming solar radiation and that the photoperiod was 12 h boundary functions showed gs decreases when the atmospheric demand is high corroborating the hypothesis that soybean plants partially control transpiration rates as eto increases allen et al 1998 have claimed that kc values must be used under standard climatic conditions sub humid climate minimum relative humidity of 45 and wind speeds averaging 2 m s 1 and that variations in wind speed may alter aerodynamic resistance and hence kc they also pointed out that kc tends to increase under conditions of high wind speed and air temperatures and low relative humidity our data showed that high air temperature vpd and wind speed tended to restrict soybean transpiration along with changing kc values as eto varied yet we measured etc throughout two irrigated soybean cycles to update kc values specifically for brazilian cultivars and those dataset suggested that the irrigation management procedures suggested by allen et al 1998 should be updated as the use of conventional kc values proposed by allen et al 1998 might lead to a crop water requirement higher than necessary 5 conclusions we measured etc along two irrigated soybean crop plots to update kc values for irrigation management in accordance with the current technologies and practices in southern brazil and discussed the paradigm involving the crop coefficient reference evapotranspiration approach the average kc value obtained was 0 92 and the maximum average value of 1 12 was found between the reproductive stages r1 and r4 representing a value 20 lower than those suggested by allen et al 1998 the kc values decreased as eto at statiscally significant values p 0 001 for both experiment and all phenological stages soybean leaves reduced the stomatal conductance under high air temperature wind speed vpd and mainly solar radiation even with high soil water availability based on these results we proposed that the kc recommendation for practical purposes should take into account the eto values of the previous days before irrigation
