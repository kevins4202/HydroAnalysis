14175,a new modified configuration of pilot scale anoxic anaerobic membrane bioreactor maa mbr was designed for excellent organic and nutrient removal from real urban wastewater with a low carbon nutrient ratio and notable nitrate concentration eight different runs of mixed liquor recycle mlr ratio of 100 600 and hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 12 h were used to identify the optimal operating conditions of the maa mbr system statistical analysis anova of the results showed that the food to microorganism ratio and degradation performance of the system were significantly independent of the aerobic hrt of 3 12 h however chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn removal dropped by 7 at 2 h aerobic hrt the results also highlighted that tn and total phosphorus tp removal were significantly affected by the mlr ratio additionally the maa mbr system was able to improve tp removal by 21 6 comparing to the a2o mbr system at the same operating conditions without any chemical addition the maximum five day biochemical oxygen demand cod tn and tp removal were 99 2 96 9 88 1 and 75 8 respectively at total hrt of 8 1 h and mlr ratio of 400 moreover tp removal improved to 92 0 when methanol was added to the anaerobic reactor in addition more than 87 of the maximum tp and tn removal occurred via the enhanced biological nutrient removal ebnr and the remaining removal happened via the assimilation mechanism in conclusion the proposed maa mbr system is highly efficient for ebnr of wastewater with a high nitrate concentration keywords modified anoxic anaerobic membrane bioreactor maa mbr phosphorus removal nitrogen removal low carbon nutrient ratio hydraulic retention time hrt mixed liquor recycle mlr 1 introduction water eutrophication principally caused by phosphorus p and nitrogen n and strict regulations for water reuse and reclamation have recently become a matter of concern and consideration 1 3 in this context the removal of phosphorus and nitrogen is vital in wastewater treatment enhanced biological nitrogen removal process employs nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria to obtain nitrogen elimination from the wastewater typically the nitrate and nitrite produced by nitrifying bacteria in oxic condition must be returned to an anoxic reactor for denitrification to be carried out therefore it is vital to consider combined anoxic and aerobic reactors in the biological nitrogen removal system under proper control the nitrogen removal efficiency is related to organic matter availability 4 5 unfavorable carbon nitrogen ratio of the feed wastewater often restricts the enhanced biological nitrogen removal process this condition will be even worse when biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal occur simultaneously due to the competition of phosphorus accumulating organisms for chemical oxygen demand cod 6 8 typically phosphorus could be removed via two diﬀ erent processes luxury uptake and assimilation luxury uptake or enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr takes place when the mixed liquor flows through anaerobic and aerobic reactors consecutively while assimilation only occurs via normal cell synthesis in the growth phases both removal processes are stopped when the biomass is saturated or does not produce new cells an inherent problem with ebpr is the interference of nitrate with the phosphorus removal capacity in the anaerobic reactor this interference takes place because of enhanced redox potential and the decreased production of fatty acids which are required for p release 7 9 10 to put it another way in these situations longer anaerobic hydraulic retention time hrt and a more readily biodegradable cod are required to eliminate nitrate concentration also the low carbon nutrient ratio inhibits luxury p release in the anaerobic reactor and p uptake in the anoxic and aerobic reactors notably this drawback will be worse for mbrs with long sludge retention times srts due to very low net biomass growth and the limited phosphorus incorporation in new cells 11 nowadays single membrane bioreactor mbr systems have significantly improved the efficiency of nitrification and organic matter elimination in wastewater treatment processes and have been widely used in water reuse and reclamation 12 13 however studies have reported a high concentration of residual phosphorus and nitrate can still be observed in the permeate of the single mbr system 14 combining anaerobic anoxic and aerobic reactors with mixed liquor recycle mlr lines has been investigated for the removal of phosphorus and nitrogen in wastewater treatment in most of these combined systems such as anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o standard and modified university of cape town uct modified bardenpho 5 stage virginia initiative plant vip johannesburg a20 mbr modified bardenpho mbr and johannesburg mbr process an anaerobic zone is placed as the first zone and feed wastewater is introduced into the anaerobic zone 15 16 good performance of p removal in these combined systems has been observed by many investigators 17 24 however as above stated in this configuration efficient phosphorus removal for wastewater with notable nitrate concentration and a low ratio of cod tp tn is not possible due to interference of nitrate with the phosphorus removal capacity and the shortage of readily biodegradable cod in the anaerobic reactor 25 26 therefore a new modification of reactors configuration should be considered to eliminate nitrate for the improvement of phosphorus removal to address the problems stated above in this research a new modified configuration of pilot scale anoxic anaerobic membrane bioreactor maa mbr was designed to treat real urban wastewater with a low cod tn tp 100 20 8 3 3 ratio and relatively high nitrate concentration in this system the anoxic reactor was employed as the first reactor that received raw wastewater and the anaerobic reactor was placed after the anoxic reactor and only one mlr line was connected between the anoxic reactor and membrane bioreactor tank on the other hand feed and mlr streams were transferred to the anaerobic zone after flowing through the anoxic zone and being freed of nitrate in the present research the maa mbr performance was evaluated under various operating conditions including the fluctuation of substrate concentrations 168 5 418 1 mgcod l 1 hydraulic retention times hrts ranging from 2 12 h mlr rates of 100 600 of influent flow rate and addition of methanol to the anaerobic reactor besides the biomass evolution of the maa mbr pilot plant was also investigated the results were then statistically analyzed to compare nutrient and organic removal performance of the maa mbr system during different operating conditions 2 materials and method 2 1 wastewater characterization in the present research the real wastewater with a low carbon nutrient ratio and relatively high nitrate concentration of 6 1 1 8 mg l 1 as n n 42 was collected directly from the primary sedimentation basin of shiraz urban wastewater treatment plant shiraz iran to investigate the performance of the maa mbr the main characteristics of feed wastewater are shown in table 1 the average cod tn tp of the feed was observed to be 100 20 8 3 3 demonstrating low levels of cod for efficient enhanced biological nutrient removal 25 as demonstrated in table 1 the quality of feed wastewater was highly variable during operating periods 2 2 pilot scale maa mbr set up and operating conditions considering that this study aims to evaluate the performance of a new pilot plant maa mbr system for the treatment of real wastewater with a low carbon nutrient ratio and high nitrate concentration the pilot plant was designed and set up at shiraz urban wastewater treatment plant the treatment capacity of this pilot plant maa mbr was up to 50 l h 1 a configuration drawing of the maa mbr system is presented in fig 1 the maa mbr system is comprised of three zones anoxic anaerobic and aerobic zone having one two immersed membrane modules the membrane module specifications are shown in table 2 as shown in fig 1 the anoxic reactor was fed continuously with raw wastewater by a constant level tank and the permeate was extracted by applying a vacuum pressure tank over the membranes applying a dry vacuum pump based on time interval of 10 min including 9 min and 40 s on and 20 s off in a filtration and backwash cycle the pilot plant was operated with an air backwash device at a pressure of 1 80 bar and the transmembrane pressure was kept less than 0 40 bar to prevent significant membrane flux decline the maa mbr system was only designed with one external mlr line without any internal mlr to improve p removal efficiency the mlr line links the mbr compartment to the anoxic reactor in the anoxic and anaerobic reactors complete mixing was provided by a low speed mixer also bar type diffusers were applied at the lower end of the aerobic reactor to make air bubbles for biological oxidation p uptake and also to create the well mixed active sludge to decrease membrane fouling besides a programmable logic controller was applied to control automatically the integrated operation of the maa mbr system integrating the biological degradation as well as physical membrane separation processes considering the first 55 days of study as the start up stage the whole operation period was completed in 293 days at the beginning of the start up period biomass collected from the return activated sludge stream of shiraz urban wastewater treatment plant at a concentration of 4832 mg l 1 was inoculated to the pilot plant to produce a concentration of 2564 mgmlss l 1 the pilot plant system did not experience any sludge wastage during the first 24 days of study the desired srt of 55 d was set by withdrawing the additional sludge from the bioreactors daily to evaluate the degradation performance of the maa mbr pilot plant on nutrient and organic matter removal eight different runs of the mlr ratio 100 600 hrt and using methanol in the anaerobic reactor were tested according to table 3 during different operating periods the hrts of the anoxic and anaerobic reactor were set to 2 1 2 5 h and 3 1 3 5 h respectively however the hrts of the aerobic reactor varied from 2 12 h the aerobic hrt was estimated considering the liquid volume of the aerobic tank in which the volume of the membrane module was missed during the experimental period the flux value was changed between 4 13 and 6 25 l m 2 h 1 as obvious in table 3 the hrt was adjusted by changing the liquid volume of the tank and influent flow rate and variation of the flux in runs 1 4 one membrane module was used while in runs 5 8 two membrane modules were used in the aerobic reactor dissolved oxygen was measured 0 33 0 05 mg l 1 n 40 and 0 15 0 06 mg l 1 n 40 in the anoxic and anaerobic reactors respectively and was 3 0 0 3 mg l 1 n 40 for the aerobic reactor the temperature of bioreactors was maintained between 27 30 c 2 3 statistical analysis of the data each data point shown on the figures is the average of two measurements one way anova p 0 05 was applied for statistical significance and statistical comparison between various operating conditions anova indicated that there was not a significant difference between effluent concentration removal efficiency of a parameter among various operating conditions if p value was more than 0 05 the steady state data of each run was used in anova the quantity of dispersion or variation from the mean value was displayed as mean value standard deviation besides the confidence interval was presented for data from each operating condition to demonstrate the probable range of the mean value 2 4 analytical methods the experimental measurement of nitrate nitrite total nitrogen tn total ammonia nitrogen tan and cod in feed and permeate were done according to the hach standard tests 27 8039 hr 0 3 30 0 mg l 1 no3 n 8507 lr 0 002 0 300 mg l 1 no2 n 10071 lr 0 5 25 0 mg l 1 as n 8038 nessler method 0 02 2 5 mg l 1 nh3 n and 8000 lr tnt821 3 150 mg l 1 cod hr tnt822

the hach standard methods 8048 avpp 0 02 2 50 mg l 1po4 3 27 the measurement of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and the temperature were done using the standard methods 28 ph was analyzed by a glass electrode ph meter hach sension 3 dissolved oxygen was determined using a dissolved oxygen meter hach sension 6 five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 was measured using a hach bod track apparatus 27 organic nitrogen was determined by following equation organic nitrogen on tn tan nitrate nitrite 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass evolution and f m ratio the biomass growth was determined by measurement of the concentration of mlss in the aerobic reactor over the whole operation period fig 2 displays the changes in the biomass concentration mgmlss l 1 and food to microorganism f m ratio over time as previously stated the maa mbr system was started up using the biomass concentration of 2564 mgmlss l 1 via inoculation gradually during the first 24 days of study the biomass concentration was increased via omitting biomass wastage until a value of 4200 mgmlss l 1 was obtained to achieve the desirable f m ratio of 0 086 kgcod kg 1mlss d 1 that was found in the previous study under similar work conditions 26 by keeping the srt at 55 d the concentration of biomass reached 4068 mgmlss l 1 and 0 089 kgcod kg 1mlss d 1 f m ratio was obtained at the end of the start up stage this value is between a typical mbr f m ratio of 0 05 0 10 kgcod kg 1mlss d 1 as reported by stephenson et al 29 moreover the f m ratio value in the mbr systems is less than the f m ratio value in the conventional activated sludge 0 25 to 0 5 kgbod kg 1mlss d 1 as reported by von sperling 30 the reasons for different f m ratios can be related to various operating conditions especially srt and feed compositions as confirmed by previous researches 31 32 in run 2 at 10 h aerobic hrt the steady state biomass concentration increased to 4506 mgmlss l 1 and the f m ratio of 0 089 0 002 kgcod kg 1mlss d 1 was obtained this trend was also observed for runs 3 7 when the value of aerobic hrt decreased from 10 to 3 h at the end of run 7 the steady state biomass concentration increased to 9064 mgmlss l 1 and a constant f m ratio of 0 089 0 001 kgcod kg 1mlss d 1 was achieved this finding showed that at constant srt the bacteria tend to be active and survive at a constant f m ratio and consequently the concentration of biomass increased with the reduction of hrt to put it another way at the same srt the value of the f m ratio was independent of the aerobic hrt reduction from 12 to 3 h the results of anova confirmed the validity of this finding in which the p value of the f m ratio between runs 1 7 was 0 96 as given in table 4 finally in run 8 when aerobic hrt decreased from 3 to 2 h the steady state biomass concentration with a slight rise reached 9285 150 mgmlss l 1 and the f m ratio increased to 0 099 0 002 kgcod kg 1mlss d 1 it seems that this increase in the f m ratio was related to the reduction of organic removal efficiency of the maa mbr pilot plant at aerobic hrt of 2 h as explained in the next section the dependence of the f m ratio to aerobic hrt of 2 h was confirmed by anova in which the p value of the f m ratio between runs 1 8 was 2 4e 7 as given in table 4 3 2 the maa mbr performance 3 2 1 degradation of cod and bod the organic removal performance of the maa mbr was determined by measuring the bod5 and cod removal fig 3 displays the cod variation of the feed and permeate and cod removal during various operating periods as is clear in fig 3 the cod concentration of the feed was extremely variable in contrast it is evident from table 4 5 and fig 3 that the permeate cod concentration was independent of the variation of the feed cod concentration and was extremely stable during the diﬀ erent operating periods the result was consistent with the results of rosenberger et al 33 and rasool et al 34 in runs 1 7 the steady state concentration of the permeate cod was 11 5 2 2 mg l 1 n 60 table 5 whereas in run 8 in which aerobic hrt was adjusted to be 2 h the steady state concentration of the permeate cod increased to 30 4 4 mg l 1 n 3 these results indicated that the organic removal performance of the maa mbr pilot plant was not affected by the changes of the aerobic hrt from 3 h to 12 h these surprising findings were confirmed by anova in which the p value of the cod removal efficiency between runs 1 7 was 0 81 as shown in table 4 however at the aerobic hrt of 2 h the average cod removal performance of the maa mbr pilot plant decreased by 7 the dependence of the organic removal performance of the maa mbr pilot plant to aerobic hrt of 2 h was confirmed by anova in which the p value of the cod removal between runs 1 8 was 3 9e 14 to investigate the organic removal performance of the anaerobic reactor rate of flow of cod into the anaerobic reactor gcod h 1 and rate of flow of cod out of the anaerobic reactor gcod h 1 was measured and compared with the rate of flow of feed cod into the system as is clear in fig 3 in run 1 the average cod removal efficiency of anaerobic reactor was 13 5 of total influent cod of the system while in runs 2 6 the average cod removal efficiency was about 24 and finally it increased to 27 in run 7 these results revealed that the trend of the cod removal in the anaerobic reactor is the same as the tp removal efficiency of the system which discussed in section 3 2 2 at the optimal condition in run 5 the average influent and effluent cod of the anaerobic reactor were 6 3 gcod h 1 and 4 1 gcod h 1 respectively and the cod removal efficiency was 35 of the anaerobic influent cod which is 24 of the total influent cod to the system 9 0 gcod h 1 as demonstrated in fig 3 the average cod removal of the maa mbr pilot plant was 95 8 0 9 n 60 during runs 1 to run 7 while in run 8 the average cod removal was 89 1 6 n 3 this high cod removal at low values of hrt has also been demonstrated in a previous study that was performed by ren et al 35 who reported that in a submerged mbr when hrt was 1 2 and 3 h the cod removal was 80 91 1 88 5 97 3 and 89 3 97 2 respectively also as exhibited in table 6 there is no significant difference between the cod removal performance of the maa mbr system and the a2o mbr system this result was confirmed by anova in which the p value of the cod removal efficiency between these combined systems was 0 07 as exhibited in fig 4 the feed bod5 was highly variable like cod variation the results of bod5 tests showed that the steady state permeate bod5 of the maa mbr was less than 2 mg l 1during the whole study period except in run 8 in which aerobic hrt was adjusted to 2 h in run 8 the steady state permeate bod5 of the maa mbr system increased to 6 1 4 mg l 1 and the bod5 removal decreased from 99 to 97 excellent performance of bod5 removal in this system was related to the following reasons i complete retention of the all particulate bod in the permeate of the membrane ii at the high srt mbr process due to lack of washout the microorganisms can acclimate to the feed wastewater characteristics in this condition even despite low aerobic hrt of 2 h special microorganisms can be developed that can treat refractory compounds this result is confirmed by other works 36 37 3 2 2 phosphorus removal phosphorus luxury uptake or ebpr takes place when p uptake is beyond the cellular requirement of the bacteria fig 5 shows the ebpr performance of the maa mbr pilot plant during the study period as demonstrated in fig 5 the tp concentration of the feed changes daily and hourly during the diﬀ erent operating periods after system stability at the end of the start up stage when the maa mbr pilot plant was operated under the mlr ratio of 100 and aerobic hrt of 12 h the maximum tp removal and the minimum concentration of permeate tp were 52 7 and 4 7 mg l 1 as p respectively in run 2 when the mlr ratio and the aerobic hrt were 200 and 10 h respectively the maximum tp removal increased to 73 9 and the average and minimum permeate tp concentration decreased to 2 5 0 3 n 4 and 2 3 mg l 1 as p respectively in run 3 in which the aerobic hrt and the mlr ratio were 8 h and 300 respectively the maximum tp removal was 76 7 and the minimum and the average concentration of permeate tp reached 2 0 and 2 2 0 3 mg l 1 as p n 5 respectively similar findings were obtained by run 4 run 5 and run 6 in run 4 at the 400 mlr ratio and the aerobic hrt of 6 h the maximum tp removal of 77 5 was achieved finally in run 6 at the 600 mlr ratio and the aerobic hrt of 3 h the maximum tp removal and the minimum concentration of the permeate tp were 75 8 and 2 1 mg l 1 respectively these results show that the ebpr performance of the maa mbr pilot plant was affected by the operation of the mlr ratio which was consistent with the result of the anova between runs 1 and 2 for removal efficiency of tp p 2 7e 07 as well as the concentration of permeate tp p 0 0008 however the influence of the mlr ratio of more than 200 on the p removal efficiency of the maa mbr pilot plant was negligible this result was confirmed by anova as given in table 4 the results also specify that the influence of the aerobic hrt changes from 3 to 12 h on the p removal efficiency was also negligible for example in runs 4 and 5 at the same mlr ratio when aerobic hrt decreased from 6 h to 4 h the average tp removal was the same value of 74 9 as exhibited in table 6 a maximum tp removal of 55 9 was achieved by the a2o mbr in the previous work of the present authors 26 that was performed on the same wastewater in comparison in the same condition mlr ratio hrt and temperature the ebpr performance of the maa mbr pilot plant is 21 6 more than the performance of the a2o mbr pilot plant in the preceding study the reason for this improvement is related to the location of the mlr line as well as the anaerobic and anoxic reactors in two systems in fact in the maa mbr system feed and mlr stream flow through the anaerobic reactor after passing through the anoxic reactor and are freed of nitrate on the other hand in the a2o mbr system the ebpr is hindered by the presence of nitrate in the anaerobic reactor especially for the shiraz urban wastewater with a low carbon nutrient ratio and relatively high nitrate concentration the p removal quantity by the ebpr process is related to the availability of readily biodegradable cod quantity in the feed wastewater theoretically to eliminate 1 g of p by the ebpr process it is required to provide about 7 11 g of readily biodegradable cod in the anaerobic reactor 15 one of the drawbacks of the maa mbr system in terms of excellent phosphorus removal of the real urban wastewater with a low carbon nutrient ratio is the shortage of readily biodegradable cod in the anaerobic reactor this occurs because most of the readily biodegradable cod is utilized in the anoxic reactor this drawback was worse because of the variation in the feed cod concentration in other words better performance of ebpr systems is obtained when readily biodegradable cod is supplied at a steady rate 15 therefore in run 7 to eliminate the permeate residual p concentration of 2 1 mg l 1 and achieving excellent tp removal methanol with a concentration of 20 mg per one liter of feed wastewater was added in the anaerobic reactor considering methanol has a cod of l 5 gcod g 1methanol 15 theoretically this methanol concentration will be able to eliminate about 3 mg l 1 of p as demonstrated in fig 5 in run 7 the maximum tp removal reached 92 and the average concentration of permeate tp was 0 7 0 1 mg l 1 as p n 4 this result shows that at the same operating conditions the ebpr performance of the maa mbr increased 16 using methanol in the anaerobic compartment in comparison with the run 5 as exhibited in table 6 the research of brown et al 38 in an a2o mbr used for treating synthetic wastewater with a ratio of cod tn tp 100 9 3 2 9 and very low nitrate nitrogen of 0 4 mg l 1 as n showed that tp removal was 72 5 at 4 h anoxic hrt 2 h anaerobic hrt 8 h aerobic hrt and 50 d srt moreover fu et al 4 found that when the cod n ratio increased from 5 3 9 3 the phosphate removal efficiency increased from 50 5 90 5 compared to the other similar experiments the maa mbr performance in terms of p removal with 55 d srt for the treatment of urban wastewater with a low ratio of cod tn tp 100 20 8 3 3 and notable nitrate concentration is high the reasons for this improvement as previously mentioned can be listed as follows a the proper location of anaerobic and anoxic reactors and mlr line in the maa mbr pilot plant to prevent the entrance of nitrate to the anaerobic tank b using methanol in the anaerobic tank at a steady rate based on the composition of cell biomass about 2 3 kg of phosphorus will be required per 100 kg of cell biomass 15 taking the substrate and biomass mass balance into consideration in this study 12 6 of the maximum tp removal occurred via the assimilation process for microbial cell synthesis and 87 4 of the maximum tp removal happened via the ebpr process this surprising finding indicates that the maa mbr pilot plant is very efficient for ebpr normally p content of activated sludge is almost 1 3 while when ebpr is applied the p content of activated sludge is almost 6 7 7 however the mass balance of biomass and phosphorus surprisingly shows a high value of about 18 3 for biomass phosphorus content in this study 3 2 3 removal of nitrogen the nitrogen removal performance of the maa mbr was tested during different operating conditions the concentration of the different nitrogen compounds in the feed wastewater during the period of study is presented in fig 6 a the concentration of all the nitrogen species was highly variable in comparison with other urban wastewaters one unexpected observation was a high influent nitrate concentration of 2 5 10 5 mg l 1 as n high nitrate concentration in the influent wastewater is due to the presence of nitrate in shiraz drinking water about 75 of potable water for drinking purposes in shiraz is supplied by groundwater the concentration of nitrate in some drinking wells of shiraz is about 14 3 0 05 mg l 1 as n 39 another possible reason is the infiltration of agricultural dominated wastewater flows in shiraz urban sewage system 40 41 as previously discussed this notable nitrate concentration in feed wastewater has a significant unfavorable effect on the ebpr performance of the combined processes in which the anaerobic zone is employed as the first reactor which receives raw feed wastewater to overcome this drawback the maa mbr pilot plant was designed in which the anoxic zone is placed as the first reactor that receives raw wastewater fig 6b displays the feed and permeate tan concentration as well as tan removal over the whole experimental period as demonstrated in fig 6b complete nitrification occurred after the first 15 days of study a similar finding was observed by ferraris et al 42 the feed tan concentration was quite variable between 25 2 and 52 3 mg l 1 as n with a mean concentration of 39 4 5 8 mg l 1 as n n 80 in contrast the steady state permeate tan concentration was extremely stable at different operating conditions except in run 8 with 2 h aerobic hrt these findings were confirmed by anova in which p value between runs 1 7 was 0 24 and p value between runs 1 8 was 4 0e 25 as given in table 4 the permeate tan concentration was obtained to be 0 29 0 1 mg l 1 as n n 63 with tan removal efﬁciency of above 99 from runs 1 7 and in run 8 the steady state permeate tan concentration increased to 1 8 0 2 mg l 1 as n n 3 and tan removal decreased to 95 the results revealed that the nitrification performance of the maa mbr pilot plant was not affected by the changes in the aerobic hrt between 3 and 12 h however in the 2 h aerobic hrt the performance of the maa mbr decreased by 5 complete nitrification at low values of aerobic hrt 2 8 h has been reported by many investigators and it seems to be one of the main characteristics of the high srt mbr systems 43 45 however thanh et al 46 reported that when hrt decreased from 4 h to 2 h the ammonia removal efficiency of a sponge mbr system which was used for the treatment of a low strength catfish farm wastewater decreased from 99 to 86 fig 6c displays the concentration of the different nitrogen compounds in permeate during the period of study the steady state concentration of nitrite and tkn in permeate was independent of the mlr ratio of 100 600 and the aerobic hrts in the range of 3 12 h the total concentration of nitrite and tkn was 1 6 0 14 mg l 1 as n n 32 during the whole study period this result was confirmed by anova in which p value between runs 1 7 was 0 15 see table 4 by contrast the average steady state concentration of permeate nitrate declined rapidly from 15 7 0 3 mg l 1 as n n 3 to 10 0 0 2 mg l 1 as n n 5 after the ratio of mlr was raised from 100 to 200 this trend continued in run 3 at the 300 mlr ratio in which the average steady state permeate nitrate decreased to 7 2 0 3 mg l 1 as n n 13 similarly in run 5 at the 400 mlr ratio the average steady state permeate nitrate reduced to 5 4 0 3 mg l 1 as n n 6 finally in run 6 at the 600 mlr ratio the average steady state permeate nitrate with a slight decline reached 3 7 0 2 mg l 1 as n n 3 the feed and permeate of tn and the tn removal are revealed in fig 6d in run 1 at 100 mlr ratio the average steady state tn removal efficiency was 69 3 0 4 n 3 in run 2 when the mlr ratio increased to 200 the average steady state tn removal efficiency increased to 79 2 0 3 n 4 this trend continued in run 3 at the 300 mlr ratio in which the average steady state tn removal efficiency reached 84 2 0 4 n 5 similarly in run 5 in which the mlr ratio increased to 400 the average steady state tn removal efficiency increased to 87 4 0 4 n 6 then in run 6 at the 600 mlr ratio the maximum tn removal efficiency with a slight increase was observed at 91 0 finally in run 7 at the mlr ratio of 400 when methanol was added in the anaerobic tank the maximum tn removal of this maa mbr pilot plant was 89 5 and the minimum permeate nitrate was 4 4 mg l 1 as n that in comparison with run 5 with the same mlr ratio has a 2 1 improvement in the efficiency it is clear from fig 6d that nitrogen removal performance of the maa mbr pilot plant is independent of the aerobic hrt 3 12 h for example in runs 4 and 5 with the same mlr ratio when hrt declined from 6 h to 4 h the maximum tn removal was almost the same value of 88 however in run 8 at the 2 h aerobic hrt the average tn removal decreased from 87 4 0 4 n 6 to 80 0 0 4 3 with the minimum permeate tn of 11 2 mg l 1 as n compared to the run 5 with the same mlr ratio 400 the results also highlighted the nitrogen removal performance of this maa mbr pilot plant is significantly dependent on the mlr ratio however the mlr ratio above 300 is not very significant in the performance of the maa mbr system based on the composition of cell biomass about 12 2 kg of nitrogen will be required per 100 kg of cell biomass 15 the mass balance of biomass and substrate around the system reveal that 10 8 of the maximum tn removal occurred via the assimilation mechanism removal and 89 2 of the maximum tn removal was happened via the enhanced biological nitrogen removal mechanism this surprising finding indicated that the maa mbr pilot plant was very efficient for enhanced biological nitrogen removal as exhibited in table 6 the nitrogen removal performance of this maa mbr is slightly more than the nitrogen removal of the a2o mbr in the previous study under the same condition temperature mlr ratio aerobic hrt and feed wastewater 26 for example at mlr ratio of 400 and aerobic hrt of 6 h the maximum tn removal of the a2o mbr was 86 2 whereas it increased to 88 0 in this maa mbr system it is evident that this slight improvement is due to the location of the anoxic reactor in the maa mbr system and consequently readily biodegradable cod is easily available to the facultative heterotrophic bacteria chae and shin 47 investigated the performance of a vertical submerged mbr used for treating urban wastewater with a ratio of cod tn tp 100 18 1 1 38 and free of nitrate concentration they reported that the average tn removal was 74 at 8 h hrt and 60 d srt moreover the research of song et al 48 in a sequencing anoxic anaerobic mbr system for the treatment of wastewater with a ratio of cod tn tp 100 19 7 2 0 indicated that the maximum removal of tn was 56 at 8 h total hrt and 78 d srt in comparison with other previous works that were performed on the similar feed wastewater the very high removal of nitrogen in the maa mbr system can be ascribed to the following reasons optimal location of the anoxic reactor in the configuration of the maa mbr system complete nitrification in the aerobic zone proper ratio of mlr and providing suitable condition for the anoxic reactor very good mixing low dissolved oxygen 0 4 mg l 1 and temperature of 27 30 c 4 conclusions excellent nutrient and organic matter removal were achieved by a new maa mbr pilot plant used for treating urban wastewater with a low carbon nutrient ratio and relatively high nitrate concentration the results highlighted the key role of the mlr ratio on the tn and tp removal performance of the maa mbr pilot plant also the results showed that the treatment performance of the maa mbr and f m ratio were significantly independent of the aerobic hrt 3 12 h however at 2 h aerobic hrt the performance of the maa mbr decreased by 7 considering the essential factors of treatment efficiency and cost effective design and operation the optimal conditions for the maa mbr system are 8 1 h total hrt and 400 mlr ratio in these conditions the maximum bod5 cod tn tp and tan removal reached 99 2 96 9 88 1 75 8 and 99 4 respectively the minimum bod5 cod tn tp and tan in the permeate were observed to be 1 0 10 0 6 7 2 1 and 0 25 mg l 1 respectively also the addition of methanol to the anaerobic reactor improved the tp removal up to 92 with a minimum permeate tp concentration of 0 6 mg l 1 in addition a comparison of the proposed maa mbr system with the a2o mbr system showed a tp removal improvement of 21 6 without any chemical addition in conclusion the results of this pilot plant illustrated that the proposed maa mbr process is highly efficient for enhanced biological nutrient removal and can be used to treat urban wastewater with a high nitrate concentration and a low carbon nutrient ratio to

14175,a new modified configuration of pilot scale anoxic anaerobic membrane bioreactor maa mbr was designed for excellent organic and nutrient removal from real urban wastewater with a low carbon nutrient ratio and notable nitrate concentration eight different runs of mixed liquor recycle mlr ratio of 100 600 and hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 12 h were used to identify the optimal operating conditions of the maa mbr system statistical analysis anova of the results showed that the food to microorganism ratio and degradation performance of the system were significantly independent of the aerobic hrt of 3 12 h however chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn removal dropped by 7 at 2 h aerobic hrt the results also highlighted that tn and total phosphorus tp removal were significantly affected by the mlr ratio additionally the maa mbr system was able to improve tp removal by 21 6 comparing to the a2o mbr system at the same operating conditions without any chemical addition the maximum five day biochemical oxygen demand cod tn and tp removal were 99 2 96 9 88 1 and 75 8 respectively at total hrt of 8 1 h and mlr ratio of 400 moreover tp removal improved to 92 0 when methanol was added to the anaerobic reactor in addition more than 87 of the maximum tp and tn removal occurred via the enhanced biological nutrient removal ebnr and the remaining removal happened via the assimilation mechanism in conclusion the proposed maa mbr system is highly efficient for ebnr of wastewater with a high nitrate concentration keywords modified anoxic anaerobic membrane bioreactor maa mbr phosphorus removal nitrogen removal low carbon nutrient ratio hydraulic retention time hrt mixed liquor recycle mlr 1 introduction water eutrophication principally caused by phosphorus p and nitrogen n and strict regulations for water reuse and reclamation have recently become a matter of concern and consideration 1 3 in this context the removal of phosphorus and nitrogen is vital in wastewater treatment enhanced biological nitrogen removal process employs nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria to obtain nitrogen elimination from the wastewater typically the nitrate and nitrite produced by nitrifying bacteria in oxic condition must be returned to an anoxic reactor for denitrification to be carried out therefore it is vital to consider combined anoxic and aerobic reactors in the biological nitrogen removal system under proper control the nitrogen removal efficiency is related to organic matter availability 4 5 unfavorable carbon nitrogen ratio of the feed wastewater often restricts the enhanced biological nitrogen removal process this condition will be even worse when biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal occur simultaneously due to the competition of phosphorus accumulating organisms for chemical oxygen demand cod 6 8 typically phosphorus could be removed via two diﬀ erent processes luxury uptake and assimilation luxury uptake or enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr takes place when the mixed liquor flows through anaerobic and aerobic reactors consecutively while assimilation only occurs via normal cell synthesis in the growth phases both removal processes are stopped when the biomass is saturated or does not produce new cells an inherent problem with ebpr is the interference of nitrate with the phosphorus removal capacity in the anaerobic reactor this interference takes place because of enhanced redox potential and the decreased production of fatty acids which are required for p release 7 9 10 to put it another way in these situations longer anaerobic hydraulic retention time hrt and a more readily biodegradable cod are required to eliminate nitrate concentration also the low carbon nutrient ratio inhibits luxury p release in the anaerobic reactor and p uptake in the anoxic and aerobic reactors notably this drawback will be worse for mbrs with long sludge retention times srts due to very low net biomass growth and the limited phosphorus incorporation in new cells 11 nowadays single membrane bioreactor mbr systems have significantly improved the efficiency of nitrification and organic matter elimination in wastewater treatment processes and have been widely used in water reuse and reclamation 12 13 however studies have reported a high concentration of residual phosphorus and nitrate can still be observed in the permeate of the single mbr system 14 combining anaerobic anoxic and aerobic reactors with mixed liquor recycle mlr lines has been investigated for the removal of phosphorus and nitrogen in wastewater treatment in most of these combined systems such as anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o standard and modified university of cape town uct modified bardenpho 5 stage virginia initiative plant vip johannesburg a20 mbr modified bardenpho mbr and johannesburg mbr process an anaerobic zone is placed as the first zone and feed wastewater is introduced into the anaerobic zone 15 16 good performance of p removal in these combined systems has been observed by many investigators 17 24 however as above stated in this configuration efficient phosphorus removal for wastewater with notable nitrate concentration and a low ratio of cod tp tn is not possible due to interference of nitrate with the phosphorus removal capacity and the shortage of readily biodegradable cod in the anaerobic reactor 25 26 therefore a new modification of reactors configuration should be considered to eliminate nitrate for the improvement of phosphorus removal to address the problems stated above in this research a new modified configuration of pilot scale anoxic anaerobic membrane bioreactor maa mbr was designed to treat real urban wastewater with a low cod tn tp 100 20 8 3 3 ratio and relatively high nitrate concentration in this system the anoxic reactor was employed as the first reactor that received raw wastewater and the anaerobic reactor was placed after the anoxic reactor and only one mlr line was connected between the anoxic reactor and membrane bioreactor tank on the other hand feed and mlr streams were transferred to the anaerobic zone after flowing through the anoxic zone and being freed of nitrate in the present research the maa mbr performance was evaluated under various operating conditions including the fluctuation of substrate concentrations 168 5 418 1 mgcod l 1 hydraulic retention times hrts ranging from 2 12 h mlr rates of 100 600 of influent flow rate and addition of methanol to the anaerobic reactor besides the biomass evolution of the maa mbr pilot plant was also investigated the results were then statistically analyzed to compare nutrient and organic removal performance of the maa mbr system during different operating conditions 2 materials and method 2 1 wastewater characterization in the present research the real wastewater with a low carbon nutrient ratio and relatively high nitrate concentration of 6 1 1 8 mg l 1 as n n 42 was collected directly from the primary sedimentation basin of shiraz urban wastewater treatment plant shiraz iran to investigate the performance of the maa mbr the main characteristics of feed wastewater are shown in table 1 the average cod tn tp of the feed was observed to be 100 20 8 3 3 demonstrating low levels of cod for efficient enhanced biological nutrient removal 25 as demonstrated in table 1 the quality of feed wastewater was highly variable during operating periods 2 2 pilot scale maa mbr set up and operating conditions considering that this study aims to evaluate the performance of a new pilot plant maa mbr system for the treatment of real wastewater with a low carbon nutrient ratio and high nitrate concentration the pilot plant was designed and set up at shiraz urban wastewater treatment plant the treatment capacity of this pilot plant maa mbr was up to 50 l h 1 a configuration drawing of the maa mbr system is presented in fig 1 the maa mbr system is comprised of three zones anoxic anaerobic and aerobic zone having one two immersed membrane modules the membrane module specifications are shown in table 2 as shown in fig 1 the anoxic reactor was fed continuously with raw wastewater by a constant level tank and the permeate was extracted by applying a vacuum pressure tank over the membranes applying a dry vacuum pump based on time interval of 10 min including 9 min and 40 s on and 20 s off in a filtration and backwash cycle the pilot plant was operated with an air backwash device at a pressure of 1 80 bar and the transmembrane pressure was kept less than 0 40 bar to prevent significant membrane flux decline the maa mbr system was only designed with one external mlr line without any internal mlr to improve p removal efficiency the mlr line links the mbr compartment to the anoxic reactor in the anoxic and anaerobic reactors complete mixing was provided by a low speed mixer also bar type diffusers were applied at the lower end of the aerobic reactor to make air bubbles for biological oxidation p uptake and also to create the well mixed active sludge to decrease membrane fouling besides a programmable logic controller was applied to control automatically the integrated operation of the maa mbr system integrating the biological degradation as well as physical membrane separation processes considering the first 55 days of study as the start up stage the whole operation period was completed in 293 days at the beginning of the start up period biomass collected from the return activated sludge stream of shiraz urban wastewater treatment plant at a concentration of 4832 mg l 1 was inoculated to the pilot plant to produce a concentration of 2564 mgmlss l 1 the pilot plant system did not experience any sludge wastage during the first 24 days of study the desired srt of 55 d was set by withdrawing the additional sludge from the bioreactors daily to evaluate the degradation performance of the maa mbr pilot plant on nutrient and organic matter removal eight different runs of the mlr ratio 100 600 hrt and using methanol in the anaerobic reactor were tested according to table 3 during different operating periods the hrts of the anoxic and anaerobic reactor were set to 2 1 2 5 h and 3 1 3 5 h respectively however the hrts of the aerobic reactor varied from 2 12 h the aerobic hrt was estimated considering the liquid volume of the aerobic tank in which the volume of the membrane module was missed during the experimental period the flux value was changed between 4 13 and 6 25 l m 2 h 1 as obvious in table 3 the hrt was adjusted by changing the liquid volume of the tank and influent flow rate and variation of the flux in runs 1 4 one membrane module was used while in runs 5 8 two membrane modules were used in the aerobic reactor dissolved oxygen was measured 0 33 0 05 mg l 1 n 40 and 0 15 0 06 mg l 1 n 40 in the anoxic and anaerobic reactors respectively and was 3 0 0 3 mg l 1 n 40 for the aerobic reactor the temperature of bioreactors was maintained between 27 30 c 2 3 statistical analysis of the data each data point shown on the figures is the average of two measurements one way anova p 0 05 was applied for statistical significance and statistical comparison between various operating conditions anova indicated that there was not a significant difference between effluent concentration removal efficiency of a parameter among various operating conditions if p value was more than 0 05 the steady state data of each run was used in anova the quantity of dispersion or variation from the mean value was displayed as mean value standard deviation besides the confidence interval was presented for data from each operating condition to demonstrate the probable range of the mean value 2 4 analytical methods the experimental measurement of nitrate nitrite total nitrogen tn total ammonia nitrogen tan and cod in feed and permeate were done according to the hach standard tests 27 8039 hr 0 3 30 0 mg l 1 no3 n 8507 lr 0 002 0 300 mg l 1 no2 n 10071 lr 0 5 25 0 mg l 1 as n 8038 nessler method 0 02 2 5 mg l 1 nh3 n and 8000 lr tnt821 3 150 mg l 1 cod hr tnt822

the hach standard methods 8048 avpp 0 02 2 50 mg l 1po4 3 27 the measurement of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and the temperature were done using the standard methods 28 ph was analyzed by a glass electrode ph meter hach sension 3 dissolved oxygen was determined using a dissolved oxygen meter hach sension 6 five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 was measured using a hach bod track apparatus 27 organic nitrogen was determined by following equation organic nitrogen on tn tan nitrate nitrite 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass evolution and f m ratio the biomass growth was determined by measurement of the concentration of mlss in the aerobic reactor over the whole operation period fig 2 displays the changes in the biomass concentration mgmlss l 1 and food to microorganism f m ratio over time as previously stated the maa mbr system was started up using the biomass concentration of 2564 mgmlss l 1 via inoculation gradually during the first 24 days of study the biomass concentration was increased via omitting biomass wastage until a value of 4200 mgmlss l 1 was obtained to achieve the desirable f m ratio of 0 086 kgcod kg 1mlss d 1 that was found in the previous study under similar work conditions 26 by keeping the srt at 55 d the concentration of biomass reached 4068 mgmlss l 1 and 0 089 kgcod kg 1mlss d 1 f m ratio was obtained at the end of the start up stage this value is between a typical mbr f m ratio of 0 05 0 10 kgcod kg 1mlss d 1 as reported by stephenson et al 29 moreover the f m ratio value in the mbr systems is less than the f m ratio value in the conventional activated sludge 0 25 to 0 5 kgbod kg 1mlss d 1 as reported by von sperling 30 the reasons for different f m ratios can be related to various operating conditions especially srt and feed compositions as confirmed by previous researches 31 32 in run 2 at 10 h aerobic hrt the steady state biomass concentration increased to 4506 mgmlss l 1 and the f m ratio of 0 089 0 002 kgcod kg 1mlss d 1 was obtained this trend was also observed for runs 3 7 when the value of aerobic hrt decreased from 10 to 3 h at the end of run 7 the steady state biomass concentration increased to 9064 mgmlss l 1 and a constant f m ratio of 0 089 0 001 kgcod kg 1mlss d 1 was achieved this finding showed that at constant srt the bacteria tend to be active and survive at a constant f m ratio and consequently the concentration of biomass increased with the reduction of hrt to put it another way at the same srt the value of the f m ratio was independent of the aerobic hrt reduction from 12 to 3 h the results of anova confirmed the validity of this finding in which the p value of the f m ratio between runs 1 7 was 0 96 as given in table 4 finally in run 8 when aerobic hrt decreased from 3 to 2 h the steady state biomass concentration with a slight rise reached 9285 150 mgmlss l 1 and the f m ratio increased to 0 099 0 002 kgcod kg 1mlss d 1 it seems that this increase in the f m ratio was related to the reduction of organic removal efficiency of the maa mbr pilot plant at aerobic hrt of 2 h as explained in the next section the dependence of the f m ratio to aerobic hrt of 2 h was confirmed by anova in which the p value of the f m ratio between runs 1 8 was 2 4e 7 as given in table 4 3 2 the maa mbr performance 3 2 1 degradation of cod and bod the organic removal performance of the maa mbr was determined by measuring the bod5 and cod removal fig 3 displays the cod variation of the feed and permeate and cod removal during various operating periods as is clear in fig 3 the cod concentration of the feed was extremely variable in contrast it is evident from table 4 5 and fig 3 that the permeate cod concentration was independent of the variation of the feed cod concentration and was extremely stable during the diﬀ erent operating periods the result was consistent with the results of rosenberger et al 33 and rasool et al 34 in runs 1 7 the steady state concentration of the permeate cod was 11 5 2 2 mg l 1 n 60 table 5 whereas in run 8 in which aerobic hrt was adjusted to be 2 h the steady state concentration of the permeate cod increased to 30 4 4 mg l 1 n 3 these results indicated that the organic removal performance of the maa mbr pilot plant was not affected by the changes of the aerobic hrt from 3 h to 12 h these surprising findings were confirmed by anova in which the p value of the cod removal efficiency between runs 1 7 was 0 81 as shown in table 4 however at the aerobic hrt of 2 h the average cod removal performance of the maa mbr pilot plant decreased by 7 the dependence of the organic removal performance of the maa mbr pilot plant to aerobic hrt of 2 h was confirmed by anova in which the p value of the cod removal between runs 1 8 was 3 9e 14 to investigate the organic removal performance of the anaerobic reactor rate of flow of cod into the anaerobic reactor gcod h 1 and rate of flow of cod out of the anaerobic reactor gcod h 1 was measured and compared with the rate of flow of feed cod into the system as is clear in fig 3 in run 1 the average cod removal efficiency of anaerobic reactor was 13 5 of total influent cod of the system while in runs 2 6 the average cod removal efficiency was about 24 and finally it increased to 27 in run 7 these results revealed that the trend of the cod removal in the anaerobic reactor is the same as the tp removal efficiency of the system which discussed in section 3 2 2 at the optimal condition in run 5 the average influent and effluent cod of the anaerobic reactor were 6 3 gcod h 1 and 4 1 gcod h 1 respectively and the cod removal efficiency was 35 of the anaerobic influent cod which is 24 of the total influent cod to the system 9 0 gcod h 1 as demonstrated in fig 3 the average cod removal of the maa mbr pilot plant was 95 8 0 9 n 60 during runs 1 to run 7 while in run 8 the average cod removal was 89 1 6 n 3 this high cod removal at low values of hrt has also been demonstrated in a previous study that was performed by ren et al 35 who reported that in a submerged mbr when hrt was 1 2 and 3 h the cod removal was 80 91 1 88 5 97 3 and 89 3 97 2 respectively also as exhibited in table 6 there is no significant difference between the cod removal performance of the maa mbr system and the a2o mbr system this result was confirmed by anova in which the p value of the cod removal efficiency between these combined systems was 0 07 as exhibited in fig 4 the feed bod5 was highly variable like cod variation the results of bod5 tests showed that the steady state permeate bod5 of the maa mbr was less than 2 mg l 1during the whole study period except in run 8 in which aerobic hrt was adjusted to 2 h in run 8 the steady state permeate bod5 of the maa mbr system increased to 6 1 4 mg l 1 and the bod5 removal decreased from 99 to 97 excellent performance of bod5 removal in this system was related to the following reasons i complete retention of the all particulate bod in the permeate of the membrane ii at the high srt mbr process due to lack of washout the microorganisms can acclimate to the feed wastewater characteristics in this condition even despite low aerobic hrt of 2 h special microorganisms can be developed that can treat refractory compounds this result is confirmed by other works 36 37 3 2 2 phosphorus removal phosphorus luxury uptake or ebpr takes place when p uptake is beyond the cellular requirement of the bacteria fig 5 shows the ebpr performance of the maa mbr pilot plant during the study period as demonstrated in fig 5 the tp concentration of the feed changes daily and hourly during the diﬀ erent operating periods after system stability at the end of the start up stage when the maa mbr pilot plant was operated under the mlr ratio of 100 and aerobic hrt of 12 h the maximum tp removal and the minimum concentration of permeate tp were 52 7 and 4 7 mg l 1 as p respectively in run 2 when the mlr ratio and the aerobic hrt were 200 and 10 h respectively the maximum tp removal increased to 73 9 and the average and minimum permeate tp concentration decreased to 2 5 0 3 n 4 and 2 3 mg l 1 as p respectively in run 3 in which the aerobic hrt and the mlr ratio were 8 h and 300 respectively the maximum tp removal was 76 7 and the minimum and the average concentration of permeate tp reached 2 0 and 2 2 0 3 mg l 1 as p n 5 respectively similar findings were obtained by run 4 run 5 and run 6 in run 4 at the 400 mlr ratio and the aerobic hrt of 6 h the maximum tp removal of 77 5 was achieved finally in run 6 at the 600 mlr ratio and the aerobic hrt of 3 h the maximum tp removal and the minimum concentration of the permeate tp were 75 8 and 2 1 mg l 1 respectively these results show that the ebpr performance of the maa mbr pilot plant was affected by the operation of the mlr ratio which was consistent with the result of the anova between runs 1 and 2 for removal efficiency of tp p 2 7e 07 as well as the concentration of permeate tp p 0 0008 however the influence of the mlr ratio of more than 200 on the p removal efficiency of the maa mbr pilot plant was negligible this result was confirmed by anova as given in table 4 the results also specify that the influence of the aerobic hrt changes from 3 to 12 h on the p removal efficiency was also negligible for example in runs 4 and 5 at the same mlr ratio when aerobic hrt decreased from 6 h to 4 h the average tp removal was the same value of 74 9 as exhibited in table 6 a maximum tp removal of 55 9 was achieved by the a2o mbr in the previous work of the present authors 26 that was performed on the same wastewater in comparison in the same condition mlr ratio hrt and temperature the ebpr performance of the maa mbr pilot plant is 21 6 more than the performance of the a2o mbr pilot plant in the preceding study the reason for this improvement is related to the location of the mlr line as well as the anaerobic and anoxic reactors in two systems in fact in the maa mbr system feed and mlr stream flow through the anaerobic reactor after passing through the anoxic reactor and are freed of nitrate on the other hand in the a2o mbr system the ebpr is hindered by the presence of nitrate in the anaerobic reactor especially for the shiraz urban wastewater with a low carbon nutrient ratio and relatively high nitrate concentration the p removal quantity by the ebpr process is related to the availability of readily biodegradable cod quantity in the feed wastewater theoretically to eliminate 1 g of p by the ebpr process it is required to provide about 7 11 g of readily biodegradable cod in the anaerobic reactor 15 one of the drawbacks of the maa mbr system in terms of excellent phosphorus removal of the real urban wastewater with a low carbon nutrient ratio is the shortage of readily biodegradable cod in the anaerobic reactor this occurs because most of the readily biodegradable cod is utilized in the anoxic reactor this drawback was worse because of the variation in the feed cod concentration in other words better performance of ebpr systems is obtained when readily biodegradable cod is supplied at a steady rate 15 therefore in run 7 to eliminate the permeate residual p concentration of 2 1 mg l 1 and achieving excellent tp removal methanol with a concentration of 20 mg per one liter of feed wastewater was added in the anaerobic reactor considering methanol has a cod of l 5 gcod g 1methanol 15 theoretically this methanol concentration will be able to eliminate about 3 mg l 1 of p as demonstrated in fig 5 in run 7 the maximum tp removal reached 92 and the average concentration of permeate tp was 0 7 0 1 mg l 1 as p n 4 this result shows that at the same operating conditions the ebpr performance of the maa mbr increased 16 using methanol in the anaerobic compartment in comparison with the run 5 as exhibited in table 6 the research of brown et al 38 in an a2o mbr used for treating synthetic wastewater with a ratio of cod tn tp 100 9 3 2 9 and very low nitrate nitrogen of 0 4 mg l 1 as n showed that tp removal was 72 5 at 4 h anoxic hrt 2 h anaerobic hrt 8 h aerobic hrt and 50 d srt moreover fu et al 4 found that when the cod n ratio increased from 5 3 9 3 the phosphate removal efficiency increased from 50 5 90 5 compared to the other similar experiments the maa mbr performance in terms of p removal with 55 d srt for the treatment of urban wastewater with a low ratio of cod tn tp 100 20 8 3 3 and notable nitrate concentration is high the reasons for this improvement as previously mentioned can be listed as follows a the proper location of anaerobic and anoxic reactors and mlr line in the maa mbr pilot plant to prevent the entrance of nitrate to the anaerobic tank b using methanol in the anaerobic tank at a steady rate based on the composition of cell biomass about 2 3 kg of phosphorus will be required per 100 kg of cell biomass 15 taking the substrate and biomass mass balance into consideration in this study 12 6 of the maximum tp removal occurred via the assimilation process for microbial cell synthesis and 87 4 of the maximum tp removal happened via the ebpr process this surprising finding indicates that the maa mbr pilot plant is very efficient for ebpr normally p content of activated sludge is almost 1 3 while when ebpr is applied the p content of activated sludge is almost 6 7 7 however the mass balance of biomass and phosphorus surprisingly shows a high value of about 18 3 for biomass phosphorus content in this study 3 2 3 removal of nitrogen the nitrogen removal performance of the maa mbr was tested during different operating conditions the concentration of the different nitrogen compounds in the feed wastewater during the period of study is presented in fig 6 a the concentration of all the nitrogen species was highly variable in comparison with other urban wastewaters one unexpected observation was a high influent nitrate concentration of 2 5 10 5 mg l 1 as n high nitrate concentration in the influent wastewater is due to the presence of nitrate in shiraz drinking water about 75 of potable water for drinking purposes in shiraz is supplied by groundwater the concentration of nitrate in some drinking wells of shiraz is about 14 3 0 05 mg l 1 as n 39 another possible reason is the infiltration of agricultural dominated wastewater flows in shiraz urban sewage system 40 41 as previously discussed this notable nitrate concentration in feed wastewater has a significant unfavorable effect on the ebpr performance of the combined processes in which the anaerobic zone is employed as the first reactor which receives raw feed wastewater to overcome this drawback the maa mbr pilot plant was designed in which the anoxic zone is placed as the first reactor that receives raw wastewater fig 6b displays the feed and permeate tan concentration as well as tan removal over the whole experimental period as demonstrated in fig 6b complete nitrification occurred after the first 15 days of study a similar finding was observed by ferraris et al 42 the feed tan concentration was quite variable between 25 2 and 52 3 mg l 1 as n with a mean concentration of 39 4 5 8 mg l 1 as n n 80 in contrast the steady state permeate tan concentration was extremely stable at different operating conditions except in run 8 with 2 h aerobic hrt these findings were confirmed by anova in which p value between runs 1 7 was 0 24 and p value between runs 1 8 was 4 0e 25 as given in table 4 the permeate tan concentration was obtained to be 0 29 0 1 mg l 1 as n n 63 with tan removal efﬁciency of above 99 from runs 1 7 and in run 8 the steady state permeate tan concentration increased to 1 8 0 2 mg l 1 as n n 3 and tan removal decreased to 95 the results revealed that the nitrification performance of the maa mbr pilot plant was not affected by the changes in the aerobic hrt between 3 and 12 h however in the 2 h aerobic hrt the performance of the maa mbr decreased by 5 complete nitrification at low values of aerobic hrt 2 8 h has been reported by many investigators and it seems to be one of the main characteristics of the high srt mbr systems 43 45 however thanh et al 46 reported that when hrt decreased from 4 h to 2 h the ammonia removal efficiency of a sponge mbr system which was used for the treatment of a low strength catfish farm wastewater decreased from 99 to 86 fig 6c displays the concentration of the different nitrogen compounds in permeate during the period of study the steady state concentration of nitrite and tkn in permeate was independent of the mlr ratio of 100 600 and the aerobic hrts in the range of 3 12 h the total concentration of nitrite and tkn was 1 6 0 14 mg l 1 as n n 32 during the whole study period this result was confirmed by anova in which p value between runs 1 7 was 0 15 see table 4 by contrast the average steady state concentration of permeate nitrate declined rapidly from 15 7 0 3 mg l 1 as n n 3 to 10 0 0 2 mg l 1 as n n 5 after the ratio of mlr was raised from 100 to 200 this trend continued in run 3 at the 300 mlr ratio in which the average steady state permeate nitrate decreased to 7 2 0 3 mg l 1 as n n 13 similarly in run 5 at the 400 mlr ratio the average steady state permeate nitrate reduced to 5 4 0 3 mg l 1 as n n 6 finally in run 6 at the 600 mlr ratio the average steady state permeate nitrate with a slight decline reached 3 7 0 2 mg l 1 as n n 3 the feed and permeate of tn and the tn removal are revealed in fig 6d in run 1 at 100 mlr ratio the average steady state tn removal efficiency was 69 3 0 4 n 3 in run 2 when the mlr ratio increased to 200 the average steady state tn removal efficiency increased to 79 2 0 3 n 4 this trend continued in run 3 at the 300 mlr ratio in which the average steady state tn removal efficiency reached 84 2 0 4 n 5 similarly in run 5 in which the mlr ratio increased to 400 the average steady state tn removal efficiency increased to 87 4 0 4 n 6 then in run 6 at the 600 mlr ratio the maximum tn removal efficiency with a slight increase was observed at 91 0 finally in run 7 at the mlr ratio of 400 when methanol was added in the anaerobic tank the maximum tn removal of this maa mbr pilot plant was 89 5 and the minimum permeate nitrate was 4 4 mg l 1 as n that in comparison with run 5 with the same mlr ratio has a 2 1 improvement in the efficiency it is clear from fig 6d that nitrogen removal performance of the maa mbr pilot plant is independent of the aerobic hrt 3 12 h for example in runs 4 and 5 with the same mlr ratio when hrt declined from 6 h to 4 h the maximum tn removal was almost the same value of 88 however in run 8 at the 2 h aerobic hrt the average tn removal decreased from 87 4 0 4 n 6 to 80 0 0 4 3 with the minimum permeate tn of 11 2 mg l 1 as n compared to the run 5 with the same mlr ratio 400 the results also highlighted the nitrogen removal performance of this maa mbr pilot plant is significantly dependent on the mlr ratio however the mlr ratio above 300 is not very significant in the performance of the maa mbr system based on the composition of cell biomass about 12 2 kg of nitrogen will be required per 100 kg of cell biomass 15 the mass balance of biomass and substrate around the system reveal that 10 8 of the maximum tn removal occurred via the assimilation mechanism removal and 89 2 of the maximum tn removal was happened via the enhanced biological nitrogen removal mechanism this surprising finding indicated that the maa mbr pilot plant was very efficient for enhanced biological nitrogen removal as exhibited in table 6 the nitrogen removal performance of this maa mbr is slightly more than the nitrogen removal of the a2o mbr in the previous study under the same condition temperature mlr ratio aerobic hrt and feed wastewater 26 for example at mlr ratio of 400 and aerobic hrt of 6 h the maximum tn removal of the a2o mbr was 86 2 whereas it increased to 88 0 in this maa mbr system it is evident that this slight improvement is due to the location of the anoxic reactor in the maa mbr system and consequently readily biodegradable cod is easily available to the facultative heterotrophic bacteria chae and shin 47 investigated the performance of a vertical submerged mbr used for treating urban wastewater with a ratio of cod tn tp 100 18 1 1 38 and free of nitrate concentration they reported that the average tn removal was 74 at 8 h hrt and 60 d srt moreover the research of song et al 48 in a sequencing anoxic anaerobic mbr system for the treatment of wastewater with a ratio of cod tn tp 100 19 7 2 0 indicated that the maximum removal of tn was 56 at 8 h total hrt and 78 d srt in comparison with other previous works that were performed on the similar feed wastewater the very high removal of nitrogen in the maa mbr system can be ascribed to the following reasons optimal location of the anoxic reactor in the configuration of the maa mbr system complete nitrification in the aerobic zone proper ratio of mlr and providing suitable condition for the anoxic reactor very good mixing low dissolved oxygen 0 4 mg l 1 and temperature of 27 30 c 4 conclusions excellent nutrient and organic matter removal were achieved by a new maa mbr pilot plant used for treating urban wastewater with a low carbon nutrient ratio and relatively high nitrate concentration the results highlighted the key role of the mlr ratio on the tn and tp removal performance of the maa mbr pilot plant also the results showed that the treatment performance of the maa mbr and f m ratio were significantly independent of the aerobic hrt 3 12 h however at 2 h aerobic hrt the performance of the maa mbr decreased by 7 considering the essential factors of treatment efficiency and cost effective design and operation the optimal conditions for the maa mbr system are 8 1 h total hrt and 400 mlr ratio in these conditions the maximum bod5 cod tn tp and tan removal reached 99 2 96 9 88 1 75 8 and 99 4 respectively the minimum bod5 cod tn tp and tan in the permeate were observed to be 1 0 10 0 6 7 2 1 and 0 25 mg l 1 respectively also the addition of methanol to the anaerobic reactor improved the tp removal up to 92 with a minimum permeate tp concentration of 0 6 mg l 1 in addition a comparison of the proposed maa mbr system with the a2o mbr system showed a tp removal improvement of 21 6 without any chemical addition in conclusion the results of this pilot plant illustrated that the proposed maa mbr process is highly efficient for enhanced biological nutrient removal and can be used to treat urban wastewater with a high nitrate concentration and a low carbon nutrient ratio to

14176,nowadays dyes are used in many industrial activities and their presence in wastewater is quite common and involves different environmental and health problems in addition dyes are usually recalcitrant compounds and conventional treatment are not appropriate for their removal so there is great interest in finding alternative removal processes as the one based on excimer lamp technology for the removal of amaranth dye described in the present work two excilamps and two reactor configurations have been tested a batch reactor with krcl or xebr excilamp and a krcl flow through photoreactor after comparing the results for both lamps in the batch reactor the krcl excilamp has proven to be more efficient both in terms of conversions achieved and energy consumption and by this it has been selected to be used in the flow through photoreactor for both reactor configurations several experimental series were done to analyze the influence of the different operational variables on the photoprocess and the optimal mass ratio between hydrogen peroxide and dye has been established also it has been proven that the use of fenton reagent improves the process efficiency particularly in the case of the xebr lamp in addition a kinetic model based on a previous one developed by the authors for a flow through photoreactor and slightly modified to can also apply it to batch reactors has been applied the model has been validated with an excellent fitting of the experimental data for all series and both reactor configurations keywords amaranth uv photodegradation

aim to increase sales companies tend to offer more attractive products something that can be achieved by means of color since it allows us to differentiate the products makes them more striking or customize them industries such as cosmetics food or textile are just some examples of this tendency dyes can also be used for more technical purposes such as those found in pharmacy or laboratories the main problem derived from the multiple applications of dyes is the presence of colored compounds in wastewater that will end up being discharged into the natural environment despite the apparently innocuous aesthetic effects on the receptor medium the transmission of solar energy decreases by the presence of dyes and this affects the photosynthesis and reduces the concentration of oxygen in the ecosystem in addition some of these compounds may be toxic to organisms of the aquatic medium 1 2 affecting their development or behaviour 3 4 another important aspect of dyes is that in some cases the products formed during their decomposition can become more toxic than the dyes themselves azo dyes are the most common and numerous dyes and among them amaranth has been the one selected for this research it is used in the coloration of textile fibers leather paper thermoplastics wood cosmetics inks and in the food industry with the number e123 of the international numbering system ins 5 amaranth also has applications in biological research such as detecting changes in membranes potential 5 according to some recent research studies as one with in vitro human lymphocytes 6 it seems that amaranth can be toxic and by this it is not authorized anymore in eeuu as additive in the food pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry as a consequence amaranth can be considered as a pollutant which must be removed from wastewaters different physical chemical and biological methods have been used for the removal of amaranth from wastewaters adsorption treatments have been tested with good results with adsorbent materials such as zeolites or activated carbon 7 however this technique involves the pollutant change of phase and by this although almost total removal from wastewater can be achieved the pollutant remains in the adsorbent which must be treated further membrane processes have been applied as well among the physical treatments using nanofiltration and reverse osmosis with polysulfone and polyethylamine membranes 8 9 in this case the main disadvantage is the high energy consumption and also the concentrate obtained that must be treated as well biological treatments have been used with bacterial culture such as pseudomonas 10 fungi 11 or peroxidase enzymes extracted from arundo donax typha angustifolia or phragmites australis 12 however due to the toxicity of pollutants some of these treatments can be applied only for low dye concentrations chemical methods like coagulation flocculation ionic exchange or electro coagulation have proven to be effective for the removal of azo dyes like amaranth 13 15 among the chemical methods oxidation processes offer the important advantage that total mineralization of the pollutant can be achieved in most cases subcritical and supercritical water oxidation have been used attaining removal efficiencies of azo dyes between 80 90 16 17 although extreme temperature and pressure conditions are normally required for these treatments advanced oxidation processes aops offer an interesting alternative that has been attracting increasing interest over the last years aops are based on the generation of strong oxidizing agents like ho allowing oxidation and total mineralization of water pollutants even at very low concentrations due to their high reactivity and low selectivity 18 both photochemical and non photochemical aops such as ozonation 19 fenton treatment 20 or uv fenton 21 have been successfully used for amaranth removal from wastewater among the photochemical aops excimer technology has been selected for the present work because in the literature there are no references about the use of this technology in the removal of this dye excimer lamps or excilamps are new uv sources based on transitions of exciplex rare gas halides or excimer molecules rare gas or halogen dimmers formed as a result of an electric discharge they are attractive alternatives to commonly used mercury lamps because they have some important advantages including the absence of elemental mercury long lifetime from 1000 to 10 000 h geometric freedom and high photon flux their main advantage is the emission in a narrow band uv radiation nearly monochromatic and matching the dissociation energies of bonds of the main organic compounds especially if barrier discharge lamps are used since they provide a narrower emission spectrum from an environmental point of view the absence of toxic mercury is a remarkable characteristic 22 25 over the last years excimer technology has been applied to the removal of different organic pollutants that can be found in industrial wastewaters using different lamp configurations 26 37 in addition different kinetic studies on oxidation treatments of amaranth and other dyes can be found in the literature 38 41 in most processes the progress curves can be successfully fitted to a pseudo first order kinetic model and commonly the first order kinetic parameter shows a dependence on the operational variables mainly the concentration of pollutant which is not the expected behaviour for a true first order kinetics in a previous work 42 the authors studied the photodegradation of the methylene blue dye using an exciplex krcl flow through photoreactor and a kinetic model that explained the dependence of the first order kinetic parameter on the operational variables was developed and successfully validated in the present paper a comparative study is carried out firstly in a batch reactor with two different excilamps of krcl and xebr to test their efficiency in the removal of amaranth once the best lamp is selected the second part of the study is focused on the photodegradation of amaranth by using an exciplex krcl flow through photoreactor this is the reactor configuration that allows us to work in the future not only in discontinuous but also in semicontinuous or continuous mode as a previous step for a further scale up of the process in addition the previously developed kinetic model with some small modifications to be suitable for batch reactors is checked and validated with the data obtained from both reaction systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents amaranth 85 95 w w was purchased from sigma aldrich fine chemicals hydrogen peroxide 33 w v was purchased from panreac ferrous sulphate was purchased from probus catalase solution 1340 u mg solid and aluminium potassium sulphate 98 0 were purchased from sigma aldrich fine chemicals other chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification 2 2 materials the equipment used for the experiments consist in two barrier discharge excilamps purchased from the institute of high current electronics of the siberian branch russian academy of sciences the xebr and krcl excilamps emitting maximum uv radiation at 283 and 222 nm respectively were of cylindrical geometry covered by a metal case having an uv exit window with an area of 75 cm2 the exit window was oriented at a fixed distance of 3 cm over a vessel of 100 ml of capacity and 4 5 cm external diameter the average radiation intensity delivered to the solution was 17 12 and 2 47 mwcm 2 for xebr and krcl excimer lamps respectively also a flow through krcl photoreactor with an irradiation zone length of 30 cm and an internal diameter of 2 cm which provides an irradiation area of 188 5 cm2 and with an average radiation intensity of 2 38 mwcm 2 was used in the experiments data of radiation intensity both for the two excilamps and for the flow through photoreactor were provided by the manufacturer for the analytical determination of amaranth concentration an ultraviolet visible thermospectronic helios alpha spectrophotometer was used cod was also measured with some specific equipment consisting of reactor and photometer model hi 938 800 and model 83099 respectively from hanna instruments an eppendorf centrifuge 5424 was used in fenton s series 2 3 operational procedure photodegradation assays were done in two configurations of reactors a batch reactor with krcl and xebr excilamp and a krcl flow through photoreactor in the first case a glass beaker is used as a batch reactor excilamp is over the reactor and radiation directly falls on the treated volume a system scheme is presented in fig 1 a amaranth hydrogen peroxide and fe2 at the required concentrations were dissolved in distilled water and placed into the glass beaker and irradiated at room temperature 23 25 c under static conditions and for exposure times of 120 min for the different experiments fluence was also determined by multiplying the radiation intensity and the exposure time of reaction volume in the second case the solution containing the amaranth and the rest of the reagents hydrogen peroxide and fe2 at the required initial concentration was pumped from a stirred tank to the photoreactor and the effluent was continuously recycled to the tank so that the system acts as a pseudo batch reactor flow through reactor all the experiments were done at room temperature 23 25 c with an operational time of 120 min experimental equipment including the main components is depicted in fig 1b in both cases samples were taken at different reaction times 0 2 5 5 10 20 40 60 90 and 120 min duplicate experiments were carried out and average values were obtained four experimental series were carried out in order to study the influence of the following operational variables h2o2 amaranth mass ratio initial amaranth concentration reaction volume and initial fe2 concentration experimental conditions for all the experiments with the static excilamps and for the krcl flow through photoreactor are shown in tables 1 and 2 2 4 analytical determinations samples were spectrophotometrically analyzed at the amaranth maximum absorption wavelength in the visible region 522 nm absorbance values were transformed to concentrations by using the amaranth calibration curve amaranth mg l 1 absorbance522 0 0399 r 0 9998 3 kinetic model the kinetic model applied in the present work is an adaptation of another one previously developed 42 with small modifications to be suitable for batch reactors the model is based on the presence of two regions with different dye concentration in the liquid phase a thin layer in the region where the radiation is delivered to the solution where the photoprocess takes place with a small residual concentration of non degraded dye and the bulk solution with a uniform concentration of dye which decreases with time and is the measured concentration the model takes into account the dependence of the first order kinetic constant on different experimental variables a behaviour that does not correspond to a true first order kinetic but to a pseudo first order one the model has been applied to the data from both the krcl photoreactor and the batch reactor with krcl and xebr excilamps being the equations valid for both systems in the following the model hypotheses and equations are presented 3 1 model hypotheses i both the stirring in the glass beaker and the flow rate in the photoreactor are high enough and as a consequence the solution is well agitated and the amaranth concentration in the bulk solution a only varies with time ii different consecutive steps take place along the photodegradation process of amaranth from the initial dye to intermediate compounds until the final products the global reaction can be expressed as 3 1 a m a r a n t h n h 2 o 2 i n t e r m e d i a t e s f i n a l p r o d u c t s i at any time if a 0 and a are the initial and current mass concentrations of the dye respectively and prod i is the mass concentration of each one of the products formed according to the mass conservation law it must be verified 3 2 a p r o d i a 0 i the radiation intensity delivered to the sample from the krcl photoreactor or from the krcl and xebr excilamps is constant at a fixed distance from the uv source and uniformly distributed so a density of radiation intensity per mass unit can be expressed as the quotient i a 0 where i is the average radiation intensity emitted ii the radiation is quickly absorbed by the substrates and photoproducts and consumed during the photoprocess near the region where it is delivered to the solution so it can be assumed that the photodegradation takes place in a thin film with a small volume v r close to the top of the reactor volume for the batch experiments with krcl and xebr and close to the wall of the quartz tube in the krcl photoreactor as a result there are two regions with different dye concentrations the thin film where the photoprocess takes place with a small residual concentration a lim and the bulk solution whose volume v is practically equal to the sample volume with a uniform concentration a which decreases with time according to hypothesis i these two regions determines a transport of amaranth which will be a limiting step being the driven force the concentration gradient a a lim iii in a similar way as explained in the above hypothesis for amaranth there is a concentration gradient of hydrogen peroxide h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 lim however this mass transfer is faster than the one of amaranth and not limiting due to the much lower molecular weight of hydrogen peroxide iv the photodegradation of amaranth takes place both by direct photolysis and by reaction with hydrogen peroxide 3 2 model equations as previously indicated in the assays with krcl and xebr excilamps a glass beaker was used as a batch reactor and in the experiments carried out with the photoreactor total recirculation was used so the system acts as a batch reactor as well as a result for both reactor configurations if ra is the amaranth photodegradation rate v the total sample volume and vr the volume of the reaction zone the mass balance can be expressed as follows 3 3 v d a d t v r r a 0 according to hypothesis v and being kla the mass transfer volumetric coefficient the mass transfer rate rdif can be expressed as 3 4 r d i f k l a a a l i m taking into account hypothesis iv the energy received in the time unit by the mass of amaranth must be proportional to the mass transfer rate and to the density of radiation per mass unit being ke the proportionality constant 3 5 e a k e k l a i a 0 a a l i m and taking into account the quantum yield of the process the photodegradation rate can be defined as follows 3 6 r a ԑ k e k l a i a 0 a a l i m according to hypothesis vii and if kc1 is the kinetic constant of direct photolysis and kc2 is the kinetic constant of the photodegradation with hydrogen peroxide the following equation applies 3 7 r a k c 1 a l i m k c 2 a l i m h 2 o 2 l i m from these last two eqs 3 6 and 3 7 the value of a lim can be obtained 3 8 a l i m ԑ k e k l a i a ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 a 0 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m a 0 and by replacing this expression in eq 3 7 a new equation for ra is obtained 3 9 r a ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m a 0 a by substituting eq 3 9 in eq 3 3 of mass balance the variation of a with time can be obtained as follows 3 10 d a d t v r v ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m a 0 a from eq 3 10 a pseudo first order kinetic constant kr can be defined as 3 11 k r v r v ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m a 0 and since h2o2 lim has a small value the approximation kc1 kc2 h2o2 lim kc1 can be accepted and it leads to a new expression for the pseudo first order kinetic constant kr 3 12 k r v r v k c 1 ԑ k e k l a i ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 a 0 the definition of kr allows us to simplify the mass balance equation to the following one matching the batch reactor equation for a pseudo first order kinetic 3 13 d a d t k r a additionally from the definition of conversion 3 14 x a a 0 a a 0 eq 3 13 is modified to 3 15 d x a d t k r 1 x a with the initial condition 3 16 t 0 x a 0 finally from the integration of eq 3 15 it is obtained 3 17 x a 1 e k r t for the fitting of the experimental data to eq 3 17 the software curve expert 1 4 has been used 4 results and discussion as indicated at the end of section 2 3 four experimental series were carried out in order to study the influence of the different operational variables on the process in fig 1 the experimental reaction system is shown and the experimental conditions for the four series are shown on table 1 for the krcl and xebr static excilamps and on table 2 for the krcl flow through photoreactor regarding the results the ones obtained for the four experimental series both for the krcl and xebr static excilamps are presented in figs 2 6 and discussed in subsections 4 1 and 4 2 in a similar way the ones for the flow through photoreactor can be found in figs 7 and 8 and they are discussed in subsections 4 3 and 4 4 finally in subsection 4 5 a comparison between the results obtained in this work and some others found in similar studies has been made 4 1 experimental results in batch reactor with krcl and xebr excilamps in the first experimental series the influence of the variation of h2o2 amaranth mass ratio on the process has been analyzed the results obtained are shown in fig 2a and b for the krcl and xebr excilamp respectively as it can be observed for the krcl lamp the optimum mass ratio seems to be 5 1 and there is no significant improvement with the results corresponding to the 6 1 ratio in a similar way for the xebr lamp the optimal ratio seems to be 6 1 once the optimum mass ratio has been selected for both lamps the obtained results were compared not only considering the photodegradation rate but also the energy consumption expressed as fluence this can be seen in fig 2c and d proving that the krcl excilamp is clearly more effective both in terms of degradation rate and energy consumption this result can be explained taking into account the wavelength of maximum uv emission of both excilamps which is 222 nm for the krcl excilamp very close to the maximum absorption wavelength of amaranth in the uv region 225 nm while this maximum is of 283 nm for the xebr excilamp far from amaranth absorption it is important to notice that although the average radiation intensity of the xebr lamp is around 5 times higher than the one of the krcl excilamp the most determining factor to achieve an optimum photodegradation process is the matching between the maximum emission of the lamp and the maximum absorption of the target compound this aspect is particularly relevant when monochromatic sources such as excimer lamps are used in fig 3a which corresponds with the second series and where the variation of the initial dye concentration was studied it can be seen that for both excilamps conversion decreases when increasing amaranth initial concentration as expected since the radiation intensity per mass unit is lower as in the previous series the best results are obtained with the krcl lamp also considering the energy consumption as it can be seen in fig 3b the third experimental series in which reaction volume was varied is depicted in fig 4a and b showing the variation of conversion versus time and fluence respectively from these results it seems that this variable has no significant influence probably due to the narrow range of volume variation used in this series once again the krcl has proven to be the best uv source achieving high values of amaranth conversion with low energy requirements finally for the four series the results corresponding to the photo fenton process are shown in fig 5a d it is interesting to observe how the use of fenton improves the performance of the xebr excilamp for the optimum fe2 concentration selected 5 mg l 1 the results of the mentioned lamp are very close to the ones obtained with the krcl excilamp which is still a better option especially in terms of fluence 4 2 model fitting of the batch reactor results with krcl and xebr excilamps in figs 2 5 the dots are the experimental values of conversion and the continuous lines correspond with the data calculated by using eq 3 17 additionally in table 1 the values of the pseudo first order kinetic constant kr obtained in the fitting of the experimental data of each series to the model and the correlation coefficients are shown as it can be observed both in all figures and in table 1 an excellent fitting to the proposed model has been obtained in the series with the variation of the h2o2 amaranth mass ratio to analyze the dependence of kr on the experimental conditions eq 3 11 must be applied since the only variable is the hydrogen peroxide concentration however as the value of h2o2 lim is unknown some approximation must be made assuming this value is almost proportional to the initial hydrogen peroxide concentration being kh the proportionality constant the rate constant obtained from eq 3 11 can be rewritten as 4 1 k r v r v ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 k h h 2 o 2 0 ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 k h h 2 o 2 0 a 0 and by putting all constants together the following dependence with h2o2 0 is obtained 4 2 k r a b h 2 o 2 0 c d h 2 o 2 0 fig 6a shows the fitting to this previous equation using the different values of h2o2 0 and the calculated values of kr for both krcl and xebr excilamps the values of the different parameters of eq 4 2 are presented in table 3 in fig 6a it is also important to point out the much higher values of kr obtained for the krcl excilamp in good agreement with the better performance of this uv lamp mentioned in section 4 1 for the fitting to the model of experimental series 2 where the variation of initial dye concentration was studied from eq 3 12 the following new expression can be obtained 4 3 1 k r v v r 1 ԑ k e k l a i a 0 1 k c 1 which can be expressed as follows 4 4 1 k r a a 0 b the good fitting to this last equation is shown in fig 6b and once again the values of kr are higher for the assays with the krcl excimer lamp as expected from the experimental results in the third series eq 3 12 has been used again for the model fitting a linear variation of kr with the inverse of the volume is expected initially according to the following expression 4 5 k r 1 v v r k c 1 ԑ k e k l a i ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 a 0 however as it can be seen in fig 6c there is not a significant variation of kr with the inverse of v as predicted in eq 4 5 this is probably due to a double and opposite effect on one hand as the volume is in the denominator of eq 4 5 a higher volume has a negative effect on the kinetic constant on the other hand taking into account the experimental system used a higher volume involves less distance between the free surface of reaction volume and the radiation source and as a result the sample receives higher radiation intensity and the value of kr increases as a consequence of this double effect and considering also the narrow range obtained for the variation of kr there is no clear tendency for this series finally for the photo fenton experiments although the use of fenton reagent is not considered in the model equations the same kinetic model has been applied with good results and a clear linear dependence between the obtained values of kr and the variation of the initial fe2 concentration is presented in fig 6d being again the krcl excilamp more efficient 4 3 experimental results in the krcl flow through photoreactor results from this experimental reactor configuration are shown in fig 7 fig 7a depicts the results of variation in the h2o2 amaranth mass ratio as it can be observed the optimum mass ratio seems to be 2 5 1 0 because for a higher mass ratio 3 0 1 0 no significant improvements are obtained after selecting the optimum mass ratio the influences of variation of the initial dye concentration and the reaction volume were studied results are depicted in fig 7b and c respectively showing that conversion decreases when there is an increase in amaranth initial concentration and or in the reaction volume in good agreement with the behaviour predicted in eqs 4 4 and 4 5 this is the expected result as the radiation intensity is the same but lower per mass unit finally fig 7d shows the results corresponding to the photo fenton process where it can be noticed that even with the lowest fe2 concentration assayed the reaction is very fast and conversion values close to 100 are reached from the first reaction minutes 4 4 model fitting of the krcl flow through photoreactor results as indicated in previous paragraphs in fig 7 solid lines correspond with the fitting to the model of the experimental data for each experimental series also the values of kr and correlation coefficients can be found in table 2 fig 7a c show an excellent fitting of the experimental data to the model fig 8a shows the fitting to eq 4 2 for the different values of kr obtained in the series of variation of h2o2 amaranth mass ratio table 4 shows the values of the different parameters of eq 4 2 in the same way fig 8b shows the fitting of kr to eq 4 4 for the experimental data corresponding to the variation of the initial dye concentration a good fitting is observed and also a decreasing in kr values for increasing values of initial dye concentration as expected for the third series and taken into account that in this reactor configuration there is no variation in the intensity of radiation since the distance from the radiation source and the liquid surface is constant according to eq 4 5 a linear variation of kr with the inverse of the volume is expected fig 8c shows the obtained fitting finally for the photo fenton experiments as it has been previously commented the use of fenton reagent is not considered in the model equations besides the reaction occurs very fast and the progress curve is practically a constant line as shown in fig 7d 4 5 comparison with other similar studies regarding the amaranth degradation rate it must be taken into account that it depends on the different operational conditions the dye concentration the type of uv lamp used the use of an oxidizing agent and the possible addition of a catalyst as a consequence it is not easy to make a comparison between the results obtained in this work and the ones from other published manuscripts on similar studies nevertheless a comparison has been made using the results of the present study and the ones obtained by gomathi et al 21 and wu et al 40 these works have been selected because their results have been fitted to a pseudo first order kinetic model as well and the values of the pseudo first order kinetic constant can be found which facilitates the comparison in this way from eq 3 17 of the manuscript where the relationship between the conversion xa the reaction time t and the kinetic constant kr was established the half life time t 1 2 can be calculated as follows 4 6 t 1 2 l n 0 5 k r this time corresponds with a conversion of 0 5 and it is the time needed to degrade half of the initial dye concentration so the lower the half life time is the higher is the efficiency of the lamp also if the intensity of radiation is known the fluence corresponding to the half life time can be also calculated and the lower the fluence the lower the energy consumption from these considerations in table 5 a comparison between the results obtained for the half life time and fluence in this work and the ones calculated from the data shown in references 21 and 40 has been made as it can be seen in table 5 in terms of half life time and fluence the higher efficiency corresponds with the krcl excilamp being the efficiency of the xebr excilamp higher or lower than the one of reference 21 depending on the initial dye concentration and lower than the one of reference 40 so it can be affirmed that good removal performance of amaranth can be obtained with excilamps mainly with the krcl one additionally as the use of mercury is avoided in these lamps they are also a technology cleanest and more environmentally friendly than traditional uv sources 5 conclusions excimer technology has proven to be an excellent alternative to conventional treatments for the removal of complex organic

14176,nowadays dyes are used in many industrial activities and their presence in wastewater is quite common and involves different environmental and health problems in addition dyes are usually recalcitrant compounds and conventional treatment are not appropriate for their removal so there is great interest in finding alternative removal processes as the one based on excimer lamp technology for the removal of amaranth dye described in the present work two excilamps and two reactor configurations have been tested a batch reactor with krcl or xebr excilamp and a krcl flow through photoreactor after comparing the results for both lamps in the batch reactor the krcl excilamp has proven to be more efficient both in terms of conversions achieved and energy consumption and by this it has been selected to be used in the flow through photoreactor for both reactor configurations several experimental series were done to analyze the influence of the different operational variables on the photoprocess and the optimal mass ratio between hydrogen peroxide and dye has been established also it has been proven that the use of fenton reagent improves the process efficiency particularly in the case of the xebr lamp in addition a kinetic model based on a previous one developed by the authors for a flow through photoreactor and slightly modified to can also apply it to batch reactors has been applied the model has been validated with an excellent fitting of the experimental data for all series and both reactor configurations keywords amaranth uv photodegradation

aim to increase sales companies tend to offer more attractive products something that can be achieved by means of color since it allows us to differentiate the products makes them more striking or customize them industries such as cosmetics food or textile are just some examples of this tendency dyes can also be used for more technical purposes such as those found in pharmacy or laboratories the main problem derived from the multiple applications of dyes is the presence of colored compounds in wastewater that will end up being discharged into the natural environment despite the apparently innocuous aesthetic effects on the receptor medium the transmission of solar energy decreases by the presence of dyes and this affects the photosynthesis and reduces the concentration of oxygen in the ecosystem in addition some of these compounds may be toxic to organisms of the aquatic medium 1 2 affecting their development or behaviour 3 4 another important aspect of dyes is that in some cases the products formed during their decomposition can become more toxic than the dyes themselves azo dyes are the most common and numerous dyes and among them amaranth has been the one selected for this research it is used in the coloration of textile fibers leather paper thermoplastics wood cosmetics inks and in the food industry with the number e123 of the international numbering system ins 5 amaranth also has applications in biological research such as detecting changes in membranes potential 5 according to some recent research studies as one with in vitro human lymphocytes 6 it seems that amaranth can be toxic and by this it is not authorized anymore in eeuu as additive in the food pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry as a consequence amaranth can be considered as a pollutant which must be removed from wastewaters different physical chemical and biological methods have been used for the removal of amaranth from wastewaters adsorption treatments have been tested with good results with adsorbent materials such as zeolites or activated carbon 7 however this technique involves the pollutant change of phase and by this although almost total removal from wastewater can be achieved the pollutant remains in the adsorbent which must be treated further membrane processes have been applied as well among the physical treatments using nanofiltration and reverse osmosis with polysulfone and polyethylamine membranes 8 9 in this case the main disadvantage is the high energy consumption and also the concentrate obtained that must be treated as well biological treatments have been used with bacterial culture such as pseudomonas 10 fungi 11 or peroxidase enzymes extracted from arundo donax typha angustifolia or phragmites australis 12 however due to the toxicity of pollutants some of these treatments can be applied only for low dye concentrations chemical methods like coagulation flocculation ionic exchange or electro coagulation have proven to be effective for the removal of azo dyes like amaranth 13 15 among the chemical methods oxidation processes offer the important advantage that total mineralization of the pollutant can be achieved in most cases subcritical and supercritical water oxidation have been used attaining removal efficiencies of azo dyes between 80 90 16 17 although extreme temperature and pressure conditions are normally required for these treatments advanced oxidation processes aops offer an interesting alternative that has been attracting increasing interest over the last years aops are based on the generation of strong oxidizing agents like ho allowing oxidation and total mineralization of water pollutants even at very low concentrations due to their high reactivity and low selectivity 18 both photochemical and non photochemical aops such as ozonation 19 fenton treatment 20 or uv fenton 21 have been successfully used for amaranth removal from wastewater among the photochemical aops excimer technology has been selected for the present work because in the literature there are no references about the use of this technology in the removal of this dye excimer lamps or excilamps are new uv sources based on transitions of exciplex rare gas halides or excimer molecules rare gas or halogen dimmers formed as a result of an electric discharge they are attractive alternatives to commonly used mercury lamps because they have some important advantages including the absence of elemental mercury long lifetime from 1000 to 10 000 h geometric freedom and high photon flux their main advantage is the emission in a narrow band uv radiation nearly monochromatic and matching the dissociation energies of bonds of the main organic compounds especially if barrier discharge lamps are used since they provide a narrower emission spectrum from an environmental point of view the absence of toxic mercury is a remarkable characteristic 22 25 over the last years excimer technology has been applied to the removal of different organic pollutants that can be found in industrial wastewaters using different lamp configurations 26 37 in addition different kinetic studies on oxidation treatments of amaranth and other dyes can be found in the literature 38 41 in most processes the progress curves can be successfully fitted to a pseudo first order kinetic model and commonly the first order kinetic parameter shows a dependence on the operational variables mainly the concentration of pollutant which is not the expected behaviour for a true first order kinetics in a previous work 42 the authors studied the photodegradation of the methylene blue dye using an exciplex krcl flow through photoreactor and a kinetic model that explained the dependence of the first order kinetic parameter on the operational variables was developed and successfully validated in the present paper a comparative study is carried out firstly in a batch reactor with two different excilamps of krcl and xebr to test their efficiency in the removal of amaranth once the best lamp is selected the second part of the study is focused on the photodegradation of amaranth by using an exciplex krcl flow through photoreactor this is the reactor configuration that allows us to work in the future not only in discontinuous but also in semicontinuous or continuous mode as a previous step for a further scale up of the process in addition the previously developed kinetic model with some small modifications to be suitable for batch reactors is checked and validated with the data obtained from both reaction systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents amaranth 85 95 w w was purchased from sigma aldrich fine chemicals hydrogen peroxide 33 w v was purchased from panreac ferrous sulphate was purchased from probus catalase solution 1340 u mg solid and aluminium potassium sulphate 98 0 were purchased from sigma aldrich fine chemicals other chemicals were of analytical grade and were used without further purification 2 2 materials the equipment used for the experiments consist in two barrier discharge excilamps purchased from the institute of high current electronics of the siberian branch russian academy of sciences the xebr and krcl excilamps emitting maximum uv radiation at 283 and 222 nm respectively were of cylindrical geometry covered by a metal case having an uv exit window with an area of 75 cm2 the exit window was oriented at a fixed distance of 3 cm over a vessel of 100 ml of capacity and 4 5 cm external diameter the average radiation intensity delivered to the solution was 17 12 and 2 47 mwcm 2 for xebr and krcl excimer lamps respectively also a flow through krcl photoreactor with an irradiation zone length of 30 cm and an internal diameter of 2 cm which provides an irradiation area of 188 5 cm2 and with an average radiation intensity of 2 38 mwcm 2 was used in the experiments data of radiation intensity both for the two excilamps and for the flow through photoreactor were provided by the manufacturer for the analytical determination of amaranth concentration an ultraviolet visible thermospectronic helios alpha spectrophotometer was used cod was also measured with some specific equipment consisting of reactor and photometer model hi 938 800 and model 83099 respectively from hanna instruments an eppendorf centrifuge 5424 was used in fenton s series 2 3 operational procedure photodegradation assays were done in two configurations of reactors a batch reactor with krcl and xebr excilamp and a krcl flow through photoreactor in the first case a glass beaker is used as a batch reactor excilamp is over the reactor and radiation directly falls on the treated volume a system scheme is presented in fig 1 a amaranth hydrogen peroxide and fe2 at the required concentrations were dissolved in distilled water and placed into the glass beaker and irradiated at room temperature 23 25 c under static conditions and for exposure times of 120 min for the different experiments fluence was also determined by multiplying the radiation intensity and the exposure time of reaction volume in the second case the solution containing the amaranth and the rest of the reagents hydrogen peroxide and fe2 at the required initial concentration was pumped from a stirred tank to the photoreactor and the effluent was continuously recycled to the tank so that the system acts as a pseudo batch reactor flow through reactor all the experiments were done at room temperature 23 25 c with an operational time of 120 min experimental equipment including the main components is depicted in fig 1b in both cases samples were taken at different reaction times 0 2 5 5 10 20 40 60 90 and 120 min duplicate experiments were carried out and average values were obtained four experimental series were carried out in order to study the influence of the following operational variables h2o2 amaranth mass ratio initial amaranth concentration reaction volume and initial fe2 concentration experimental conditions for all the experiments with the static excilamps and for the krcl flow through photoreactor are shown in tables 1 and 2 2 4 analytical determinations samples were spectrophotometrically analyzed at the amaranth maximum absorption wavelength in the visible region 522 nm absorbance values were transformed to concentrations by using the amaranth calibration curve amaranth mg l 1 absorbance522 0 0399 r 0 9998 3 kinetic model the kinetic model applied in the present work is an adaptation of another one previously developed 42 with small modifications to be suitable for batch reactors the model is based on the presence of two regions with different dye concentration in the liquid phase a thin layer in the region where the radiation is delivered to the solution where the photoprocess takes place with a small residual concentration of non degraded dye and the bulk solution with a uniform concentration of dye which decreases with time and is the measured concentration the model takes into account the dependence of the first order kinetic constant on different experimental variables a behaviour that does not correspond to a true first order kinetic but to a pseudo first order one the model has been applied to the data from both the krcl photoreactor and the batch reactor with krcl and xebr excilamps being the equations valid for both systems in the following the model hypotheses and equations are presented 3 1 model hypotheses i both the stirring in the glass beaker and the flow rate in the photoreactor are high enough and as a consequence the solution is well agitated and the amaranth concentration in the bulk solution a only varies with time ii different consecutive steps take place along the photodegradation process of amaranth from the initial dye to intermediate compounds until the final products the global reaction can be expressed as 3 1 a m a r a n t h n h 2 o 2 i n t e r m e d i a t e s f i n a l p r o d u c t s i at any time if a 0 and a are the initial and current mass concentrations of the dye respectively and prod i is the mass concentration of each one of the products formed according to the mass conservation law it must be verified 3 2 a p r o d i a 0 i the radiation intensity delivered to the sample from the krcl photoreactor or from the krcl and xebr excilamps is constant at a fixed distance from the uv source and uniformly distributed so a density of radiation intensity per mass unit can be expressed as the quotient i a 0 where i is the average radiation intensity emitted ii the radiation is quickly absorbed by the substrates and photoproducts and consumed during the photoprocess near the region where it is delivered to the solution so it can be assumed that the photodegradation takes place in a thin film with a small volume v r close to the top of the reactor volume for the batch experiments with krcl and xebr and close to the wall of the quartz tube in the krcl photoreactor as a result there are two regions with different dye concentrations the thin film where the photoprocess takes place with a small residual concentration a lim and the bulk solution whose volume v is practically equal to the sample volume with a uniform concentration a which decreases with time according to hypothesis i these two regions determines a transport of amaranth which will be a limiting step being the driven force the concentration gradient a a lim iii in a similar way as explained in the above hypothesis for amaranth there is a concentration gradient of hydrogen peroxide h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 lim however this mass transfer is faster than the one of amaranth and not limiting due to the much lower molecular weight of hydrogen peroxide iv the photodegradation of amaranth takes place both by direct photolysis and by reaction with hydrogen peroxide 3 2 model equations as previously indicated in the assays with krcl and xebr excilamps a glass beaker was used as a batch reactor and in the experiments carried out with the photoreactor total recirculation was used so the system acts as a batch reactor as well as a result for both reactor configurations if ra is the amaranth photodegradation rate v the total sample volume and vr the volume of the reaction zone the mass balance can be expressed as follows 3 3 v d a d t v r r a 0 according to hypothesis v and being kla the mass transfer volumetric coefficient the mass transfer rate rdif can be expressed as 3 4 r d i f k l a a a l i m taking into account hypothesis iv the energy received in the time unit by the mass of amaranth must be proportional to the mass transfer rate and to the density of radiation per mass unit being ke the proportionality constant 3 5 e a k e k l a i a 0 a a l i m and taking into account the quantum yield of the process the photodegradation rate can be defined as follows 3 6 r a ԑ k e k l a i a 0 a a l i m according to hypothesis vii and if kc1 is the kinetic constant of direct photolysis and kc2 is the kinetic constant of the photodegradation with hydrogen peroxide the following equation applies 3 7 r a k c 1 a l i m k c 2 a l i m h 2 o 2 l i m from these last two eqs 3 6 and 3 7 the value of a lim can be obtained 3 8 a l i m ԑ k e k l a i a ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 a 0 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m a 0 and by replacing this expression in eq 3 7 a new equation for ra is obtained 3 9 r a ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m a 0 a by substituting eq 3 9 in eq 3 3 of mass balance the variation of a with time can be obtained as follows 3 10 d a d t v r v ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m a 0 a from eq 3 10 a pseudo first order kinetic constant kr can be defined as 3 11 k r v r v ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 h 2 o 2 l i m a 0 and since h2o2 lim has a small value the approximation kc1 kc2 h2o2 lim kc1 can be accepted and it leads to a new expression for the pseudo first order kinetic constant kr 3 12 k r v r v k c 1 ԑ k e k l a i ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 a 0 the definition of kr allows us to simplify the mass balance equation to the following one matching the batch reactor equation for a pseudo first order kinetic 3 13 d a d t k r a additionally from the definition of conversion 3 14 x a a 0 a a 0 eq 3 13 is modified to 3 15 d x a d t k r 1 x a with the initial condition 3 16 t 0 x a 0 finally from the integration of eq 3 15 it is obtained 3 17 x a 1 e k r t for the fitting of the experimental data to eq 3 17 the software curve expert 1 4 has been used 4 results and discussion as indicated at the end of section 2 3 four experimental series were carried out in order to study the influence of the different operational variables on the process in fig 1 the experimental reaction system is shown and the experimental conditions for the four series are shown on table 1 for the krcl and xebr static excilamps and on table 2 for the krcl flow through photoreactor regarding the results the ones obtained for the four experimental series both for the krcl and xebr static excilamps are presented in figs 2 6 and discussed in subsections 4 1 and 4 2 in a similar way the ones for the flow through photoreactor can be found in figs 7 and 8 and they are discussed in subsections 4 3 and 4 4 finally in subsection 4 5 a comparison between the results obtained in this work and some others found in similar studies has been made 4 1 experimental results in batch reactor with krcl and xebr excilamps in the first experimental series the influence of the variation of h2o2 amaranth mass ratio on the process has been analyzed the results obtained are shown in fig 2a and b for the krcl and xebr excilamp respectively as it can be observed for the krcl lamp the optimum mass ratio seems to be 5 1 and there is no significant improvement with the results corresponding to the 6 1 ratio in a similar way for the xebr lamp the optimal ratio seems to be 6 1 once the optimum mass ratio has been selected for both lamps the obtained results were compared not only considering the photodegradation rate but also the energy consumption expressed as fluence this can be seen in fig 2c and d proving that the krcl excilamp is clearly more effective both in terms of degradation rate and energy consumption this result can be explained taking into account the wavelength of maximum uv emission of both excilamps which is 222 nm for the krcl excilamp very close to the maximum absorption wavelength of amaranth in the uv region 225 nm while this maximum is of 283 nm for the xebr excilamp far from amaranth absorption it is important to notice that although the average radiation intensity of the xebr lamp is around 5 times higher than the one of the krcl excilamp the most determining factor to achieve an optimum photodegradation process is the matching between the maximum emission of the lamp and the maximum absorption of the target compound this aspect is particularly relevant when monochromatic sources such as excimer lamps are used in fig 3a which corresponds with the second series and where the variation of the initial dye concentration was studied it can be seen that for both excilamps conversion decreases when increasing amaranth initial concentration as expected since the radiation intensity per mass unit is lower as in the previous series the best results are obtained with the krcl lamp also considering the energy consumption as it can be seen in fig 3b the third experimental series in which reaction volume was varied is depicted in fig 4a and b showing the variation of conversion versus time and fluence respectively from these results it seems that this variable has no significant influence probably due to the narrow range of volume variation used in this series once again the krcl has proven to be the best uv source achieving high values of amaranth conversion with low energy requirements finally for the four series the results corresponding to the photo fenton process are shown in fig 5a d it is interesting to observe how the use of fenton improves the performance of the xebr excilamp for the optimum fe2 concentration selected 5 mg l 1 the results of the mentioned lamp are very close to the ones obtained with the krcl excilamp which is still a better option especially in terms of fluence 4 2 model fitting of the batch reactor results with krcl and xebr excilamps in figs 2 5 the dots are the experimental values of conversion and the continuous lines correspond with the data calculated by using eq 3 17 additionally in table 1 the values of the pseudo first order kinetic constant kr obtained in the fitting of the experimental data of each series to the model and the correlation coefficients are shown as it can be observed both in all figures and in table 1 an excellent fitting to the proposed model has been obtained in the series with the variation of the h2o2 amaranth mass ratio to analyze the dependence of kr on the experimental conditions eq 3 11 must be applied since the only variable is the hydrogen peroxide concentration however as the value of h2o2 lim is unknown some approximation must be made assuming this value is almost proportional to the initial hydrogen peroxide concentration being kh the proportionality constant the rate constant obtained from eq 3 11 can be rewritten as 4 1 k r v r v ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 k h h 2 o 2 0 ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 k c 2 k h h 2 o 2 0 a 0 and by putting all constants together the following dependence with h2o2 0 is obtained 4 2 k r a b h 2 o 2 0 c d h 2 o 2 0 fig 6a shows the fitting to this previous equation using the different values of h2o2 0 and the calculated values of kr for both krcl and xebr excilamps the values of the different parameters of eq 4 2 are presented in table 3 in fig 6a it is also important to point out the much higher values of kr obtained for the krcl excilamp in good agreement with the better performance of this uv lamp mentioned in section 4 1 for the fitting to the model of experimental series 2 where the variation of initial dye concentration was studied from eq 3 12 the following new expression can be obtained 4 3 1 k r v v r 1 ԑ k e k l a i a 0 1 k c 1 which can be expressed as follows 4 4 1 k r a a 0 b the good fitting to this last equation is shown in fig 6b and once again the values of kr are higher for the assays with the krcl excimer lamp as expected from the experimental results in the third series eq 3 12 has been used again for the model fitting a linear variation of kr with the inverse of the volume is expected initially according to the following expression 4 5 k r 1 v v r k c 1 ԑ k e k l a i ԑ k e k l a i k c 1 a 0 however as it can be seen in fig 6c there is not a significant variation of kr with the inverse of v as predicted in eq 4 5 this is probably due to a double and opposite effect on one hand as the volume is in the denominator of eq 4 5 a higher volume has a negative effect on the kinetic constant on the other hand taking into account the experimental system used a higher volume involves less distance between the free surface of reaction volume and the radiation source and as a result the sample receives higher radiation intensity and the value of kr increases as a consequence of this double effect and considering also the narrow range obtained for the variation of kr there is no clear tendency for this series finally for the photo fenton experiments although the use of fenton reagent is not considered in the model equations the same kinetic model has been applied with good results and a clear linear dependence between the obtained values of kr and the variation of the initial fe2 concentration is presented in fig 6d being again the krcl excilamp more efficient 4 3 experimental results in the krcl flow through photoreactor results from this experimental reactor configuration are shown in fig 7 fig 7a depicts the results of variation in the h2o2 amaranth mass ratio as it can be observed the optimum mass ratio seems to be 2 5 1 0 because for a higher mass ratio 3 0 1 0 no significant improvements are obtained after selecting the optimum mass ratio the influences of variation of the initial dye concentration and the reaction volume were studied results are depicted in fig 7b and c respectively showing that conversion decreases when there is an increase in amaranth initial concentration and or in the reaction volume in good agreement with the behaviour predicted in eqs 4 4 and 4 5 this is the expected result as the radiation intensity is the same but lower per mass unit finally fig 7d shows the results corresponding to the photo fenton process where it can be noticed that even with the lowest fe2 concentration assayed the reaction is very fast and conversion values close to 100 are reached from the first reaction minutes 4 4 model fitting of the krcl flow through photoreactor results as indicated in previous paragraphs in fig 7 solid lines correspond with the fitting to the model of the experimental data for each experimental series also the values of kr and correlation coefficients can be found in table 2 fig 7a c show an excellent fitting of the experimental data to the model fig 8a shows the fitting to eq 4 2 for the different values of kr obtained in the series of variation of h2o2 amaranth mass ratio table 4 shows the values of the different parameters of eq 4 2 in the same way fig 8b shows the fitting of kr to eq 4 4 for the experimental data corresponding to the variation of the initial dye concentration a good fitting is observed and also a decreasing in kr values for increasing values of initial dye concentration as expected for the third series and taken into account that in this reactor configuration there is no variation in the intensity of radiation since the distance from the radiation source and the liquid surface is constant according to eq 4 5 a linear variation of kr with the inverse of the volume is expected fig 8c shows the obtained fitting finally for the photo fenton experiments as it has been previously commented the use of fenton reagent is not considered in the model equations besides the reaction occurs very fast and the progress curve is practically a constant line as shown in fig 7d 4 5 comparison with other similar studies regarding the amaranth degradation rate it must be taken into account that it depends on the different operational conditions the dye concentration the type of uv lamp used the use of an oxidizing agent and the possible addition of a catalyst as a consequence it is not easy to make a comparison between the results obtained in this work and the ones from other published manuscripts on similar studies nevertheless a comparison has been made using the results of the present study and the ones obtained by gomathi et al 21 and wu et al 40 these works have been selected because their results have been fitted to a pseudo first order kinetic model as well and the values of the pseudo first order kinetic constant can be found which facilitates the comparison in this way from eq 3 17 of the manuscript where the relationship between the conversion xa the reaction time t and the kinetic constant kr was established the half life time t 1 2 can be calculated as follows 4 6 t 1 2 l n 0 5 k r this time corresponds with a conversion of 0 5 and it is the time needed to degrade half of the initial dye concentration so the lower the half life time is the higher is the efficiency of the lamp also if the intensity of radiation is known the fluence corresponding to the half life time can be also calculated and the lower the fluence the lower the energy consumption from these considerations in table 5 a comparison between the results obtained for the half life time and fluence in this work and the ones calculated from the data shown in references 21 and 40 has been made as it can be seen in table 5 in terms of half life time and fluence the higher efficiency corresponds with the krcl excilamp being the efficiency of the xebr excilamp higher or lower than the one of reference 21 depending on the initial dye concentration and lower than the one of reference 40 so it can be affirmed that good removal performance of amaranth can be obtained with excilamps mainly with the krcl one additionally as the use of mercury is avoided in these lamps they are also a technology cleanest and more environmentally friendly than traditional uv sources 5 conclusions excimer technology has proven to be an excellent alternative to conventional treatments for the removal of complex organic compounds such as dyes achieving a high elimination level under optimal reaction conditions in this work two reactor configurations have been used for the photodegradation of amaranth a batch reactor with krcl or xebr excilamp and a krcl flow through photoreactor firstly a detailed study comparing the results attained with the krcl and xebr excilamps in the discontinuous system has been carried out the krcl lamp has led to the best results both in terms of removal efficiency amount of oxidant needed optimum mass ratio hydrogen peroxide dye is 5 1 versus 6 1 for the xebr and energy requirements although with the addition of fenton reagent as oxidant there is a significant improvement in the results obtained with the xebr excilamp being very close to those achieved with the krcl lamp once the krcl excilamp has been selected the flow through photoreactor has been tested for the same experimental series for this reactor configuration the optimal mass ratio hydrogen peroxide amaranth has been 2 5 1 and as previously the photo fenton process significantly improves the removal efficiencies in addition a kinetic model previously developed by the authors and slightly modified to be suitable for batch reactors has been tested and validated with an excellent fitting of all experimental data for both reactor configurations this model agrees with the observed dependence of the pseudo first order kinetic constant on different experimental variables future research must be focused on the process scale up and for that semicontinuous or continuous configurations of the flow through photoreactor must be tested and some small aspects of the kinetic model must be improved such as the inclusion of the fenton reagent in the model equations or a deeper study of the influence of the reaction volume distance from the radiation source allowing an even better process simulation and understanding declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements along this work m d

beauty industry including brands from the consumer division of loreal such as dark and lovely site 2 the sampling sites were chosen for this study to assess the difference in the quality of the wastewater produced the collection was done over a period of 4 weeks in october 2018 about 4 l of wastewater was collected from each hair salon during this period to ensure that the water had uniform characteristics 1 l of wastewater was collected for each type of hair treatment a composite sample was then made by mixing all the collected wastewater in a polypropylene bucket composite samples were made by mixing the different types of wastewater provided from the different services provided by the salons fig 1 this was done by collecting the wastewater from the basins during washing rinsing off of the hair the pipes leading to the public sewer system from the salons could not be accessed hence the point of use sampling method samples were packed in an icebox before transportation to the laboratory where they were stored in a refrigerator at about 4 c 2 3 design of a rapid granular multimedia filtration system the rapid granular multimedia filter system was designed using a 50 l transparent plastic container a hole was perforated at the base of the container to fit a polyvinyl chloride pvc tube which served as an outlet fig 2 the filter bed was made up of three granular media sand crushed activated charcoal and clinoptilolite zeolites aluminum silicate balanced by cationic species na k ca2 mg2 the sand layer was used to remove colloidal matter such as hair particles and foam from the wastewater the purpose of the activated charcoal ac layer was to remove components that the sand filter could not remove such as odour harmful taste and colour causing compounds the clinoptilolite zeolites layer removes heavy metals pb cd zn cr fe etc present in the wastewater prior to stacking in the column the sand and coal were washed with water then treated with 10 v v hcl and finally heated at 180 c the hcl chemical treatment removes hard deposits within the depth of the multimedia rapid filter bhosale and sakhar 2013 the filter bed was packed to a depth of 1 m different sizes of sand particles 0 3 0 8 1 2 2 mm made up the first 50 cm upper layer followed by a 10 cm layer of 800 mm of coal blocks the third layer consisted of 40 cm of 1 2 mm zeolite particles the column had a headspace of 0 022 m3 the filtrate was collected from a 10 cm layer of gravel the granular multimedia filtration system was prepared by washing it with tap water for two days prior to filtering the collected wastewater half of the collected samples were run through the sand filter at a flow rate of 50 ml min 1 and the rest were kept refrigerated the wastewater from each site was run once through the multimedia filter before analysis the unfiltered samples were preserved with nitric acid to a ph of about 2 the collection and filtration of the salon wastewater through the multimedia filter was done twice for samples from each site 2 4 analysis of physical and chemical composition of the wastewater the collected wastewater samples were analyzed for physicochemical properties using a ysi professional plus multiparameter meter the multimeter was appropriately calibrated according to the manufacturer s instructions total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec and the ph were measured on site the turbidity of the samples was measured using an orion aquafast turbidity meter aq 3010 the toc of the samples was measured using a teledyne tekmar toc torch sample preparation for ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc was done by a manual solid phase extraction spe method the cartridge stationary phase was comprised of a 22 μm

the lc ms peaks was done using compass dataanalysis version 4 3 software by bruker daltonik gmbh the software uses various libraries such as chemspider kegg and chebi for the identification of the organic compounds in salon wastewater 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater physicochemical properties the rapid granular multimedia filter was able to effectively remove color from the wastewater samples as depicted in fig 3 this was attributed to the exclusion or removal of large or suspended colloidal particles and chromophore bearing compounds by the three layers of sand and activated carbon the physicochemical parameters of the wastewater samples from the two hair salons sites 1 and 2 before and after multimedia filtration are given in table 1 the results show that the analyzed raw composite samples were alkaline table 1 the lowest ph value of 9 34 was recorded at site 1 and a slightly higher value of 9 77 at site 2 the similarity in the ph values in this study suggests that the composition of the wastewater is alike this can further be supported by the similar product ingredients used in the hair salons from table si 1 the high ph of wastewater is attributed to the relaxer containing calcium hydroxide and dye products containing p ppd used in the hair beauty process 14 p ppd is an aromatic base compound derived from benzene substituted by two electron donor amine nh2 groups in the para positions to confer the property of easy oxidation 15 p ppd in alkaline medium containing hydrogen peroxide reacts with for example m aminophenol to form colour compounds in the hair colour formation process calcium hydroxide is a slightly soluble metal base compound derived from water and calcium oxide it is converted in situ into a more soluble base like guanidine hydroxide guanidine hydroxide which then generates hydroxide oh ions that initiate the relaxing process 16 hence the high ph in the wastewater is due to the electron donor nh2 groups and oh ions concentration from p ppd and guanidine hydroxide respectively the ph values after pretreatment are within the general acceptable limits between 5 5 and 9 5 for wastewater to be discharged into the environment according to the national water act of south africa of 1988 however zamxaka et al 17 reported that the growth of both pathogenic and indicator microorganisms could be favoured in wastewater with ph values between 3 and 10 5 a reduction in wastewater ph after pretreatment from 9 34 to 7 47 for site 1 and 9 77 to 7 54 for site 2 samples was recorded the ph reduction is due to the cationic exchange capacity cec of the clinoptilolite zeolites layer in the granular filter the presence of the exchangeable charge balancing cations in the zeolites structure allows for the exchange of the cations when the zeolites are in contact with ionic solutions 9 for example the oh ions in the wastewater will get adsorbed onto the surface functional silanol si oh and al oh groups of clinoptilolite to form si o and al o groups 18 the predominant formation of the si o and al o groups means that these reactions have an overall negative charge which consequently leads to the decrease in ph this also involves the ion exchange reactions between the metal ions and surface counterbalance cations 19 a very high ph can negatively affect the performance of subsequent treatment steps such as membrane filtration which has the potential of treating salon wastewater for reuse purposes the tds values of the raw wastewater were 309 5 mg l 1 site 1 and 315 0 mg l 1 site 2 respectively the low tds values in comparison to previous work can be attributed to the composition of the composite samples sourced from only four types of beauty hair salon the wash relaxer dye and treatment wastewater excluding services such as perm nail and skin care the limited number of services can only generate wastewater with limited inorganic and organic salts the granular filter was effective in reducing the tds and values decreased from 309 5 211 4 mg l 1 for site 1 and 315 before multimedia filtration to 226 mg l 1 after multimedia filtration for site 2 this was mainly due to the adsorption by the activated carbon as well as the combined effect of adsorption and ion exchange that occurs in the clinoptilolite zeolites layer it was anticipated that these two layers would have high affinity for charged species in the wastewater the ec of the wastewater samples from the two salons differed significantly and a value of 344 1 μs cm 1 was recorded for site 1 and 453 μs cm 1 for site 2 this was due to the differences in the ingredients of the different hair products used at these two salons the results also showed a correlation between the ec and tds values from the two sites site 2 had a slightly higher tds value and a higher ec value this shows that the dissolved salts in the wastewater contributed to the high conductivity of the wastewater therefore the ion content from the dissolution of salts in the wastewater affected the electrical conductivity according to 20 ions that cause conductivity are the oh and hydrogen h and nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates the oh and h ion contribution to ec is a function of ph for example at high ph the oh ion concentration is high and thus will result in high ec values electrical conductivity values measured from the two sites were within the acceptable limit of 700 1500 μs cm 1 of wastewater discharged into water sources according to the national water act 36 of 1998 of south africa multimedia filtration resulted in 9 1 and 9 0 decrease in ec after filtration for site 1 and 2 respectively the decrease in ec was due to the removal of the ions in the wastewater which is due to the combined effect of adsorption and ion exchange reactions that occurs in the clinoptilolite layer 3 2 feed stream turbidity the turbidity of the collected composite samples ranged from 227 4 54 ntu site 1 to 945 28 35 ntu site 2 the high turbidity values can be attributed to the presence of surfactants from the washing and colouring chemicals used in the various hair treatments 14 a high reduction in the turbidity of the wastewater was observed 99 8 and 99 7 removal for site 1 and 2 respectively this is due to the small interparticle pores of activated carbon coupled with its large surface area activated carbon has great sorption proportion due to its well developed and accessible pore structure 9 3 3 total organic carbon the measured total organic carbon values of the raw composite samples from sites 1 and 2 were 47 284 0 739 and 61 487 0 943 mgc l 1 respectively indicating the presence of high content of organics in the wastewater 14 a significant decline in the toc levels was observed after the multimedia filtration step near complete removal of toc was observed for both sites site 1 98 5 and site 2 98 7 the activated carbon layer in the rapid granular filter can physically adsorb organic compounds from aqueous solutions 21 the positively charged clinoptilolite also has an affinity for negatively charged organics activated carbon is mainly used for the removal of odour bad taste and colour causing compounds from water furthermore activated carbon has also been reported to effectively remove dyes up to 99 from wastewater 21 3 4 compound identification the lc ms chromatograms of the as collected samples from site 1 and site 2 are shown in fig 4 analysis was done at a mass accuracy less than 0 3 ppm the peaks indicate the mass of the identified organic compounds using the peak with one unit of mass higher than the parent ion m 1 due to the presence of the 13c isotope fig 4 shows that more than 50 of the identified organic compounds occurred at both sites the wastewater from the different beauty hair salons was similar in terms of the composition and the products used at the two beauty hair salons had the same composition of active ingredients a total of twenty two substances were identified in the salon wastewater after qualitative screening twelve of the identified compounds were found to be common at both sites blue arrows eight of the compounds were found only at site 1 green arrows and two of the identified compounds were found only at site 2 red arrows the differences observed could be due to the progressive trend towards manufacturing and entrance of new hair products into the market hence emergency of new ingredients one of the commonly identified compounds at both sites is pantothenol also known as provitamin b5 used in the cosmetics and healthcare industries it is a common ingredient for skin care products and shampoos 22 according to hoelzel et al 23 pantothenol or one of its derivatives is responsible for the shine lending effects in shampoos hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid hedta is another commonly identified compound at both sites it is used as a chelating agent in shampoos chelating agents are added in compositions of hair shampoos to complex undesired metal ions 24 l rhamnose a naturally occurring deoxy sugar obtained from plants such as birch trees and buckthorn was found only in the wastewater from site 2 one or two molecules of rhamnose bonded to several hydroxyl fatty acids of varying chain lengths make up a rhamnolipid rhamnolipids have been reported to be constituents of anti dandruff nail care products and toothpaste because of their high emulsifying and surface activities 25 table 2 lists all the identified compounds as annotated by the specific databases figures si 1 11 in the supplementary material section shows the lcms chromatograms and mass spectra of some of the identified organic compounds from site 1 and 2 six of the identified compounds 2 3 11 12 13 and 14 are polyethylene glycols pegs or peg derivatives some occurring in both sites and others in only one site these compounds are used as solvents humectants emulsion stabilizers viscosity increasing agents and binders in personal care products 26 pegs and their derivatives are commonly used in hair care products face makeup lipsticks mascara and blush pegs and peg derivatives are mixtures of compounds with different polymer chain lengths 26 for example peg 4 contains substantial amounts of heptaethylene glycol 8 hexaethylene glycol 16 triethylene glycol 17 pentaethylene glycol 25 diethylene glycol 3 octaethylene glycol 2 and tetraethylene glycol 29 27 peg 4 was not one of the identified compounds in the wastewater but one of its constituents heptaethylene glycol was identified peg 4 is used as a humectant or solvent in cosmetics most of the identified compounds have not been reported in personal care products or cosmetics salon wastewater contains various acids alkalis dyes relaxer bleaches and other organic and inorganic compounds 5 due to the complexity of the compounds identified in the wastewater reactions may have occurred in the wastewater on mixing of the different chemical compounds used in the services provided resulting in new compounds that were not originally part of the main ingredients figures si 10 and 11 in the supplementary material section show a decrease in peak intensity after multimedia filtration with some of the peaks having completely disappeared in the filtered samples peak intensity of compounds 8 22 decreased in intensity after the multimedia filtration pretreatment step masses of these compounds ranged from 126 032 524 278 g mol peaks of two of the identified compounds pantothenol and l phenylalanine found at both sites completely disappeared peak of l rhamnose site 2 and peak of compound 4 site 1 also completely disappeared this shows that the multimedia granular filter completely removed compounds with masses 165 076 166 086 206 139 385 238 406 216 428 216 and 519 315 g mol which indicate their affinity for the media used in the filter the large porosity of the activated carbon layer of the multimedia filter increases its capability of adsorbing small molecules and even larger molecules from the wastewater furthermore this can be attributed to the high surface area and presence of active sites for adsorption on the activated carbon and clinoptilolite zeolites layer in the rapid granular multimedia filtration system the significant decline in wastewater toc demonstrated the effectiveness of the simple and easily assembled multimedia filter system used in this work the effectiveness of activated carbon and the clinoptilolite zeolites layer in the removal and reduction of organic compounds in the salon wastewater is evident in the chromatograms of the pretreated salon wastewater samples figures si 10 and 11 4 conclusion the attained results showed that the collected wastewater from the two sites was alkaline with an average ph of 9 55 the multimedia granular filter showed a ph correction potential which was largely attributed to the exchangeable cations in clinoptilolite it also exhibited high removal efficiency for turbidity for the highly coloured salon wastewater the attained removal was above 98 the chosen granular multimedia showed selectivity and affinity towards certain organic compounds from the wastewater matrices the effectiveness of the granular multimedia filter is further demonstrated by the significant reduction in toc values this study also managed to detect and identify several compounds which are constituents of commonly used hair treatment products in their pristine form in the aqueous mixture even though it was immediately after use there is still a huge need to develop cheap effective methods to remove these compounds before they are added to the already complex mixture of grey wastewater stream the identified organic compounds had masses ranging from 164 16 to 516 315 g mol and have identified use in personal care products the simple granular multimedia displayed great potential in improving the quality of raw salon wastewater

sand crushed activated charcoal and clinoptilolite zeolites aluminum silicate balanced by cationic species na k ca2 mg2 the sand layer was used to remove colloidal matter such as hair particles and foam from the wastewater the purpose of the activated charcoal ac layer was to remove components that the sand filter could not remove such as odour harmful taste and colour causing compounds the clinoptilolite zeolites layer removes heavy metals pb cd zn cr fe etc present in the wastewater prior to stacking in the column the sand and coal were washed with water then treated with 10 v v hcl and finally heated at 180 c the hcl chemical treatment removes hard deposits within the depth of the multimedia rapid filter bhosale and sakhar 2013 the filter bed was packed to a depth of 1 m different sizes of sand particles 0 3 0 8 1 2 2 mm made up the first 50 cm upper layer followed by a 10 cm layer of 800 mm of coal blocks the third layer consisted of 40 cm of 1 2 mm zeolite particles the column had a headspace of 0 022 m3 the filtrate was collected from a 10 cm layer of gravel the granular multimedia filtration system was prepared by washing it with tap water for two days prior to filtering the collected wastewater half of the collected samples were run through the sand filter at a flow rate of 50 ml min 1 and the rest were kept refrigerated the wastewater from each site was run once through the multimedia filter before analysis the unfiltered samples were preserved with nitric acid to a ph of about 2 the collection and filtration of the salon wastewater through the multimedia filter was done twice for samples from each site 2 4 analysis of physical and chemical composition of the wastewater the collected wastewater samples were analyzed for physicochemical properties using a ysi professional plus multiparameter meter the multimeter was appropriately calibrated according to the manufacturer s instructions total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec and the ph were measured on site the turbidity of the samples was measured using an orion aquafast turbidity meter aq 3010 the toc of the samples was measured using a teledyne tekmar toc torch sample preparation for ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc was done by a manual solid phase extraction spe method the cartridge stationary phase was comprised of a 22 μm medium surface area divinylbenzene resin particle grafted with carboxylate functionality 13 the spe system was composed of a glass vacuum manifold and pump the conditions of the spe step were done as reported before 13 the eluted samples were stored at 4 c before analysis a dionex ultimate 3000 uhplc system dionex softon gmbh dorniersterk 4 germany equipped with a reversed phase c18 analytical column of 100 mm 2 1 mm and 1 7 μm particle size acquity uplc reh water ireland was used to analyse the organic compounds in the salon wastewater this lc ms system used was an impact ǁ bruker bruker daltonics gmbh fahrenheitstr 4 bremen germany equipped with electrospray ionization operated in positive ion mode lc ms accurate mass spectra were recorded across the range 50 1600 m z analysis was done with 0 1 fa in water in line a and 10 methanol in water in line b at a flow rate of 0 1 ml min 1 the water methanol ratio was kept constant and the running time was 14 min run 1 identification of the lc ms peaks was done using compass dataanalysis version 4 3 software by bruker daltonik gmbh the software uses various libraries such as chemspider kegg and chebi for the identification of the organic compounds in salon wastewater 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater physicochemical properties the rapid granular multimedia filter was able to effectively remove color from the wastewater samples as depicted in fig 3 this was attributed to the exclusion or removal of large or suspended colloidal particles and chromophore bearing compounds by the three layers of sand and activated carbon the physicochemical parameters of the wastewater samples from the two hair salons sites 1 and 2 before and after multimedia filtration are given in table 1 the results show that the analyzed raw composite samples were alkaline table 1 the lowest ph value of 9 34 was recorded at site 1 and a slightly higher value of 9 77 at site 2 the similarity in the ph values in this study suggests that the composition of the wastewater is alike this can further be supported by the similar product ingredients used in the hair salons from table si 1 the high ph of wastewater is attributed to the relaxer containing calcium hydroxide and dye products containing p ppd used in the hair beauty process 14 p ppd is an aromatic base compound derived from benzene substituted by two electron donor amine nh2 groups in the para positions to confer the property of easy oxidation 15 p ppd in alkaline medium containing hydrogen peroxide reacts with for example m aminophenol to form colour compounds in the hair colour formation process calcium hydroxide is a slightly soluble metal base compound derived from water and calcium oxide it is converted in situ into a more soluble base like guanidine hydroxide guanidine hydroxide which then generates hydroxide oh ions that initiate the relaxing process 16 hence the high ph in the wastewater is due to the electron donor nh2 groups and oh ions concentration from p ppd and guanidine hydroxide respectively the ph values after pretreatment are within the general acceptable limits between 5 5 and 9 5 for wastewater to be discharged into the environment according to the national water act of south africa of 1988 however zamxaka et al 17 reported that the growth of both pathogenic and indicator microorganisms could be favoured in wastewater with ph values between 3 and 10 5 a reduction in wastewater ph after pretreatment from 9 34 to 7 47 for site 1 and 9 77 to 7 54 for site 2 samples was recorded the ph reduction is due to the cationic exchange capacity cec of the clinoptilolite zeolites layer in the granular filter the presence of the exchangeable charge balancing cations in the zeolites structure allows for the exchange of the cations when the zeolites are in contact with ionic solutions 9 for example the oh ions in the wastewater will get adsorbed onto the surface functional silanol si oh and al oh groups of clinoptilolite to form si o and al o groups 18 the predominant formation of the si o and al o groups means that these reactions have an overall negative charge which consequently leads to the decrease in ph this also involves the ion exchange reactions between the metal ions and surface counterbalance cations 19 a very high ph can negatively affect the performance of subsequent treatment steps such as membrane filtration which has the potential of treating salon wastewater for reuse purposes the tds values of the raw wastewater were 309 5 mg l 1 site 1 and 315 0 mg l 1 site 2 respectively the low tds values in comparison to previous work can be attributed to the composition of the composite samples sourced from only four types of beauty hair salon the wash relaxer dye and treatment wastewater excluding services such as perm nail and skin care the limited number of services can only generate wastewater with limited inorganic and organic salts the granular filter was effective in reducing the tds and values decreased from 309 5 211 4 mg l 1 for site 1 and 315 before multimedia filtration to 226 mg l 1 after multimedia filtration for site 2 this was mainly due to the adsorption by the activated carbon as well as the combined effect of adsorption and ion exchange that occurs in the clinoptilolite zeolites layer it was anticipated that these two layers would have high affinity for charged species in the wastewater the ec of the wastewater samples from the two salons differed significantly and a value of 344 1 μs cm 1 was recorded for site 1 and 453 μs cm 1 for site 2 this was due to the differences in the ingredients of the different hair products used at these two salons the results also showed a correlation between the ec and tds values from the two sites site 2 had a slightly higher tds value and a higher ec value this shows that the dissolved salts in the wastewater contributed to the high conductivity of the wastewater therefore the ion content from the dissolution of salts in the wastewater affected the electrical conductivity according to 20 ions that cause conductivity are the oh and hydrogen h and nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates the oh and h ion contribution to ec is a function of ph for example at high ph the oh ion concentration is high and thus will result in high ec values electrical conductivity values measured from the two sites were within the acceptable limit of 700 1500 μs cm 1 of wastewater discharged into water sources according to the national water act 36 of 1998 of south africa multimedia filtration resulted in 9 1 and 9 0 decrease in ec after filtration for site 1 and 2 respectively the decrease in ec was due to the removal of the ions in the wastewater which is due to the combined effect of adsorption and ion exchange reactions that occurs in the clinoptilolite layer 3 2 feed stream turbidity the turbidity of the collected composite samples ranged from 227 4 54 ntu site 1 to 945 28 35 ntu site 2 the high turbidity values can be attributed to the presence of surfactants from the washing and colouring chemicals used in the various hair treatments 14 a high reduction in the turbidity of the wastewater was observed 99 8 and 99 7 removal for site 1 and 2 respectively this is due to the small interparticle pores of activated carbon coupled with its large surface area activated carbon has great sorption proportion due to its well developed and accessible pore structure 9 3 3 total organic carbon the measured total organic carbon values of the raw composite samples from sites 1 and 2 were 47 284 0 739 and 61 487 0 943 mgc l 1 respectively indicating the presence of high content of organics in the wastewater 14 a significant decline in the toc levels was observed after the multimedia filtration step near complete removal of toc was observed for both sites site 1 98 5 and site 2 98 7 the activated carbon layer in the rapid granular filter can physically adsorb organic compounds from aqueous solutions 21 the positively charged clinoptilolite also has an affinity for negatively charged organics activated carbon is mainly used for the removal of odour bad taste and colour causing compounds from water furthermore activated carbon has also been reported to effectively remove dyes up to 99 from wastewater 21 3 4 compound identification the lc ms chromatograms of the as collected samples from site 1 and site 2 are shown in fig 4 analysis was done at a mass accuracy less than 0 3 ppm the peaks indicate the mass of the identified organic compounds using the peak with one unit of mass higher than the parent ion m 1 due to the presence of the 13c isotope fig 4 shows that more than 50 of the identified organic compounds occurred at both sites the wastewater from the different beauty hair salons was similar in terms of the composition and the products used at the two beauty hair salons had the same composition of active ingredients a total of twenty two substances were identified in the salon wastewater after qualitative screening twelve of the identified compounds were found to be common at both sites blue arrows eight of the compounds were found only at site 1 green arrows and two of the identified compounds were found only at site 2 red arrows the differences observed could be due to the progressive trend towards manufacturing and entrance of new hair products into the market hence emergency of new ingredients one of the commonly identified compounds at both sites is pantothenol also known as provitamin b5 used in the cosmetics and healthcare industries it is a common ingredient for skin care products and shampoos 22 according to hoelzel et al 23 pantothenol or one of its derivatives is responsible for the shine lending effects in shampoos hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid hedta is another commonly identified compound at both sites it is used as a chelating agent in shampoos chelating agents are added in compositions of hair shampoos to complex undesired metal ions 24 l rhamnose a naturally occurring deoxy sugar obtained from plants such as birch trees and buckthorn was found only in the wastewater from site 2 one or two molecules of rhamnose bonded to several hydroxyl fatty acids of varying chain lengths make up a rhamnolipid rhamnolipids have been reported to be constituents of anti dandruff nail care products and toothpaste because of their high emulsifying and surface activities 25 table 2 lists all the identified compounds as annotated by the specific databases figures si 1 11 in the supplementary material section shows the lcms chromatograms and mass spectra of some of the identified organic compounds from site 1 and 2 six of the identified compounds 2 3 11 12 13 and 14 are polyethylene glycols pegs or peg derivatives some occurring in both sites and others in only one site these compounds are used as solvents humectants emulsion stabilizers viscosity increasing agents and binders in personal care products 26 pegs and their derivatives are commonly used in hair care products face makeup lipsticks mascara and blush pegs and peg derivatives are mixtures of compounds with different polymer chain lengths 26 for example peg 4 contains substantial amounts of heptaethylene glycol 8 hexaethylene glycol 16 triethylene glycol 17 pentaethylene glycol 25 diethylene glycol 3 octaethylene glycol 2 and tetraethylene glycol 29 27 peg 4 was not one of the identified compounds in the wastewater but one of its constituents heptaethylene glycol was identified peg 4 is used as a humectant or solvent in cosmetics most of the identified compounds have not been reported in personal care products or cosmetics salon wastewater contains various acids alkalis dyes relaxer bleaches and other organic and inorganic compounds 5 due to the complexity of the compounds identified in the wastewater reactions may have occurred in the wastewater on mixing of the different chemical compounds used in the services provided resulting in new compounds that were not originally part of the main ingredients figures si 10 and 11 in the supplementary material section show a decrease in peak intensity after multimedia filtration with some of the peaks having completely disappeared in the filtered samples peak intensity of compounds 8 22 decreased in intensity after the multimedia filtration pretreatment step masses of these compounds ranged from 126 032 524 278 g mol peaks of two of the identified compounds pantothenol and l phenylalanine found at both sites completely disappeared peak of l rhamnose site 2 and peak of compound 4 site 1 also completely disappeared this shows that the multimedia granular filter completely removed compounds with masses 165 076 166 086 206 139 385 238 406 216 428 216 and 519 315 g mol which indicate their affinity for the media used in the filter the large porosity of the activated carbon layer of the multimedia filter increases its capability of adsorbing small molecules and even larger molecules from the wastewater furthermore this can be attributed to the high surface area and presence of active sites for adsorption on the activated carbon and clinoptilolite zeolites layer in the rapid granular multimedia filtration system the significant decline in wastewater toc demonstrated the effectiveness of the simple and easily assembled multimedia filter system used in this work the effectiveness of activated carbon and the clinoptilolite zeolites layer in the removal and reduction of organic compounds in the salon wastewater is evident in the chromatograms of the pretreated salon wastewater samples figures si 10 and 11 4 conclusion the attained results showed that the collected wastewater from the two sites was alkaline with an average ph of 9 55 the multimedia granular filter showed a ph correction potential which was largely attributed to the exchangeable cations in clinoptilolite it also exhibited high removal efficiency for turbidity for the highly coloured salon wastewater the attained removal was above 98 the chosen granular multimedia showed selectivity and affinity towards certain organic compounds from the wastewater matrices the effectiveness of the granular multimedia filter is further demonstrated by the significant reduction in toc values this study also managed to detect and identify several compounds which are constituents of commonly used hair treatment products in their pristine form in the aqueous mixture even though it was immediately after use there is still a huge need to develop cheap effective methods to remove these compounds before they are added to the already complex mixture of grey wastewater stream the identified organic compounds had masses ranging from 164 16 to 516 315 g mol and have identified use in personal care products the simple granular multimedia displayed great potential in improving the quality of raw salon wastewater

14178,in recent years the application of algae and metal oxides to treat heavy metal wastewaters has attracted considerable attention however algae are difficult to recover due to their low density which will cause secondary pollution and limit its development in the treatment process in this paper metal oxide fe2o3 as an adsorptive material is used to form a composite material with algae which not only can achieve the purpose of immobilizing microalgae but can also improve the adsorption effect we controlled the synthesis temperature of the fe2o3 to reach a good immobilization effect for microalgae and the adsorption capacity of the composite material fe2o3 microalgae was tested the results showed that the adsorption of fe2o3 microalgae for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii followed the pseudo second order model r 2 0 99 the equilibrium data of fe2o3 microalgae agreed well with the langmuir adsorption isotherm model and the maximum adsorption capacity of fe2o3 microalgae was higher than that of microalgae or commercial fe2o3 alone the adsorption capacity for metal ions can be ranked in the following order cr vi 69 77 mg g pb ii 62 63 mg g cd ii 42 12 mg g cu ii 38 68 mg g functional groups such as oh and cooh on the adsorbent surface were involved in the adsorption process therefore fe2o3 microalgae not only achieved the purpose of immobilizing microalgae but also combined the material with the biosorbent thereby enhancing the adsorption effect the biocomposite is thus has potential as an adsorbent for sewage treatment keywords synechocystis sp pcc6803 fe2o3 immobilization adsorption heavy metal 1 introduction with the intensification of industrialization and urbanization heavy metal pollutions has become a serious problem threatening human and ecosystem health 1 2 of the many heavy metals used industrially cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii are common contaminants in various wastewaters e g dye wastewater electroplating oil refining tanning and mining wastewaters 2 when the cellular content of these toxic metals exceeds a tolerance level it results in poisoning cancer and other diseases 3 4 due to their high toxicity the united states environmental protection agency usepa stipulated that the concentration of cr vi in drinking water should not exceed 0 1 mg l 5 the content of cu ii in industrial wastewater was limited to 1 3 mg l 6 the allowed limit of pb ii in wastewater was 0 05 mg l 7 and the content of cd ii in drinking water was limited to 0 002 mg l 8 10 in addition the food and agriculture organization of the united nations recommended that the maximum concentration of cr vi in irrigated water should be 0 1 mg l 11 the world health organization stipulated that the maximum concentration of pb ii and cd ii in drinking water should not exceed 0 01 mg l 12 14 and 0 003 mg l 15 16 respectively at present many methods and technologies have been used to remove heavy metal ions from wastewater including reverse osmosis chemical precipitation and ion exchange 17 19 however these methods are limited in practical application due to their high operating costs and toxic precipitates 20 in comparison adsorption has become a promising treatment method in recent years 21 22 because of ease of operation environmental friendliness and high adsorption ability 23 25 therefore various adsorbents including carbon nanotubes 26 graphene 27 30 alumina iron oxide and other metal oxides 31 32 have attracted considerable attention and wide application in addition biosorbent microalgae are also potential candidates because there are many functional groups e g hydroxyl and carboxyl groups related to adsorption on the surface of microalgae and both living cells and dead cells have good adsorption capacities 33 34 however because microalgae have low density 35 and are difficult to in separate it has been difficult to implement their use in large scale applications this has led to rapid development of microalgae immobilization technologies 36 several immobilization media including alginates carrageenan and polyacrylamide gel have been examined 37 however there are few reports on immobilizing microalgae by any means that do not affect their adsorption performance in recent years various metal oxides 31 32 especially iron oxides fe2o3 and fe3o4 38 39 have attracted wide attention due to their good selectivity and affinity in the adsorption process van chinh tran prepared low cost fe2o3 rutile nanocomposites from ilmenite for the removal of arsenic from water due to its high specific surface area the adsorption capacity of fe2o3 rutile dioxide composite to arsenic can reach 47 12 mg g 1 40 lie yang studied a approach was employed to load α fe2o3 and α feooh onto sewage sludge biochar sbc with the purpose of efficient nickel ni removal ni ii adsorption capacity of 35 50 mg g 1 in 100 ppm ni ii solution with 10 mg modified sewage sludge biochar msbc was achieved 41 mahboobeh dirbaz et al studied the adsorption effect of different microalgae on cd2 in wastewater among which parachlorella sp had a adsorption capacity of 90 72 mg g 1 that was 1 5 to 3 times that of other adsorbents 42 ricardo saavedra compared the absorption of arsenic boron copper and other toxic elements in single and multi metal solutions of four green microalgae indicating that microalgae biomass was a potential biological adsorbent of toxic elements 43 maria del rosario martinez macias found that the removal rate of cu2 ions from acid mine drainage by nannochloropsis oculata was 99 92 44 the research on microalgae and fe2o3 mainly used bio synthetic magnetic nanomaterials to extract harmful algae from water and convert them into biodiesel in a cheap simple and environmentally friendly process 45 few studies have been conducted on the adsorption of heavy metals by combining the microalgae and fe2o3 compounds a combination of microalgae and iron oxides may bring some advantages 1 more adsorption groups along with microalgae immobilization 46 47 which make microalgae easier to harvest 2 the interaction between microalgae and iron oxide is more beneficial to heavy metal adsorption this is the first attempt to use metal oxides to achieve the immobilization of microalgae to form composite materials with high adsorption properties in this study fe2o3 was synthesized with the inclusion of microalgae synechocystis sp pcc6803 which achieved the purpose of microalgae immobilization because high temperature can carbonize the biological sample so the aim of this study was therefore to investigate the immobilization effect of different synthesis temperatures and the mechanisms of adsorption of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii when using the microalgal fe2o3 immobilized complex fe2o3 microalgae 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of materials five v v of synecdatehocystis sp pcc6803 was inoculated in 250 ml conical flasks with bg 11 medium and cultured under a light intensity of 2000 lx at 35 c ph 7 1 and a 12 12 h light dark cycle 48 during the culture period all flasks were shaken by hand twice every day to avoid agglomeration 49 after 6 days growth the cultures were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min to harvest the cells the washed cells were lyophilized and then ground to a powder in a typical procedure fecl3 0 243 g and synechocystis sp pcc6803 powder 0 05 g were dissolved in 35 ml of distilled water with hexamethylenetetramine 0 421 g after stirring for 30 min the reaction solution was poured into a teflon lined autoclave adjusted to one of three reaction temperatures 70 c 60 c and 50 c for 6 h after 6 h the autoclave cooled naturally to room temperature the precipitate was collected washed with water and ethanol several times by centrifugation and then dried at 70 c for 6 h 2 2 analysis of physical characteristics the products were verified by several techniques x ray diffraction xrd measurements of the as prepared product were collected using a brukerd8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu kα irradiation λ 1 5406 å at room temperature the surface morphology and structure were examined with sem and an energy dispersive spectrometer eds ultra 55 germany was used to analyze the size and morphology of the samples the ftir spectra were recorded in kbr pellets using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in the 400 4000 cm 1 range x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were taken using a phi 5700 esca spectrometer with monochromated al kα radiation hm 1486 6 ev the specific surface area of product was calculated using the multiple point brunauer emmett teller bet method and total pore volume was evaluated from nitrogen uptake at a maximum of relative pressure 2 3 adsorption experiments a series of adsorption experiments were conducted to determine the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii ions fe2o3 microalgae was added to a flask containing a 50 ml solution of heavy metal ions and samples were placed on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm the effects of contact time initial ph 2 0 6 0 adsorption dose 0 1 1 0 g l and ion concentration 10 100 mg l on adsorption capacity were studied respectively the adsorption isotherm model experiment was carried using a range of different metal ion concentrations 10 mg l 500 mg l and samples were extracted from the flask at intervals the inductively coupled plasma spectrometer icp oes was used to determine the ion concentration of each sample all assays were conducted in triplicate and only mean values are presented the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e mg g of the adsorbent for four metal ions was calculated according to eq 1 50 1 q e c 0 c e v m where q e is the equilibrium uptake mg g c 0 is the initial metal ion concentration mg l or ppm c e is the equilibrium metal ion concentration mg l or ppm v is the volume of the solution l and m is the mass of the sorbent g the adsorption kinetic data

amount of metal adsorbed at equilibrium mg g q t is the amount of metal ions adsorbed at any sample time mg g 1 k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg min are rate constants of pseudo first and second order adsorption respectively the adsorption isotherms of the four metal ions were determined langmuir 52 and freundlich 53 equations describing sorption isotherms were applied 4 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 5

known as the freundlich coefficient 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd and ftir analysis x ray diffraction xrd was used to characterize the fe2o3 microalgae synthesized under different reaction temperatures fig 1 a a single sharp intense and well recognizable peaks can be observed on these three patterns the diffraction peaks were in good agreement with the recorded values of fe2o3 joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds 73 2234 a mechanism for the formation of fe2o3 is shown in eqs 6 and 7 as reaction temperature declined the intensity of the characteristic peaks decreased fig 1a this demonstrated that the crystallinity of synthesized fe2o3 was affected by the reaction temperature the adsorbent with low crystallinity was more conducive to adsorption 54 consequently the product synthesized at 50 c was selected to further investigate the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of the four metal ions a schematic diagram of fe2o3 microalgae is presented in fig s1 supplementary information 6 c6h12n4 10h2o 4nh3 h2o 6hcho 7 2fecl3 6nh3 h2o fe2o3 6nh4cl 3h2o the fe2o3 microalgae synthesized under different reaction temperatures exhibited essentially identical group compositions fig 1b the major bands can be assigned as follows a characteristic and broad band appeared around 3730 3739 cm 1 the nh stretching vibrations 55 3355 3384 cm 1 oh stretching 56 2921 2927 cm 1 ch stretching vibration in ch3 groups 57 1621 1631 cm 1 co groups of cooh and ketones 57 1533 1540 cm 1 nh stretch 58 1441 1449 cm 1 the adsorption bands of nh4 59 1151 1152 cm 1 the saccharide ring 58 1021 1026 cm 1 the band of cn the main difference between the microalgae and the fe2o3 microalgae was that the vibration of iron oxide feo 699 cm 1 was apparent in fe2o3 microalgae compared with the microalgae groups in shen s paper 60 these characteristic peaks were essentially consistent with the microalgae alone except for the slight offset of some peaks indicating that the functional group compositions of fe2o3 microalgae were mainly derived from the microalgae in addition it is also suggested that groups on the surface of microalgae were an important component in the formation of fe2o3 microalgae functional groups table 1 the specific surface area of the fe2o3 microalgae also played an important role in the adsorption process the pore distribution and n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of fe2o3 microalgae are shown in fig 1c the position of the hysteresis loop at the n2 isotherm can be used to determine that the specific surface area was 156 m2 g 1 3 2 xps analysis xps spectra were used to investigate the existence of fe2o3 on the surface of fe2o3 microalgae fig 2 the atomic percentage of fe2o3 microalgae is summarized in table 2 these elements including fe c o and n were confirmed by measuring xps scan from 0 to 1400 ev fig 2a for the microalgae and fe2o3 alone n only appeared in microalgae and fe only in fe2o3 however for the fe2o3 microalgae in addition to these common elements fe and n also appeared which indicated that the synthesized product was a mixture of fe2o3 and microalgae the decrease of the c atom percentage and the appearance of n and fe signals indicated that fe2o3 was successfully coated on the surface of the microalgae 3 3 sem and tem analysis scanning electron micrographs taken before and after fe2o3 microalgae adsorption of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii demonstrate that fe2o3 microalgae was composed of spherical particles with diameters less than 2 μm the hrtem image fig 4 demonstrates the presence of nano sized spherical particles on the surface of fe2o3 microalgae this indicated that the synthesis product was composed of micron sized spherical particles wrapped by nanoscale particles microalgal balls were clustered together so that they were highly immobilized fig 3 this xrd analysis also demonstrated the existence of fe2o3 in composition of compounds the possible mechanisms of formation of fe2o3 is shown in fig s1 in addition energy spectrum analysis also demonstrated that the spherical microalgae were covered with nano sized spherical iron oxide the proportion of carbon 63 56 and iron 17 56 indicated that microalgae were still dominant in fe2o3 microalgae this indicated that fe2o3 was synthesized on the surface of microalgae and the microalgae were immobilized through their interaction with the surface of fe2o3 fe2o3 microalgae there were many reports on the synthesis of fe2o3 materials but few reported the synthesis of fe2o3 on the surface of microalgae this not only synthesized the iron oxide but also achieved the purpose of immobilizing microalgae thereby providing the possibility of immobilizing microalgae with metal oxides 3 4 adsorption experiments 3 4 1 effect of ph the initial ph of the solution is an important parameter affecting adsorption because it not only affects the surface charge distribution of the adsorbent but also determines the existence state of metal ions in the solution and solution properties 63 the change of adsorption capacity of fe2o3 microalgae for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii as a function of initial ph is shown in fig s2 for cr vi adsorption fe2o3 microalgae reached the highest adsorption capacity at about ph 2 0 and decreased significantly with increased ph from 2 0 to 6 0 this can be explained as follows at low ph due to the presence of a large number of h ions the adsorbent surface is positively charged and the dominant species of cr ion in solution is hcro4 64 which can be preferentially adsorbed onto the surface of fe2o3 microalgae by electrostatic adsorption with increased ph the number of protons on the fe2o3 microalgae surface decreased and hcro4 also gradually transforms into cro4 2 the electrostatic repulsion between fe2o3 microalgae and cro4 2 was not conducive to adsorption enhancement 65 resulting in a reduction in the adsorption capacity of fe2o3 microalgae to cr vi fe2o3 microalgae showed a strong ph dependence for cr vi adsorption which indicated that the adsorption of cr vi was mainly surface complexation the adsorption of cu ii pb ii and cd ii increased with increased ph at low ph a large number of h competed with metal ions for adsorption sites 22 fe2o3 microalgae exhibited the highest adsorption capacity at ph 5 0 6 0 but in the range 2 0 ph 4 0 fe2o3 microalgae exhibited the lowest adsorption capacity for cu ii pb ii and cd ii when ph 4 0 fe2o3 microalgae began to gradually lose protons thereby exposing more adsorption sites for metal ion binding which significantly increased the adsorption capacity if the ph continues to rise to 6 0 or higher cu ii pb ii and cd ii will hydrolyze to form precipitates of cu oh 2 pb oh 2 and cd oh 2 therefore adsorption at higher ph is not necessary for further discussion considering the adsorption capacity and the feasibility of the experimental operation in the following experiment the optimal ph was adsorbed by ph 2 0 for cr vi and the ph of the cu ii pb ii and cd ii solutions was set at 5 0 3 4 2 effect of contact time and ion concentration the contact time between adsorbate and sorbent is very important for the study of adsorption kinetics the capacity for adsorption of metal ions with a constant does 0 5 g l constant ph ph 2 0 for cr vi ph 5 0 for cu ii pb ii and cd ii increased with increased duration of contact fig s3 for fe2o3 microalgae pb ii required 1 h to reach adsorption equilibrium while for cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions adsorption increased significantly for 0 30 min of contact and then slowly increased to reach the maximum adsorption capacity and maintain a constant rate this is consistent with the generalized characteristics whereby adsorption is faster at the initial stage of contact but slower when approaching equilibrium 61 this may be because there are many adsorption sites available on the surface of the adsorbent at the initial stage of contact 62 as time progresses the number of unoccupied sites diminishes and the rate of adsorption declines due to the increased repulsion between the adsorbent and the adsorbed ions moreover physical adsorption is the main process in the short contact time and the chemical combination of sorbent and heavy metal takes a long time to reach equilibrium in addition fe2o3 microalgae showed far higher adsorption for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii than for control treatments microalgae and fe2o3 alone the higher adsorption efficiency of fe2o3 microalgae may be attributed to the active groups on the surface of the composites the increase of adsorption rate and capacity showed that fe2o3 microalgae had potential advantages in the removal of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii therefore in further experiments the optimal contact time of fe2o3 microalgae for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii was 30 min 60 min 30 min and 30 min respectively the effects of concentration of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii on fe2o3 microalgae adsorption were studied by changing the initial ion concentration within the range 10 100 mg l and keeping all other experimental conditions unchanged ph 2 0 for cr vi ph 5 0 for cu ii pb ii and cd ii contact time 1 5 h adsorption dose 0 5 g l as the concentrations of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii increased from 10 mg l to 100 mg l the adsorption capacity of fe2o3 microalgae increased from 48 2 mg g to 54 9 mg g 28 1 mg g to 34 4 mg g 47 7 mg g to 52 2 mg g and 32 1 mg g to 38 4 mg g respectively fig s3 but with the further increase of the concentration the adsorption capacity did not change significantly fig 6 which may be due to inadequate active sites in the biosorbent for the diffusion of the increasing amount of ions or their mutual collisions hindered the diffusion at the interface of two phases or competing repulsion among them 66 fe2o3 microalgae exhibited a far higher adsorption capacity for the four ions than that of fe2o3 or microalgae alone 3 4 3 effect of adsorbent dose the amount of fe2o3 mcroalgae at the start of exposure to heavy metals is an important parameter influencing adsorption and determines the adsorption capacity of adsorbent for a given initial concentration of metal ions in solution the effects of varying the amount of fe2o3 microalgae present on cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii adsorption were examined the amount of adsorbent amount ranged between 0 1 1 0 g l and other experimental conditions remained unchanged ph 2 0 for cr vi ph 5 0 for cu ii pb ii and cd ii contact time 1 5 h initial ion concentration 80 mg l fig s4 the removal rates of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii increased with increased amounts of absorbent this may be due to the increase of adsorbent surface area and hence available functional sites in the range 0 1 0 5 g l the rate of removal of fe2o3 microalgae increased from 13 83 to 88 37 for cr vi 8 97 to 78 89 for cu ii 11 83 to 88 89 for pb ii and 10 96 to 88 89 for cd ii the removal rates of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii were not significantly increased when the concentration exceeded 0 5 g l this indicated that the adsorption sites in fe2o3 microalgae became saturated therefore 0 5 g l was selected for follow up experiments table 3 3 5 adsorption kinetics absorption equilibrium was attained after 30 min for all ions other that pb ii which needed at least 1 h fig 5 the correlation coefficients indicated a slightly better fit of pseudo second order equation to the experimental data the calculated values derived from the pseudo second order model qe cal were 62 37 mg g 1 22 28 mg g 1 60 39 mg g 1 and 20 07 mg g 1 for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii respectively this showed good agreement with the experiment data the adsorption results of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii onto fe2o3 microalgae were explained by the pseudo second order equation with correlation coefficients of around 0 99 this implied that the basic adsorption was chemisorption 67 and involved electron sharing between adsorbent and metal ions 68 70 3 6 adsorption isotherms the langmuir model better matched the adsorption data with higher correlation coefficients than the freundlich model fig 6 therefore the langmuir model was better able to explain the adsorption process of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii on fe2o3 microalgae it can be inferred that the adsorption process of metal ions on fe2o3 microalgae was mainly homogeneous and monolayer adsorption with the latter being the main process 71 in addition rl 2 0 9 table 4 also indicated that langmuir adsorption was dominant according to the langmuir model the calculated q m was approximately 69 77 mg g 1 for cr vi 38 68 mg g 1 for cu ii 62 63 mg g 1 for pb ii and 42 12 mg g 1 for cd ii at 303 k the comparison adsorption capacities of various adsorbents to cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii were listed in table 5 it can be seen that fe2o3 microalgae had a good adsorption effect compared with other adsorbents maximum adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions decreased in the order cr vi pb ii cd ii cu ii 3 7 adsorption mechanism 3 7 1 ftir analysis of the materials after adsorption after adsorption of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii the characteristic peaks of functional groups shifted by varying degrees fig 7 for example the characteristic peaks of oh moved from 3355 cm 1 to 3357 cm 1 3332 cm 1 3352 cm 1 and 3582 cm 1 respectively the migration of each characteristic peak before and after adsorption are listed in table 6 this was consistent with the results of xps indicating that the functional groups were involved in the adsorption process compared with ftir of fe2o3 microalgae the characteristic functional groups of microalgae also showed similar offset before and after adsorption indicating that the exclusive functional groups of microalgae still dominated during the adsorption process as for the adsorption effect of the four ions the adsorption ability of fe2o3 microalgae was much higher than that of the microalgae and commercial fe2o3 alone because the synthesis of fe2o3 microalgae retained the adsorption groups of the microalgae compared with some adsorption materials reported the composition of fe2o3 microalgae had a larger specific surface area 156 m2 g which led to the higher adsorption of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii 3 7 2 sem and edx analysis of the fe2o3 microalgae after adsorption the edx map fig 3 demonstrates that after adsorption of the four metal ions by fe2o3 microalgae in addition to the basic constituent elements characteristic peaks of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii also appeared which indicated that the four metal ions were present on the surface of fe2o3 microalgae the ranked order of heavy metal ion content on the adsorbent surface was cr vi pb ii cd ii cu ii which was consistent with the results of kinetic and isothermal models this demonstrated that the adsorbent had a higher adsorption capacity for cr vi and pb ii than cu ii and cd ii 3 7 3 xps analysis of the fe2o3 microalgae after adsorption to further examine the mechanism of adsorption xps analysis of fe2o3 microalgae was undertaken before adsorption the main elements contained in fe2o3 microalgae were carbon 28 55 oxygen 46 45 and iron 23 13 fig 8 a after treatment with different metal ions for 3 h new peaks representing chromium copper lead and cadmium appeared at about 580 ev 935 ev 140 ev and 405 ev respectively indicating that heavy metal ions were adsorbed on the surface of fe2o3 microalgae this was consistent with the results of edx high resolution spectra of the fe 2p region before and after adsorption are presented in fig 8b according to the reported literature the binding energies of 711 1 ev and 725 1 ev represent fe2p 3 2 and fe2p 1 2 respectively and the satellite between the two dominant peaks is contributed by fe2 through the process of oscillation 81 before and after adsorption the fe2p 3 2 peak and the fe2p 1 2 peak were slightly shifted indicating that the iron bound functional group also participated in the adsorption process fig 8c contains the high resolution c1 s spectrum before and after fe2o3 microalgae adsorption of different ions after fe2o3 microalgae adsorbed the different metal ions high resolution spectra c1s exhibited similar variations the c1s spectrum was mainly composed of three peaks cc 284 8 ev co 284 6 ev and coc 288 5 ev the c1s xps spectra exhibited a notable increase in cc groups from 65 75 to 52 36 49 74 57 97 and 42 80 for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii sorption together with a decrease in the c o from 22 74 to 27 27 32 43 25 01 and 34 70 and coc groups from 11 78 to 20 38 17 84 17 02 and 22 50 as compared to the raw fe2o3 microalgae these results demonstrated that the co and coc groups cc co coc were created on the surface of fe2o3 microalgae through the oxidation of hexavalent chromium the o1s spectrum had three peaks at 530 1 ev 531 4 ev and 532 4 ev fig 8d representing metal oxide bonds fe o metal hydrogen bonds feoh and carboxyl groups fecooh respectively 82 after adsorption of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii the contents of metal oxide feo dropped from 46 62 to 38 98 33 08 34 76 and 29 13 respectively feoh decreased after adsorption of all ions except for pb ii in contrast the relative contents of fecooh increased from 10 64 to 33 71 42 35 19 87 and 54 73 after cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii sorption respectively which suggested they participated in the adsorption process the reduced metal oxides and hydroxyl groups may be the result of conversion of more metal oxides and oxyhydroxides on the surface of the microalgae to fecooh during adsorption and which played a major role in the adsorption process the high resolution cr 2p spectrum of fe2o3 microalgae fig 8e exhibited both cr 2p3 2 and cr 2p1 2 peaks that were centered at 577 5 and 587 2 ev respectively consistent with cr iii and cr vi respectively 83 84 this indicated that the reduction of hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium occurred during the adsorption of cr vi by fe2o3 microalgae it was further found that cr iii on the surface of fe2o3 microalgae adsorbent existed in the form of cr oh 3 not cr2o3 because the spectra of cr 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 were not consistent with that of cr2o3 85 86 this demonstrated that the cr vi removal process involved the reduction of cr vi to cr iii during sorption after cu ii pb ii and cd ii adsorption new peaks appeared in the wide scan xps spectra of fe2o3 microalgae fig 8e which corresponded to the spectral peaks of cu ii pb ii and cd ii this demonstrated that cu ii pb ii and cd ii ions were adsorbed on fe2o3 microalgae and the adsorption process did not change the valence states of the three ions 4 conclusion a biomaterial sample with good adsorption properties and the capacity to immobilize microalgae was synthesized and characterized by xrd ftir sem and xps the adsorption capacity of this biomaterial for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii ions was studied the adsorption data were in good agreement with the langmuir isotherm the second order kinetic data showed that the limiting step of the adsorption process was chemical adsorption the analysis by ftir and xps demonstrated that hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups played an important role in adsorption the adsorption of cr vi involved reduction of trivalent cr declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

14178,in recent years the application of algae and metal oxides to treat heavy metal wastewaters has attracted considerable attention however algae are difficult to recover due to their low density which will cause secondary pollution and limit its development in the treatment process in this paper metal oxide fe2o3 as an adsorptive material is used to form a composite material with algae which not only can achieve the purpose of immobilizing microalgae but can also improve the adsorption effect we controlled the synthesis temperature of the fe2o3 to reach a good immobilization effect for microalgae and the adsorption capacity of the composite material fe2o3 microalgae was tested the results showed that the adsorption of fe2o3 microalgae for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii followed the pseudo second order model r 2 0 99 the equilibrium data of fe2o3 microalgae agreed well with the langmuir adsorption isotherm model and the maximum adsorption capacity of fe2o3 microalgae was higher than that of microalgae or commercial fe2o3 alone the adsorption capacity for metal ions can be ranked in the following order cr vi 69 77 mg g pb ii 62 63 mg g cd ii 42 12 mg g cu ii 38 68 mg g functional groups such as oh and cooh on the adsorbent surface were involved in the adsorption process therefore fe2o3 microalgae not only achieved the purpose of immobilizing microalgae but also combined the material with the biosorbent thereby enhancing the adsorption effect the biocomposite is thus has potential as an adsorbent for sewage treatment keywords synechocystis sp pcc6803 fe2o3 immobilization adsorption heavy metal 1 introduction with the intensification of industrialization and urbanization heavy metal pollutions has become a serious problem threatening human and ecosystem health 1 2 of the many heavy metals used industrially cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii are common contaminants in various wastewaters e g dye wastewater electroplating oil refining tanning and mining wastewaters 2 when the cellular content of these toxic metals exceeds a tolerance level it results in poisoning cancer and other diseases 3 4 due to their high toxicity the united states environmental protection agency usepa stipulated that the concentration of cr vi in drinking water should not exceed 0 1 mg l 5 the content of cu ii in industrial wastewater was limited to 1 3 mg l 6 the allowed limit of pb ii in wastewater was 0 05 mg l 7 and the content of cd ii in drinking water was limited to 0 002 mg l 8 10 in addition the food and agriculture organization of the united nations recommended that the maximum concentration of cr vi in irrigated water should be 0 1 mg l 11 the world health organization stipulated that the maximum concentration of pb ii and cd ii in drinking water should not exceed 0 01 mg l 12 14 and 0 003 mg l 15 16 respectively at present many methods and technologies have been used to remove heavy metal ions from wastewater including reverse osmosis chemical precipitation and ion exchange 17 19 however these methods are limited in practical application due to their high operating costs and toxic precipitates 20 in comparison adsorption has become a promising treatment method in recent years 21 22 because of ease of operation environmental friendliness and high adsorption ability 23 25 therefore various adsorbents including carbon nanotubes 26 graphene 27 30 alumina iron oxide and other metal oxides 31 32 have attracted considerable attention and wide application in addition biosorbent microalgae are also potential candidates because there are many functional groups e g hydroxyl and carboxyl groups related to adsorption on the surface of microalgae and both living cells and dead cells have good adsorption capacities 33 34 however because microalgae have low density 35 and are difficult to in separate it has been difficult to implement their use in large scale applications this has led to rapid development of microalgae immobilization technologies 36 several immobilization media including alginates carrageenan and polyacrylamide gel have been examined 37 however there are few reports on immobilizing microalgae by any means that do not affect their adsorption performance in recent years various metal oxides 31 32 especially iron oxides fe2o3 and fe3o4 38 39 have attracted wide attention due to their good selectivity and affinity in the adsorption process van chinh tran prepared low cost fe2o3 rutile nanocomposites from ilmenite for the removal of arsenic from water due to its high specific surface area the adsorption capacity of fe2o3 rutile dioxide composite to arsenic can reach 47 12 mg g 1 40 lie yang studied a approach was employed to load α fe2o3 and α feooh onto sewage sludge biochar sbc with the purpose of efficient nickel ni removal ni ii adsorption capacity of 35 50 mg g 1 in 100 ppm ni ii solution with 10 mg modified sewage sludge biochar msbc was achieved 41 mahboobeh dirbaz et al studied the adsorption effect of different microalgae on cd2 in wastewater among which parachlorella sp had a adsorption capacity of 90 72 mg g 1 that was 1 5 to 3 times that of other adsorbents 42 ricardo saavedra compared the absorption of arsenic boron copper and other toxic elements in single and multi metal solutions of four green microalgae indicating that microalgae biomass was a potential biological adsorbent of toxic elements 43 maria del rosario martinez macias found that the removal rate of cu2 ions from acid mine drainage by nannochloropsis oculata was 99 92 44 the research on microalgae and fe2o3 mainly used bio synthetic magnetic nanomaterials to extract harmful algae from water and convert them into biodiesel in a cheap simple and environmentally friendly process 45 few studies have been conducted on the adsorption of heavy metals by combining the microalgae and fe2o3 compounds a combination of microalgae and iron oxides may bring some advantages 1 more adsorption groups along with microalgae immobilization 46 47 which make microalgae easier to harvest 2 the interaction between microalgae and iron oxide is more beneficial to heavy metal adsorption this is the first attempt to use metal oxides to achieve the immobilization of microalgae to form composite materials with high adsorption properties in this study fe2o3 was synthesized with the inclusion of microalgae synechocystis sp pcc6803 which achieved the purpose of microalgae immobilization because high temperature can carbonize the biological sample so the aim of this study was therefore to investigate the immobilization effect of different synthesis temperatures and the mechanisms of adsorption of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii when using the microalgal fe2o3 immobilized complex fe2o3 microalgae 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of materials five v v of synecdatehocystis sp pcc6803 was inoculated in 250 ml conical flasks with bg 11 medium and cultured under a light intensity of 2000 lx at 35 c ph 7 1 and a 12 12 h light dark cycle 48 during the culture period all flasks were shaken by hand twice every day to avoid agglomeration 49 after 6 days growth the cultures were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min to harvest the cells the washed cells were lyophilized and then ground to a powder in a typical procedure fecl3 0 243 g and synechocystis sp pcc6803 powder 0 05 g were dissolved in 35 ml of distilled water with hexamethylenetetramine 0 421 g after stirring for 30 min the reaction solution was poured into a teflon lined autoclave adjusted to one of three reaction temperatures 70 c 60 c and 50 c for 6 h after 6 h the autoclave cooled naturally to room temperature the precipitate was collected washed with water and ethanol several times by centrifugation and then dried at 70 c for 6 h 2 2 analysis of physical characteristics the products were verified by several techniques x ray diffraction xrd measurements of the as prepared product were collected using a brukerd8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu kα irradiation λ 1 5406 å at room temperature the surface morphology and structure were examined with sem and an energy dispersive spectrometer eds ultra 55 germany was used to analyze the size and morphology of the samples the ftir spectra were recorded in kbr pellets using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in the 400 4000 cm 1 range x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were taken using a phi 5700 esca spectrometer with monochromated al kα radiation hm 1486 6 ev the specific surface area of product was calculated using the multiple point brunauer emmett teller bet method and total pore volume was evaluated from nitrogen uptake at a maximum of relative pressure 2 3 adsorption experiments a series of adsorption experiments were conducted to determine the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii ions fe2o3 microalgae was added to a flask containing a 50 ml solution of heavy metal ions and samples were placed on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm the effects of contact time initial ph 2 0 6 0 adsorption dose 0 1 1 0 g l and ion concentration 10 100 mg l on adsorption capacity were studied respectively the adsorption isotherm model experiment was carried using a range of different metal ion concentrations 10 mg l 500 mg l and samples were extracted from the flask at intervals the inductively coupled plasma spectrometer icp oes was used to determine the ion concentration of each sample all assays were conducted in triplicate and only mean values are presented the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e mg g of the adsorbent for four metal ions was calculated according to eq 1 50 1 q e c 0 c e v m where q e is the equilibrium uptake mg g c 0 is the initial metal ion concentration mg l or ppm c e is the equilibrium metal ion concentration mg l or ppm v is the volume of the solution l and m is the mass of the sorbent g the adsorption kinetic data for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii onto fe2o3 microalgae were simulated with pseudo first order and pseudo second order 51 equations 2 l n q e q t l n q e k 1 t 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where q e is the amount of metal adsorbed at equilibrium mg g q t is the amount of metal ions adsorbed at any sample time mg g 1 k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg min are rate constants of pseudo first and second order adsorption respectively the adsorption isotherms of the four metal ions were determined langmuir 52 and freundlich 53 equations describing sorption isotherms were applied 4 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 5

known as the freundlich coefficient 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd and ftir analysis x ray diffraction xrd was used to characterize the fe2o3 microalgae synthesized under different reaction temperatures fig 1 a a single sharp intense and well recognizable peaks can be observed on these three patterns the diffraction peaks were in good agreement with the recorded values of fe2o3 joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds 73 2234 a mechanism for the formation of fe2o3 is shown in eqs 6 and 7 as reaction temperature declined the intensity of the characteristic peaks decreased fig 1a this demonstrated that the crystallinity of synthesized fe2o3 was affected by the reaction temperature the adsorbent with low crystallinity was more conducive to adsorption 54 consequently the product synthesized at 50 c was selected to further investigate the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of the four metal ions a schematic diagram of fe2o3 microalgae is presented in fig s1 supplementary information 6 c6h12n4 10h2o 4nh3 h2o 6hcho 7 2fecl3 6nh3 h2o fe2o3 6nh4cl 3h2o the fe2o3 microalgae synthesized under different reaction temperatures exhibited essentially identical group compositions fig 1b the major bands can be assigned as follows a characteristic and broad band appeared around 3730 3739 cm 1 the nh stretching vibrations 55 3355 3384 cm 1 oh

1152 cm 1 the saccharide ring 58 1021 1026 cm 1 the band of cn the main difference between the microalgae and the fe2o3 microalgae was that the vibration of iron oxide feo 699 cm 1 was apparent in fe2o3 microalgae compared with the microalgae groups in shen s paper 60 these characteristic peaks were essentially consistent with the microalgae alone except for the slight offset of some peaks indicating that the functional group compositions of fe2o3 microalgae were mainly derived from the microalgae in addition it is also suggested that groups on the surface of microalgae were an important component in the formation of fe2o3 microalgae functional groups table 1 the specific surface area of the fe2o3 microalgae also played an important role in the adsorption process the pore distribution and n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of fe2o3 microalgae are shown in fig 1c the position of the hysteresis loop at the n2 isotherm can be used to determine that the specific surface area was 156 m2 g 1 3 2 xps analysis xps spectra were used to investigate the existence of fe2o3 on the surface of fe2o3 microalgae fig 2 the atomic percentage of fe2o3 microalgae is summarized in table 2 these elements including fe c o and n were confirmed by measuring xps scan from 0 to 1400 ev fig 2a for the microalgae and fe2o3 alone n only appeared in microalgae and fe only in fe2o3 however for the fe2o3 microalgae in addition to these common elements fe and n also appeared which indicated that the synthesized product was a mixture of fe2o3 and microalgae the decrease of the c atom percentage and the appearance of n and fe signals indicated that fe2o3 was successfully coated on the surface of the microalgae 3 3 sem and tem analysis scanning electron micrographs taken before and after fe2o3 microalgae adsorption of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii demonstrate that fe2o3 microalgae was composed of spherical particles with diameters less than 2 μm the hrtem image fig 4 demonstrates the presence of nano sized spherical particles on the surface of fe2o3 microalgae this indicated that the synthesis product was composed of micron sized spherical particles wrapped by nanoscale particles microalgal balls were clustered together so that they were highly immobilized fig 3 this xrd analysis also demonstrated the existence of fe2o3 in composition of compounds the possible mechanisms of formation of fe2o3 is shown in fig s1 in addition energy spectrum analysis also demonstrated that the spherical microalgae were covered with nano sized spherical iron oxide the proportion of carbon 63 56 and iron 17 56 indicated that microalgae were still dominant in fe2o3 microalgae this indicated that fe2o3 was synthesized on the surface of microalgae and the microalgae were immobilized through their interaction with the surface of fe2o3 fe2o3 microalgae there were many reports on the synthesis of fe2o3 materials but few reported the synthesis of fe2o3 on the surface of microalgae this not only synthesized the iron oxide but also achieved the purpose of immobilizing microalgae thereby providing the possibility of immobilizing microalgae with metal oxides 3 4 adsorption experiments 3 4 1 effect of ph the initial ph of the solution is an important parameter affecting adsorption because it not only affects the surface charge distribution of the adsorbent but also determines the existence state of metal ions in the solution and solution properties 63 the change of adsorption capacity of fe2o3 microalgae for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii as a function of initial ph is shown in fig s2 for cr vi adsorption fe2o3 microalgae reached the highest adsorption capacity at about ph 2 0 and decreased significantly with increased ph from 2 0 to 6 0 this can be explained as follows at low ph due to the presence of a large number of h ions the adsorbent surface is positively charged and the dominant species of cr ion in solution is hcro4 64 which can be preferentially adsorbed onto the surface of fe2o3 microalgae by electrostatic adsorption with increased ph the number of protons on the fe2o3 microalgae surface decreased and hcro4 also gradually transforms into cro4 2 the electrostatic repulsion between fe2o3 microalgae and cro4 2 was not conducive to adsorption enhancement 65 resulting in a reduction in the adsorption capacity of fe2o3 microalgae to cr vi fe2o3 microalgae showed a strong ph dependence for cr vi adsorption which indicated that the adsorption of cr vi was mainly surface complexation the adsorption of cu ii pb ii and cd ii increased with increased ph at low ph a large number of h competed with metal ions for adsorption sites 22 fe2o3 microalgae exhibited the highest adsorption capacity at ph 5 0 6 0 but in the range 2 0 ph 4 0 fe2o3 microalgae exhibited the lowest adsorption capacity for cu ii pb ii and cd ii when ph 4 0 fe2o3 microalgae began to gradually lose protons thereby exposing more adsorption sites for metal ion binding which significantly increased the adsorption capacity if the ph continues to rise to 6 0 or higher cu ii pb ii and cd ii will hydrolyze to form precipitates of cu oh 2 pb oh 2 and cd oh 2 therefore adsorption at higher ph is not necessary for further discussion considering the adsorption capacity and the feasibility of the experimental operation in the following experiment the optimal ph was adsorbed by ph 2 0 for cr vi and the ph of the cu ii pb ii and cd ii solutions was set at 5 0 3 4 2 effect of contact time and ion concentration the contact time between adsorbate and sorbent is very important for the study of adsorption kinetics the capacity for adsorption of metal ions with a constant does 0 5 g l constant ph ph 2 0 for cr vi ph 5 0 for cu ii pb ii and cd ii increased with increased duration of contact fig s3 for fe2o3 microalgae pb ii required 1 h to reach adsorption equilibrium while for cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions adsorption increased significantly for 0 30 min of contact and then slowly increased to reach the maximum adsorption capacity and maintain a constant rate this is consistent with the generalized characteristics whereby adsorption is faster at the initial stage of contact but slower when approaching equilibrium 61 this may be because there are many adsorption sites available on the surface of the adsorbent at the initial stage of contact 62 as time progresses the number of unoccupied sites diminishes and the rate of adsorption declines due to the increased repulsion between the adsorbent and the adsorbed ions moreover physical adsorption is the main process in the short contact time and the chemical combination of sorbent and heavy metal takes a long time to reach equilibrium in addition fe2o3 microalgae showed far higher adsorption for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii than for control treatments microalgae and fe2o3 alone the higher adsorption efficiency of fe2o3 microalgae may be attributed to the active groups on the surface of the composites the increase of adsorption rate and capacity showed that fe2o3 microalgae had potential advantages in the removal of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii therefore in further experiments the optimal contact time of fe2o3 microalgae for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii was 30 min 60 min 30 min and 30 min respectively the effects of concentration of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii on fe2o3 microalgae adsorption were studied by changing the initial ion concentration within the range 10 100 mg l and keeping all other experimental conditions unchanged ph 2 0 for cr vi ph 5 0 for cu ii pb ii and cd ii contact time 1 5 h adsorption dose 0 5 g l as the concentrations of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii increased from 10 mg l to 100 mg l the adsorption capacity of fe2o3 microalgae increased from 48 2 mg g to 54 9 mg g 28 1 mg g to 34 4 mg g 47 7 mg g to 52 2 mg g and 32 1 mg g to 38 4 mg g respectively fig s3 but with the further increase of the concentration the adsorption capacity did not change significantly fig 6 which may be due to inadequate active sites in the biosorbent for the diffusion of the increasing amount of ions or their mutual collisions hindered the diffusion at the interface of two phases or competing repulsion among them 66 fe2o3 microalgae exhibited a far higher adsorption capacity for the four ions than that of fe2o3 or microalgae alone 3 4 3 effect of adsorbent dose the amount of fe2o3 mcroalgae at the start of exposure to heavy metals is an important parameter influencing adsorption and determines the adsorption capacity of adsorbent for a given initial concentration of metal ions in solution the effects of varying the amount of fe2o3 microalgae present on cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii adsorption were examined the amount of adsorbent amount ranged between 0 1 1 0 g l and other experimental conditions remained unchanged ph 2 0 for cr vi ph 5 0 for cu ii pb ii and cd ii contact time 1 5 h initial ion concentration 80 mg l fig s4 the removal rates of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii increased with increased amounts of absorbent this may be due to the increase of adsorbent surface area and hence available functional sites in the range 0 1 0 5 g l the rate of removal of fe2o3 microalgae increased from 13 83 to 88 37 for cr vi 8 97 to 78 89 for cu ii 11 83 to 88 89 for pb ii and 10 96 to 88 89 for cd ii the removal rates of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii were not significantly increased when the concentration exceeded 0 5 g l this indicated that the adsorption sites in fe2o3 microalgae became saturated therefore 0 5 g l was selected for follow up experiments table 3 3 5 adsorption kinetics absorption equilibrium was attained after 30 min for all ions other that pb ii which needed at least 1 h fig 5 the correlation coefficients indicated a slightly better fit of pseudo second order equation to the experimental data the calculated values derived from the pseudo second order model qe cal were 62 37 mg g 1 22 28 mg g 1 60 39 mg g 1 and 20 07 mg g 1 for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii respectively this showed good agreement with the experiment data the adsorption results of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii onto fe2o3 microalgae were explained by the pseudo second order equation with correlation coefficients of around 0 99 this implied that the basic adsorption was chemisorption 67 and involved electron sharing between adsorbent and metal ions 68 70 3 6 adsorption isotherms the langmuir model better matched the adsorption data with higher correlation coefficients than the freundlich model fig 6 therefore the langmuir model was better able to explain the adsorption process of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii on fe2o3 microalgae it can be inferred that the adsorption process of metal ions on fe2o3 microalgae was mainly homogeneous and monolayer adsorption with the latter being the main process 71 in addition rl 2 0 9 table 4 also indicated that langmuir adsorption was dominant according to the langmuir model the calculated q m was approximately 69 77 mg g 1 for cr vi 38 68 mg g 1 for cu ii 62 63 mg g 1 for pb ii and 42 12 mg g 1 for cd ii at 303 k the comparison adsorption capacities of various adsorbents to cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii were listed in table 5 it can be seen that fe2o3 microalgae had a good adsorption effect compared with other adsorbents maximum adsorption capacity for heavy metal ions decreased in the order cr vi pb ii cd ii cu ii 3 7 adsorption mechanism 3 7 1 ftir analysis of the materials after adsorption after adsorption of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii the characteristic peaks of functional groups shifted by varying degrees fig 7 for example the characteristic peaks of oh moved from 3355 cm 1 to 3357 cm 1 3332 cm 1 3352 cm 1 and 3582 cm 1 respectively the migration of each characteristic peak before and after adsorption are listed in table 6 this was consistent with the results of xps indicating that the functional groups were involved in the adsorption process compared with ftir of fe2o3 microalgae the characteristic functional groups of microalgae also showed similar offset before and after adsorption indicating that the exclusive functional groups of microalgae still dominated during the adsorption process as for the adsorption effect of the four ions the adsorption ability of fe2o3 microalgae was much higher than that of the microalgae and commercial fe2o3 alone because the synthesis of fe2o3 microalgae retained the adsorption groups of the microalgae compared with some adsorption materials reported the composition of fe2o3 microalgae had a larger specific surface area 156 m2 g which led to the higher adsorption of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii 3 7 2 sem and edx analysis of the fe2o3 microalgae after adsorption the edx map fig 3 demonstrates that after adsorption of the four metal ions by fe2o3 microalgae in addition to the basic constituent elements characteristic peaks of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii also appeared which indicated that the four metal ions were present on the surface of fe2o3 microalgae the ranked order of heavy metal ion content on the adsorbent surface was cr vi pb ii cd ii cu ii which was consistent with the results of kinetic and isothermal models this demonstrated that the adsorbent had a higher adsorption capacity for cr vi and pb ii than cu ii and cd ii 3 7 3 xps analysis of the fe2o3 microalgae after adsorption to further examine the mechanism of adsorption xps analysis of fe2o3 microalgae was undertaken before adsorption the main elements contained in fe2o3 microalgae were carbon 28 55 oxygen 46 45 and iron 23 13 fig 8 a after treatment with different metal ions for 3 h new peaks representing chromium copper lead and cadmium appeared at about 580 ev 935 ev 140 ev and 405 ev respectively indicating that heavy metal ions were adsorbed on the surface of fe2o3 microalgae this was consistent with the results of edx high resolution spectra of the fe 2p region before and after adsorption are presented in fig 8b according to the reported literature the binding energies of 711 1 ev and 725 1 ev represent fe2p 3 2 and fe2p 1 2 respectively and the satellite between the two dominant peaks is contributed by fe2 through the process of oscillation 81 before and after adsorption the fe2p 3 2 peak and the fe2p 1 2 peak were slightly shifted indicating that the iron bound functional group also participated in the adsorption process fig 8c contains the high resolution c1 s spectrum before and after fe2o3 microalgae adsorption of different ions after fe2o3 microalgae adsorbed the different metal ions high resolution spectra c1s exhibited similar variations the c1s spectrum was mainly composed of three peaks cc 284 8 ev co 284 6 ev and coc 288 5 ev the c1s xps spectra exhibited a notable increase in cc groups from 65 75 to 52 36 49 74 57 97 and 42 80 for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii sorption together with a decrease in the c o from 22 74 to 27 27 32 43 25 01 and 34 70 and coc groups from 11 78 to 20 38 17 84 17 02 and 22 50 as compared to the raw fe2o3 microalgae these results demonstrated that the co and coc groups cc co coc were created on the surface of fe2o3 microalgae through the oxidation of hexavalent chromium the o1s spectrum had three peaks at 530 1 ev 531 4 ev and 532 4 ev fig 8d representing metal oxide bonds fe o metal hydrogen bonds feoh and carboxyl groups fecooh respectively 82 after adsorption of cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii the contents of metal oxide feo dropped from 46 62 to 38 98 33 08 34 76 and 29 13 respectively feoh decreased after adsorption of all ions except for pb ii in contrast the relative contents of fecooh increased from 10 64 to 33 71 42 35 19 87 and 54 73 after cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii sorption respectively which suggested they participated in the adsorption process the reduced metal oxides and hydroxyl groups may be the result of conversion of more metal oxides and oxyhydroxides on the surface of the microalgae to fecooh during adsorption and which played a major role in the adsorption process the high resolution cr 2p spectrum of fe2o3 microalgae fig 8e exhibited both cr 2p3 2 and cr 2p1 2 peaks that were centered at 577 5 and 587 2 ev respectively consistent with cr iii and cr vi respectively 83 84 this indicated that the reduction of hexavalent chromium to trivalent chromium occurred during the adsorption of cr vi by fe2o3 microalgae it was further found that cr iii on the surface of fe2o3 microalgae adsorbent existed in the form of cr oh 3 not cr2o3 because the spectra of cr 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 were not consistent with that of cr2o3 85 86 this demonstrated that the cr vi removal process involved the reduction of cr vi to cr iii during sorption after cu ii pb ii and cd ii adsorption new peaks appeared in the wide scan xps spectra of fe2o3 microalgae fig 8e which corresponded to the spectral peaks of cu ii pb ii and cd ii this demonstrated that cu ii pb ii and cd ii ions were adsorbed on fe2o3 microalgae and the adsorption process did not change the valence states of the three ions 4 conclusion a biomaterial sample with good adsorption properties and the capacity to immobilize microalgae was synthesized and characterized by xrd ftir sem and xps the adsorption capacity of this biomaterial for cr vi cu ii pb ii and cd ii ions was studied the adsorption data were in good agreement with the langmuir isotherm the second order kinetic data showed that the limiting step of the adsorption process was chemical adsorption the analysis by ftir and xps demonstrated that hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups played an important role in adsorption the adsorption of cr vi involved reduction of trivalent cr declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

pseudo first order reaction kinetics with appreciable recyclability after five 05 repeated uses the results herein open new prospects for cellulose based functional nanomaterial for various environmental applications keywords cellulose nanowhiskers titania photo catalysis methylene blue water treatment 1 introduction over the past few decades environmental problems have attracted worldwide attention because of the increasing ecological crisis 1 the most common pollution sources are industrial enterprises that produce wastewater having colored materials such as textiles 2 leather 3 and nutrition industries 4 such color bearing organic contaminants are adversely affecting aquatic organisms not only by releasing toxicants into the water but also by reducing photosynthesis through blocking the necessary transmission of sunlight 5 thus the removal of these colorants from the effluent before discharge into surface water is of utmost practical importance 6 various methods have been suggested to handle the dye removal from water such as biodegradation 7 coagulation 8 adsorption 9 advanced oxidation processes aops 10 12 the membrane process and so on 13 16 all these processes have some advantages or disadvantages over the other methods 5 17 20 a balanced approach is therefore needed to look into the worthiness on choosing an appropriate method which can be used to degrade the dye in solution photocatalytic technology 21 22 as an efficient advance oxidation process has been widely researched for applications in the wastewater purification system the oxidation capacity of the photocatalytic process is sufficient to break down resilient pollutants into their corresponding simpler forms 23 25 the photocatalytic processes mainly use semiconductor catalysts such as tio2 fe2o3 zno under light exposure uv light or sunlight to degrade the organic and inorganic contaminants 26 27 among them highly efficient and inexpensive titanium dioxide tio2 is widely used due to their availability non toxic nature and ability to complete mineralization of various organic pollutants 28 29 a number of studies have established the notion that tio2 based photo catalysis is a robust and effective way to degrade colorants in water 30 31 however traditional powder photo catalysts usually need to be dispersed into wastewater where they form suspensions to improve the reaction contact area 32 nevertheless from a practical point of view the process would eventually result in the release of particles to the water media being treated the additional separation step to remove the catalysts from the wastewater is inevitable 33 the use of catalysts as a slurry after the reaction has created the problems of leaching and how to separate them from the system which usually requires a long settlement time or centrifugation and any residual toxic photo catalyst such as sludge might cause secondary pollution 34 35 hence many researchers have suggested that this problem can be circumvented by supporting the catalyst on a suitable substrate until now several textile and non textile materials have been used to integrate tio2 on a support material through various methods such as sol gel 36 sputtering 37 electrospinning 17 plasma or chemical vapor deposition and so on 38 the sol gel method allows the formation of nanostructured tio2 materials with controlled porosity and shape as either powders or films 39 this process provides excellent chemical homogeneity and the possibility of deriving unique metastable structures at low reaction temperatures 40 however in all methods the intricate operations involved in depositing catalysts on a substrate the expensive equipment needed high energy consumption and environmental issues pose significant obstacles to their large scale production and commercialization on the other hand the direct mixing of the catalyst with a polymer significantly reduces the photocatalytic activity due to the decrease in available reaction area 41 therefore developing a convenient pathway for the synthesis of recyclable photo catalysts remains a great challenge the ideal template supposed to be a biodegradable inexpensive as well as comprehends a simple preparation process native cellulose nanowhiskers are easily available cheap and highly crystalline nanomaterial with a combination of natural and renewable origins and with extraordinary surface area and good mechanical properties 42 exceptional characteristics easy preparation and renewability of its precursor made it an ideal green material for sustainable applications o l galkina et al 2014 reported the sol gel synthesis of cotton tio2 composites and their antibacterial and potential drug delivery applications 43 to our best knowledge the photocatalytic performance of titania loaded cellulose based hybrid nanomaterial towards environmental remediation is yet to be explored in the present work we report a simple approach for dispersion of titania on cellulose nanowhiskers using titanium tetra isopropoxide as the precursor and sulphuric acid as a peptizing agent via low temperature sol gel synthesis method which serves as recyclable photocatalyst the physicochemical properties of the resultant catalyst were studied through fesem tem xrd eds and ftir analysis the photocatalytic performance of the catalyst in hetero photo catalytic degradation of methylene blue dye in aqueous solution was also investigated results provide a foundation for a resource efficient and eco friendly approach for an efficient cellulose based reactor for the removal of pollutants in various environment 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and materials analytical grade tetrabutyl titanate ti oc4h9 4 tbt sulphuric acid h2so4 sodium hydroxide naoh absolute ethanol et oh and methylene blue was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd the chemicals had used as received and have not considered for any further refining process the cotton powder was obtained from hubei chemical fiber co ltd xiangfan hubei china deionized water obtained from a water purification system provided by chengdu ultra technology co ltd was used in all experiments 2 2 preparation of titania loaded cellulose based functional nanomaterial titania loaded cellulose based functional nanomaterial was prepared by multiple steps as discussed below a in the first step cellulose nanowhiskers cn were synthesized by hydrolyzing cotton powder as per the method described by habibi et al 2010 and rahman et al 2014 44 45 typically 5 g cotton powder was dispersed in 40 w w sulfuric acid solution 100 ml under vigorous stirring at 45 c for 2 h the prepared suspension was centrifuge 6000 rpm for three times tailed by watering down with distilled water and set in an ultrasonic benchtop bath for 2 h at constant sonic power 100 w after ultrasonication the suspension was centrifuged again and freeze dried 48 h to obtain cn powder b in the second step freshly synthesized cn powders were used as a template during titania synthesis via the sol gel method for that 0 5 mg cn was dispersed in titania precursor solution s1 3 0 ml tbt 30 ml et oh under vigorous stirring for 30 min in an ultrasonic benchtop bath for a uniform complex between cn and titania precursor a separate solution s2 containing 60 ml of water and 10 ml of et oh was prepared sulphuric acid was used to maintain the ph of the synthesis as well as a peptizing agent s2 was added slowly on the s1 under vigorous stirring to obtain a suspension of titania hydrosol c the as prepared suspension was stirred at 65 c in order to obtain the gel the gel formation indicates the formation of titania which has simultaneously loaded on the surface of cn the resulting gel was fridge dried for 48 h to obtain the solid hybrid nanomaterial cn ntio2 photo catalyst and stored in ambient condition before characterization and photocatalytic degradation application 2 3 material characterizations the structural and morphological properties of titania loaded cellulose based functional nanomaterial was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem zeiss evo 15 electron microscope prior to fesem the sample was sprayed with a conducting resin followed by a sputter coating of the gold layer the elemental composition of the material was identified via horiba emax x ray detector energy dispersive spectroscopy eds mounted with the fesem device moreover tem philips em was used to describe the outline and dimension of the core shell x ray diffraction xrd pattern was obtained using stoe stadi p transmission x ray powder diffractometer with a monochromatized cu ka k 1 54051 a radiation over a perceiving refraction angle from 10 to 70 2θ to identify the quantitative molecular bonding and arrangement of resultant hybrid nanomaterial fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir chemical analysis was carried out by using a series 100 thermo nicolet ftir nicolet usa spectrophotometer 2 4 chemical oxygen demand cod analysis chemical oxygen demand analysis was carried out using cod vials provided by chemetrics inc the usa following astm d 1252 06 chemical oxygen demand dichromate oxygen demand of water test method b 46 typically cod measures the oxidizable organic matter content of a wastewater sample the samples reacted with an acidic solution of potassium dichromate in the presence of a catalyst silver and digested for 2 h at a temperature of 150 c oxidizable organic compounds reduce the dichromate ion cr2o7 2 to the chromic ion cr3 in the cod kits the decrease in dichromate ion was measured colorimetrically at 620 nm in the cod kits the amount of chromic ion produced is measured the test results are expressed as the number of milligrams of oxygen consumed per liter of the sample mg liter cod using the following eq 1 1 cod mg l 23010 abs 3 here abs absorption of the solution was taken in 620 nm after digested for 2 h at a temperature of 150 2 c 2 5 photocatalytic degradation of toxic aromatic methylene blue dye to study the photocatalytic performance of cn ntio2 the hetero photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye was investigated under mercury uvc lamps λ 254 nm in a typical reaction methylene blue aqueous solution 40 ml 50 ppm was prepared and placed under the uv lamp 5 mg of cn ntio2 catalyst was added to the solution in order to trigger the photo catalysis the instant to initial absorbance ratio of methylene blue solution at a0 was measured at different time intervals using uv vis spectrophotometric analysis shimadzu uv 1650 pc spectrophotometer changes in at a0 allowed assessing the progress in conversion the conversion percentage was calculated according to the concentration at predetermined time intervals by using eq 2 12 2 c o n v e r s i o n c 0 c t c 0 100 here c0 concentration of pollutants at 0 min and ct concentration of pollutants at different time intervals in water treatment processes recyclability and reusability of catalyst are one of the most essential characteristics for sustainable industrial applications in this regard cn ntio2 photo catalyst was analyzed for potential reusability for that after the degradation of methylene blue in initial cycles the cn ntio2 was recycled by simple filtration followed by washed and dried at 50 c before another cycle degradation analysis the catalysts were tested for several cycles to evaluate their potential reusability in the same photocatalytic system 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of cn ntio2 3 1 1 fesem and tem analysis surface morphology and size distribution analysis of cn ntio2 was analyzed by using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and transmission electron microscopy tem as shown in fig 1 from a comparative and contrast perspective pristine cn was investigated as well a quick synopsis on sem pictures reveals the morphological changes between cn and cn ntio2 the flock shape particles as presented in fig 1a is cellulose nanowhiskers on the other hand the spherical particle as shown in fig 1c indicates the formation of cn ntio2 size distribution analysis of ntio2 particles using fesem shown that particle sizes varying from 10 nm to 20 nm were present on the surface of cn however tem analysis fig 1d clearly confirms the existence of a core shell like structure where a thin layer approximately 10 nm ntio2 is evenly distributed over the cn flocks in order to confirm the presence of ntio2 more precisely elemental analysis eds was carried out which also provides further quantitative information 3 1 2 elemental eds analysis the elemental study of cn and cn ntio2 was examined by using energy dispensing spectroscopy eds as shown in fig 2 the characteristics eds peak around 0 278 kev and 0 550 kev correspond to carbon and oxygen from cellulose respectively as appeared in both cn and cn ntio2 the presence of na and s in cn see fig 2b may come from the usage of sulphuric acid during cn synthesis and further neutralization using naoh however two more apparent characteristics peaks at 0 3 kev and 4 5 kev assigned to titanium atom ti 47 48 were recorded see fig 2d confirms the presence of ntio2 which also further indicates successful synthesis of cn ntio2 atomic ratio analysis obtained from eds spectra demonstrates the quantitative significance of ti particles there is no presence of ti atoms were recorded in pristine cn samples cellulose nanowhiskers mostly contain oxygen and carbon atoms and their o c atom ratio is 0 72 however the atomic ratio analysis of the cn ntio2 catalyst showed a distinct atom distribution with the remarkable existence of ti atoms ti c and ti o atom ratio were calculated and estimated at about 0 11 and 1 54 respectively the weight percentage analysis of cn ntio2 showed that about 23 50 see fig 2d of ti atoms were present in the cn ntio2 that makes it an ideal photocatalyst 3 1 3 x ray diffraction xrd analysis crystalline cellulose nanowhiskers and cn ntio2 were examined by x ray diffraction analysis as shown in fig 3 the characteristic diffraction peak at 2θ 22 503 in both cn and cn ntio2 corresponds to cellulose i 49 52 the small peak at 14 539 has appeared in cn see fig 3a represents cellulose ii 52 however the peak of cellulose ii is absent in cn ntio2 may come from the applied treatments during the synthesis of core shell the crystal size of cellulose was measured 28 nm in cn apart from the diffraction peak of cellulose i no other peak has appeared which validates synthesis of pure crystal cellulose on the other hand various peaks have been seen in cn ntio2 diffractometric analysis see fig 3b among them the diffraction peak of the rutile structure of crystal tio2 appeared at 2θ 31 25 121 whereas peaks at 2θ 25 23 101 37 98 004 48 04 200 54 74 105 and 63 35 204 corresponds to anatase structure of crystal ntio2 47 53 55 along with fesem tem analysis and the presence of crystalline cellulose i fenced by titanium dioxide nanocrystals in xrd analysis of cn ntio2 undoubtedly validates the synthesis and formation of metal organic functional core shell like catalyst where cellulose nanowhisker is an effective green carrier 3 1 4 ftir chemical analysis the quantitative molecular bonds and chemical influences between cotton cn and resultant cn ntio2 were studied by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir see fig 4 the broad peak around 3450 cm 1 was attributed to the oh stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups which was observed in all three samples 51 shifting of oh stretching peaks to the lower wavelengths in cn ntio2 suggested that strong interactions had been made between oh groups of cellulose and ti o bonds of tio2 peaks around 2900 cm 1 attributed to stretching of ethylene ch2 groups in long alkyl chains 56 found in pristine cotton and cn but sterically hindered in cn ntio2 apparently because of the thin layer of ntio2 that blocks ch in plane stretching 57 the band cantered on 1646 77 cm 1 corresponds to the oh bending vibration of the cellulose that moved somewhat downfield because of the ti o c vibration 1642 cm 1 1373 cm 1 which specifies the contact that takes place at the edge of cn and ntio2 55 57 ch2 asymmetric bending vibration at 1430 cm 1 ch bending vibration at 1372 cm 1 ch2 wagging vibration at 1317 cm 1 co anti symmetric stretching at 1113 cm 1 co stretching vibration and coc stretching vibration at 1060 cm 1 were observed in cotton and cn 58 however these peaks disappeared or hindered in cn ntio2 which indicated that cellulose molecular structure may have been destroyed the structure of cellulose microfibres degraded through breaking the co and some of the cc bonds in the sol gel process following the addition of tio2 acidic sol which contained h2so4 and further heat treatment 57 3 2 photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye 3 2 1 decoloration of methylene blue to investigate the potential application of cn ntio2 as a promising photo catalyst hetero photo catalytic degradation of methylene blue dye in aqueous solution was studied by using the conditions described in section 2 5 the uv vis spectroscopic analysis was used to study the real time decoloration of methylene blue see fig 5 methylene blue is a common organic dye containing aromatic ring that is resistant to conventional water treatment systems therefore we have studied it in our system the uv vis spectroscopic analysis shows that methylene blue started to degrade immediately upon reaction was triggered by the addition of an as prepared catalyst cn ntio2 under uv light the characteristic absorption peak of methylene blue at 660 nm significantly decreased within 40 min see fig 5c however no visible color removal was observed in control experiments performed using cn see fig 5a however a slight absorption of dyes has been noticed due to the characteristic heterogeneity of cellulose towards cationic thiazine dye see fig 5a on the other hand ntio2 alone showed the fastest degradation of the dye as consistent with the previous literature 59 61 see fig 5b however despite the excellent degradation property the catalysts remain in the treated water proved by high tds and cod analysis in the following section which requires costly and time consuming secondary treatment principally ntio2 absorbs the light to create a void region which extends from the top of the filled valence band to the bottom of the vacant conduction band create electron hole pairs which subsequently generate free radicals e g hydroxyl radicals oh these hydroxyl radicals are very oxidative in nature and non selective with redox potential 62 the degradation was occurred due to the oxidation of methyl group through oh that followed to complete decoloration of dyes and possible degradation into h2o co2 and other nontoxic elements 3 2 2 kinetics of the decoloration decoloration kinetics is a vital feature that represents the efficiency of bulk applications 63 it is of great interest that cn ntio2 catalyst confirmed complete decoloration of methylene blue as shown in fig 6 a the rate of decoloration and possible degradation reaction follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics where the rate of reaction depends only on the isolated reactant since a difference in concentration of the reactant in excess will not affect the reaction confirmed through previous reports on photo catalysis 17 64 66 the instant initial absorbance ratio of the methylene blue band at 660 nm at a0 which accounts for the corresponding concentration ratio ct c0 allows plotting ln ct c0 as a function of time fig 6b according to eq 3 3 l n c t c 0 l n a t a 0 k t model validation of the pseudo first order kinetics for photocatalytic removal of methylene blue with the catalyst is obtained by the linear evolution in time of ln c c0 more particularly for prepared functional nanomaterial cn ntio2 as supported by r2 values beyond 0 98 plots summarized in table 1 shows that all cn ntio2 catalysts exhibited good linear relationships of ln ct c0 versus reaction time following pseudo first order kinetics with respect to methylene blue decoloration possibly degradation interestingly prepared functional nanomaterial photo catalyst showed a compatible photocatalytic activity among many works of literature under similar conditions 3 3 degradation analysis the effluent treatment process involves controlling several parameters such as ph color chemical oxygen demand cod and total dissolved solids tds analysis etc pollutant concentration has an interesting effect on these parameters especially in the case of dyes decoloration by affecting the chromophore group may not be the ultimate solution for degradation several secondary elements produced by the treatment may cause invisible toxicity considering these aspects photocatalytic decoloration of methylene blue dye has been studied through toxicity studies as summarized in table 2 all the experimental studies were carried out at room temperature thus temperature analysis was avoided however visual color analysis of untreated methylene blue dye solution shows a characteristic dark blue solution which turns into clear water with a bit whitish tone while treated with free ntio2 the whitish effect can be due to the presence of free titanium oxides which has been further validated by an increase in tds value 442 ppm of treated water since tds analysis signifies the presence of solid particles in the aqueous solution the amount of tds in treated water indicates the level of oxide formation a robust 66 decrease in tds has been observed for core shell novel catalyst compare to free catalyst the claim has been further investigated by cod analysis it has been found that see table 2 68 64 reduction of cod was achieved by cn ntio2 photocatalyst which indicates mineralization of pollutants into nontoxic substances as corresponds to the tds and cod analysis the designed photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue found to have very effective in decoloration as well as degradation of toxicant of the substance 3 4 reusability of functional nanomaterial one of the great importance of resultant catalysts is the possibility to be recovered and reused in consecutive degradation cycles in the present work we studied the reusability of cn ntio2 functional nanomaterial on the hetero photo catalytic degradation of methylene blue as reported in fig 7 after each cycle the catalyst was recovered by simple filtration and prepared for the next cycle the results indicating that prepared photo catalyst can be recycled and reused more than five 05 times providing high up to 80 conversion efficiency this can be explained by the key role of metal organic electrostatic attraction which could serve as an effective shield for superior grafting and prevent leaching results in a good durability the present catalyst exhibited excellent repetitive use performance which was of great interest as compared with recently reported catalyst systems in the literature for example zno tio2 au ceo2 tio2 rgo tio2 bn tio2 tio2 cnc and many other materials 67 71 however there is a gradual decrease in removal efficiency of the recycled catalysts has also been noticed which can be due to the loss of the material during filtration and or leaching of ntio2 from the carrier 3 5 the postulated mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue the detailed mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye using cn ntio2 has been postulated in scheme 1 a number of reactive species such as h oh and o2 are responsible for photo induced degradation of methylene blue 29 into nontoxic substances 72 in this system ntio2 played a role in the generation of oh under uv light to produce reactive species pedestals of produced reactive species likely to react with the methylene blue

environmental applications keywords cellulose nanowhiskers titania photo catalysis methylene blue water treatment 1 introduction over the past few decades environmental problems have attracted worldwide attention because of the increasing ecological crisis 1 the most common pollution sources are industrial enterprises that produce wastewater having colored materials such as textiles 2 leather 3 and nutrition industries 4 such color bearing organic contaminants are adversely affecting aquatic organisms not only by releasing toxicants into the water but also by reducing photosynthesis through blocking the necessary transmission of sunlight 5 thus the removal of these colorants from the effluent before discharge into surface water is of utmost practical importance 6 various methods have been suggested to handle the dye removal from water such as biodegradation 7 coagulation 8 adsorption 9 advanced oxidation processes aops 10 12 the membrane process and so on 13 16 all these processes have some advantages or disadvantages over the other methods 5 17 20 a balanced approach is therefore needed to look into the worthiness on choosing an appropriate method which can be used to degrade the dye in solution photocatalytic technology 21 22 as an efficient advance oxidation process has been widely researched for applications in the wastewater purification system the oxidation capacity of the photocatalytic process is sufficient to break down resilient pollutants into their corresponding simpler forms 23 25 the photocatalytic processes mainly use semiconductor catalysts such as tio2 fe2o3 zno under light exposure uv light or sunlight to degrade the organic and inorganic contaminants 26 27 among them highly efficient and inexpensive titanium dioxide tio2 is widely used due to their availability non toxic nature and ability to complete mineralization of various organic pollutants 28 29 a number of studies have established the notion that tio2 based photo catalysis is a robust and effective way to degrade colorants in water 30 31 however traditional powder photo catalysts usually need to be dispersed into wastewater where they form suspensions to improve the reaction contact area 32 nevertheless from a practical point of view the process would eventually result in the release of particles to the water media being treated the additional separation step to remove the catalysts from the wastewater is inevitable 33 the use of catalysts as a slurry after the reaction has created the problems of leaching and how to separate them from the system which usually requires a long settlement time or centrifugation and any residual toxic photo catalyst such as sludge might cause secondary pollution 34 35 hence many researchers have suggested that this problem can be circumvented by supporting the catalyst on a suitable substrate until now several textile and non textile materials have been used to integrate tio2 on a support material through various methods such as sol gel 36 sputtering 37 electrospinning 17 plasma or chemical vapor deposition and so on 38 the sol gel method allows the formation of nanostructured tio2 materials with controlled porosity and shape as either powders or films 39 this process provides excellent chemical homogeneity and the possibility of deriving unique metastable structures at low reaction temperatures 40 however in all methods the intricate operations involved in depositing catalysts on a substrate the expensive equipment needed high energy consumption and environmental issues pose significant obstacles to their large scale production and commercialization on the other hand the direct mixing of the catalyst with a polymer significantly reduces the photocatalytic activity due to the decrease in available reaction area 41 therefore developing a convenient pathway for the synthesis of recyclable photo catalysts remains a great challenge the ideal template supposed to be a biodegradable inexpensive as well as comprehends a simple preparation process native cellulose nanowhiskers are easily available cheap and highly crystalline nanomaterial with a combination of natural and renewable origins and with extraordinary surface area and good mechanical properties 42 exceptional characteristics easy preparation and renewability of its precursor made it an ideal green material for sustainable applications o l galkina et al 2014 reported the sol gel synthesis of cotton tio2 composites and their antibacterial and potential drug delivery applications 43 to our best knowledge the photocatalytic performance of titania loaded cellulose based hybrid nanomaterial towards environmental remediation is yet to be explored in the present work we report a simple approach for dispersion of titania on cellulose nanowhiskers using titanium tetra isopropoxide as the precursor and sulphuric acid as a peptizing agent via low temperature sol gel synthesis method which serves as recyclable photocatalyst the physicochemical properties of the resultant catalyst were studied through fesem tem xrd eds and ftir analysis the photocatalytic performance of the catalyst in hetero photo catalytic degradation of methylene blue dye in aqueous solution was also investigated results provide a foundation for a resource efficient and eco friendly approach for an efficient cellulose based reactor for the removal of pollutants in various environment 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and materials analytical grade tetrabutyl titanate ti oc4h9 4 tbt sulphuric acid h2so4 sodium hydroxide naoh absolute ethanol et oh and methylene blue was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd the chemicals had used as received and have not considered for any further refining process the cotton powder was obtained from hubei chemical fiber co ltd xiangfan hubei china deionized water obtained from a water purification system provided by chengdu ultra technology co ltd was used in all experiments 2 2 preparation of titania loaded cellulose based functional nanomaterial titania loaded cellulose based functional nanomaterial was prepared by multiple steps as discussed below a in the first step cellulose nanowhiskers cn were synthesized by hydrolyzing cotton powder as per the method described by habibi et al 2010 and rahman et al 2014 44 45 typically 5 g cotton powder was dispersed in 40 w w sulfuric acid solution 100 ml under vigorous stirring at 45 c for 2 h the prepared suspension was centrifuge 6000 rpm for three times tailed by watering down with distilled water and set in an ultrasonic benchtop bath for 2 h at constant sonic power 100 w after ultrasonication the suspension was centrifuged again and freeze dried 48 h to obtain cn powder b in the second step freshly synthesized cn powders were used as a template during titania synthesis via the sol gel method for that 0 5 mg cn was dispersed in titania precursor solution s1 3 0 ml tbt 30 ml et oh under vigorous stirring for 30 min in an ultrasonic benchtop bath for a uniform complex between cn and titania precursor a separate solution s2 containing 60 ml of water and 10 ml of et oh was prepared sulphuric acid was used to maintain the ph of the synthesis as well as a peptizing agent s2 was added slowly on the s1 under vigorous stirring to obtain a suspension of titania hydrosol c the as prepared suspension was stirred at 65 c in order to obtain the gel the gel formation indicates the formation of titania which has simultaneously loaded on the surface of cn the resulting gel was fridge dried for 48 h to obtain the solid hybrid nanomaterial cn ntio2 photo catalyst and stored in ambient condition before characterization and photocatalytic degradation application 2 3 material characterizations the structural and morphological properties of titania loaded cellulose based functional nanomaterial was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem zeiss evo 15 electron microscope prior to fesem the sample was sprayed with a conducting resin followed by a sputter coating of the gold layer the elemental composition of the material was identified via horiba emax x ray detector energy dispersive spectroscopy eds mounted with the fesem device moreover tem philips em was used to describe the outline and dimension of the core shell x ray diffraction xrd pattern was obtained using stoe stadi p transmission x ray powder diffractometer with a monochromatized cu ka k 1 54051 a radiation over a perceiving refraction angle from 10 to 70 2θ to identify the quantitative molecular bonding and arrangement of resultant hybrid nanomaterial fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir chemical analysis was carried out by using a series 100 thermo nicolet ftir nicolet usa spectrophotometer 2 4 chemical oxygen demand cod analysis chemical oxygen demand analysis was carried out using cod vials provided by chemetrics inc the usa following astm d 1252 06 chemical oxygen demand dichromate oxygen demand of water test method b 46 typically cod measures the oxidizable organic matter content of a wastewater sample the samples reacted with an acidic solution of potassium dichromate in the presence of a catalyst silver and digested for 2 h at a temperature of 150 c oxidizable organic compounds reduce the dichromate ion cr2o7 2 to the chromic ion cr3 in the cod kits the decrease in dichromate ion was measured colorimetrically at 620 nm in the cod kits the amount of chromic ion produced is measured the test results are expressed as the number of milligrams of oxygen consumed per liter of the sample mg liter cod using the following eq 1 1 cod mg l 23010 abs 3 here abs absorption of the solution was taken in 620 nm after digested for 2 h at a temperature of 150 2 c 2 5 photocatalytic degradation of toxic aromatic methylene blue dye to study the photocatalytic performance of cn ntio2 the hetero photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye was investigated under mercury uvc lamps λ 254 nm in a typical reaction methylene blue aqueous solution 40 ml 50 ppm was prepared and placed under the uv lamp 5 mg of cn ntio2 catalyst was added to the solution in order to trigger the photo catalysis the instant to initial absorbance ratio of methylene blue solution at a0 was measured at different time intervals using uv vis spectrophotometric analysis shimadzu uv 1650 pc spectrophotometer changes in at a0 allowed assessing the progress in conversion the conversion percentage was calculated according to the concentration at predetermined time intervals by using eq 2 12 2 c o n v e r s i o n c 0 c t c 0 100 here c0 concentration of pollutants at 0 min and ct concentration of pollutants at different time intervals in water treatment processes recyclability and reusability of catalyst are one of the most essential characteristics for sustainable industrial applications in this regard cn ntio2 photo catalyst was analyzed for potential reusability for that after the degradation of methylene blue in initial cycles the cn ntio2 was recycled by simple filtration followed by washed and dried at 50 c before another cycle degradation analysis the catalysts were tested for several cycles to evaluate their potential reusability in the same photocatalytic system 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of cn ntio2 3 1 1 fesem and tem analysis surface morphology and size distribution analysis of cn ntio2 was analyzed by using field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and transmission electron microscopy tem as shown in fig 1 from a comparative and contrast perspective pristine cn was investigated as well a quick synopsis on sem pictures reveals the morphological changes between cn and cn ntio2 the flock shape particles as presented in fig 1a is cellulose nanowhiskers on the other hand the spherical particle as shown in fig 1c indicates the formation of cn ntio2 size distribution analysis of ntio2 particles using fesem shown that particle sizes varying from 10 nm to 20 nm were present on the surface of cn however tem analysis fig 1d clearly confirms the existence of a core shell like structure where a thin layer approximately 10 nm ntio2 is evenly distributed over the cn flocks in order to confirm the presence of ntio2 more precisely elemental analysis eds was carried out which also provides further quantitative information 3 1 2 elemental eds analysis the elemental study of cn and cn ntio2 was examined by using energy dispensing spectroscopy eds as shown in fig 2 the characteristics eds peak around 0 278 kev and 0 550 kev correspond to carbon and oxygen from cellulose respectively as appeared in both cn and cn ntio2 the presence of na and s in cn see fig 2b may come from the usage of sulphuric acid during cn synthesis and further neutralization using naoh however two more apparent characteristics peaks at 0 3 kev and 4 5 kev assigned to titanium atom ti 47 48 were recorded see fig 2d confirms the presence of ntio2 which also further indicates successful synthesis of cn ntio2 atomic ratio analysis obtained from eds spectra demonstrates the quantitative significance of ti particles there is no presence of ti atoms were recorded in pristine cn samples cellulose nanowhiskers mostly contain oxygen and carbon atoms and their o c atom ratio is 0 72 however the atomic ratio analysis of the cn ntio2 catalyst showed a distinct atom distribution with the remarkable existence of ti atoms ti c and ti o atom ratio were calculated and estimated at about 0 11 and 1 54 respectively the weight percentage analysis of cn ntio2 showed that about 23 50 see fig 2d of ti atoms were present in the cn ntio2 that makes it an ideal photocatalyst 3 1 3 x ray diffraction xrd analysis crystalline cellulose nanowhiskers and cn ntio2 were examined by x ray diffraction analysis as shown in fig 3 the characteristic diffraction peak at 2θ 22 503 in both cn and cn ntio2 corresponds to cellulose i 49 52 the small peak at 14 539 has appeared in cn see fig 3a represents cellulose ii 52 however the peak of cellulose ii is absent in cn ntio2 may come from the applied treatments during the synthesis of core shell the crystal size of cellulose was measured 28 nm in cn apart from the diffraction peak of cellulose i no other peak has appeared which validates synthesis of pure crystal cellulose on the other hand various peaks have been seen in cn ntio2 diffractometric analysis see fig 3b among them the diffraction peak of the rutile structure of crystal tio2 appeared at 2θ 31 25 121 whereas peaks at 2θ 25 23 101 37 98 004 48 04 200 54 74 105 and 63 35 204 corresponds to anatase structure of crystal ntio2 47 53 55 along with fesem tem analysis and the presence of crystalline cellulose i fenced by titanium dioxide nanocrystals in xrd analysis of cn ntio2 undoubtedly validates the synthesis and formation of metal organic functional core shell like catalyst where cellulose nanowhisker is an effective green carrier 3 1 4 ftir chemical analysis the quantitative molecular bonds and chemical influences between cotton cn and resultant cn ntio2 were studied by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir see fig 4 the broad peak around 3450 cm 1 was attributed to the oh stretching vibrations of hydroxyl groups which was observed in all three samples 51 shifting of oh stretching peaks to the lower wavelengths in cn ntio2 suggested that strong interactions had been made between oh groups of cellulose and ti o bonds of tio2 peaks around 2900 cm 1 attributed to stretching of ethylene ch2 groups in long alkyl chains 56 found in pristine cotton and cn but sterically hindered in cn ntio2 apparently because of the thin layer of ntio2 that blocks ch in plane stretching 57 the band cantered on 1646 77 cm 1 corresponds to the oh bending vibration of the cellulose that moved somewhat downfield because of the ti o c vibration 1642 cm 1 1373 cm 1 which specifies the contact that takes place at the edge of cn and ntio2 55 57 ch2 asymmetric bending vibration at 1430 cm 1 ch bending vibration at 1372 cm 1 ch2 wagging vibration at 1317 cm 1 co anti symmetric stretching at 1113 cm 1 co stretching vibration and coc stretching vibration at 1060 cm 1 were observed in cotton and cn 58 however these peaks disappeared or hindered in cn ntio2 which indicated that cellulose molecular structure may have been destroyed the structure of cellulose microfibres degraded through breaking the co and some of the cc bonds in the sol gel process following the addition of tio2 acidic sol which contained h2so4 and further heat treatment 57 3 2 photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye 3 2 1 decoloration of methylene blue to investigate the potential application of cn ntio2 as a promising photo catalyst hetero photo catalytic degradation of methylene blue dye in aqueous solution was studied by using the conditions described in section 2 5 the uv vis spectroscopic analysis was used to study the real time decoloration of methylene blue see fig 5 methylene blue is a common organic dye containing aromatic ring that is resistant to conventional water treatment systems therefore we have studied it in our system the uv vis spectroscopic analysis shows that methylene blue started to degrade immediately upon reaction was triggered by the addition of an as prepared catalyst cn ntio2 under uv light the characteristic absorption peak of methylene blue at 660 nm significantly decreased within 40 min see fig 5c however no visible color removal was observed in control experiments performed using cn see fig 5a however a slight absorption of dyes has been noticed due to the characteristic heterogeneity of cellulose towards cationic thiazine dye see fig 5a on the other hand ntio2 alone showed the fastest degradation of the dye as consistent with the previous literature 59 61 see fig 5b however despite the excellent degradation property the catalysts remain in the treated water proved by high tds and cod analysis in the following section which requires costly and time consuming secondary treatment principally ntio2 absorbs the light to create a void region which extends from the top of the filled valence band to the bottom of the vacant conduction band create electron hole pairs which subsequently generate free radicals e g hydroxyl radicals oh these hydroxyl radicals are very oxidative in nature and non selective with redox potential 62 the degradation was occurred due to the oxidation of methyl group through oh that followed to complete decoloration of dyes and possible degradation into h2o co2 and other nontoxic elements 3 2 2 kinetics of the decoloration decoloration kinetics is a vital feature that represents the efficiency of bulk applications 63 it is of great interest that cn ntio2 catalyst confirmed complete decoloration of methylene blue as shown in fig 6 a the rate of decoloration and possible degradation reaction follows pseudo first order reaction kinetics where the rate of reaction depends only on the isolated reactant since a difference in concentration of the reactant in excess will not affect the reaction confirmed through previous reports on photo catalysis 17 64 66 the instant initial absorbance ratio of the methylene blue band at 660 nm at a0 which accounts for the corresponding concentration ratio ct c0 allows plotting ln ct c0 as a function of time fig 6b according to eq 3 3 l n c t c 0 l n a t a 0 k t model validation of the pseudo first order kinetics for photocatalytic removal of methylene blue with the catalyst is obtained by the linear evolution in time of ln c c0 more particularly for prepared functional nanomaterial cn ntio2 as supported by r2 values beyond 0 98 plots summarized in table 1 shows that all cn ntio2 catalysts exhibited good linear relationships of ln ct c0 versus reaction time following pseudo first order kinetics with respect to methylene blue decoloration possibly degradation interestingly prepared functional nanomaterial photo catalyst showed a compatible photocatalytic activity among many works of literature under similar conditions 3 3 degradation analysis the effluent treatment process involves controlling several parameters such as ph color chemical oxygen demand cod and total dissolved solids tds analysis etc pollutant concentration has an interesting effect on these parameters especially in the case of dyes decoloration by affecting the chromophore group may not be the ultimate solution for degradation several secondary elements produced by the treatment may cause invisible toxicity considering these aspects photocatalytic decoloration of methylene blue dye has been studied through toxicity studies as summarized in table 2 all the experimental studies were carried out at room temperature thus temperature analysis was avoided however visual color analysis of untreated methylene blue dye solution shows a characteristic dark blue solution which turns into clear water with a bit whitish tone while treated with free ntio2 the whitish effect can be due to the presence of free titanium oxides which has been further validated by an increase in tds value 442 ppm of treated water since tds analysis signifies the presence of solid particles in the aqueous solution the amount of tds in treated water indicates the level of oxide formation a robust 66 decrease in tds has been observed for core shell novel catalyst compare to free catalyst the claim has been further investigated by cod analysis it has been found that see table 2 68 64 reduction of cod was achieved by cn ntio2 photocatalyst which indicates mineralization of pollutants into nontoxic substances as corresponds to the tds and cod analysis the designed photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue found to have very effective in decoloration as well as degradation of toxicant of the substance 3 4 reusability of functional nanomaterial one of the great importance of resultant catalysts is the possibility to be recovered and reused in consecutive degradation cycles in the present work we studied the reusability of cn ntio2 functional nanomaterial on the hetero photo catalytic degradation of methylene blue as reported in fig 7 after each cycle the catalyst was recovered by simple filtration and prepared for the next cycle the results indicating that prepared photo catalyst can be recycled and reused more than five 05 times providing high up to 80 conversion efficiency this can be explained by the key role of metal organic electrostatic attraction which could serve as an effective shield for superior grafting and prevent leaching results in a good durability the present catalyst exhibited excellent repetitive use performance which was of great interest as compared with recently reported catalyst systems in the literature for example zno tio2 au ceo2 tio2 rgo tio2 bn tio2 tio2 cnc and many other materials 67 71 however there is a gradual decrease in removal efficiency of the recycled catalysts has also been noticed which can be due to the loss of the material during filtration and or leaching of ntio2 from the carrier 3 5 the postulated mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue the detailed mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye using cn ntio2 has been postulated in scheme 1 a number of reactive species such as h oh and o2 are responsible for photo induced degradation of methylene blue 29 into nontoxic substances 72 in this system ntio2 played a role in the generation of oh under uv light to produce reactive species pedestals of produced reactive species likely to react with the methylene blue molecules and convert them into harmless molecules this mechanism involves the ntio2 excitation under uv light from the ground state to the triplet excited state 73 cn not only acted as a support for even distribution of ntio2 but also played a role in the adsorption of methylene blue and alleviation of ntio2 passivation which was validated through a blank experiment where cn was found to have a good attraction towards mb in aqueous form besides the presence of multiple crystal substances ntio2 and cn in catalyst and their high surface area causes higher utilization of uv light results effective generation of reactive species therefore ensures superior degradation of methylene blue the degradation of methylene blue occurred in through the following steps as illustrated in reaction 1

cotton powder by acid hydrolysis method the resultant materials were characterized by fesem tem xrd eds and ftir analysis the overall outcome of the study can be summarized as follows a realizing cn
