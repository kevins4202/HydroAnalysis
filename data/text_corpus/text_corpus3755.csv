18775,the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in municipal wastewater treatment plants represents a real risk to human health for the first time this paper shows that the inactivation rate of cefotaxime resistant bacteria is the same as total bacteria when secondary effluents are treated by the solar photo fenton process to obtain this result an exhaustive and comparative kinetic study on the inactivation of both total and cefotaxime resistant bacteria total coliform escherichia coli and enterococcus sp was carried out taking into account the effects of the main operation conditions such as solar irradiance and iron concentration and operation mode batch and continuous in all the operation conditions studied no significant differences were found between the first order inactivation rate constants ki of total and cefotaxime resistant bacteria additionally ki increased with solar irradiance and iron concentration as for the effect of the operation mode the main finding of this work is much quicker inactivation in continuous flow mode than in batch mode pointing out its potential application at large scale the best continuous operation condition to inactivate the bacteria to the detection limit 1 cfu ml 1 was at 22 4 min of hydraulic residence time with 5 mg fe2 l 1 and 30 mg h2o2 l 1 this treatment time is approximately a third of that reported in batch mode the efficiency in terms of figure of merits of the continuous flow operation was 2 7 m2 of solar collector area to reduce one log of e coli concentration per m3 of treated water and per hour in comparison with 2137 m2 calculated for batch operation under the same solar uva irradiance 30 w m 2 this paper encourages research into continuous solar disinfection processes due to its enhanced efficiency with regard to the commonly used batch wise operation and shows that efficient removal of total bacteria ensures the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater disinfection antibiotic resistant bacteria disinfection kinetics solar treatment efficiency analysis 1 introduction the reuse of treated wastewater for crop irrigation has become an increasingly recommended practice to address water scarcity in the eu and worldwide michael kordatou et al 2018 however the presence of the so called new contaminants or contaminants of emerging concern in treated wastewater has led to increased concern about the potential direct and indirect effects on the environment and possible implications for human health kümmerer et al 2016 in this regard special attention has been paid to the contribution of treated wastewater concerning the emergence of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria claimed to be one of the major global threats to society in the twenty first century by the world health organization who 2014 municipal wastewater treatment plants mwwtps are considered to be significant reservoirs of antibiotic resistant bacteria as they combine a high load of bacteria with a residual concentration of antibiotics fatta kassinos 2016 the biological treatments typically applied in mwwtps are poorly effective in the complete disinfection of the wastewater generating secondary effluents with about 109 1012 colony forming units cfu per day and per inhabitant equivalent among these at least 107 1010 cfu could have acquired antibiotic resistance rizzo et al 2013a b thus the large amount of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb discharged when treated wastewater is used for irrigation which may proliferate in soils or plants christou et al 2017 therefore conventional mwwtps should be upgraded with more efficient technologies such as tertiary treatments to provide enough protection for the potential risks related to water reuse not only by meeting the current quality standards but also by controlling the spread of arb into the environment in fact currents standards in water reuse for irrigation purposes relies on the control of chemical and microbiological parameters like heavy metals or enteric pathogens escherichia coli and enterococcus sp but do not evaluate arb levels fatta kassinos 2016 in this regard the measurement of bacteria resistant to cefotaxime third generation cephalosporin which is on the who essential list of medicine could be used as a reliable indicator of wastewater resistance levels as proposed by the scientific committee on health environmental and emerging risks scheer on the proposed eu minimum quality requirements for water reuse in agricultural irrigation and aquifer recharge a report prepared by the european commission joint research centre scheer 2017 despite the most common tertiary treatments used as a disinfection step before secondary effluent reuse having proved to be efficient in microorganism inactivation namely ozonation chlorination or uvc irradiation xu et al 2002 rodriguez chueca et al 2015 rizzo et al 2019 their efficacy for effective reduction of antibiotic resistance is not completely agreed upon luigi rizzo et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 sousa et al 2017 michael kordatou et al 2018 additionally other drawbacks related to the generation of undesirable disinfection by products through ozonation stalter et al 2010 or chlorination watson et al 2012 has forced research to seek out disinfection alternatives that are environmentally safer than conventional tertiary treatments namely the solar photo fenton process this advanced oxidation process aop has been found to be efficient not only at degrading antibiotics but also at inactivating microorganisms and arb giannakis et al 2018a without increasing toxicity michael et al 2012 it is based on the generation of highly oxidative and non selective species hydroxyl radicals ho that degrade the external membrane of bacteria increasing its permeability and inducing internal reactions that eventually inactivate the microorganisms giannakis et al 2018b the generation of ho in the fenton process relies on the repeated oxidation and reduction of iron catalyst by hydrogen peroxide moreover in the presence of uv vis radiation the ho production rate is increased due to the regeneration of fe2 by the photo conversion of ferric iron to ferrous iron pignatello et al 2006 despite the most desirable ph for radical production being around 2 8 3 0 owing to the low solubility of fe3 at higher ph many recent studies have confirmed the effectiveness of the photo fenton process for bacterial inactivation at neutral ph giannakis et al 2016b nevertheless to our knowledge the industrial application of this solar process as a tertiary treatment for wastewater disinfection has not yet been developed even though efforts have been directed towards making its application at large scale feasible via compound parabolic collectors cpcs rodríguez chueca et al 2014 or low cost reactors such as raceway pond reactors rprs esteban garcía et al 2018 in particular the latter has emerged as an attractive option not only for the remarkable reduction in investment cost rpr construction costs are 40 times cheaper than those for cpcs but also for the larger volume of wastewater than can be treated per surface area carra et al 2014 in fact to bring closer to reality the solar photo fenton implementation the large amount of secondary effluent generated in mwwtps needs to be dealt with with this in mind the feasibility of the continuous flow operation of the solar photo fenton process in rpr for secondary effluent disinfection has recently been investigated with promising results de la obra et al 2019 the objective of this work was to carry out an exhaustive and comparative kinetic study on the inactivation of both total and cefotaxime resistant bacteria by solar photo fenton at neutral ph in a wide range of operation conditions taking into account different bacterial species total coliform escherichia coli and enterococcus sp to this end the effects of solar irradiance and iron concentration as well as operation mode batch vs continuous were analysed 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater source secondary effluent batches of 1 m3 were taken from the municipal wastewater treatment plant named el bobar almeria southeastern spain a characterization of wastewater samples was carried out during the first three days of experimentation to assess their variability the average values and standard deviation of the main physico chemical parameters during the experimental period from october 2017 to february 2019 are included as supplementary material in table s1 all experiments were carried out at the natural ph of secondary effluent samples around 7 3 0 4 and remained constant during treatment time 2 2 experimental set up batch wise experiments were conducted in 5 cm deep rprs with initial hydrogen peroxide and iron concentrations of 50 and 20 mg l 1 respectively the effect of solar uva irradiance on bacteria inactivation was evaluated at 12 85 1 07 w m 2 30 38 0 69 w m 2 and 37 57 0 55 w m 2 corresponding to winter spring and summer respectively these experiments have been partially reported by de la obra et al 2019 in the present study new results of cefotaxime resistant cfx r bacteria inactivation are discussed as for studying the influence of iron concentration on both total and cfx r bacteria inactivation iron concentration was varied 20 10 5 and 2 5 mg l 1 while maintaining the initial h2o2 concentration at 50 mg l 1 and the irradiance at 13 1 w m 2 corresponding to winter conditions this experimental setup is shown in fig 1 a temperature labjack ei1034 and ph crison 5335 were monitored with a labjack u12 data acquisition card connected to a computer uva radiation was measured w m 2 with a horizontal global uv radiometer delta ohm lp uva 02 av the spectral response range being 327 384 nm control experiments in batch mode were performed outdoors under the following conditions i dark without any reagent to check the effect of the mechanical stress ii in the presence of sunlight uva and iii sunlight with hydrogen peroxide uva h2o2 mechanical stress had no effect on bacteria inactivation while 2 and 2 5 log decrease were observed for tc and e coli respectively after 120 min of treatment and the synergic effect of uva h2o2 caused 3 log inactivation after 200 min for tc and e coli significant differences can be observed for enterococcus sp with no bacterial damage in any control assayed these results are in concordance with those previously reported esteban garcía et al 2018 apart from that the influence of hydraulic residence time hrt on total and cfx r bacteria inactivation in continuous flow was studied at laboratory scale in a sun test cps solar simulator at 30 w m 2 of uva irradiance and a temperature of 25 c using a thermo scientific neslab rte 7 thermostatic bath to this end a 1 l stirred pvc cylindrical reactor with 5 cm of liquid depth and 16 cm of internal diameter was selected to perform this study fig 1b to ensure perfect mixing magnetic agitation was set to reach a mixing time of 2 4 s a value much shorter than the photo fenton treatment time four input flows 33 3 50 100 and 200 ml min 1 for the secondary effluent feed pump and two different input flows 4 2 and 7 2 ml min 1 for the h2o2 and fe2 stock solutions respectively were established giving rise to four values of hrt 22 4 16 3 9 0 and 4 7 min the inlet iron and h2o2 concentrations were 5 mg l 1 and 30 mg l 1 respectively the reactor start up was carried out in batch mode for 2 h followed by the continuous supply of reactants and secondary effluent giving rise to the continuous flow mode each hrt was maintained for 2 h to collect enough data once steady state was achieved additional control assays were carried out in continuous flow mode at 22 4 min of hrt the effects of i the mechanical stress ii uva and iii uva h2o2 on tc e coli and enterococcus sp inactivation were evaluated mechanical stress due to magnetic stirring led to 1 log decrease for tc while not damage was observed for e coli and enterococcus sp the exposure to uva irradiance caused 1 5 log decrease in tc 1 log due to mechanical stress and 1 log decrease in e coli in the case of enterococcus sp no bacterial damage was observed the combined effect of uva h2o2 did not cause any additional effect with regard to uva for the three species studied 2 3 total and antibiotic resistant bacteria quantification bovine liver catalase sigma aldrich spain was added to the wastewater samples before microbiological analysis in order to remove residual hydrogen peroxide garcía fernández et al 2012 the bacteria count in the samples collected during photo fenton experiments was carried out using the standard plated counting method through serial 10 fold dilutions with saline solution 0 8 nacl in selective media to count antibiotic resistant bacteria in the samples the selective media was enriched with 4 mg l 1 of cefotaxime cfx a third generation cephalosporin this concentration was reported in the documented clsi minimal inhibitory concentration mic breakpoint levels for enterobacteriaceae clinical and laboratory standards institute wayne pa 2011 the enumeration of colonies was performed after one day of incubation for tc and e coli in chromocult agar merk germany and two days for enterococcus sp in enterococcus medium pronadisa spain at 37 c in both total and cfx r for plate counting 50 250 500 1000 μl of sample were used reaching the microbial detection limit dl of 1 cfu ml 1 all procedures were carried out in duplicate for each sample regrowth in photo fenton treated water was checked by storing 200 ml of the sample in the dark at room temperature overnight the stored samples were plated for colony counting as previously described no regrowth was observed in any case 2 4 kinetic analysis chick s first order kinetic equation was chosen to fit the decrease of total and cfx r

2001 for the comparison and evaluation of advanced oxidation process aops can either be applied in terms of energy requirements in the case of devices using artificial light or in terms of area required in the case of solar light applications which is the case for the present study in this regard the figure of merit used was that intended for solar driven systems namely the collector area per order a co m2 m 3 order 1 a co is the collector area needed to inactivate 1 log of microorganism per unit of volume over a time t0 when standardized incident solar uv radiation was 30 w m 2 and

et al de la obra et al 2019 the ph of iron stock solution was adjusted to 2 8 with sulphuric acid 0 1 m 95 98 panreac spain to check the physico chemical quality of secondary effluent batches ion chromatography metrohm 881 compact ic pro and a toc v csh csn analyser shimadzu corporation were used for determining by direct injection of filtered samples anions and the dissolved carbon organic and total inorganic carbon tic concentrations respectively the chemical oxygen demand cod was quantified using a commercial kit hach lck 314 standard parameters such as ph and turbidity were measured using a portable ph meter and turbidity meter both acquired from hanna while the conductivity was determined by means of a conductivity meter phywe 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of uv irradiance and iron concentration in batch mode operation on cfx r bacteria inactivation the inactivation kinetics of arb is studied in batch mode since a simple first order model is used to calculate the rate constants for comparison purposes fig 2 shows the variation in the inactivation rate constants ki for total and cfx r bacteria at three irradiance levels related to winter spring and summer in almería spain in addition the inactivation rate constants from fenton control experiments were also included in order to obtain accurate results and taking into account that the experiments were carried out in outdoor conditions five replicates were carried out for 2 h at each irradiance level with initial iron and hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 20 and 50 mg l 1 respectively as reported to be the best reactant concentration for bacteria inactivation by solar photo fenton in batch mode ortega gómez et al 2014 significant differences in the initial bacterial concentration was found between total bacteria 2 9 104 5 2 103 and 3 7 103 cfu ml 1 for tc e coli and enterococcus sp respectively and antibiotic resistant bacteria 1 7 102 5 6 101 and 5 3 101 cfu ml 1 for tc e coli and enterococcus sp respectively in other words around two orders of magnitude lower the cfx r bacteria concentration with regard to the total as per the total bacteria tb the highest inactivation rate constants were obtained for tc while the lowest values were obtained for enterococcus sp at each irradiance tested these results corroborate previous studies where less bacterial damage and consequently a lower inactivation rate constant was observed in the case of enterococcus sp than in the case of tc and e coli esteban garcía et al 2018 this can be explained due to the higher resistance shown by these gram positive enteric bacteria enterococcus sp because of the presence of a more resistant cell wall as reported elsewhere giannakis et al 2016a the highest bacterial inactivation rate constants were obtained with the highest irradiance in summer in concordance with ortega gómez et al 2016 however the irradiance values corresponding to spring and summer 30 38 0 69 and 37 57 0 55 w m 2 respectively were not significantly different enough to justify the difference in the rate constant temperature also plays an important role in this inactivation process ortega gómez et al 2012 and therefore the differences in temperature between spring and summer 24 2 and 30 1 c respectively made an important contribution to the total and cfx r bacterial inactivation rates comparing the inactivation rate between total bacteria and cfx r bacteria no significant differences were observed in both cases inactivation rate constants very close to each other were obtained for the three microbiological groups studied these results confirm those obtained by giannakis et al 2018a who pointed out that antibiotic resistant bacteria do not need to be taken into account as a special factor in disinfection kinetics studies when the photo fenton process is applied in addition our study demonstrates that there are no differences between antibiotic resistant gram positive and gram negative bacteria enterococcus sp tc and e coli respectively since the inactivation rate constants were the same within confidence limits in all cases corroborating once again the aforementioned study as for the effect of iron concentration on antibiotic resistant bacteria cfx r inactivation four iron concentrations 20 10 5 and 2 5 mg l 1 were evaluated in triplicate with 50 mg l 1 of hydrogen peroxide in winter 13 1 w m 2 fig 3 the best iron concentration was 20 mg l 1 as reported elsewhere ortega gómez et al 2014 and the linear increase of ki with fe concentration shows the relevant effect of photo fenton on bacterial damage up to cellular inactivation no significant differences between total and cfx r bacteria inactivation constant were observed and the same slope in the ki vs iron concentration linear relationship corroborates that the small differences shown in fig 3 are in the experimental error interval to better compare total and cfx r bacteria inactivation a statistical analysis was carried out by pooling all data of ki obtained in batch mode and representing ki for total bacteria tb vs ki for cfx r bacteria fig 4 a statistically significant correlation between total and cfx r bacteria inactivation with a confidence level of 95 was observed the slope 1 003 demonstrates that the inactivation rate constants can be accepted as being the same for total and cfx r bacteria the determination coefficient being 0 997 3 2 effect of hrt on cfx r bacteria inactivation for scaling up purposes the solar photo fenton reactor must be operated in continuous flow mode so it is necessary to study the effect of hrt on the inactivation of cfx r bacteria the study was carried out at four values of hydraulic residence time from 22 4 to 4 7 min working with the best iron 5 mg l 1 and h2o2 30 mg l 1 concentrations previously reported for continuous flow disinfection of wwtp secondary effluents de la obra et al 2019 the operation started in batch mode for 2 h and the continuous operation was then started by increasing the inflow rate every 2 h to verify the effect of the hrt reduction fig 5 bacterial inactivation below the dl was achieved after 70 min of treatment for total and cfx r bacteria during batch mode operation this result is consistent with that obtained in a previous study esteban garcía et al 2018 in contrast at continuous flow operation significant differences were observed between 22 4 min and the other hrts studied 16 3 9 0 and 4 7 min although fig 5 only shows total and cfx r e coli inactivation the results of total and cfx r tc and enterococcus sp are shown in figures s1 and s2 in the case of 22 4 min the system was able to reach bacterial inactivation under dl 1 cfu ml 1 once steady state was achieved however in the cases of 16 3 min 9 0 min and 4 7 min of hrt the bacterial concentration increased up to values very close to the initial ones at steady state it is important to remark that no regrowth was observed for any microbiological group studied in the collected samples during the experiments carried out at 22 4 min of hrt total and cfx r e coli inactivation rate constants were evaluated once steady state was achieved showing rate constant values significantly higher 143 30 min 1 for e coli in the case of 22 4 min of hrt when compared with 0 16 0 01 min 1 0 18 0 01 min 1 and 0 30 0 01 min 1 in the case of 16 3 9 0 and 4 7 min of hrt respectively table 1 it is worth noting that when dl is achieved in steady state there is uncertainty in the calculation of the kinetic constant due to the very high initial concentration and the unknown actual bacterial concentration below the dl hence the reason for expressing k i 143 30 min 1 two features need to be highlighted from table 1 first the inactivation rate constants are much higher in continuous flow mode than in batch in continuous flow operation ferrous iron and hydrogen peroxide are continuously added to the reaction bulk and fenton reaction continuously generates hydroxyl radicals and not only in the first few seconds of treatment as occurs in batch mode this could explain a higher inactivation rate in continuous mode so a fenton assay in continuous operation was carried out with 20 mg l 1 of iron and compared with continuous photo fenton table 2 to provide more insight on the explanation of this difference in inactivation rates both experiments were carried out with the highest iron concentration tested to enhance the fenton effect although the fenton inactivation rate constants in continuous mode were higher one order of magnitude than in batch the differences between dark and illuminated operation in continuous mode were far higher these results demonstrated the great influence of irradiance on the disinfection by solar photo fenton as such the explanation comes from the complex mechanisms of bacteria inactivation as reported by pulgarín and co workers giannakis et al 2016a photo fenton inactivation of bacterial cells is a synergic and additive effect of several factors such as radiation intensity the oxidative action of hydrogen peroxide the photo fenton reaction on cell membranes and the internal photo fenton reaction giving rise to a multiple path oxidative destruction of vital cellular structures and molecules in the case presented in this work at neutral ph ferric iron formed from the reaction of h2o2 with freshly added ferrous iron precipitates as ferric hydroxides ortega gómez et al 2016 iron hydroxides can produce hydroxyl radicals through the heterogeneous photo fenton process ruales lonfat at el 2015 and this precipitate can be adsorbed onto the cells generating ho right at the membrane favouring oxidative attack in continuous flow the dilution effect as the inlet stream enters the reactor increases the likelihood of cell damage as opposed to initial batch conditions when a much higher bacterial concentration is subjected to stressful conditions nonetheless a minimum radiation energy requirement must be achieved and energy dose must be taken into account following the procedure described by de la obra et al de la obra et al 2019 the cumulative radiation energy received per unit of treated water volume quva was calculated for the different hrts giving 0 80 0 58 0 32 and 0 17 kj l 1 for hrts of 22 4 16 3 9 0 and 4 7 min respectively as previously demonstrated ortega gómez et al 2016 the longer exposure time allows higher ho generation to be obtained leading to higher bacterial inactivation being observed a minimum of 1 kj l 1 has been reported to cause bacterial damage de la obra et al 2019 a value similar to 0 80 kj l 1 obtained at 22 4 min hrt the second feature in table 1 is the apparent difference between inactivation rate constants for total and cfx r bacteria when dl is reached in steady state unfortunately the above mentioned uncertainty in the calculation of ki from eq 2 with only two values of bacterial concentration gives rise to a substantial impact of the inlet flow concentration meaning the higher the initial concentration the higher the rate constant accordingly no conclusion can be drawn from these results and more research is needed for clarification as for the hrts when dl was not achieved differences between rate constants for total and cfx r bacteria were not significant 3 3 process efficiency analysis figures of merit to evaluate the effect of the different factors tested in the previous sections on the scale up of the process the figures of merit of the photo fenton process have been calculated as the collector area per order aco m2 m 3 order 1 for batch system abco and continuous flow operation acco following equations 3 and 4 respectively the lower the collector area per order the higher the efficiency of the process consequently the determination of the collector area per order aco for the operational modes discontinuous and continuous seasonal period winter spring and summer and iron concentration used has been carried out for that purpose only the data for e coli were used since a concentration limit is required by the spanish legislation for that strain rd 1620 2007 the results are shown in table 3 the values obtained for discontinuous mode operation are two order of magnitude higher than for continuous mode among the three seasons summer gives rise to the lowest abco values regarding the effect of iron concentration in batch mode operation the higher the iron concentration the lower the area required and the higher the efficiency in this respect additional continuous conditions with lower hrt values 22 4 16 3 9 and 4 7 min were tested in the solar simulator as shown in the section 2 2 under these experimental conditions the figure of merit calculation is an extrapolation to the operation with natural sunlight in spring in this case only 22 4 min of hrt achieved the detection limit giving a value of acco 2 7 square meters of solar collector area required to reduce in 1 h the amount of e coli bacteria to one logarithmic unit 90 less in one cubic meter of real secondary effluent as shown in table 3 4 conclusions for the first time the inactivation kinetics of total and cefotaxime resistant bacteria by solar photo fenton have been compared under very different treatment conditions with no significant differences the target of wastewater disinfection treatments can therefore be defined as total pathogen bacteria inactivation as once the detection limit has been achieved arb are also inactivated the value obtained for the e coli inactivation rate constant in continuous mode operation was around four orders of magnitude higher than in batch mode with minimum energy dose 0 8 kj l 1 for hrt 22 4 min to bring about disinfection below the detection limit 1 cfu ml 1 for wastewater reuse in irrigation these results of bacteria inactivation by solar photo fenton at neutral ph in continuous flow mode make this process suitable for large scale application since the treatment times are shorter than batch operation and reactor loading manoeuvres are avoided additionally process efficiency has been evaluated in terms of figures of merit the best condition being continuous flow operation with 5 mg l 1 of iron and 22 4 min of hrt giving the lowest value 2 7 m2 m 3 order 1 of collector area per order and cubic meter in contrast with 2137 m2 calculated for batch operation under the same solar uva irradiance 30 w m 2 the operation of the solar photo fenton process in continuous flow mode opens up a new field of research as tertiary treatment because bacterial inactivation is much more efficient than in batch mode however more research is needed to elucidate the inactivation mechanisms and to develop process models in continuous flow acknowledgements this research has been supported by the andalusian regional government p12 rnm 1437 and the european regional

industrial application of this solar process as a tertiary treatment for wastewater disinfection has not yet been developed even though efforts have been directed towards making its application at large scale feasible via compound parabolic collectors cpcs rodríguez chueca et al 2014 or low cost reactors such as raceway pond reactors rprs esteban garcía et al 2018 in particular the latter has emerged as an attractive option not only for the remarkable reduction in investment cost rpr construction costs are 40 times cheaper than those for cpcs but also for the larger volume of wastewater than can be treated per surface area carra et al 2014 in fact to bring closer to reality the solar photo fenton implementation the large amount of secondary effluent generated in mwwtps needs to be dealt with with this in mind the feasibility of the continuous flow operation of the solar photo fenton process in rpr for secondary effluent disinfection has recently been investigated with promising results de la obra et al 2019 the objective of this work was to carry out an exhaustive and comparative kinetic study on the inactivation of both total and cefotaxime resistant bacteria by solar photo fenton at neutral ph in a wide range of operation conditions taking into account different bacterial species total coliform escherichia coli and enterococcus sp to this end the effects of solar irradiance and iron concentration as well as operation mode batch vs continuous were analysed 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater source secondary effluent batches of 1 m3 were taken from the municipal wastewater treatment plant named el bobar almeria southeastern spain a characterization of wastewater samples was carried out during the first three days of experimentation to assess their variability the average values and standard deviation of the main physico chemical parameters during the experimental period from october 2017 to february 2019 are included as supplementary material in table s1 all experiments were carried out at the natural ph of secondary effluent samples around 7 3 0 4 and remained constant during treatment time 2 2 experimental set up batch wise experiments were conducted in 5 cm deep rprs with initial hydrogen peroxide and iron concentrations of 50 and 20 mg l 1 respectively the effect of solar uva irradiance on bacteria inactivation was evaluated at 12 85 1 07 w m 2 30 38 0 69 w m 2 and 37 57 0 55 w m 2 corresponding to winter spring and summer respectively these experiments have been partially reported by de la obra et al 2019 in the present study new results of cefotaxime resistant cfx r bacteria inactivation are discussed as for studying the influence of iron concentration on both total and cfx r bacteria inactivation iron concentration was varied 20 10 5 and 2 5 mg l 1 while maintaining the initial h2o2 concentration at 50 mg l 1 and the irradiance at 13 1 w m 2 corresponding to winter conditions this experimental setup is shown in fig 1 a temperature labjack ei1034 and ph crison 5335 were monitored with a labjack u12 data acquisition card connected to a computer uva radiation was measured w m 2 with a horizontal global uv radiometer delta ohm lp uva 02 av the spectral response range being 327 384 nm control experiments in batch mode were performed outdoors under the following conditions i dark without any reagent to check the effect of the mechanical stress ii in the presence of sunlight uva and iii sunlight with hydrogen peroxide uva h2o2 mechanical stress had no effect on bacteria inactivation while 2 and 2 5 log decrease were observed for tc and e coli respectively after 120 min of treatment and the synergic effect of uva h2o2 caused 3 log inactivation after 200 min for tc and e coli significant differences can be observed for enterococcus sp with no bacterial damage in any control assayed these results are in concordance with those previously reported esteban garcía et al 2018 apart from that the influence of hydraulic residence time hrt on total and cfx r bacteria inactivation in continuous flow was studied at laboratory scale in a sun test cps solar simulator at 30 w m 2 of uva irradiance and a temperature of 25 c using a thermo scientific neslab rte 7 thermostatic bath to this end a 1 l stirred pvc cylindrical reactor with 5 cm of liquid depth and 16 cm of internal diameter was selected to perform this study fig 1b to ensure perfect mixing magnetic agitation was set to reach a mixing time of 2 4 s a value much shorter than the photo fenton treatment time four input flows 33 3 50 100 and 200 ml min 1 for the secondary effluent feed pump and two different input flows 4 2 and 7 2 ml min 1 for the h2o2 and fe2 stock solutions respectively were established giving rise to four values of hrt 22 4 16 3 9 0 and 4 7 min the inlet iron and h2o2 concentrations were 5 mg l 1 and 30 mg l 1 respectively the reactor start up was carried out in batch mode for 2 h followed by the continuous supply of reactants and secondary effluent giving rise to the continuous flow mode each hrt was maintained for 2 h to collect enough data once steady state was achieved additional control assays were carried out in continuous flow mode at 22 4 min of hrt the effects of i the mechanical stress ii uva and iii uva h2o2 on tc e coli and enterococcus sp inactivation were evaluated mechanical stress due to magnetic stirring led to 1 log decrease for tc while not damage was observed for e coli and enterococcus sp the exposure to uva irradiance caused 1 5 log decrease in tc 1 log due to mechanical stress and 1 log decrease in e coli in the case of enterococcus sp no bacterial damage was observed the combined effect of uva h2o2 did not cause any additional effect with regard to uva for the three species studied 2 3 total and antibiotic resistant bacteria quantification bovine liver catalase sigma aldrich spain was added to the wastewater samples before microbiological analysis in order to remove residual hydrogen peroxide garcía fernández et al 2012 the bacteria count in the samples collected during photo fenton experiments was carried out using the standard plated counting method through serial 10 fold dilutions with saline solution 0 8 nacl in selective media to count antibiotic resistant bacteria in the samples the selective media was enriched with 4 mg l 1 of cefotaxime cfx a third generation cephalosporin this concentration was reported in the documented clsi minimal inhibitory concentration mic breakpoint levels for enterobacteriaceae clinical and laboratory standards institute wayne pa 2011 the enumeration of colonies was performed after one day of incubation for tc and e coli in chromocult agar merk germany and two days for enterococcus sp in enterococcus medium pronadisa spain at 37 c in both total and cfx r for plate counting 50 250 500 1000 μl of sample were used reaching the microbial detection limit dl of 1 cfu ml 1 all procedures were carried out in duplicate for each sample regrowth in photo fenton treated water was checked by storing 200 ml of the sample in the dark at room temperature overnight the stored samples were plated for colony counting as previously described no regrowth was observed in any case 2 4 kinetic analysis chick s first order kinetic equation was chosen to fit the decrease of total and cfx r

2001 for the comparison and evaluation of advanced oxidation process aops can either be applied in terms of energy requirements in the case of devices using artificial light or in terms of area required in the case of solar light applications which is the case for the present study in this regard the figure of merit used was that intended for solar driven systems namely the collector area

et al de la obra et al 2019 the ph of iron stock solution was adjusted to 2 8 with sulphuric acid 0 1 m 95 98 panreac spain to check the physico chemical quality of secondary effluent batches ion chromatography metrohm 881 compact ic pro and a toc v csh csn analyser shimadzu corporation were used for determining by direct injection of filtered samples anions and the dissolved carbon organic and total inorganic carbon tic concentrations respectively the chemical oxygen demand cod was quantified using a commercial kit hach lck 314 standard parameters such as ph and turbidity were measured using a portable ph meter and turbidity meter both acquired from hanna while the conductivity was determined by means of a conductivity meter phywe 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of uv irradiance and iron concentration in batch mode operation on cfx r bacteria inactivation the inactivation kinetics of arb is studied in batch mode since a simple first order model is used to calculate the rate constants for comparison purposes fig 2 shows the variation in the inactivation rate constants ki for total and cfx r bacteria at three irradiance levels related to winter spring and summer in almería spain in addition the inactivation rate constants from fenton control experiments were also included in order to obtain accurate results and taking into account that the experiments were carried out in outdoor conditions five replicates were carried out for 2 h at each irradiance level with initial iron and hydrogen peroxide concentrations of 20 and 50 mg l 1 respectively as reported to be the best reactant concentration for bacteria inactivation by solar photo fenton in batch mode ortega gómez et al 2014 significant differences in the initial bacterial concentration was found between total bacteria 2 9 104 5 2 103 and 3 7 103 cfu ml 1 for tc e coli and enterococcus sp respectively and antibiotic resistant bacteria 1 7 102 5 6 101 and 5 3 101 cfu ml 1 for tc e coli and enterococcus sp respectively in other words around two orders of magnitude lower the cfx r bacteria concentration with regard to the total as per the total bacteria tb the highest inactivation rate constants were obtained for tc while the lowest values were obtained for enterococcus sp at each irradiance tested these results corroborate previous studies where less bacterial damage and consequently a lower inactivation rate constant was observed in the case of enterococcus sp than in the case of tc and e coli esteban garcía et al 2018 this can be explained due to the higher resistance shown by these gram positive enteric bacteria enterococcus sp because of the presence of a more resistant cell wall as reported elsewhere giannakis et al 2016a the highest bacterial inactivation rate constants were obtained with the highest irradiance in summer in concordance with ortega gómez et al 2016 however the irradiance values corresponding to spring and summer 30 38 0 69 and 37 57 0 55 w m 2 respectively were not significantly different enough to justify the difference in the rate constant temperature also plays an important role in this inactivation process ortega gómez et al 2012 and therefore the differences in temperature between spring and summer 24 2 and 30 1 c respectively made an important contribution to the total and cfx r bacterial inactivation rates comparing the inactivation rate between total bacteria and cfx r bacteria no significant differences were observed in both cases inactivation rate constants very close to each other were obtained for the three microbiological groups studied these results confirm those obtained by giannakis et al 2018a who pointed out that antibiotic resistant bacteria do not need to be taken into account as a special factor in disinfection kinetics studies when the photo fenton process is applied in addition our study demonstrates that there are no differences between antibiotic resistant gram positive and gram negative bacteria enterococcus sp tc and e coli respectively since the inactivation rate constants were the same within confidence limits in all cases corroborating once again the aforementioned study as for the effect of iron concentration on antibiotic resistant bacteria cfx r inactivation four iron concentrations 20 10 5 and 2 5 mg l 1 were evaluated in triplicate with 50 mg l 1 of hydrogen peroxide in winter 13 1 w m 2 fig 3 the best iron concentration was 20 mg l 1 as reported elsewhere ortega gómez et al 2014 and the linear increase of ki with fe concentration shows the relevant effect of photo fenton on bacterial damage up to cellular inactivation no significant differences between total and cfx r bacteria inactivation constant were observed and the same slope in the ki vs iron concentration linear relationship corroborates that the small differences shown in fig 3 are in the experimental error interval to better compare total and cfx r bacteria inactivation a statistical analysis was carried out by pooling all data of ki obtained in batch mode and representing ki for total bacteria tb vs ki for cfx r bacteria fig 4 a statistically significant correlation between total and cfx r bacteria inactivation with a confidence level of 95 was observed the slope 1 003 demonstrates that the inactivation rate constants can be accepted as being the same for total and cfx r bacteria the determination coefficient being 0 997 3 2 effect of hrt on cfx r bacteria inactivation for scaling up purposes the solar photo fenton reactor must be operated in continuous flow mode so it is necessary to study the effect of hrt on the inactivation of cfx r bacteria the study was carried out at four values of hydraulic residence time from 22 4 to 4 7 min working with the best iron 5 mg l 1 and h2o2 30 mg l 1 concentrations previously reported for continuous flow disinfection of wwtp secondary effluents de la obra et al 2019 the operation started in batch mode for 2 h and the continuous operation was then started by increasing the inflow rate every 2 h to verify the effect of the hrt reduction fig 5 bacterial inactivation below the dl was achieved after 70 min of treatment for total and cfx r bacteria during batch mode operation this result is consistent with that obtained in a previous study esteban garcía et al 2018 in contrast at continuous flow operation significant differences were observed between 22 4 min and the other hrts studied 16 3 9 0 and 4 7 min although fig 5 only shows total and cfx r e coli inactivation the results of total and cfx r tc and enterococcus sp are shown in figures s1 and s2 in the case of 22 4 min the system was able to reach bacterial inactivation under dl 1 cfu ml 1 once steady state was achieved however in the cases of 16 3 min 9 0 min and 4 7 min of hrt the bacterial concentration increased up to values very close to the initial ones at steady state it is important to remark that no regrowth was observed for any microbiological group studied in the collected samples during the experiments carried out at 22 4 min of hrt total and cfx r e coli inactivation rate constants were evaluated once steady state was achieved showing rate constant values significantly higher 143 30 min 1 for e coli in the case of 22 4 min of hrt when compared with 0 16 0 01 min 1 0 18 0 01 min 1 and 0 30 0 01 min 1 in the case of 16 3 9 0 and 4 7 min of hrt respectively table 1 it is worth noting that when dl is achieved in steady state there is uncertainty in the calculation of the kinetic constant due to the very high initial concentration and the unknown actual bacterial concentration below the dl hence the reason for expressing k i 143 30 min 1 two features need to be highlighted from table 1 first the inactivation rate constants are much higher in continuous flow mode than in batch in continuous flow operation ferrous iron and hydrogen peroxide are continuously added to the reaction bulk and fenton reaction continuously generates hydroxyl radicals and not only in the first few seconds of treatment as occurs in batch mode this could explain a higher inactivation rate in continuous mode so a fenton assay in continuous operation was carried out with 20 mg l 1 of iron and compared with continuous photo fenton table 2 to provide more insight on the explanation of this difference in inactivation rates both experiments were carried out with the highest iron concentration tested to enhance the fenton effect although the fenton inactivation rate constants in continuous mode were higher one order of magnitude than in batch the differences between dark and illuminated operation in continuous mode were far higher these results demonstrated the great influence of irradiance on the disinfection by solar photo fenton as such the explanation comes from the complex mechanisms of bacteria inactivation as reported by pulgarín and co workers giannakis et al 2016a photo fenton inactivation of bacterial cells is a synergic and additive effect of several factors such as radiation intensity the oxidative action of hydrogen peroxide the photo fenton reaction on cell membranes and the internal photo fenton reaction giving rise to a multiple path oxidative destruction of vital cellular structures and molecules in the case presented in this work at neutral ph ferric iron formed from the reaction of h2o2 with freshly added ferrous iron precipitates as ferric hydroxides ortega gómez et al 2016 iron hydroxides can produce hydroxyl radicals through the heterogeneous photo fenton process ruales lonfat at el 2015 and this precipitate can be adsorbed onto the cells generating ho right at the membrane favouring oxidative attack in continuous flow the dilution effect as the inlet stream enters the reactor increases the likelihood of cell damage as opposed to initial batch conditions when a much higher bacterial concentration is subjected to stressful conditions nonetheless a minimum radiation energy requirement must be achieved and energy dose must be taken into account following the procedure described by de la obra et al de la obra et al 2019 the cumulative radiation energy received per unit of treated water volume quva was calculated for the different hrts giving 0 80 0 58 0 32 and 0 17 kj l 1 for hrts of 22 4 16 3 9 0 and 4 7 min respectively as previously demonstrated ortega gómez et al 2016 the longer exposure time allows higher ho generation to be obtained leading to higher bacterial inactivation being observed a minimum of 1 kj l 1 has been reported to cause bacterial damage de la obra et al 2019 a value similar to 0 80 kj l 1 obtained at 22 4 min hrt the second feature in table 1 is the apparent difference between inactivation rate constants for total and cfx r bacteria when dl is reached in steady state unfortunately the above mentioned uncertainty in the calculation of ki from eq 2 with only two values of bacterial concentration gives rise to a substantial impact of the inlet flow concentration meaning the higher the initial concentration the higher the rate constant accordingly no conclusion can be drawn from these results and more research is needed for clarification as for the hrts when dl was not achieved differences between rate constants for total and cfx r bacteria were not significant 3 3 process efficiency analysis figures of merit to evaluate the effect of the different factors tested in the previous sections on the scale up of the process the figures of merit of the photo fenton process have been calculated as the collector area per order aco m2 m 3 order 1 for batch system abco and continuous flow operation acco following equations 3 and 4 respectively the lower the collector area per order the higher the efficiency of the process consequently the determination of the collector area per order aco for the operational modes discontinuous and continuous seasonal period winter spring and summer and iron concentration used has been carried out for that purpose only the data for e coli were used since a concentration limit is required by the spanish legislation for that strain rd 1620 2007 the results are shown in table 3 the values obtained for discontinuous mode operation are two order of magnitude higher than for continuous mode among the three seasons summer gives rise to the lowest abco values regarding the effect of iron concentration in batch mode operation the higher the iron concentration the lower the area required and the higher the efficiency in this respect additional continuous conditions with lower hrt values 22 4 16 3 9 and 4 7 min were tested in the solar simulator as shown in the section 2 2 under these experimental conditions the figure of merit calculation is an extrapolation to the operation with natural sunlight in spring in this case only 22 4 min of hrt achieved the detection limit giving a value of acco 2 7 square meters of solar collector area required to reduce in 1 h the amount of e coli bacteria to one logarithmic unit 90 less in one cubic meter of real secondary effluent as shown in table 3 4 conclusions for the first time the inactivation kinetics of total and cefotaxime resistant bacteria by solar photo fenton have been compared under very different treatment conditions with no significant differences the target of wastewater disinfection treatments can therefore be defined as total pathogen bacteria inactivation as once the detection limit has been achieved arb are also inactivated the value obtained for the e coli inactivation rate constant in continuous mode operation was around four orders of magnitude higher than in batch mode with minimum energy dose 0 8 kj l 1 for hrt 22 4 min to bring about disinfection below the detection limit 1 cfu ml 1 for wastewater reuse in irrigation these results of bacteria inactivation by solar photo fenton at neutral ph in continuous flow mode make this process suitable for large scale application since the treatment times are shorter than batch operation and reactor loading manoeuvres are avoided additionally process efficiency has been evaluated in terms of figures of merit the best condition being continuous flow operation with 5 mg l 1 of iron and 22 4 min of hrt giving the lowest value 2 7 m2 m 3 order 1 of collector area per order and cubic meter in contrast with 2137 m2 calculated for batch operation under the same solar uva irradiance 30 w m 2 the operation of the solar photo fenton process in continuous flow mode opens up a new field of research as tertiary treatment because bacterial inactivation is much more efficient than in batch mode however more research is needed to elucidate the inactivation mechanisms and to develop process models in continuous flow acknowledgements this research has been supported by the andalusian regional government p12 rnm 1437 and the european regional

advanced oxidation process aop by unknown screening analysis with orbitrap mass spectrometry the consequential effects on formation of unknown disinfection by products dbps by chlorination were evaluated in laboratory scale experiments several hundred unsaturated dom features with positive oxygen subtracted double bond equivalents per carbon dbe o c were decomposed by the ozone only treatment and aop the aop decomposed some saturated negative dbe o c and reduced molecules which had negative carbon oxidation states cos several hundred saturated oxidation by products were detected after ozonation and the aop after chlorination the samples pre treated with ozone alone resulted in higher formation of unknown dbps than the aop pre treated sample or the sample without oxidation over half of the dbp precursors estimated by electrophilic substitution were not totally decomposed by any oxidation process but they were increased after the ozone only process and aop dbp precursors produced by the ozone only process or aop formed unique unknown dbps therefore post treatment processes after oxidation and before chlorination are important to minimize formation of unknown dbps

watanabe 1999 rice 1999 ozone o3 oxidation of organic molecules mostly results in transformation rather than complete mineralization at the doses applied for drinking water treatment lamsal et al 2011 ratpukdi et al 2010 a wide variety of oxidation by products obps are produced by ozone oxidation with organic molecules such as carboxylic acids alcohols aldehydes ketones and keto aldehydes richardson et al 1999 von gunten 2003b biological activated carbon filtration is often used after ozonation to remove obps but only some obps are removed by this process amy et al 1992 phungsai et al 2018 decomposition of ozone during reactions with organic molecules results in production of the hydroxyl radical oh which is a much stronger oxidant than ozone however its concentration is typically below 10 12 m in drinking water ozonation and it is rapidly consumed by natural scavengers such as carbonate bicarbonate von gunten 2003a production of oh could be promoted by various systems such as o3 ultraviolet uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv and o3 h2o2 peroxone which are used in advanced oxidation processes aops peroxone is the most practical system for upgrading current water ozonation processes to an aop as it is only necessary to add h2o2 to promote formation of oh the reaction for oh formation with peroxone bourgin et al 2017 occurs as follows 1 h2o2 2o3 2 oh 3o2 applications of ozone and aops in water treatment have been widely studied for decades lamsal et al 2011 ratpukdi et al 2010 although the oxidation rates of numerous organic molecules by o3 or oh have been investigated these studies have mostly used limited numbers of model compounds comprehensive understanding of obps is lacking because of the absence of suitable analytical methods although ozone is an effective disinfectant chlorination is used in addition to ozonation or an aop for its residual effect one of the major concerns of chlorination is the formation of toxic disinfection by products dbps pre ozonation effectively decreases the formation of several regulated dbps such as trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and haloacetonitriles but increases formation of other dbps de vera et al 2015 hua and reckhow 2013 de vera et al 2015 also compared ozonation and peroxone effects on dbp formations and found most of the regulated dbp formations increased after peroxone oxidation except trihalonitromethanes however precursors of regulated dbps could be effectively minimized by biofiltration de vera et al 2016 the regulated dbps generally account for less than half of all the organic halide dbps formed by chlorination and over half of dbps were still unknown richardson 2003 in this decade several studies have shed light on unknown dbp by applied unknown screening analysis and reported occurrence of several hundred unknown dbps in drinking waters gonsior et al 2014 lavonen et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 phungsai et al 2018 not only reported over unknown 50 dbp features in two drinking waters in japan but also found some of ozone obps acted as unknown precursors even if de vera et al 2016 and fu et al 2017 reported that regulated dbp precursors could be decreased during biofiltration phungsai et al 2018 found many of unknown dbp precursors could escape from biological activated carbon filtration to water chlorination however the previous studies mostly show the fate of regulated dbp precursors or that of unknown dbps only in given conditions in some treatment plants hence the effects of different ozonation conditions and aops on dbp precursors and the formation of the other unknown dbps is still unclear and should be taken into account to control the overall risk of dbps this study aimed to provide insight into the effects of ozone and peroxone on molecular level dom and the consequential effects on formation of unknown dbps in chlorination for practical reasons we simulated the ozonation and peroxone effects and then conducted a laboratory scale chlorination experiment using coagulation sedimentation effluent from a full scale dwtp previously an orbitrap mass spectrometry orbitrap ms with unknown screening analysis has been successfully used for molecular level characterization of dom and determination of the formulae of unknown dbps formed after chlorination phungsai et al 2016 2018 and this analysis was used in this study changes in dom and molecular characteristics were elucidated by a semiquantitative approach the effects of oxidation treatments on formation of unknown dbps and putative precursors were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples and laboratory scale experiment the water samples were collected from a dwtp in tokyo in october 2015 the treatment processes used at this plant are coagulation sedimentation ozonation biological activated carbon filtration and rapid sand filtration at the time of the sampling an ozone gas dosage of 0 57 mg of o3 per liter mg o3 l was constantly diffused into the water for 15 min and the ozonated water was retained for a further 15 min without ozone diffusion chlorination was performed with dosages of 0 7 and 0 1 mg of cl2 per liter mg cl2 l as free chlorine before and after rapid sand filtration respectively samples of the raw water and after each treatment process were collected in 2 l pre combusted 550 c 4 h glass bottles the samples were stored at 5 c before further analyses coagulation sedimentation effluent was used for laboratory oxidation experiments the oxidation treatment experiments were conducted in a 6 l pre combusted glass reactor fig s1a to stimulate actual drinking water treatment condition none of chemical buffer was not added to the samples and ph level of the samples was 6 8 before ozonation and chlorination the temperature was

for use in full scale dwtps after 15 min of ozone diffusion the water samples were retained for another 15 min with constant mixing by a magnetic stirrer to simulate actual treatment conditions for the aop experiment while 4 mg o3 l was continuously supplied to the water samples a 302 5 mg of h2o2 per liter solution was simultaneously supplied at 3 33 ml per minute within 15 min of ozone

same method to compare the effects with and without oxidation treatment on dbp formation all the experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 2 water sample analyses total organic carbon and dissolved

sample was acidified to ph 2 using formic acid purity 98 before extraction the cartridge was conditioned with 10 ml of liquid chromatography ms grade methanol and equilibrated with 10 ml of acidified milli q water ph 2 the acidified samples were supplied to the cartridge at a flow rate of 20 ml min then the cartridge was rinsed with 10 ml of acidified milli q water followed by elution with 10 ml of methanol milli q water and the chlorinated milli q with the identical free chlorine dosage with the experiment were extracted with the same spe method to eliminate artifact chlorinated molecules from the reaction of sorbent with chlorine and used as a control an orbitrap ms exactive thermo fisher scientific waltham ma with electrospray ionization was applied for screening of unknowns in this study the extracts were analyzed by flow injection analysis with a methanol mobile phase liquid chromatography ms grade at a flow rate of 200 μl min the analysis was performed in negative ion mode with a spray current of 4 5 kv and full scan m z range of 100 1000 the analysis was not conducted in positive ion mode because of the complex mass spectra of sodium adducts which affected assignment of molecular formulae natural organic matter peaks sleighter et al 2008 were detected in all the samples and used as internal calibrants to achieve a mass accuracy below 2 ppm the other analytical conditions were as described by phungsai et al 2016 background subtraction peak integration and component extraction from high resolution mass spectra were performed using sieve software thermo fisher scientific peak integration also included adduct removal and isotope confirmation 13c12cn 1 of each component for oxidation experiments only peaks which detected in both duplicate samples were further analyzed the list of peak integrated components were obtained from the software unequivocal molecular formulae schymanski et al 2014 were obtained from a compound identification algorithm kujawinski and behn 2006 kujawinski et al 2009 using the following numbers of atoms c0 39 h0 72 o0 20 n0 2 s0 2 and cl0 3 the identification by the algorithm included formula identification by the best fit within mass error less than 2 ppm and functional group extension with mass error less than 5 ppm as described in kujawinski and behn 2006 the lowest mass error formulae with the lowest number of n s was prioritized as this identification function was validated with synthetic compounds kujawinski and behn 2006 kujawinski et al 2009 assigned formulae were further validated by seven golden rules kind and fiehn 2007 additionally only formulae with dbe o calculated using eq 2 between 10 and 10 herzsprung et al 2014 were used in this study for cl containing features the numbers of chlorine atoms were validated using the intensity of 37cl peak those assigned formula dom peaks were referred as features in this study an intensity change of over 30 was used as the criterion to examine semiquantitative changes of dom in the unknowns screening this criterion was set based on the degree of intensity deviation of the orbitrap ms with 95 of the peak intensities deviating by 30 phungsai et al 2016 2018 hence changes were categorized into three groups decomposed unchanged and new obps formed the decomposed group included features that showed intensity decreases of 30 after oxidation whereas the unchanged or refractory group contained features that showed intensity changes of 30 after treatment it should be noted that a sample could contain at the same time compounds that were decreased and others which has identical formula to the decrease ones that were formed those features with intensity increases of 30 or that were newly formed after oxidation treatments were classed as obps 2 4 calculations principal component analysis pca was applied to examine differences among the water samples using their peak intensities using spss software ibm armonk ny molecular formulae of dom were converted to molecular characteristics plots of the oxygen subtracted double bond equivalents per carbon dbe o c in eq 3 and carbon oxidation state cos in eq 4 were used as indicators of the degrees of unsaturation and oxidation respectively in addition kendrick mass km plots on the ch2 scale were applied to extrapolate changes in dom in different homologous series kim et al 2003 stenson et al 2003 this ch2 scale km analysis has been widely used for dom in environmental analyses because dom commonly contains series of alkylated homologs the km plots depict differences in the number of ch2 groups with the nominal km da on the x axis eq 5 and the members of a homologous series with the same km defect kmd on the y axis eq 6 the formulae on the same horizontal line same kmd are those in a homologous series or with identical core structures all these molecular characterizations were applied only for dom features containing carbon oxygen and hydrogen cho features this was the main focus in this study because of the abundance 70 of all identified compounds in terms of both number and intensity based distributions fig s2 2 dbe o 1 0 5 2c h o 3 dbe o c 1 0 5 2c h o c 4 cos h 2o c 5 km mass of a formula 14 14 01565 6 kmd nominal mass km 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall changes in dom and recovery after spe treatment the doc concentrations and suva values of the water samples before and after treatments are shown in table 1 the dosed ozone was efficiently consumed as residual ozone was below 0 15 mg l in all experiments the changes in the doc concentrations by dwtp ozonation and 1 mg o3 l in the laboratory experiment were negligible as it was under deviation of measurement at 0 1 mg of carbon per liter mg c l a reduction of 0 2 mg c l was observed after treatment with 4 mg o3 l and the aop and may indicate that dom mineralization occurred by these two oxidation conditions the suva values decreased by more than 65 after treatment with 4 mg o3 l and the aop and by around 50 after treatment with 1 mg o3 l these results indicated that decomposition of carbon double bonds in organic molecules and formation of saturated molecules occurred with oxidation treatments in addition higher ozone dosage or the aop induced more changes to dom by increasing hydrophilicity these observations are consistent with mineralization of dom and reduction in the suva values which have been reported by ratpukdi et al 2010 and lamsal et al 2011 the doc and suva values of the sample after treatment with 1 mg o3 l were of the same magnitude as those for the water sample collected after ozonation in the dwtp changes observed in doc and suva with h2o2 treatment were only minor after 24 h of chlorination the changes of doc levels were almost negligible while the suva values decreased by over 30 in all the water samples these unchanged doc vales and consistent reduction of the suva indicators in all the chlorinated samples indicates decomposition of unsaturated dom and production of saturated dom by chlorination without mineralization the doc recovery from coagulation effluent on the spe cartridge was almost 60 whereas the doc recoveries after ozone or h2o2 oxidations were around 40 49 table 1 this doc recovery level was similar to several other studies gonsior et al 2014 li et al 2017 phungsai et al 2018 the lowest doc recovery around 27 was observed after aop treatment the reduced doc recovery and suva values after oxidation treatment indicated low recovery of saturated dom as obps with oxidation treatment hence some of the obps might be missing in the following analyses the doc recoveries of the samples after chlorination were at the same level as before chlorination table 1 only a fraction of recovered dom ionized by esi and lower than 1000 da were analyzed in this study 3 2 comparison of the cho features we used pca to statistically evaluate the experimental reproducibility and differences among the oxidation treatments using the peak intensities of the cho features for each sample fig 1 the results of duplicate experiments were clustered within a short distance indicating good experimental reproducibility the ozonation and aop showed considerable differences among the cho features compared with the coagulation sedimentation effluent and the sample after treatment with 2 5 mg h2o2 l which were clustered within short distances this observation suggested that the effect of 2 5 mg h2o2 l on the cho features was only minor compared with that of ozonation and the aop dwtp ozonation was very close to the laboratory scale treatment with 1 mg o3 l showing these oxidation conditions were similar in addition we found over 900 cho features showed similar changes decomposed unchanged and produced after dwtp ozonation and the laboratory scale treatment with 1 mg o3 l table 2 accounting for 91 8 of the total cho features this semiquantitative analysis was consistent with the pca results and doc suva results table 1 hence the laboratory scale experiment with 1 mg o3 l could simulate ozonation in the full scale dwtp increasing the ozone dosage to 4 mg o3 l resulted in larger difference among the cho features as seen in the pca results fig 1 doc and suva results table 1 although over 80 of the cho features underwent the same changes at the different ozone dosages table 2 for the other 20 decomposition of over 100 cho features and production of around 100 more cho obps occurred at the higher ozone dosage in addition the aop results were distanced differently to the ozonated water samples fig 1 this could be attributed to decomposition of more cho features by the aop than with ozone treatment only table 2 the more effective oxidation by the aop than ozone could be induced by the reaction of oh with cho features the lower ozone concentration in the water with 4 mg o3 l 2 5 mg h2o2 l treatment compared with 4 mg o3 l treatment also supported formation of oh fig s3 fewer obp features were formed by the aop than with ozone treatment only table 2 this may be partly caused by formation of compounds that are more difficult to recover by the spe treatment which would decrease the doc recovery table 1 it is also possible that the aop obps have lower molecular weights than under our analytical conditions for example we found that the levels of low molecular weight carboxylic acids which are well known ozone and aop obps formed after the aop were lower than after ozonation table 1 and separate low molecular weight carboxylic acids shown in fig s4 3 3 dom decomposition and obp formation by oxidation to reveal differences in the effects of the oxidation treatments changes in the cho features with the oxidation treatments were plotted against the degree of unsaturation dbe o c and carbon oxidation state cos fig 2 and each oxidation condition shown separately in fig s5 most of the cho features decomposed by ozonation had positive dbe o c fig 2a this finding indicates selective reaction of ozone with the features containing unsaturated double bonds this selective reaction at carbon double bonds or activated aromatic rings is well known von gunten 2003a an increase in the ozone dosage further decomposed some cho features with lower cos fig 2a and also some of those with negative dbe o c this implies efficiency of higher ozone dose on decomposition of more saturated molecules compared with ozonation the aop could decompose additional features with more negative dbe o c and cos which were refractory to ozone fig 2b this additional decomposition could arise from the oh reaction with more saturated organic molecules these observations imply that we could extend the oxidation efficiency to saturated organic molecules by increasing the ozone dosage or adding h2o2 to promote advanced oxidation by oh most of the obps formed after both ozone conditions were only relatively saturated negative dbe o c with a wide range of cos fig 2c some of obps specifically formed by 1 mg o3 l were found at negative cos values while those obps specifically formed by 4 mg o3 l were relatively higher cos this implies formation of more oxidized obps when applied higher ozone dosage in some extent compared with obps produced by the 4 mg o3 l treatment the aop produced saturated negative dbe o c and highly oxidized obps positive cos fig 2d this could be partly attributed to the decomposition of the cho features with negative dbe o c and cos values blue dots in fig 2b by the aop these observations on the decomposition of unsaturated cho features and formation of saturated obps in oxidation treatment are consistent with the reduction observed in the suva results after ozone treatment km analyses were applied to compare decomposition with the oxidation treatments fig 3 and changes with each treatment shown separately in fig s6 ozone preferentially reacted with cho features in some alkylation homologs fig 3a it is important to note that these ozone reactive homologs would contain carbon double bonds as most of those decomposed by ozone reaction had positive dbe o c the differences on oxidations among homologs would be explained by functional group substituents on their structure the homologs decomposed by ozonation e g line a in fig 3a could contain electron donating substituents e g oh or o and ch2 which make carbon double bonds rich in electron density other refractory homologs e g line c in fig 3a could have electron withdrawing substituents e g cho cor cooh and coor that should be less reactive with ozone in ozone reactive homologs cho features with smaller nominal kms which could have fewer ch2 groups were decomposed by both ozone conditions e g line d in fig 3a it was obvious that a higher ozone dosage could decompose not only features with fewer ch2 groups but also those with more ch2 groups line d in fig 3a these observations suggest that for this homolog features with fewer ch2 groups were more reactive to ozone oxidation than those with more ch2 groups by contrast the opposite was observed for some other homologous series e g lines b and e in fig 3a the formula containing the most ch2 groups in this homolog was decomposed by a low ozone dosage whereas features with fewer ch2 groups were decomposed with the higher ozone dosage one possible explanation for this is that there might be less electron density at the reactive bonds of features with fewer ch2 groups because of electron withdrawing substituents whereas the electron withdrawing effects in features with more ch2 groups might be reduced because of the electron donating efficiency of ch2 when the 4 mg o3 l treatment was compared with the aop fig 3b we found the aop could decompose both cho features which were decomposed by ozone e g lines a d and e in fig 3b and react with the features that were not decomposed by ozone e g lines b and c in fig 3b the oxidation by aop could extend to features in the homologs containing fewer ch2 groups line b in fig 3b the cho obps formed after oxidation treatments were also analyzed by km fig 4 it was clear that many homologous alkyl obps were produced by ozonation fig 4a between both ozone conditions some of obps with low numbers of ch2 groups and some with 500 da were only formed in the 4 mg o3 l treatment while some obps specifically formed by 1 mg o3 l were found containing the most ch2 in the homologous alkyl obps the observations imply additional formation of high molecular weight obp homologs and formation of less ch2 obps in some homologs by increasing of ozone dosage comparison of the 4 mg o3 l and aop treatments showed that obps with fewer ch2 were produced by both the ozone and aop treatments whereas obps with more ch2 chains were only produced by the 4 mg o3 l treatment fig 4b comparing oxidation efficiencies of each condition with formation of obps revealed by dbe o c vs cos and km analyses increasing oxidation efficiencies by increasing ozone dose or the aop produce obps with lower molecular weight or fewer ch2 in the homologs with higher oxidation states this is consistent with results of low molecular weight carboxylic acids table 1 and fig s4 3 4 effects of the oxidation treatments on unknown dbp formation after 24 h of chlorination the residual chlorine concentration were 0 53 0 53 0 58 and 0 16 mgcl2 l for the chlorinated samples with no ozonation 1 mg o3 l 4 mg o3 l and 4 mg o3 l 2 5 mg h2o2 l respectively the intensities of several hundred cho features were decreased over 30 after chlorination and those of less than a hundred cho features were either increased or newly formed table s1 by contrast 50 100 of the chlorinated cho features chocl were new or increased by 30 in each chlorinated sample fig 5 a those features were classed as dbps in this study table s2 both the number and intensity based levels of dbps in the chlorinated sample previously treated with 1 mg o3 l 0 97 mg of o3 per milligram of carbon were larger than those for the chlorinated sample without oxidation chlorinated coagulation effluent or the samples from the other oxidation treatments these results imply that unlike well known dbps the potential for formation of unknown dbps can be enhanced by ozonation with approximately 1 mg of o3 per milligram of carbon dbp formation was reduced when a higher ozone dosage was applied but it was still higher than the dbp formation in the chlorinated coagulation effluent no oxidation treatment these observations show it is important to consider unknown dbps because they can behave differently from regulated dbps it is also important to select an ozone dosage that minimizes dbp formation in the chlorination step compared with ozonation the aop resulted in the lowest dbp formation in terms of both number and intensity lamsal et al 2011 consistently found peroxone treatment reduced formation potential of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids more than o3 treatment in contrast de vera et al 2015 reported increasing of all regulated dbps except trihalonitromethanes after adding h2o2 during ozonation however those regulated dbps precursors were found to be effectively minimized by biofiltration de vera et al 2016 fu et al 2017 as shown in fig 6 a several unique dbp were formed in each oxidation treatment effects of oxidation treatments on dbp precursors might be different among water samples and optimal conditions would be importantly required to minimize formation of dbp precursors in addition fate of unknown dbp precursors during biofiltration would be different and need to be further investigated as many of them could not be removed during biofiltration phungsai et al 2018 the smaller numbers of dbps detected in the chlorinated sample pre treated by aop in this study could also be because of the lower doc recovery compared with other samples as dom after oxidation by oh radical or chlorine would be more hydrophilic other spe cartridge that specifically target highly hydrophilic molecules would recover such fraction of dom knowing the molecular features of dbps allows us to track their putative precursors via well known chlorination reactions such as electrophilic substitution by displacing the cl atoms with h atoms in dbp features the molecular features of electrophilic substitution type putative precursors can be obtained dbps whose precursors cannot be found could originate from other chlorine reactions such as oxidation or addition reactions or decomposition of molecules with higher masses among the chlorinated cho 49 features were commonly formed in all the oxidation pre treated samples and also the sample without pre oxidation fig 6a and other heteroatom dbps shown in table s3 we could detect 33 of the putative electrophilic substitution precursors of these 49 dbps fig 6b many of the dbps and their putative precursors were found in all of the samples this suggested that those precursors were refractory to oxidation treatments but reactive to chlorination it is also possible that they were produced by the oxidation treatments as the levels of most of them increased after the oxidation treatments table s4 this is consistent with our previous reports phungsai et al 2016 2018 ozone only treatment and the aop also produced some unique dbp precursors fig 6b which resulted in formation of unique dbps in the samples pre treated by the oxidation treatments fig 6a this study demonstrates the molecular characteristics of dom decomposed by treatments with different ozone dosage and an aop the findings emphasize the importance of selection of oxidation conditions and removal of remaining obps before chlorination our results also demonstrate the applicability of the orbitrap ms for determination of unknown dbps and their precursors this approach shows potential for comprehensive monitoring of both dbps and their precursors at full scale dwtps and other micro organic pollutants hollender et al 2017 van leerdam et al 2014 it is important to note that some of obps and dbps were missing in this study as those were not able to be recovered by spe they might be recovered if another spe sorbents such as those especially target hydrophilic compounds are additionally employed in addition direct injection of larger sample volume would be a potential way to avoid dom loss in the spe step olaf et al 2014 sleighter et al 2009 if we could sacrifice sensitivity of the analysis analysis with chromatographic column and ms ms would provide more valuable data through structure estimation merel et al 2017 to evaluate potential toxicity of dbps via qualitative structure activity relationship matsushita et al 2016 or toxicities tests via authentic standards stalter et al 2013 however selection of chromatographic column suitable to wide variety of complex dom would be another challenge to avoid irreversible adsorption on the column itself 4 conclusion reduction of suva values by all the oxidation treatments indicated decomposition of dissolved organic matter dom to become more saturated molecules and mineralization were found only at 4 mg o3 l and aop 4 mgo3 l 2 5 mg h2o2 l by over 0 2 mgc l 24 h chlorination at 1 2 mg cl2 l further decreased suva values while doc level remained unchanged ozone selectively decomposed cho features with positive dbe o c or unsaturated molecules the increase of ozone dosage promoted decomposition of the features with more saturated molecules more negative dbe o c and with less oxidized character more negative cos kendrick mass analysis indicated decomposition of cho features by ozone selectively took place with some alkylation homologs while increasing ozone dosage could promote decomposition of fewer or more ch2 in the homologs aop could additionally decompose the features with more saturated and lower oxidation state negative dbe o c and cos some ch2 features which were resistant to ozone could be decomposed by aop over 500 cho oxidation by products obps features were found after oxidation treatments by 1 mg o3 l or 4 mg o3 l while numbers of obps features formed after aop were less higher oxidation efficiencies by higher ozone dose or aop generated obps with lower molecular weights fewer ch2 in the obp homologs with higher oxidation states pre treatment by ozone rather increased the formation of unknown dbps after chlorination in terms of both number and intensity while the aop could decrease the number of unknown dbps formed after chlorination pre treatment by each oxidation also formed unique dbp precursors resulting in the formation of specific unknown dbps for each condition acknowledgements this research was funded by the core research for

18776,we investigated semiquantitative changes in almost 1000 dissolved organic matter dom features during oxidation with 1 mg of o3 per liter mg o3 l 4 mg o3 l or 4 mg o3 l 2 5 mg of h2o2 per liter advanced oxidation process aop by unknown screening analysis with orbitrap mass spectrometry the consequential effects on formation of unknown disinfection by products dbps by chlorination were evaluated in laboratory scale experiments several hundred unsaturated dom features with positive oxygen subtracted double bond equivalents per carbon dbe o c were decomposed by the ozone only treatment and aop the aop decomposed some saturated negative dbe o c and reduced molecules which had negative carbon oxidation states cos several hundred saturated oxidation by products were detected after ozonation and the aop after chlorination the samples pre treated with ozone alone resulted in higher formation of unknown dbps than the aop pre treated sample or the sample without oxidation over half of the dbp precursors estimated by electrophilic substitution were not totally decomposed by any oxidation process but they were increased after the ozone only process and aop dbp precursors produced by the ozone only process or aop formed unique unknown dbps therefore post treatment processes after oxidation and before chlorination are important to minimize formation of unknown dbps

been widely implemented in drinking water treatment plants dwtps for odor and taste control decoloration disinfection and removal of micropollutants camel and bermond 1998 geering 1999 matsumoto and watanabe 1999 rice 1999 ozone o3 oxidation of organic molecules mostly results in transformation rather than complete mineralization at the doses applied for drinking water treatment lamsal et al 2011 ratpukdi et al 2010 a wide variety of oxidation by products obps are produced by ozone oxidation with organic molecules such as carboxylic acids alcohols aldehydes ketones and keto aldehydes richardson et al 1999 von gunten 2003b biological activated carbon filtration is often used after ozonation to remove obps but only some obps are removed by this process amy et al 1992 phungsai et al 2018 decomposition of ozone during reactions with organic molecules results in production of the hydroxyl radical oh which is a much stronger oxidant than ozone however its concentration is typically below 10 12 m in drinking water ozonation and it is rapidly consumed by natural scavengers such as carbonate bicarbonate von gunten 2003a production of oh could be promoted by various systems such as o3 ultraviolet uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv and o3 h2o2 peroxone which are used in advanced oxidation processes aops peroxone is the most practical system for upgrading current water ozonation processes to an aop as it is only necessary to add h2o2 to promote formation of oh the reaction for oh formation with peroxone bourgin et al 2017 occurs as follows 1 h2o2 2o3 2 oh 3o2 applications of ozone and aops in water treatment have been widely studied for decades lamsal et al 2011 ratpukdi et al 2010 although the oxidation rates of numerous organic molecules by o3 or oh have been investigated these studies have mostly used limited numbers of model compounds comprehensive understanding of obps is lacking because of the absence of suitable analytical methods although ozone is an effective disinfectant chlorination is used in addition to ozonation or an aop for its residual effect one of the major concerns of chlorination is the formation of toxic disinfection by products dbps pre ozonation effectively decreases the formation of several regulated dbps such as trihalomethanes haloacetic acids and haloacetonitriles but increases formation of other dbps de vera et al 2015 hua and reckhow 2013 de vera et al 2015 also compared ozonation and peroxone effects on dbp formations and found most of the regulated dbp formations increased after peroxone oxidation except trihalonitromethanes however precursors of regulated dbps could be effectively minimized by biofiltration de vera et al 2016 the regulated dbps generally account for less than half of all the organic halide dbps formed by chlorination and over half of dbps were still unknown richardson 2003 in this decade several studies have shed light on unknown dbp by applied unknown screening analysis and reported occurrence of several hundred unknown dbps in drinking waters gonsior et al 2014 lavonen et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 phungsai et al 2018 not only reported over unknown 50 dbp features in two drinking waters in japan but also found some of ozone obps acted as unknown precursors even if de vera et al 2016 and fu et al 2017 reported that regulated dbp precursors could be decreased during biofiltration phungsai et al 2018 found many of unknown dbp precursors could escape from biological activated carbon filtration to water chlorination however the previous studies mostly show the fate of regulated dbp precursors or that of unknown dbps only in given conditions in some treatment plants hence the effects of different ozonation conditions and aops on dbp precursors and the formation of the other unknown dbps is still unclear and should be taken into account to control the overall risk of dbps this study aimed to provide insight into the effects of ozone and peroxone on molecular level dom and the consequential effects on formation of unknown dbps in chlorination for practical reasons we simulated the ozonation and peroxone effects and then conducted a laboratory scale chlorination experiment using coagulation sedimentation effluent from a full scale dwtp previously an orbitrap mass spectrometry orbitrap ms with unknown screening analysis has been successfully used for molecular level characterization of dom and determination of the formulae of unknown dbps formed after chlorination phungsai et al 2016 2018 and this analysis was used in this study changes in dom and molecular characteristics were elucidated by a semiquantitative approach the effects of oxidation treatments on formation of unknown dbps and putative precursors were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples and laboratory scale experiment the water samples were collected from a dwtp in tokyo in october 2015 the treatment processes used at this plant are coagulation sedimentation ozonation biological activated carbon filtration and rapid sand filtration at the time of the sampling an ozone gas dosage of 0 57 mg of o3 per liter mg o3 l was constantly diffused into the water for 15 min and the ozonated water was retained for a further 15 min without ozone diffusion chlorination was performed with dosages of 0 7 and 0 1 mg of cl2 per liter mg cl2 l as free chlorine before and after rapid sand filtration respectively samples of the raw water and after each treatment process were collected in 2 l pre combusted 550 c 4 h glass bottles the samples were stored at 5 c before further analyses coagulation sedimentation effluent was used for laboratory oxidation experiments the oxidation treatment experiments were conducted in a 6 l pre combusted glass reactor fig s1a to stimulate actual drinking water treatment condition none of chemical buffer was not added to the samples and ph level of the samples was 6 8 before ozonation and chlorination the temperature was controlled at 20 c using a water bath with a temperature controller ncb 1200 tokyo rikakikai tokyo japan ozone was generated from high purity oxygen gas using an ozone generator ozsd 3000a ebara jitsugyo co ltd tokyo japan ozone gas was supplied to the water samples by a porous glass diffuser at a constant rate of 1 l min for 15 min in all the experiments the concentration of ozone in the gas stream was calibrated using an ozone monitor eg 550 ebara jitsugyo co ltd two ozone dosages 1 mg o3 l and 4 mg o3 l in gas stream fig s1b were selected for use in this study because they are practical for use in full scale dwtps after 15 min of ozone diffusion the water samples were retained for another 15 min with constant mixing by a magnetic stirrer to simulate actual treatment conditions for the aop experiment while 4 mg o3 l was continuously supplied to the water samples a 302 5 mg of h2o2 per liter solution was simultaneously supplied at 3 33 ml per minute within 15 min of ozone diffusion time to achieve 2 5 mg h2o2 l with a molar ratio of o3 to h2o2 of 3 5 the h2o2 solution was supplied by a peristaltic pump perista pump sj 1211h atto co japan oxidation treatment with 2 5 mg

after 24 h incubation for the chlorination experiments 2 l of the samples were used the water samples were chlorinated by dosing with sodium hypochlorite to achieve 1 2 mg cl2 l as the initial free chlorine concentration followed by incubation at 20 c in the dark for 24 h boyer and singer 2005 a sample of coagulation sedimentation effluent without oxidation treatment was also chlorinated by the same method to compare the effects with and without oxidation treatment on dbp formation all the experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 2 water sample analyses total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations were measured by the non purgeable organic carbon method using a total organic carbon analyzer toc lcsh shimadzu tokyo japan the uv absorbance at 254 nm was evaluated

unknown screening analysis the water samples were filtered through a pre combusted glass fiber filter gf 75 advantec toyo japan to remove particulate matter dom in the filtered samples was extracted by solid phase extraction spe using a bond elute ppl cartridge agilent technologies santa clara ca which contained 1 g of polar functionalized polystyrene divinylbenzene one liter of the filtered

milli q water ph 2 the acidified samples were supplied to the cartridge at a flow rate of 20 ml min then the cartridge was rinsed with 10 ml of acidified milli q water followed by elution with 10 ml of methanol milli q water and the chlorinated milli q with the identical free chlorine dosage with the experiment were extracted with the same spe method to eliminate artifact chlorinated molecules from the reaction of sorbent with chlorine and used as a control an orbitrap ms exactive thermo fisher scientific waltham ma with electrospray ionization was applied for screening of unknowns in this study the extracts were analyzed by flow injection analysis with a methanol mobile phase liquid chromatography ms grade at a flow rate of 200 μl min the analysis was performed in negative ion mode with a spray current of 4 5 kv and full scan m z range of 100 1000 the analysis was not conducted in positive ion mode because of the complex mass spectra of sodium adducts which affected assignment

conditions were as described by phungsai et al 2016 background subtraction peak integration and component extraction from high resolution mass spectra were performed using sieve software thermo fisher scientific peak integration also included adduct removal and isotope confirmation 13c12cn 1 of each component for oxidation experiments only peaks which detected in both duplicate samples were further analyzed the list of peak integrated components were obtained from the software unequivocal molecular formulae schymanski et al 2014 were obtained from a compound identification algorithm kujawinski and behn 2006 kujawinski et al 2009 using the following numbers of atoms c0 39 h0 72 o0 20 n0 2 s0 2 and cl0 3 the identification by the algorithm included formula identification by the best fit within mass error less than 2 ppm and functional group extension with mass error less than 5 ppm as described in kujawinski and behn 2006 the lowest mass error formulae with the lowest number of n s was prioritized as this identification function was validated with synthetic compounds kujawinski and behn 2006 kujawinski et al 2009 assigned formulae were further validated by seven golden rules kind and fiehn 2007 additionally only formulae with dbe o calculated using eq 2 between 10 and 10 herzsprung et al 2014 were used in this study for cl containing features the numbers of chlorine atoms were validated using the intensity of 37cl peak those assigned formula dom peaks were referred as features in this study an intensity change of over 30 was used as the criterion to examine semiquantitative changes of dom in the unknowns screening this criterion was set based on the degree of intensity deviation of the orbitrap ms with 95 of the peak intensities deviating by 30 phungsai et al 2016 2018 hence changes were categorized into three groups decomposed unchanged and new obps formed the decomposed group included features that showed intensity decreases of 30 after oxidation whereas the unchanged or refractory group contained features that showed intensity changes of 30 after treatment it should be noted that a sample could contain at the same time compounds that were decreased and others which has identical formula to the decrease ones that were formed those features with intensity increases of 30 or that were newly formed after oxidation treatments were classed as obps 2 4 calculations principal component analysis pca was applied to examine differences among the water samples using their peak intensities using spss software ibm armonk ny molecular formulae of dom were converted to molecular characteristics plots of the oxygen subtracted double bond equivalents per carbon dbe o c in eq 3 and carbon oxidation state cos in eq 4 were used as indicators of the degrees of unsaturation and oxidation respectively in addition kendrick mass km plots on the ch2 scale were applied to extrapolate changes in dom in different homologous series kim et al 2003 stenson et al 2003 this ch2 scale km analysis has been widely used for dom in environmental analyses because dom commonly contains series of alkylated homologs the km plots depict differences in the number of ch2 groups with the nominal km da on the x axis eq 5 and the members of a homologous series with the same km defect kmd on the y axis eq 6 the formulae on the same horizontal line same kmd are those in a homologous series or with identical core structures all these molecular characterizations were applied only for dom features containing carbon oxygen and hydrogen cho features this was the main focus in this study because of the abundance 70 of all identified compounds in terms of both number and intensity based distributions fig s2 2 dbe o 1 0 5 2c h o 3 dbe o c 1 0 5 2c h o c 4

water samples before and after treatments are shown in table 1 the dosed ozone was efficiently consumed as residual ozone was below 0 15 mg l in all experiments the changes in the doc concentrations by dwtp ozonation and 1 mg o3 l in the laboratory experiment were negligible as it was under deviation of measurement at 0 1 mg of carbon per liter mg c l a reduction of 0 2 mg c l was observed after treatment with 4 mg o3 l and the aop and may indicate that dom mineralization occurred by these two oxidation conditions the suva values decreased by more than 65 after treatment with 4 mg o3 l and the aop and by around 50 after treatment with 1 mg o3 l these results indicated that decomposition of carbon double bonds in organic molecules and formation of saturated molecules occurred with oxidation treatments in addition higher ozone dosage or the aop induced more changes to dom by increasing hydrophilicity these observations are consistent with mineralization of dom and reduction in the suva values which have been reported by ratpukdi et al 2010 and lamsal et al 2011 the doc and suva values of the sample after treatment with 1 mg o3 l were of the same magnitude as those for the water sample collected after ozonation in the dwtp changes observed in doc and suva with h2o2 treatment were only minor after 24 h of chlorination the changes of doc levels were almost negligible while the suva values decreased by over 30 in all the water samples these unchanged doc vales and consistent reduction of the suva indicators in all the chlorinated samples indicates decomposition of unsaturated dom and production of saturated dom by chlorination without mineralization the doc recovery from coagulation effluent on the spe cartridge was almost 60 whereas the doc recoveries after ozone or h2o2 oxidations were around 40 49 table 1 this doc recovery level was similar to several other studies gonsior et al 2014 li et al 2017 phungsai et al 2018 the lowest doc recovery around 27 was observed after aop treatment the reduced doc recovery and suva values after oxidation treatment indicated low recovery of saturated dom as obps with oxidation treatment hence some of the obps might be missing in the following analyses the doc recoveries of the samples after chlorination were at the same level as before chlorination table 1 only a fraction of recovered dom ionized by esi and lower than 1000 da were analyzed in this study 3 2 comparison of the cho features we used pca to statistically evaluate the experimental reproducibility and differences among the oxidation treatments using the peak intensities of the cho features for each sample fig 1 the results of duplicate experiments were clustered within a short distance indicating good experimental reproducibility the ozonation and aop showed considerable differences among the cho features compared with the coagulation sedimentation effluent and the sample after treatment with 2 5 mg h2o2 l which were clustered within short distances this observation suggested that the effect of 2 5 mg h2o2 l on the cho features was only minor compared with that of ozonation and the aop dwtp ozonation was very close to the laboratory scale treatment with 1 mg o3 l showing these oxidation conditions were similar in addition we found over 900 cho features showed similar changes decomposed unchanged and produced after dwtp ozonation and the laboratory scale treatment with 1 mg o3 l table 2 accounting for 91 8 of the total cho features this semiquantitative analysis was consistent with the pca results and doc suva results table 1 hence the laboratory scale experiment with 1 mg o3 l could simulate ozonation in the full scale dwtp increasing the ozone dosage to 4 mg o3 l resulted in larger difference among the cho features as seen in the pca results fig 1 doc and suva results table 1 although over 80 of the cho features underwent the same changes at the different ozone dosages table 2 for the other 20 decomposition of over 100 cho features and production of around 100 more cho obps occurred at the higher ozone dosage in addition the aop results were distanced differently to the ozonated water samples fig 1 this could be attributed to decomposition of more cho features by the aop than with ozone treatment only table 2 the more effective oxidation by the aop than ozone could be induced by the reaction of oh with cho features the lower ozone concentration in the water with 4 mg o3 l 2 5 mg h2o2 l treatment compared with 4 mg o3 l treatment also supported formation of oh fig s3 fewer obp features were formed by the aop than with ozone treatment only table 2 this may be partly caused by formation of compounds that are more difficult to recover by the spe treatment which would decrease the doc recovery table 1 it is also possible that the aop obps have lower molecular weights than under our analytical conditions for example we found that the levels of low molecular weight carboxylic acids which are well known ozone and aop obps formed after the aop were lower than after ozonation table 1 and separate low molecular weight carboxylic acids shown in fig s4 3 3 dom decomposition and obp formation by oxidation to reveal differences in the effects of the oxidation treatments changes in the cho features with the oxidation treatments were plotted against the degree of unsaturation dbe o c and carbon oxidation state cos fig 2 and each oxidation condition shown separately in fig s5 most of the cho features decomposed by ozonation had positive dbe o c fig 2a this finding indicates selective reaction of ozone with the features containing unsaturated double bonds this selective reaction at carbon double bonds or activated aromatic rings is well known von gunten 2003a an increase in the ozone dosage further decomposed some cho features with lower cos fig 2a and also some of those with negative dbe o c this implies efficiency of higher ozone dose on decomposition of more saturated molecules compared with ozonation the aop could decompose additional features with more negative dbe o c and cos which were refractory to ozone fig 2b this additional decomposition could arise from the oh reaction with more saturated organic molecules these observations imply that we could extend the oxidation efficiency to saturated organic molecules by increasing the ozone dosage or adding h2o2 to promote advanced oxidation by oh most of the obps formed after both ozone conditions were only relatively saturated negative dbe o c with a wide range of cos fig 2c some of obps specifically formed by 1 mg o3 l were found at negative cos values while those obps specifically formed by 4 mg o3 l were relatively higher cos this implies formation of more oxidized obps when applied higher ozone dosage in some extent compared with obps produced by the 4 mg o3 l treatment the aop produced saturated negative dbe o c and highly oxidized obps positive cos fig 2d this could be partly attributed to the decomposition of the cho features with negative dbe o c and cos values blue dots in fig 2b by the aop these observations on the decomposition of unsaturated cho features and formation of saturated obps in oxidation treatment are consistent with the reduction observed in the suva results after ozone treatment km analyses were applied to compare decomposition with the oxidation treatments fig 3 and changes with each treatment shown separately in fig s6 ozone preferentially reacted with cho features in some alkylation homologs fig 3a it is important to note that these ozone reactive homologs would contain carbon double bonds as most of those decomposed by ozone reaction had positive dbe o c the differences on oxidations among homologs would be explained by functional group substituents on their structure the homologs decomposed by ozonation e g line a in fig 3a could contain electron donating substituents e g oh or o and ch2 which make carbon double bonds rich in electron density other refractory homologs e g line c in fig 3a could have electron withdrawing substituents e g cho cor cooh and coor that should be less reactive with ozone in ozone reactive homologs cho features with smaller nominal kms which could have fewer ch2 groups were decomposed by both ozone conditions e g line d in fig 3a it was obvious that a higher ozone dosage could decompose not only features with fewer ch2 groups but also those with more ch2 groups line d in fig 3a these observations suggest that for this homolog features with fewer ch2 groups were more reactive to ozone oxidation than those with more ch2 groups by contrast the opposite was observed for some other homologous series e g lines b and e in fig 3a the formula containing the most ch2 groups in this homolog was decomposed by a low ozone dosage whereas features with fewer ch2 groups were decomposed with the higher ozone dosage one possible explanation for this is that there might be less electron density at the reactive bonds of features with fewer ch2 groups because of electron withdrawing substituents whereas the electron withdrawing effects in features with more ch2 groups might be reduced because of the electron donating efficiency of ch2 when the 4 mg o3 l treatment was compared with the aop fig 3b we found the aop could decompose both cho features which were decomposed by ozone e g lines a d and e in fig 3b and react with the features that were not decomposed by ozone e g lines b and c in fig 3b the oxidation by aop could extend to features in the homologs containing fewer ch2 groups line b in fig 3b the cho obps formed after oxidation treatments were also analyzed by km fig 4 it was clear that many homologous alkyl obps were produced by ozonation fig 4a between both ozone conditions some of obps with low numbers of ch2 groups and some with 500 da were only formed in the 4 mg o3 l treatment while some obps specifically formed by 1 mg o3 l were found containing the most ch2 in the homologous alkyl obps the observations imply additional formation of high molecular weight obp homologs and formation of less ch2 obps in some homologs by increasing of ozone dosage comparison of the 4 mg o3 l and aop treatments showed that obps with fewer ch2 were produced by both the ozone and aop treatments whereas obps with more ch2 chains were only produced by the 4 mg o3 l treatment fig 4b comparing oxidation efficiencies of each condition with formation of obps revealed by dbe o c vs cos and km analyses increasing oxidation efficiencies by increasing ozone dose or the aop produce obps with lower molecular weight or fewer ch2 in the homologs with higher oxidation states this is consistent with results of low molecular weight carboxylic acids table 1 and fig s4 3 4 effects of the oxidation treatments on unknown dbp formation after 24 h of chlorination the residual chlorine concentration were 0 53 0 53 0 58 and 0 16 mgcl2 l for the chlorinated samples with no ozonation 1 mg o3 l 4 mg o3 l and 4 mg o3 l 2 5 mg h2o2 l respectively the intensities of several hundred cho features were decreased over 30 after chlorination and those of less than a hundred cho features were either increased or newly formed table s1 by contrast 50 100 of the chlorinated cho features chocl were new or increased by 30 in each chlorinated sample fig 5 a those features were classed as dbps in this study table s2 both the number and intensity based levels of dbps in the chlorinated sample previously treated with 1 mg o3 l 0 97 mg of o3 per milligram of carbon were larger than those for the chlorinated sample without oxidation chlorinated coagulation effluent or the samples from the other oxidation treatments these results imply that unlike well known dbps the potential for formation of unknown dbps can be enhanced by ozonation with approximately 1 mg of o3 per milligram of carbon dbp formation was reduced when a higher ozone dosage was applied but it was still higher than the dbp formation in the chlorinated coagulation effluent no oxidation treatment these observations show it is important to consider unknown dbps because they can behave differently from regulated dbps it is also important to select an ozone dosage that minimizes dbp formation in the chlorination step compared with ozonation the aop resulted in the lowest dbp formation in terms of both number and intensity lamsal et al 2011 consistently found peroxone treatment reduced formation potential of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids more than o3 treatment in contrast de vera et al 2015 reported increasing of all regulated dbps except trihalonitromethanes after adding h2o2 during ozonation however those regulated dbps precursors were found to be effectively minimized by biofiltration de vera et al 2016 fu et al 2017 as shown in fig 6 a several unique dbp were formed in each oxidation treatment effects of oxidation treatments on dbp precursors might be different among water samples and optimal conditions would be importantly required to minimize formation of dbp precursors in addition fate of unknown dbp precursors during biofiltration would be different and need to be further investigated as many of them could not be removed during biofiltration phungsai et al 2018 the smaller numbers of dbps detected in the chlorinated sample pre treated by aop in this study could also be because of the lower doc recovery compared with other samples as dom after oxidation by oh radical or chlorine would be more hydrophilic other spe cartridge that specifically target highly hydrophilic molecules would recover such fraction of dom knowing the molecular features of dbps allows us to track their putative precursors via well known chlorination reactions such as electrophilic substitution by displacing the cl atoms with h atoms in dbp features the molecular features of electrophilic substitution type putative precursors can be obtained dbps whose precursors cannot be found could originate from other chlorine reactions such as oxidation or addition reactions or decomposition of molecules with higher masses among the chlorinated cho 49 features were commonly formed in all the oxidation pre treated samples and also the sample without pre oxidation fig 6a and other heteroatom dbps shown in table s3 we could detect 33 of the putative electrophilic substitution precursors of these 49 dbps fig 6b many of the dbps and their putative precursors were found in all of the samples this suggested that those precursors were refractory to oxidation treatments but reactive to chlorination it is also possible that they were produced by the oxidation treatments as the levels of most of them increased after the oxidation treatments table s4 this is consistent with our previous reports phungsai et al 2016 2018 ozone only treatment and the aop also produced some unique dbp precursors fig 6b which resulted in formation of unique dbps in the samples pre treated by the oxidation treatments fig 6a this study demonstrates the molecular characteristics of dom decomposed by treatments with different ozone dosage and an aop the findings emphasize the importance of selection of oxidation conditions and removal of remaining obps before chlorination our results also demonstrate the applicability of the orbitrap ms for determination of unknown dbps and their precursors this approach shows potential for comprehensive monitoring of both dbps and their precursors at full scale dwtps and other micro organic pollutants hollender et al 2017 van leerdam et al 2014 it is important to note that some of obps and dbps were missing in this study as those were not able to be recovered by spe they might be recovered if another spe sorbents such as those especially target hydrophilic compounds are additionally employed in addition direct injection of larger sample volume would be a potential way to avoid dom loss in the spe step olaf et al 2014 sleighter et al 2009 if we could sacrifice sensitivity of the analysis analysis with chromatographic column and ms ms would provide more valuable data through structure estimation merel et al 2017 to evaluate potential toxicity of dbps via qualitative structure activity relationship matsushita et al 2016 or toxicities tests via authentic standards stalter et al 2013 however selection of chromatographic column suitable to wide variety of complex dom would be another challenge to avoid irreversible adsorption on the column itself 4 conclusion reduction of suva values by all the oxidation treatments indicated decomposition of dissolved organic matter dom to become more saturated molecules and mineralization were found only at 4 mg o3 l and aop 4 mgo3 l 2 5 mg h2o2 l by over 0 2 mgc l 24 h chlorination at 1 2 mg cl2 l further decreased suva values while doc level remained unchanged ozone selectively decomposed cho features with positive dbe o c or unsaturated molecules the increase of ozone dosage promoted decomposition of the features with more saturated molecules more negative dbe o c and with less oxidized character more negative cos kendrick mass analysis indicated decomposition of cho features by ozone selectively took place with some alkylation homologs while increasing ozone dosage could promote decomposition of fewer or more ch2 in the homologs aop could additionally decompose the features with more saturated and lower oxidation state negative dbe o c and cos some ch2 features which were resistant to ozone could be decomposed by aop over 500 cho oxidation by products obps features were found after oxidation treatments by 1 mg o3 l or 4 mg o3 l while numbers of obps features formed after aop were less higher oxidation efficiencies by higher ozone dose or aop generated obps with lower molecular weights fewer ch2 in the obp homologs with higher oxidation states pre treatment by ozone rather increased the formation of unknown dbps after chlorination in terms of both number and intensity while the aop could decrease the number of unknown dbps formed after chlorination pre treatment by each oxidation also formed unique dbp precursors resulting in the formation of specific unknown dbps for each condition acknowledgements this research was funded by the core research for

18777,anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria convert ammonium and nitrite into n2 in a chemolithoautotrophic way meaning that they utilize co2 hco3 solely as their carbon sources such autotrophic behavior limits their competitiveness with heterotrophic microorganisms in both natural environments and engineered systems recently environmental metagenomic results have indicated the capability of anammox bacteria to metabolize short chain fatty acids further confirmed by limited experimental evidence based on highly enriched cultures however clear evidence is difficult to get because of the limits of traditional methodologies which rely on the availability of a pure anammox culture in this study we identified and quantified the uptake of acetate and propionate on a single cell level by an anammox consortium that was dominated by candidatus jettenia asiatica relative abundance of 96 the consortium growing in granular form with an average relative abundance of anammox bacteria of 96 0 was firstly incubated in a13c labelled acetate or propionate medium then microtome sections were scanned by a nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometer nanosims the nanosims scannings revealed that the consortium enriched acetate and propionate at a 10 times higher efficiency than bicarbonate incorporation our results also suggest that acetate or propionate was likely not assimilated by j asiatica directly but firstly oxidized to co2 which then served as carbon sources for the follow up autotrophy in j asiatica cells furthermore more 15n ammonium was enriched by the propionate fed consortium than the acetate fed consortium despite that exactly the same amount of 13c atoms were supplied our study strongly indicates an alternative lifestyle namely organotrophy in addition to chemolithoautotrophy of anammox bacteria making it more versatile than often expected it suggests that the niche of anammox bacteria in both natural and engineered ecosystems can be much broader than usual assumed recognising this is important for their role in wastewater treatment and the global nitrogen turn over rates graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox acetate propionate 1 introduction energy efficient wastewater treatment eewt processes are currently intensively studied for both environmental and economic considerations an autotrophic anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process for nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater is known as the mainstream anammox which has been confirmed to be an eewt process in labs and holds a substantial potential in future large scale applications however the mainstream anammox is challenged by several issues such as a high bod5 n ratio in the wastewater competition from heterotrophic denitrifiers and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob for nitrite strict temperature requirements and slow growth rates of anammox bacteria a microorganism s mixotrophic lifestyle is a selective advantage in nature and such capability is especially important to species that are critical to global nutrient cycles matin 1978 versatile lifestyles have been discovered in microbial cells because of the development of observation power hawley et al 2014 rother and metcalf 2004 which expanded our knowledge on microbial functionality and niche anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria are capable of coupling ammonium and nitrite to form nitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions kuenen 2008 they are critical players in the global nitrogen cycle canfield et al 2010 kuypers et al 2003 ward 2013 zhu et al 2013 and have been successfully exploited to treat wastewater kartal et al 2010 most anammox species such as kuenenia stuttgartiensis jettenia asiatica brocadia fulgida and scalindua profunda use inorganic carbon to synthesize organic molecules via a wood ljungdahl pathway also known as reductive acetyl coa pathway gori et al 2011 hu et al 2012 rather than generating energy this route requires high energy input which is available from the hydrazine metabolism kartal et al 2011 as the energy release via acetate oxidation coupled to nitrite reduction is close to that of the anammox process 359 8 kj vs 357 8 kj standard gibbs free energy for each process calculated at ph 7 0 temperature 25 c air pressure 101 325 pa gao and tao 2011 it is of interest to evaluate if anammox bacteria can convert organic matter for cell growth understanding of this conversion might give insight into some essential eco technical questions such as whether anammox bacteria can survive or have an competitive advantage in an environment where organic matter is sufficient but lacks co2 babbin et al 2014 or is an industrial anammox process applicable in a mainstream wastewater treatment kartal et al 2010 an organotrophic alternative has been proposed strous et al 2006 and shown in laboratory settings kartal et al 2007 2008 two organotrophic species i e candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus candidatus brocadia fulgida have been indicated to oxidize short chain fatty acids into co2 which is then assimilated via an acetyl coa pathway that is predominant in the autotrophic anammox bacteria schouten et al 2004 however there have been very limited follow up studies and the organotrophic lifestyle of anammox bacteria is underexplored the discovery of an organotrophic lifestyle by anammox bacteria is often challenged by interference from heterotrophic microorganisms that co exist in any anammox consortium direct observation of organotrophic processes on a single cell level could deliver profound information about the actual physiology anammox bacteria however such studies are scarce by far in recent years nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims has enabled to gain an in depth view of microbiology for example to track microbial interactions and to study microbial metabolic activities kopf et al 2015 musat et al 2012 2016 in this study we used a nanosims to visualize and quantify the incorporation of 13c labelled acetate and propionate by a highly enriched anammox consortium that was dominated by candidatus jettenia asiatica hu et al 2012 this microorganism has not yet been reported relating to organotrophy the results that were based on 279 scans of 4885 cells strongly indicated that the anammox consortium incorporated acetate and propionate at a rate even higher than the uptake rate of bicarbonate in a mainstream anammox system organic matter present in wastewater plays a key role in governing the balance between anammox bacteria and heterotrophic microorganisms such as denitrifying bacteria although it has been accepted that anammox bacteria are protected by heterotrophs when organic carbon is present li et al 2016 our study confirms that anammox bacteria are capable of dealing with organic matters by their own the niche of anammox bacteria in engineered ecosystems can therefore be much broader than general assumed it also reminds us that their actual contribution to the global nitrogen turnover warrants more exploration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design in this study we firstly harvested relatively mature anammox granules from a 70 m3 full scale anammox reactor it is located at the sludge treatment site sluisjesdijk rotterdam nl which treats the sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant dokhaven its actual loading was on average 700 kg n d following a nitritation reactor van der star et al 2007 then we cultivated the anammox granules in a well controlled lab scale reactor for further enrichment of anammox bacteria a highly enriched anammox consortium was then achieved facilitating the next step cultivations in different carbon sources labelled with isotopic 13c a nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims was used to visualize and quantify the incorporation of those isotopic element signals based on the scannings of a large number of cells in different incubations fig 1 2 2 enrichment of j asiatica an expanded granular sludge bed egsb is a typical high efficiency bioreactor used for wastewater treatment under anaerobic conditions connelly et al 2017 the 1 2 l egsb was inoculated with anammox aggregates that were obtained from a full scale anammox bioreactor that treated centrifuged sludge digestate the influent flow rate was 13 2 l d which corresponded to hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 82 h an up flow velocity of 4 8 m h was maintained by bulk circulation in order to keep granulation the temperature was controlled at 34 1 c using a heating jacket the medium was sparged with a gas mixture of n2 and co2 95 and 5 respectively for 20 min after each time of preparation in order to remove oxygen the primary sources of the medium were nh4 2so4 5 14 mm and nano2 5 17 5 mm the medium also contained the following compounds per 1 l demineralized water khco3 1000 mg kh2po4 27 2 mg mgso4 7h2o 240 mg cacl2 300 mg and trace element solution i and ii 1 ml respectively prepared according to van de graaf et al 1996 the ph of the fresh medium was 7 6 0 3 without neutralization the feeding for the egsb was shut down for 48 h before collecting consortium samples allowing the removal of the residual ammonium nitrite and bicarbonate in bulk 2 3 medium the isotope medium contained 13c and 15n labelled chemicals that were supplied by cambridge isotope laboratories tewksbury ma usa the oxygen free medium was prepared using ultra pure water and sparged with n2 gas 99 99 purity for 30 min in an anaerobic glove box resazurin was used as an anaerobic indicator in the medium eight groups of experiments were carried out with seven group 1 7 applying 2 0 mm 15n ammonium and 2 0 mm 14n nitrite as nitrogen sources and one group 8 using 2 0 mm 15n nitrate only table 1 for each incubation a total of 2 5 μmol 13c atoms were supplied no matter in bicarbonate acetate or propionate forms group 1 mimicked a typical anammox process with 13c bicarbonate as the sole carbon source the group 2 5 applied acetate centred carbon sources including 1 13c acetate group 2 2 13c acetate group 3 13c bicarbonate 12c acetate group 4 and 13c bicarbonate 2 13c acetate group 5 group 6 and 7 applied propionate centred carbon sources including 1 13c propionate group 6 13c bicarbonate 12c propionate group 7 2 13c acetate was used in group 8 in order to check the contribution of heterotrophic bacteria e g denitrifying bacteria in the consortium 2 4 incubation for each incubation 4 5 anammox granules were randomly selected to incubate in a 12 ml hungate tube a volume of 5 ml media was added to each tube triplicate incubations were done for each group and gently shaken at 30 c in the dark anaerobically the incubations were ended by dosing 200 μl of 8 m zncl2 solution after 30 s 5 min 10 min 20 min 1 h 20 h and 15 d respectively the reason for applying frequent sampling within the first hour is to avoid missing the endings of reactions especially the rapid nitrogen conversions the 20 h and 15 d incubations were also carried out in order to allow a complete cell cycle as the doubling time of anammox bacteria can be as long as 1 2 weeks jetten et al 1998 van niftrik and jetten 2012 for the 15 day incubations 0 5 ml supernatants of the original medium were replaced for every three days by the concentrated medium that contained 20 mm 15nh4cl and na14no2 respectively while no such replacement of medium being done to the other incubations 2 5 dna extraction the anammox granules samples were taken from egsb reactors and stored at 80 c until the dna extraction the granules were washed with 1 phosphate buffer saline pbs solution and then centrifuged at 7000 g for 7 min the supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed with the same pbs solution for the second time and centrifuged under 17 000 g for 20 min the supernatant was removed and the pellet was used for the dna extraction the dna isolation was performed using a uniq 10 dna isolation kit sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china as per the manufacturer s instructions the dna isolation was confirmed by an agarose gel electrophoresis the quality of dna was verified by a nanodrop 1000 equipment thermo scientific waltham ma usa 2 6 qpcr the number of anammox bacteria was tested by an sybr green qpcr method the reaction mixture

an accelerating high voltage of 8 kv a mass resolution power of 7000 m m 10 definition was applied enough to eliminate isobaric interference of 13c by 12c1h and 12c15n by 12c14n1h samples were pre sputtered with a primary cs beam of 1 na for 2 min in order to remove the gold coat and achieve stable yield rates of the secondary ions after pre sputtering secondary ion images of 12c 13c 12c14n for

image shift and then accumulated into a single image two randomly selected areas of each sample were analyzed to ensure proper surface electric conduction 2 11 nanosims image processing all the nanosims scans were analyzed using the software openmims an open source imagej plugin that is supported by the national resource for imaging mass spectrometry http www nrims hms harvard edu all the analysis was done under pc windows environment the quantification of 15n and 13c incorporation were determined by selecting those regions of interest rois that were defined manually following three strict criteria 1 the sizes of the targeted cells were in the range of 800 1200 nm 2 the cells were coccoid or coccoid like shape van niftrik and jetten 2012 and 3 the 15n 14n hotspots can well wedge into the web like distributions of 31p precipitants which are highly expected to be excreted by anammox bacteria for δ13c and δ15n data processing the 15n 14n and 13c 12c values of the anammox granules that were cultivated for 30 s were used as the standard for calculation and calibration the δ value was calculated as δ rsample rstandard 1 where rsample stands for isotopic ratios of 13c 12c and 15n 14n and rstandard is the 13c 12c and 15n 14n values of the samples after 30s incubation 3 results 3 1 the enrichment of j asiatica in the cultivation bioreactor the enrichment of j asiatica was carried out in an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor that was fed with a standard medium for cultivating anammox bacteria fig 1 no organic matter was added to the egsb red colored granule like aggregates were formed in the egsb and the size of granules increased to and stabilized at 1 2 mm during the cultivation fig 2 a some granules contained interstitial voids fig s1 that might serve as water or gas channels benefitting to mass transportation lu et al 2012 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis confirmed that the microbial consortium was dominated by anammox bacteria with a mean relative abundance of 96 0 fig 2b identified as j asiatica by 16s rrna sequencing genbank kj002641 1 a classic anammox cell architecture and compartmentalization were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem fig 2c clearly showing anammoxosome as the central organelle van niftrik et al 2008 the ammonium oxidation capacity of the egsb increased by approximately ten times after a long term operation figs 1 and 2d meanwhile the qpcr analysis showed that the hzo gene copy numbers of the egsb biomass increased by over five orders of magnitude fig 2d the hzo gene encodes for the enzyme hydrazine oxidoreductase converting hydrazine to n2 li et al 2011 pitcher et al 2011 which is a unique metabolic process specific for anammox bacteria kartal et al 2011 the ratio of the consumed nitrite to the consumed ammonium stabilized in the range of 1 30 1 37 while the ratio of the produced nitrate to the consumed ammonium was consistently in the range of 0 20 0 25 both of which agreed with known anammox stoichiometry walter et al 1999 3 2 classic anammox reaction intense incorporation of 15n coming from 15n ammonium by the consortium was identified by nanosims after only 10 min of incubation but soon decreased in the control group that mimics a typical anammox reaction group 1 fig 3 b the weak signal of 15n was very likely due to the formation of 15n2 which escaped from the cytoplasm easily this result strongly indicated that ammonium oxidation was very efficient in the consortium taking place even within several minutes the short term incubations 5 60 min of group 1 exhibited minimal enrichment of 13c while a 2 4 times higher uptake of 13c was observed in the 20 h and 15 day incubations fig 3a according to our nanosims analysis of the 20 h incubation the ratio of δ13c δ15n was 21 1000 which was similar to a previous report that showed a stoichiometry of 20 mmol co2 incorporations per mol ammonium consumption strous et al 1999 for group 8 that mimicked a typical denitrification reaction with 15n nitrate as electron acceptor and 2 13c acetate as electron donors table 1 we confirmed the presence of 100 cells which was suggested from the observation of matrix rings according to the 31p nanosims scans which indicated the existence of lipid bilayers fig s2c however we could observe only two 15n signals fig s2b and extremely weak incorporation of 2 13c acetate fig s3 since strong incorporation of 2 13c acetate would occur if heterotrophic microorganisms were abundant in the consortium our findings of very low incorporation of 2 13c acetate suggested that a very low fraction of heterotrophs e g denitrifying bacteria could be present 3 3 acetate and propionate engaged anammox processes the cells in the 2 13c acetate added group 3 and the 1 13c propionate added group 6 groups enriched acetate and propionate respectively according to the nanosims scans fig 4 furthermore the 13c signals distributed across a large area of individual cells rather than a particular location figs 4a and 5a the nanosims images of a single cell fig 5 and fig s4 dividing cells fig s5 and fig s6 and multiple cells fig s7 and fig s8 consistently suggested that the highly enriched 13c region well matched to the 15n hot zones pearson correlation values range 0 853 0 947 figs 4a 5a and g 5h which likely were anammoxosome dietl et al 2015 higher enrichment of 15n and 13c can be seen in the 15 day incubations compared to short ones fig 6 for the 15 day incubations the propionate fed consortium incorporated more 13c than the acetate fed one and all the organic carbon groups group 2 7 enriched more 13c than the control group group 1 fig 6 for the 20 min and 1 h incubations the 13c incorporation was not significantly different among each group except for group 6 which was fed with 1 13c propionate the 15n incorporation of each incubation was also in a similar level except for the 1 13c acetate added group group 2 which was significantly higher than the others the addition of unlabelled acetate group 4 or propionate group 7 boosted the incorporation of 13c by 70 and 27 times compared to the incorporation in the control group group 1 after 15 d incubation fig 6 the time courses of the acetate and propionate aid 13c bicarbonate assimilation showed that the incorporation was not significant within 20 h but was evident on day 15 fig s9a and s9c the nitrogen incorporation also had similar trends fig s9b and s9d it was a strange phenomenon and might be linked to unknown pathways of j asiatica in the presence of acetate or propionate 4 discussion 4 1 is there a heterotrophic anammox conversion heterotrophs are those organisms that require organic substrates as a carbon source for growth claassens et al 2016 in our study j asiatica was proven to be able to take up acetate and propionate a core question followed will be obvious did they utilize those short chain fatty acids for forming biomass of their own for growth if j asiatica carried out a heterotrophic anammox process the 13c labeling position on the methyl group 2 1 13c acetate added group or carboxyl group 3 2 13c acetate added group carbon of acetate would result in no differences in terms of the eventual 13c incorporation however we found significantly higher 13c enrichment in the 2 13c acetate added group group 3 than that in the 1 13c acetate added group group 2 after 15 days fig 6 it indicated that the acetate or propionate was likely not assimilated by j asiatica directly but oxidized to co2 which then served as carbon sources for the follow up autotrophic growth of j asiatica it still warrants more experimental work to confirm a metabolic pathway behind the organic carbon utilization by j asiatica as we are still not able to completely rule out the possibility of j asiatica assimilating acetate or propionate from another perspective some genomic and proteomic discoveries indicate that some anammox bacteria might directly incorporate acetate into their cell biomass for example carbon monoxide co dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthase acs is responsible for the co2 fixation and it is shared by many anammox species such as k stuttgartiensis s profunda j caeni and j asiatica muhammad et al 2015 oshiki et al 2016 the transcriptome and proteome of k stuttgartiensis the model species of anammox bacteria show high level genes encoding of pyruvate associated enzymes such as pyruvate oxidoreductase kuste4371 and pyruvate carboxylase kustd1409 kartal et al 2011 the metagenome of the marine anammox bacterium s profunda illustrates several genes encoding acetate kinase phosphotransacetylase pyruvate kinase and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase indicating a versatile carbon metabolism in situ van de vossenberg et al 2013 it has been found that acetate can be activated by an acetyl coa synthetase like protein kustc1128 in a heterologous host as well as whole cells of k stuttgartiensis russ et al 2012 such acetate activation might lead to the direct incorporation of acetate into cell biomass by anammox bacteria 4 2 different impacts of propionate and acetate on ammonium oxidation carbon is important to ammonium oxidation by j asiatica as a linear relationship can be found between the incorporation of 13c and 15n fig 7 if all the cells are considered cultivated in whatever media furthermore we found different impact of propionate and acetate on the incorporation of 15n in our study exactly the same amount of 13c atoms were supplied to all anammox cells but they tended to incorporate more 13c propionate than 13c acetate and accordingly more 15n ammonium was enriched by the propionate fed consortium than the acetate fed one fig 6 it has been reported that the specific rate of acetate oxidation is higher in b fulgida while a propionicus utilizes propionate faster jetten et al 2009 according to the molecular mechanism of ammonium and nitrite metabolism by anammox bacterium k stuttgartiensis kartal et al 2011 the generation of no and n2h4 requires a significant amount of electron equivalents eq 1 and 2 when acetate or propionate was oxidized to co2 firstly such oxidation would offer a large number of electrons for example the oxidation of acetate yields 8 electron equivalents while propionate yields 14 considering the very close relationship between 13c and 15n incorporation it is possible that these electrons are used to produce no and n2h4 as a compelling electron donor ideal for the reduction of co2 the oxidized product of acetate or propionate n2h4 supplied the reductive acetyl coa pathway with adequate electrons from the oxidation of n2h4 to n2 that yields 4 electrons eq 3 1 no2 2h e no h2o e0 0 38 v 2 no nh4 2h 3e n2h4 h2o e0 0 06 v 3 n2h4 n2 4h 4e e0 0 75 v 4 3 inspirations for future studies and applications nanosims is a powerful tool to study element enrichment in cells on a single cell level gao et al 2016 in our study the enrichment of 15n and 13c in j asiatica was intensively monitored by nanosims beside of that 31p and 56fe enrichment was also captured giving extra information e g on the composition of the eps matrix in anammox granules we found that the enrichment of 31p did not correlate to that of 13c and 15n but surprisingly highly correlated to 56fe enrichment fig s5 and s7 because most highly enriched 31p and 56fe zones are extracellular it is very likely that a substantial number of extracellular polymeric substance eps was formed with phosphate and iron enclosed cao et al 2011 d abzac et al 2013 which facilitated the forming of granules hou et al 2015 there also might be iron phosphate precipatation under suitable physio chemical conditions lin et al 2013 the signal strength indicating 31p and 56fe enrichment did not vary significantly along with incubation time but correlated with space strongly it is also expected that the study could benefit our understanding of an overall contribution of anammox bacteria in a mainstream anammox process first of all our results showed extremely efficient incorporation of ammonium by j asiatica taking place within 5 min and reaching to maximum in 10 min fig 3b such capability could enable j asiatica to be competitive against other ammonium dependent microorganisms secondly long term cultivation with acetate propionate may accelerate biomass formation of j asiatica cells as higher enrichment of 13c was observed after 15 days fig 6e which may help j asiatica sustain a dominant power in a community last and most importantly anammox bacteria might be less vulnerable than previously suggested in a mainstream environment the organic matter is inevitable in a mainstream anammox process and it is one of the critical factors balancing two microbial guilds i e anammox bacteria and denitrifying bacteria there have been some studies showing that 1 anammox bacteria are not vulnerable in the presence of low dose organic matters likely because of the protection by aerobic anaerobic heterotrophs and 2 anammox bacteria are unlikely to grow on organic matters in a mainstream anammox process for example it has been found that a higher ratio of bod5 tn in the influent of a mainstream anammox reactor resulted in higher nitrogen removing efficiency very likely due to the enhanced conventional denitrification cao et al 2016 it is also confirmed the growth of anammox bacteria in a mainstream anammox process and the anammox bacteria did not directly incorporate or store the radioactive labelled acetate or glucose in their studies laureni et al 2015 although our study confirmed the capability of anammox bacteria j asiatica incorporating acetate and propionate we do not clearly understand how they might compete with aerobic and or denitrification heterotrophs in a mainstream anammox environment it definitely requires further experimental studies to explain the following questions 1 is such organotrophic capability only specific to j asiatica or is it a versatility to all anammox species 2 will short chain fatty acids other than acetate and propionate also be incorporated under similar conditions 3 what are the evolutionary physiological and ecological reasons behind a detour metabolism of j asiatica s organotrophic lifestyle 4 is it feasible engineer truely heterotrophic anammox bacteria through the introduction of production pathways and the modification of autotrophic systems by genetic engineering 5 conclusions nanosims analysis of an inorganic organic incubated highly enriched anammox granular consortium reveals efficient incorporation of acetate and propionate although it is still an enigma how acetate and propionate are metabolized and how energy electrons flow in the cell the results offer essential insight to the versatility of anammox bacteria here the shown organotrophic but unlikely a heterotrophic lifestyle of anammox bacteria strongly supports a promising niche of anammox bacteria in a mainstream anammox process where organic matter is present follow up studies about how such versatility could enhance the growth of anammox bacteria are needed declaration of interests the

18777,anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria convert ammonium and nitrite into n2 in a chemolithoautotrophic way meaning that they utilize co2 hco3 solely as their carbon sources such autotrophic behavior limits their competitiveness with heterotrophic microorganisms in both natural environments and engineered systems recently environmental metagenomic results have indicated the capability of anammox bacteria to metabolize short chain fatty acids further confirmed by limited experimental evidence based on highly enriched cultures however clear evidence is difficult to get because of the limits of traditional methodologies which rely on the availability of a pure anammox culture in this study we identified and quantified the uptake of acetate and propionate on a single cell level by an anammox consortium that was dominated by candidatus jettenia asiatica relative abundance of 96 the consortium growing in granular form with an average relative abundance of anammox bacteria of 96 0 was firstly incubated in a13c labelled acetate or propionate medium then microtome sections were scanned by a nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometer nanosims the nanosims scannings revealed that the consortium enriched acetate and propionate at a 10 times higher efficiency than bicarbonate incorporation our results also suggest that acetate or propionate was likely not assimilated by j asiatica directly but firstly oxidized to co2 which then served as carbon sources for the follow up autotrophy in j asiatica cells furthermore more 15n ammonium was enriched by the propionate fed consortium than the acetate fed consortium despite that exactly the same amount of 13c atoms were supplied our study strongly indicates an alternative lifestyle namely organotrophy in addition to chemolithoautotrophy of anammox bacteria making it more versatile than often expected it suggests that the niche of anammox bacteria in both natural and engineered ecosystems can be much broader than usual assumed recognising this is important for their role in wastewater treatment and the global nitrogen turn over rates graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox acetate propionate 1 introduction energy efficient wastewater treatment eewt processes are currently intensively studied for both environmental and economic considerations an autotrophic anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process for nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater is known as the mainstream anammox which has been confirmed to be an eewt process in labs and holds a substantial potential in future large scale applications however the mainstream anammox is challenged by several issues such as a high bod5 n ratio in the wastewater competition from heterotrophic denitrifiers and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob for nitrite strict temperature requirements and slow growth rates of anammox bacteria a microorganism s mixotrophic lifestyle is a selective advantage in nature and such capability is especially important to species that are critical to global nutrient cycles matin 1978 versatile lifestyles have been discovered in microbial cells because of the development of observation power hawley et al 2014 rother and metcalf 2004 which expanded our knowledge on microbial functionality and niche anaerobic ammonium oxidizing anammox bacteria are capable of coupling ammonium and nitrite to form nitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions kuenen 2008 they are critical players in the global nitrogen cycle canfield et al 2010 kuypers et al 2003 ward 2013 zhu et al 2013 and have been successfully exploited to treat wastewater kartal et al 2010 most anammox species such as kuenenia stuttgartiensis jettenia asiatica brocadia fulgida and scalindua profunda use inorganic carbon to synthesize organic molecules via a wood ljungdahl pathway also known as reductive acetyl coa pathway gori et al 2011 hu et al 2012 rather than generating energy this route requires high energy input which is available from the hydrazine metabolism kartal et al 2011 as the energy release via acetate oxidation coupled to nitrite reduction is close to that of the anammox process 359 8 kj vs 357 8 kj standard gibbs free energy for each process calculated at ph 7 0 temperature 25 c air pressure 101 325 pa gao and tao 2011 it is of interest to evaluate if anammox bacteria can convert organic matter for cell growth understanding of this conversion might give insight into some essential eco technical questions such as whether anammox bacteria can survive or have an competitive advantage in an environment where organic matter is sufficient but lacks co2 babbin et al 2014 or is an industrial anammox process applicable in a mainstream wastewater treatment kartal et al 2010 an organotrophic alternative has been proposed strous et al 2006 and shown in laboratory settings kartal et al 2007 2008 two organotrophic species i e candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus candidatus brocadia fulgida have been indicated to oxidize short chain fatty acids into co2 which is then assimilated via an acetyl coa pathway that is predominant in the autotrophic anammox bacteria schouten et al 2004 however there have been very limited follow up studies and the organotrophic lifestyle of anammox bacteria is underexplored the discovery of an organotrophic lifestyle by anammox bacteria is often challenged by interference from heterotrophic microorganisms that co exist in any anammox consortium direct observation of organotrophic processes on a single cell level could deliver profound information about the actual physiology anammox bacteria however such studies are scarce by far in recent years nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims has enabled to gain an in depth view of microbiology for example to track microbial interactions and to study microbial metabolic activities kopf et al 2015 musat et al 2012 2016 in this study we used a nanosims to visualize and quantify the incorporation of 13c labelled acetate and propionate by a highly enriched anammox consortium that was dominated by candidatus jettenia asiatica hu et al 2012 this microorganism has not yet been reported relating to organotrophy the results that were based on 279 scans of 4885 cells strongly indicated that the anammox consortium incorporated acetate and propionate at a rate even higher than the uptake rate of bicarbonate in a mainstream anammox system organic matter present in wastewater plays a key role in governing the balance between anammox bacteria and heterotrophic microorganisms such as denitrifying bacteria although it has been accepted that anammox bacteria are protected by heterotrophs when organic carbon is present li et al 2016 our study confirms that anammox bacteria are capable of dealing with organic matters by their own the niche of anammox bacteria in engineered ecosystems can therefore be much broader than general assumed it also reminds us that their actual contribution to the global nitrogen turnover warrants more exploration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design in this study we firstly harvested relatively mature anammox granules from a 70 m3 full scale anammox reactor it is located at the sludge treatment site sluisjesdijk rotterdam nl which treats the sludge of a municipal wastewater treatment plant dokhaven its actual loading was on average 700 kg n d following a nitritation reactor van der star et al 2007 then we cultivated the anammox granules in a well controlled lab scale reactor for further enrichment of anammox bacteria a highly enriched anammox consortium was then achieved facilitating the next step cultivations in different carbon sources labelled with isotopic 13c a nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims was used to visualize and quantify the incorporation of those isotopic element signals based on the scannings of a large number of cells in different incubations fig 1 2 2 enrichment of j asiatica an expanded granular sludge bed egsb is a typical high efficiency bioreactor used for wastewater treatment under anaerobic conditions connelly et al 2017 the 1 2 l egsb was inoculated with anammox aggregates that were obtained from a full scale anammox bioreactor that treated centrifuged sludge digestate the influent flow rate was 13 2 l d which corresponded to hydraulic retention time hrt of 1 82 h an up flow velocity of 4 8 m h was maintained by bulk circulation in order to keep granulation the temperature was controlled at 34 1 c using a heating jacket the medium was sparged with a gas mixture of n2 and co2 95 and 5 respectively for 20 min after each time of preparation in order to remove oxygen the primary sources of the medium were nh4 2so4 5 14 mm and nano2 5 17 5 mm the medium also contained the following compounds per 1 l demineralized water khco3 1000 mg kh2po4 27 2 mg mgso4 7h2o 240 mg cacl2 300 mg and trace element solution i and ii 1 ml respectively prepared according to van de graaf et al 1996 the ph of the fresh medium was 7 6 0 3 without neutralization the feeding for the egsb was shut down for 48 h before collecting consortium samples allowing the removal of the residual ammonium nitrite and bicarbonate in bulk 2 3 medium the isotope medium contained 13c and 15n labelled chemicals that were supplied by cambridge isotope laboratories tewksbury ma usa the oxygen free medium was prepared using ultra pure water and sparged with n2 gas 99 99 purity for 30 min in an anaerobic glove box resazurin was used as an anaerobic indicator in the medium eight groups of experiments were carried out with seven group 1 7 applying 2 0 mm 15n ammonium and 2 0 mm 14n nitrite as nitrogen sources and one group 8 using 2 0 mm 15n nitrate only table 1 for each incubation a total of 2 5 μmol 13c atoms were supplied no matter in bicarbonate acetate or propionate forms group 1 mimicked a typical anammox process with 13c bicarbonate as the sole carbon source the group 2 5 applied acetate centred carbon sources including 1 13c acetate group 2 2 13c acetate group 3 13c bicarbonate 12c acetate

used in group 8 in order to check the contribution of heterotrophic bacteria e g denitrifying bacteria in the consortium 2 4 incubation for each incubation 4 5 anammox granules were randomly selected to incubate in a 12 ml hungate tube a volume of 5 ml media was added to each tube triplicate incubations were done for each group and gently shaken at 30 c in the dark anaerobically the incubations were ended by dosing 200 μl of 8 m zncl2 solution after 30 s 5 min 10 min 20 min 1 h 20 h and 15 d respectively the reason for applying frequent sampling within the first hour is to avoid missing the endings of reactions especially the rapid nitrogen conversions the 20 h and 15 d incubations were also carried out in order to allow a complete cell cycle as the doubling time of anammox bacteria can be as long as 1 2 weeks jetten et al 1998 van niftrik and jetten 2012 for the 15 day incubations 0 5 ml supernatants of the original medium were replaced for every three days by the concentrated medium that contained 20 mm 15nh4cl and na14no2 respectively while no such replacement of medium being done to the other incubations 2 5 dna extraction the anammox granules samples were taken from egsb reactors and stored at 80 c until the dna extraction the granules were washed with 1 phosphate buffer saline pbs solution and then centrifuged at 7000 g for 7 min the supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed with the same pbs solution for the second time and centrifuged under 17 000 g for 20 min the supernatant was removed and the pellet was used for the dna extraction the dna

an accelerating high voltage of 8 kv a mass resolution power of 7000 m m 10 definition was applied enough to eliminate isobaric interference of 13c by 12c1h and 12c15n by 12c14n1h samples were pre sputtered with a primary cs beam of 1 na for 2 min in order to remove the gold coat and achieve stable yield rates of the secondary ions after pre sputtering secondary ion images of 12c 13c 12c14n for

nanosims scans were analyzed using the software openmims an open source imagej plugin that is supported by the national resource for imaging mass spectrometry http www nrims hms harvard edu all the analysis was done under pc windows environment the quantification of 15n and 13c incorporation were determined by selecting those regions of interest rois that were defined manually following three strict criteria 1 the sizes of the targeted cells were in the range of 800 1200 nm 2 the cells were coccoid or coccoid like shape van niftrik and jetten 2012 and 3 the 15n 14n hotspots can well wedge into the web like distributions of 31p precipitants which are highly expected to be excreted by anammox bacteria for δ13c and δ15n data processing the 15n 14n and 13c 12c values of the anammox granules that were cultivated for 30 s were used as the standard for calculation and calibration the δ value was calculated as δ rsample rstandard 1 where rsample stands for isotopic ratios of 13c 12c and 15n 14n and rstandard is the 13c 12c and 15n 14n values of the samples after 30s incubation 3 results 3 1 the enrichment of j asiatica in the cultivation bioreactor the enrichment of j asiatica was carried out in an expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor that was fed with a standard medium for cultivating anammox bacteria fig 1 no organic matter was added to the egsb red colored granule like aggregates were formed in the egsb and the size of granules increased to and stabilized at 1 2 mm during the cultivation fig 2 a some granules contained interstitial voids fig s1 that might serve as water or gas channels benefitting to mass transportation lu et al 2012 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis confirmed that the microbial consortium was dominated by anammox bacteria with a mean relative abundance of 96 0 fig 2b identified as j asiatica by 16s rrna sequencing genbank kj002641 1 a classic anammox cell architecture and compartmentalization were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem fig 2c clearly showing anammoxosome as the central organelle van niftrik et al 2008 the ammonium oxidation capacity of the egsb increased by approximately ten times after a long term operation figs 1 and 2d meanwhile the qpcr analysis showed that the hzo gene copy numbers of the egsb biomass increased by over five orders of magnitude fig 2d the hzo gene encodes for the enzyme hydrazine oxidoreductase converting hydrazine to n2 li et al 2011 pitcher et al 2011 which is a unique metabolic process specific for anammox bacteria kartal et al 2011 the ratio of the consumed nitrite to the consumed ammonium stabilized in the range of 1 30 1 37 while the ratio of the produced nitrate to the consumed ammonium was consistently in the range of 0 20 0 25 both of which agreed with known anammox stoichiometry walter et al 1999 3 2 classic anammox reaction intense incorporation of 15n coming from 15n ammonium by the consortium was identified by nanosims after only 10 min of incubation but soon decreased in the control group that mimics a typical anammox reaction group 1 fig 3 b the weak signal of 15n was very likely due to the formation of 15n2 which escaped from the cytoplasm easily this result strongly indicated that ammonium oxidation was very efficient in the consortium taking place even within several minutes the short term incubations 5 60 min of group 1 exhibited minimal enrichment of 13c while a 2 4 times higher uptake of 13c was observed in the 20 h and 15 day incubations fig 3a according to our nanosims analysis of the 20 h incubation the ratio of δ13c δ15n was 21 1000 which was similar to a previous report that showed a stoichiometry of 20 mmol co2 incorporations per mol ammonium consumption strous et al 1999 for group 8 that mimicked a typical denitrification reaction with 15n nitrate as electron acceptor and 2 13c acetate as electron donors table 1 we confirmed the presence of 100 cells which was suggested from the observation of matrix rings according to the 31p nanosims scans which indicated the existence of lipid bilayers fig s2c however we could observe only two 15n signals fig s2b and extremely weak incorporation of 2 13c acetate fig s3 since strong incorporation of 2 13c acetate would occur if heterotrophic microorganisms were abundant in the consortium our findings of very low incorporation of 2 13c acetate suggested that a very low fraction of heterotrophs e g denitrifying bacteria could be present 3 3 acetate and propionate engaged anammox processes the cells in the 2 13c acetate added group 3 and the 1 13c propionate added group 6 groups enriched acetate and propionate respectively according to the nanosims scans fig 4 furthermore the 13c signals distributed across a large area of individual cells rather than a particular location figs 4a and 5a the nanosims images of a single cell fig 5 and fig s4 dividing cells fig s5 and fig s6 and multiple cells fig s7 and fig s8 consistently suggested that the highly enriched 13c region well matched to the 15n hot zones pearson correlation values range 0 853 0 947 figs 4a 5a and g 5h which likely were anammoxosome dietl et al 2015 higher enrichment of 15n and 13c can be seen in the 15 day incubations compared to short ones fig 6 for the 15 day incubations the propionate fed consortium incorporated more 13c than the acetate fed one and all the organic carbon groups group 2 7 enriched more 13c than the control group group 1 fig 6 for the 20 min and 1 h incubations the 13c incorporation was not significantly different among each group except for group 6 which was fed with 1 13c propionate the 15n incorporation of each incubation was also in a similar level except for the 1 13c acetate added group group 2 which was significantly higher than the others the addition of unlabelled acetate group 4 or propionate group 7 boosted the incorporation of 13c by 70 and 27 times compared to the incorporation in the control group group 1 after 15 d incubation fig 6 the time courses of the acetate and propionate aid 13c bicarbonate assimilation showed that the incorporation was not significant within 20 h but was evident on day 15 fig s9a and s9c the nitrogen incorporation also had similar trends fig s9b and s9d it was a strange phenomenon and might be linked to unknown pathways of j asiatica in the presence of acetate or propionate 4 discussion 4 1 is there a heterotrophic anammox conversion heterotrophs are those organisms that require organic substrates as a carbon source for growth claassens et al 2016 in our study j asiatica was proven to be able to take up acetate and propionate a core question followed will be obvious did they utilize those short chain fatty acids for forming biomass of their own for growth if j asiatica carried out a heterotrophic anammox process the 13c labeling position on the methyl group 2 1 13c acetate added group or carboxyl group 3 2 13c acetate added group carbon of acetate would result in no differences in terms of the eventual 13c incorporation however we found significantly higher 13c enrichment in the 2 13c acetate added group group 3 than that in the 1 13c acetate added group group 2 after 15 days fig 6 it indicated that the acetate or propionate was likely not assimilated by j asiatica directly but oxidized to co2 which then served as carbon sources for the follow up autotrophic growth of j asiatica it still warrants more experimental work to confirm a metabolic pathway behind the organic carbon utilization by j asiatica as we are still not able to completely rule out the possibility of j asiatica assimilating acetate or propionate from another perspective some genomic and proteomic discoveries indicate that some anammox bacteria might directly incorporate acetate into their cell biomass for example carbon monoxide co dehydrogenase acetyl coa synthase acs is responsible for the co2 fixation and it is shared by many anammox species such as k stuttgartiensis s profunda j caeni and j asiatica muhammad et al 2015 oshiki et al 2016 the transcriptome and proteome of k stuttgartiensis the model species of anammox bacteria show high level genes encoding of pyruvate associated enzymes such as pyruvate oxidoreductase kuste4371 and pyruvate carboxylase kustd1409 kartal et al 2011 the metagenome of the marine anammox bacterium s profunda illustrates several genes encoding acetate kinase phosphotransacetylase pyruvate kinase and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase indicating a versatile carbon metabolism in situ van de vossenberg et al 2013 it has been found that acetate can be activated by an acetyl coa synthetase like protein kustc1128 in a heterologous host as well as whole cells of k stuttgartiensis russ et al 2012 such acetate activation might lead to the direct incorporation of acetate into cell biomass by anammox bacteria 4 2 different impacts of propionate and acetate on ammonium oxidation carbon is important to ammonium oxidation by j asiatica as a linear relationship can be found between the incorporation of 13c and 15n fig 7 if all the cells are considered cultivated in whatever media furthermore we found different impact of propionate and acetate on the incorporation of 15n in our study exactly the same amount of 13c atoms were supplied to all anammox cells but they tended to incorporate more 13c propionate than 13c acetate and accordingly more 15n ammonium was enriched by the propionate fed consortium than the acetate fed one fig 6 it has been reported that the specific rate of acetate oxidation is higher in b fulgida while a propionicus utilizes propionate faster jetten et al 2009 according to the molecular mechanism of ammonium and nitrite metabolism by anammox bacterium k stuttgartiensis kartal et al 2011 the generation of no and n2h4 requires a significant amount of electron equivalents eq 1 and 2 when acetate or propionate was oxidized to co2 firstly such oxidation would offer a large number of electrons for example the oxidation of acetate yields 8 electron equivalents while propionate yields 14 considering the very close relationship between 13c and 15n incorporation it is possible that these electrons are used to produce no and n2h4 as a compelling electron donor ideal for the reduction of co2 the oxidized product of acetate or propionate n2h4 supplied the reductive acetyl coa pathway with adequate electrons from the oxidation of n2h4 to n2 that yields 4 electrons eq 3 1 no2 2h e no h2o e0 0 38 v 2 no nh4 2h 3e n2h4 h2o e0 0 06 v 3 n2h4 n2 4h 4e e0 0 75 v 4 3 inspirations for future studies and applications nanosims is a powerful tool to study element enrichment in cells on a single cell level gao et al 2016 in our study the enrichment of 15n and 13c in j asiatica was intensively monitored by nanosims beside of that 31p and 56fe enrichment was also captured giving extra information e g on the composition of the eps matrix in anammox granules we found that the enrichment of 31p did not correlate to that of 13c and 15n but surprisingly highly correlated to 56fe enrichment fig s5 and s7 because most highly enriched 31p and 56fe zones are extracellular it is very likely that a substantial number of extracellular polymeric substance eps was formed with phosphate and iron enclosed cao et al 2011 d abzac et al 2013 which facilitated the forming of granules hou et al 2015 there also might be iron phosphate precipatation under suitable physio chemical conditions lin et al 2013 the signal strength indicating 31p and 56fe enrichment did not vary significantly along with incubation time but correlated with space strongly it is also expected that the study could benefit our understanding of an overall contribution of anammox bacteria in a mainstream anammox process first of all our results showed extremely efficient incorporation of ammonium by j asiatica taking place within 5 min and reaching to maximum in 10 min fig 3b such capability could enable j asiatica to be competitive against other ammonium dependent microorganisms secondly long term cultivation with acetate propionate may accelerate biomass formation of j asiatica cells as higher enrichment of 13c was observed after 15 days fig 6e which may help j asiatica sustain a dominant power in a community last and most importantly anammox bacteria might be less vulnerable than previously suggested in a mainstream environment the organic matter is inevitable in a mainstream anammox process and it is one of the critical factors balancing two microbial guilds i e anammox bacteria and denitrifying bacteria there have been some studies showing that 1 anammox bacteria are not vulnerable in the presence of low dose organic matters likely because of the protection by aerobic anaerobic heterotrophs and 2 anammox bacteria are unlikely to grow on organic matters in a mainstream anammox process for example it has been found that a higher ratio of bod5 tn in the influent of a mainstream anammox reactor resulted in higher nitrogen removing efficiency very likely due to the enhanced conventional denitrification cao et al 2016 it is also confirmed the growth of anammox bacteria in a mainstream anammox process and the anammox bacteria did not directly incorporate or store the radioactive labelled acetate or glucose in their studies laureni et al 2015 although our study confirmed the capability of anammox bacteria j asiatica incorporating acetate and propionate we do not clearly understand how they might compete with aerobic and or denitrification heterotrophs in a mainstream anammox environment it definitely requires further experimental studies to explain the following questions 1 is such organotrophic capability only specific to j asiatica or is it a versatility to all anammox species 2 will short chain fatty acids other than acetate and propionate also be incorporated under similar conditions 3 what are the evolutionary physiological and ecological reasons behind a detour metabolism of j asiatica s organotrophic lifestyle 4 is it feasible engineer truely heterotrophic anammox bacteria through the introduction of production pathways and the modification of autotrophic systems by genetic engineering 5 conclusions nanosims analysis of an inorganic organic incubated highly enriched anammox granular consortium reveals efficient incorporation of acetate and propionate although it is still an enigma how acetate and propionate are metabolized and how energy electrons flow in the cell the results offer essential insight to the versatility of anammox bacteria here the shown organotrophic but unlikely a heterotrophic lifestyle of anammox bacteria strongly supports a promising niche of anammox bacteria in a mainstream anammox process where organic matter is present follow up studies about how such versatility could enhance the growth of anammox bacteria are needed declaration of interests the

18778,groundwater ph is one of the most important geochemical parameters in controlling the interfacial reactions of zero valent iron zvi with water and contaminants ball milled microscale zvi mzvibm efficiently dechlorinated tce at initial stage 24 h at ph 6 7 but got passivated at later stage due to ph rise caused by iron corrosion at ph 9 mzvibm almost completely lost its reactivity in contrast ball milled sulfidated microscale zvi s mzvibm didn t experience any reactivity loss during the whole reaction stage across ph 6 10 and could efficiently dechlorinate tce at ph 10 with a reaction rate of 0 03 h 1 increasing ph from 6 to 9 also enhanced electron utilization efficiency from 0 95 to 5 3 and from 3 2 to 22 for mzvibm and s mzvibm respectively sem images of the reacted particles showed that the corrosion product layer on s mzvibm had a puffy porous structure while that on mzvibm was dense which may account for the mitigated passivation of s mzvibm under alkaline phs density functional theory calculations show that covered s atoms on the fe 100 surface weaken the interactions of h2o molecules with fe surfaces which renders the sulfidated fe surface inefficient for h2o dissociation and resistant to surface passivation the observation from this study provides important implication that natural sulfidation of zvi may largely contribute to the long term 10 years efficiency of tce decontamination by permeable reactive barriers with pore water ph above 9 graphical abstract image 1 keywords electron efficiency permeable reactive barrier ph sulfidation tce dechlorination zero valent iron 2019 4 26 1 introduction in the past two decades zero valent iron zvi has been proven to be an effective material for in situ reductive removal of chlorinated hydrocarbons in groundwater gao et al 2015 he et al 2010 matheson and tratnyek 1994 mu et al 2017 o carroll et al 2013 the most common implementation of this process is in permeable reactive barriers prbs of which there already were at least 200 cases by 2010 gillham et al 2010 the prbs were originally constructed as walls through trenching or excavation with granular zvi but later developed into more flexible forms with construction methods such as soil mixing and direct or well injection especially with microscale or colloidal zvi itrc 2011 after emplacement of zvi in subsurface complex interfacial reactions involving zvi corrosion contaminant adsorption and reduction can occur on zvi surface geochemical factors significantly influence these interfacial processes and ultimately affect the performance of prbs sun et al 2016 among all the factors ph is known to be the most important in controlling the interfacial reactions bae and hanna 2015 it is commonly documented that increasing ph decreased the kinetic rate constants of reductive removal of chlorinated compounds and inorganic contaminants by zvi alowitz and scherer 2002 chen et al 2001 dong et al 2010 liu and lowry 2006 matheson and tratnyek 1994 song and carraway 2005 2006 for instance with ph increased from 5 5 to 10 the rate of carbon tetrachloride ct dechlorination by microscale zvi almost linearly decreased with a slope of 1 08 h 1 ph matheson and tratnyek 1994 such linear decrease of k obs with the increase of ph from 6 5 to 9 was also observed for dechlorination of 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane song and carraway 2005 chcl3 matheson and tratnyek 1994 song and carraway 2006 and trichloroethene tce liu and lowry 2006 by nanoscale zvi nzvi this ph dependency is typically accepted to be induced by the accelerated zvi corrosion at low ph and the enhanced passivation of the iron surface at high ph through the formation of high valence iron hydr oxides bae and lee 2014 and the lower availability of protons required for hydrodechlorination at higher ph however lowering solution ph to 3 8 decreased the zvi reactivity due to the fast consumption of fe0 and the accumulation of h2 on particle surface which prevented the contaminants from interacting with zvi chen et al 2001 choe et al 2004 compared to particle reactivity the effect of ph on reaction pathway was less studied it was reported that the yield of carbon trichloride a hydrogenolysis product of ct dechlorination by zvi decreased with increasing ph tamara and butler 2004 this was attributed to 1 lower activities of the nascent hydrogen atom from proton reduction at higher ph 2 decreased catalytic hydrogenating capacity of the iron surface with increased ph and 3 more negative reduction potential at iron oxide water interface at higher ph decreasing the favorability of hydrogenolysis however increasing ph favored hydrogenolysis pathway of 1 1 2 2 teca dechlorination by zvi evidenced by 57 of overall removal via hydrogenolysis at ph 9 0 while only 27 via hydrogenolysis at ph 7 5 song and carraway 2005 the solution ph also significantly affected hydrogen evolution reaction her i e zvi corrosion a competing reaction of contaminant reduction increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 9 decreased the her rate of nzvi for 27 fold liu and lowry 2006 while for microscale zvi mzvi the her rate decreased about two orders of magnitude with this ph change tang et al 2017 since ph influences both contaminant reduction and her the electron utilization efficiency of zvi should also be affected electron efficiency has been growingly recognized as the most challenging aspect of zvi performance fan et al 2016a however this ph dependence of electron selectivity has not been investigated sulfidation of zvi to form secondary iron sulfide phases is a newly developed zvi modification method which enhances not only particle reactivity but also selectivity in dehalogenation bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 cao et al 2017 fan et al 2016b 2017 garcia et al 2016 han and yan 2016 kim et al 2011 li et al 2016 2017b rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 and sequestration of heavy metals duan et al 2019 li et al 2018 shao et al 2018 su et al 2015 2016 wang et al 2018 zou et al 2019 the effect of ph on the reactivity of sulfidated nzvi s nzvi in dechlorinating chlorinated hydrocarbon has been investigated but contradictory results were obtained it was reported that increasing ph generally increased the dechlorination rate of tce by s nzvi dong et al 2018 kim et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 this trend was opposite to the trend usually reported for zvi but consistent with the trend of fes systems butler and hayes 2001 the increase of fes reactivity with increasing ph was attributed to the increased deprotonation of fes at higher ph increasing electron availability at reactive surfaces which was demonstrated via cyclic voltammetry measurements kim et al 2015 the same ph dependance of s nzvi as that of fes was explained by the same theory kim et al 2013 however decreased debromination rate of hexabromocyclododecane by s nzvi was observed with ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 li et al 2017a the causes of this discrepancy remain unclear in addition the effect of ph on reaction pathway and electron selectivity of chlorinated hydrocarbon dechlorination by sulfidated zvi has not been investigated it should be noted that all the current ph effect work on sulfidated zvi was performed with s nzvi which is costly and typically synthesized in aqueous phase with unsafe or unstable sulfur compounds such as sulfide dithionite and thiosulfate fan et al 2017 han and yan 2016 to overcome the drawbacks of s nzvi our group recently reported the synthesis of sulfidated microscale zvi s mzvibm with zvi and elemental sulfur using a mechanochemical method that is highly amenable to up scaling gu et al 2017 huang et al 2017 the obtained s mzvibm a composite with almost homogeneously distributed fe0 iron oxides and iron sulfide phases could dechlorinate tce with at least one order magnitude faster rates and greater electron efficiencies than the unsulfidated counterparts mzvibm one important observation with s mzvibm was that it did not exhibit any particle passivation during tce dechlorination at neutral ph while the unsulfidated mzvibm suffered significant reactivity loss at later reaction stage gu et al 2017 this passivation of zvi surface was likely related to the ph increase with the reaction yet the mechanism underlying the mitigated s mzvibm passivation is unclear in addition researches have shown that dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes such as tce cannot occur at ph larger than 9 chen et al 2001 however phs in prb pore water were frequently measured to be 10 while efficient groundwater treatment was generally achieved blowes et al 1999 phillips et al 2010 warner et al 2005 a good answer for this phenomenon is also lacking the overall objective of this work is to understand the resistance of s mzvibm for particle passivation at alkaline phs through comprehensively evaluating the effect of ph on tce dechlorinaton by s mzvibm and its unsulfidated counterpart mzvibm across ph 6 10 the specific objectives are to 1 quantify and compare the reaction rate branching ratio and electron selectivity of tce dechlorination as a function of ph for both s mzvibm and mzvibm 2 explore the mechanism underlying the high reactivity and mitigated passivation with s mzvibm at alkaline phs and 3 gain insight into the long term efficiency of zvi prb with high pore water ph 2 materials and methods chemicals details of the used chemicals are provided in supporting information si particle preparation and characterization the s mzvibm particles were

details regarding its calculation are provided in si density functional theory dft calculation all dft calculations in this work were performed within the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp kresse and furthmüller 1996 kresse and hafner 1993 using the periodic supercell approach the projector augmented wave paw method was used for electron ion interactions blöchl 1994 kresse and joubert 1999 the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe function described the electron electron exchange and correlation energies perdew et al 1996 a plane wave basis set was used with an energy cutoff of 400 ev which have been proven large enough for fe catalysts wang et al 2016a spin polarized calculations were considered for fe systems to correctly capture the magnetic properties the brillouin zone of the surface unit cell was sampled by monkhorst pack grids monkhorst and pack 1976 with different k points mesh for each fe supercell for geometry optimization the convergence criterion of the forces acting on atoms was 0 05 ev å 1 while the energy threshold defining self consistency of the electron density was 10 5 ev 3 results and discussion effect of ph on reaction products and pathways the formation and distribution of major products at the end of tce dechlorination by s mzvibm 24 h and mzvibm 8 d at buffered ph 6 10 and unbufferred ph are summarized in fig 1 significant amount of acetylene was observed with s mzvibm especially at ph 7 10 up to 32 6 of the final products while it was almost absent with mzvibm at the same ph range it is known that acetylene is formed through a β elimination pathway dichloroelimination via the transient intermediate chloroacetylene and its further hydrogenation forms ethene ethane and coupling products su et al 2019 the low accumulation of acetylene with mzvibm suggests that acetylene is extremely reactive on zvi surface to undergo hydrogenation arnold and roberts 2000 the significantly more accumulation of acetylene with s mzvibm than mzvibm however indicates that the hydrogenation of acetylene on s mzvibm was controlled by the sulfidated iron phases mainly fes in s mzvibm this is not surprising given that fes phases are the main tce dechlorination sites on s mzvibm gu et al 2017 where acetylene was generated as the hydrogenation of acetylene on fes surface was not fast enough acetylene became desorbed the hydrogenation of acetylene on the iron phase of s mzvibm also became less rapid because electrons from fe0 more selectively went to fes phases especially at ph 7 will be further discussed the accumulation of acetylene decreased with decreasing ph fig 1 which is expected since hydrogenation process requires protons and therefore is favored at low ph when the reaction solution was not buffered the solution ph varied between 8 1 and 9 4 the product distribution in this case is very similar to that at ph 8 and 9 therefore the buffer didn t pose any effects on tce dechlorination in terms of product distribution it is noteworthy that cis dce also accumulated in s mzvibm systems especially at ph 7 up to 15 4 while its accumulation in mzvibm was negligible at all phs as cis dce is a typical product of tce dechlorination mediated by fes besides acetylene it further suggests that tce dechlorination by s mzvibm is mediated by iron sulfide phases one possible pathway of tce hydrogenolysis to form cis dce associated with fes surface involves an acid base equilibrium between cis dce and its conjugated base a dichlorovinyl carbanion figure s1 butler and hayes 2001 assuming this reaction can achieve equilibrium faster than other steps involving the conjugated base lower ph would selectively drive the reaction to the cis dce side this explains the higher cis dce concentration with tce dechlorination by s mzvibm at lower ph we further note that s mzvibm cannot further reduce ethene to ethane at ph 6 9 figure s2 while mzvibm can only meaningfully convert ethene to ethane at ph 6 conversion rate 17 figure s3 therefore ethene and ethane were mainly generated in parallel from hydrogenation of acetylene especially for s mzvibm in addition further reduction of cis dce was not observed with all s mzvibm particles within the tested time period figure s4 therefore the tce dechlorination pathway on s mzvibm and mzvibm can be simplified as figure s6 the hydrogenolysis pathway of tce is only significant for s mzvibm at low ph and the hydrogenation of ethene to ethane is only applicable to mzvibm at ph 7 effect of ph on reaction kinetics the kinetics of tce dechlorination by s mzvibm at ph 6 10 and unbuffered ph via intermediates and products can be well described by a model containing first order terms figure s4 and fig 2 a and b for reaction steps shown in figure s6 the fitted rate constants of β elimination k 1 and hydrogenolysis k 2 steps as well as the tce disappearance k tce along with the surface area normalized rates k sa are given in table s1 the branching ratio of these two pathways k 1 k 2 was also quantified the increase of ph from 6 to 10 decreased the observed rate k tce from 0 25 to 0 03 h 1 both k1 and k2 decreased with the increase of ph from 6 to 10 while the branching ratio increased from 3 4 to 7 0 the large branching ratio number 1 suggests that β elimination is the primary tce dechlorination pathway by s mzvibm and increasing ph favored this pathway even more this is not surprising given that hydrogenolysis reaction requires protons when the reaction solution was not buffered ph 8 1 9 4 the observed tce dechlorination rate was comparable to that at ph 8 and 9 this result suggests that buffer itself didn t pose any effects on tce dechlorination in terms of reaction kinetics to further demonstrate this point tris buffer was also used to control solution ph at 8 for tce dechlorination by s mzvibm negligible difference was observed compared to hepes buffer figure s7 at all phs tce dechlorination by s mzvibm did not show any sign of decreased reactivity before the end of reaction e g all the data were well fitted by pseudo first order kinetics suggesting iron corrosion even at high ph did not cause passivation of reactive sites on fes in contrast tce dechlorination by mzvibm was pseudo first order for only the initial stage 24 h at ph 6 7 and then slowed down suggesting the gradual loss of particle reactivity this loss is associated with the ph rise of the reaction solution especially at ph 7 monitored ph increased from 6 to 7 7 and from 7 to 7 9 respectively due to severe iron corrosion the increase of buffer concentration from 50 mm to 100 mm at ph 6 alleviated this passivation figure s8 by reducing final ph from 7 7 to 7 5 this further confirms that the passivation of mzvibm particles at later stage was due to ph rise due to this passivation the product generation of tce dechlorination by mzvibm was not modeled but the branching ratio for mzvibm should be high since cis dce was negligible tce dechlorination rate by mzvibm during the initial stage also decreased with the increase of ph and this decrease is much more dramatic compared to s mzvibm fig 2c and d it is interesting that at ph 6 mzvibm dechlorinated tce even faster than s mzvibm 2 87 10 1 v s 1 72 10 2 l h 1 m 2 at the initial stage this indicates that at low ph when the iron surface was not passivated it was actually more reactive in mediating tce dechlorination than fes based on the redox ladder we constructed for iron couples gu et al 2017 fes fe0 has the lowest redox potential the higher reactivity of mzvibm at ph 6 suggests that either fe0 was directly exposed or the iron oxides layer was thin enough to allow more efficient electron conducting than fes however the iron surface was rapidly passivated when the ph was over 7 at ph 9 mzvibm was almost inert with only negligible tce dechlorination occurred while s mzvibm can dechlorinate 70 tce in 24 h therefore the critical advantage of s mzvibm is its ability to against surface passivation at alkaline phs it is noteworthy that tce dechlorination by s mzvibm has a same ph dependence as that by mzvibm but opposite to that by fes butler and hayes 2001 liu and lowry 2006 this is not consistent with some previous studies which showed the increased tce dechlorination rate with increasing ph by s nzvi and attributed it to a decrease in the reduction potential of fe sulfide surface with increasing ph dong et al 2018 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 however similar to our observation li et al 2017a also reported the decreased debromination rate of hexabromocyclododecane by s nzvi with ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 and attributed this decrease to the formation of iron oxides precipitates on s nzvi at high ph the underlying mechanism of this controversy is unclear but may be related to the different structure and or surface iron sulfide content and speciation of the investigated particles this is because the particle reactivity of sulfidated zvi at higher ph is a balance between enhanced electron availability on fes surface but decreased proton and or higher passivation caused by corrosion products nonetheless as a fes surface mediated reaction tce dechlorination by s mzvibm also has some characteristics of fes tce system for example more production of cis dce compared to mzvibm and increased cis dce production with decreasing ph effect of ph on h 2 evolution time series data for her by s mzvibm and mzvibm at various ph are shown in fig 3 the initial rates of her defined as the molar quantity of h2 generated at 2 h divided by the time the particle mass concentration and the surface area are also calculated and compared fig 3a and table s2 her is a two step reaction with the first step involving electron transfer from fe0 to proton on particle surface to form adsorbed atomic hydrogen conway and jerkiewicz 2002 odziemkowski and simpraga 2004 sheng et al 2013 2015 skulason et al 2010 during the second step the atomic hydrogen recombines to give out h2 either through a tafel reaction me hads me hads 2me h2 or b heyrovsky reaction me hads h e me h2 therefore her rates for both particles decreased with increasing ph as expected at ph 6 8 s mzvibm had a significant lower initial her rate than mzvibm fig 3a our previous researches showed that her sites of s mzvibm are mainly on iron hydr oxides gu et al 2017 he et al 2018 the presence of fes on s mzvibm reduces not only the her sites but also the electrons available for her because fes maintains high electron conductivity while iron hydr oxide surface becomes passivated with ph rise it is interesting that the her rate of s mzvibm became larger than mzvibm at ph 9 table s2 where the surface of iron hydr oxide became heavily passivated this is likely due to that the s sites with their non passivation ability may also alleviate the passivation of the her sites by causing favorable surface structure of corrosion products will be further discussed the her rate of the unbuffered s mzvibm and mzvibm were 1 4 10 2 and 1 0 10 2 μmol l m2 h 1 respectively consistent with the her rates of the corresponding particles in the ph range of 8 9 effect of ph on electron selectivity the εe of tce dechlorination by s mzvibm increased from 3 2 to 22 5 when ph was increase from 6 to 9 the increase of ph passivated fe hydr oxide layer therefore the electrons more selectively transported to the fes surface where most tce was efficiently dechlorinated this is evidenced by the lower production of hydrogen at higher ph the εe slightly decreased from 22 5 to 19 when the solution ph further increased from 9 to 10 due to the decrease of tce dechlorination with almost unchanged her tce dechlorination in the unbuffered solution has a εe of 21 5 as the solution ph varied between 8 1 and 9 4 the εe of tce dechlorination by mzvibm was also enhanced with the increase of ph when ph was increased from 6 to 9 the εe was increased from 0 95 to 5 3 since both tce dechlorination and her on mzvibm were mediated by the iron hydr oxide surface this suggests that her is more negatively affected by the surface passivation than tce dechlorination at higher ph liu andlowry 2006 also observed increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 9 decreased the h2 evolution rate of nzvi for 27 fold but only halved the tce dechlorination rate although they didn t quantify this as electron efficiency change mechanism of passivation mitigation by sulfidation the interaction of zvi surfaces with h2o causes corrosion based on the measured h2 and products from tce dechlorination the consumption of fe0 at different ph e g 6 9 can be calculated for mzvibm 8 d and s mzvibm 24 h figure s9 generally mzvibm had higher fe0 consumption and should have more corrosion products formed on particle surface interestingly sem images of the s mzvibm particles after reaction show a puffy layer of corrosion products in contrast to the flat surface of the reacted mzvibm particles across ph 6 9 fig 4 therefore the corrosion products on mzvibm must be denser which likely caused more particle passivation due to inhibition of mass and electron transfer both the xrd and raman spectra of s mzvi after reaction figure s10 especially at ph 8 and 9 showed the appearance of new peaks of fe3o4 suggesting that the puffy corrosion products were mainly fe3o4 xps characterization shows that s content on s mzvibm surface increased from 2 7 to 7 4 after reaction at ph 6 but decreased to 1 1 after reaction at ph 9 figure s11 therefore corrosion products still built up on the surface of s mzvibm after reaction especially at high ph however the puffy structure of the corrosion products allows effective transfer of contaminant to the fes sites and maintains particle reactivity at high ph the higher redox potential of fes sites at higher ph should also contribute to the effective tce dechlorination but only given that these sites are not passivated or blocked it is expected that with sufficiently low passivation e g high s content on surface at high ph sulfidated zvi particles could even have higher reactivity this may explain the faster tce dechlorination by sulfidated nzvi at higher ph reported by some previous studies to gain molecular insights into the effect of sulfidation in the passivation of zvi h2o interaction with fe and s fe surfaces was calculated within the framework of dft for fe bulk structure we used a 10 10 10 k point mesh and the calculated equilibrium lattice constant was 2 866 å in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical values tian et al 2014 as shown in figure s12 3 3 and 2 2 supercells composed of four atomic layers of fe 100 surface were constructed to model zvi and sulfidated zvi in this work the 3 3 supercell was used to model fe surface and 1 9 monolayer ml s covered fe surface while the 2 2 supercell was used to model 1 4 1 2 and 1 ml s covered fe surfaces the bottom two layers of fe 100 were frozen in structural relaxation k point mesh of 5 5 1 and 7 7 1 were used for the 3 3 and 2 2 supercell units respectively the vacuum region between the slabs was 15 å to avoid interactions between periodic slabs spurious slab to slab dipole interactions were corrected vasp keywords ldipol true idipol 3 the adsorption energies of h2o were calculated using eq 1 1 eads eh2o surface especies esurface where eh2o surface is the energy of the isolated h2o esurface is the energy of the bare fe 100 1 9 1 4 and 1 ml s fe 100 surfaces and eh2o surface is the energy of the h2o adsorbed on the surface a negative δeads corresponds to a stable adsorbate surface system s atom adsorption on fe surface with respect to the fe 100 high symmetry sites atop t bridge b 4 fold hollow h is illustrated in figure s13 the most stable configuration for s adsorption was found for the situation where s was bonded with fe atoms above the hollow site on the fe 100 surface consistent with previous dft and experimental studies curulla ferré et al 2006 1 4 1 2 and 1 ml s covered fe 100 surfaces was therefore optimized with s atom above the h site as for the following calculations it is generally agreed that partial dissociation of water on metal surfaces would lead to surface passivation and water interaction with metal surfaces therefore plays a key role in surface passivation schilling and behm 2018 initial structures of h2o adsorption on fe 100 surface were constructed with respect to the adsorption sites and molecule orientation with the corresponding adsorption energies listed in table s3 in all cases h2o molecule preferred to interact with fe 100 surface above the t site after geometry optimization and the most stable adsorption configuration is illustrated in fig 5 the most stable adsorption configuration for h2o was at the t site via the oxygen fe bond with the h2o molecule parallel to the fe surface fig 5 and yielded a binding energy of 0 41 ev table s3 in agreement with the previous dft studies liu et al 2014a h2o adsorption on s covered fe 100 of different coverages 1 9 1 4 1 2 and 1 ml is summarized in table s4 with the most stable configuration illustrated in fig 5 whose eads was compared with that on the clean fe 100 in fig 6 evidently sulfidation of fe 100 surface led to a significant decrease in the value of eads of h2o for the 1 9 and 1 4 ml s covered fe 100 surface h2o also preferred to be adsorbed on the t sites by o fe bond table s4 fig 5 but the eads values were about 0 1 ev smaller than that on the clean fe 100 fig 6 the covered s atom made the h2o adsorbed on surfaces mainly in tilt form these results imply that surface covered s atom weakened the interaction of h2o molecule with fe 100 surface which was opposite to what observed for covered o atom i e the surface of iron oxyhydroxides wang et al 2016b this weak and tilt adsorption of h2o molecule on the 1 9 and 1 4 ml s covered fe 100 surfaces could be explained by what have been proposed by dzade andde leeuw 2018 that negatively charged s atom shields the inner fe atoms and gives rise to repulsive interactions between the o atom in the h2o molecule and the surface s atom further increasing s coverage on fe 100 surface gave rise to the physisorption of h2o fig 5 releasing adsorption energies of 0 05 and 0 03 ev on the 1 2 and 1 ml s covered fe 100 surfaces fig 6 the physisorption of h2o on the 1 2 and 1 ml s covered fe 100 surfaces was similar to what have been reported for h2o interaction with mackinawite fes surfaces dzade et al 2016 these weakened adsorption structures of h2o molecule suggest that s atom covered fe 100 are not efficient for h2o molecule activation for further dissociation which confirms experimental results that sulfidation could mitigate the passivation of zero valent iron in addition the loose structure of the corrosion products on s mzvibm can be explained by the lower dissociation ability of h2o on fes than fe surfaces causing uneven growth of corrosion products which further validates the dft calculation implication for long term performance of permeable reactive barrier zvi prbs were found to be efficient after treating chlorinated solvent contaminated groundwater for even more than a decade phillips et al 2010 wilkin et al 2014 this is surprising given that the ph of the prb pore water was commonly found to be over 10 where tce dechlorination cannot occur based on laboratory tests analyses of core samples from a 10 year prb revealed mineral precipitates ranging from fe hydr oxides ca and fe carbonate carbonate green rusts and fe sulfides phillips et al 2010 in particular mackinawite was detected by xrd from the up gradient influent section of the prb materials a 1 2 cm thick slightly cemented crust 6 5 m below ground surface down to 6 75 m 25 cm thick and was the main precipitates in the entrance zone in addition iron sulfide minerals were observed by sem as thin coatings on zvi filings throughout the prb microbial community analysis also showed the presence of sulfate reducing bacteria srb in almost all core and groundwater samples throughout the prb although less srb were detected in downstream due to harsh ph 9 0 a pattern consistent with fes distribution in the prb similar observation of the dominant presence of fes and srb especially at the entrance section of prb was reported for almost all full scale prbs with coring analysis performed either in north america or europe gu et al 2002 johnson et al 2008 muchitsch et al 2011 phillips et al 2000 zolla et al 2009 this suggests that microbial sulfidation of zvi within zvi prbs regularly occurred and at least partially explains the efficient treatment of tce by the prb even after a decade as sulfidated zvi can not only increase the reactivity of zvi but also can maintain this reactivity at basic ph while pristine zvi cannot another demonstration of zvi sulfidation contributing to the prolonged efficiency of zvi prb came from a column test treating chlorinated ethylene contaminated groundwater with zvi kober et al 2002 rapid decrease of dechlorination rate was observed in the initial phase until sulfate was reduced by srb after 70 pore volume when the tce dechlorination started to accelerate while the decrease of dechlorination rate of other chlorinated ethylene slowed down although the authors attributed this improvement to the uptake of electron transfer blocking h2 by bacteria it cannot be excluded that the sulfidation of zvi starting from 70 pore volume sustained the reactivity of zvi for a longer term it is worth noting that the geochemistry within the prb is complicated and many other factors may contribute to the long term efficiency of prb for example both cations such as mg2 mn2 fe2 and anions such as so4 2 and hco3 were found to be able to depassivate aged zvi or prevent the passivation of zvi particles liu et al 2013a b 2014b velimirovic et al 2018 therefore further studies using core samples from currently running prb should be performed to quantify the contribution of fes to the long term efficiency of zvi prbs 4 conclusion solution ph is one of the most important geochemical factors in controlling the interfacial reactions of zvi both previous studies and this work demonstrated the significant retardation of tce dechlorination by unmilled and milled zvi at alkaline phs in contrast s mzvibm efficiently dechlorinated tce and didn t experience any reactivity loss during the whole reaction stage across ph 6 10 although the increase of solution ph slowed down tce dechlorination by s mzvibm its reaction rate at ph 10 maintained at 0 03 h 1 increasing ph from 6 to 10 significantly decreased her rate for both mzvibm and s mzvibm particles and sulfidation inhibited her especially at low ph electron utilization efficiency calculation further showed that it increased from 0 95 to 5 3 and from 3 2 to 22 for mzvibm and s mzvibm respectively with ph increased from 6 to 9 the reacted s mzvibm particles had a puffy porous corrosion product layer on the surface allowing effective contaminant transport compared to a dense structure on the reacted mzvibm particles which explains the mitigated passivation of s mzvibm under alkaline phs dft calculations suggest that s atoms covered on fe surfaces weaken the interactions of h2o molecules with the surface to make the s sites inefficient for h2o dissociation and therefore cause uneven growth of corrosion products that favors contaminant transport this work also offers important implication that natural sulfidation may account for the effective tce decontamination by zvi prbs with pore water ph above 9 even after decades declaration of interests the authors declare that they

18778,groundwater ph is one of the most important geochemical parameters in controlling the interfacial reactions of zero valent iron zvi with water and contaminants ball milled microscale zvi mzvibm efficiently dechlorinated tce at initial stage 24 h at ph 6 7 but got passivated at later stage due to ph rise caused by iron corrosion at ph 9 mzvibm almost completely lost its reactivity in contrast ball milled sulfidated microscale zvi s mzvibm didn t experience any reactivity loss during the whole reaction stage across ph 6 10 and could efficiently dechlorinate tce at ph 10 with a reaction rate of 0 03 h 1 increasing ph from 6 to 9 also enhanced electron utilization efficiency from 0 95 to 5 3 and from 3 2 to 22 for mzvibm and s mzvibm respectively sem images of the reacted particles showed that the corrosion product layer on s mzvibm had a puffy porous structure while that on mzvibm was dense which may account for the mitigated passivation of s mzvibm under alkaline phs density functional theory calculations show that covered s atoms on the fe 100 surface weaken the interactions of h2o molecules with fe surfaces which renders the sulfidated fe surface inefficient for h2o dissociation and resistant to surface passivation the observation from this study provides important implication that natural sulfidation of zvi may largely contribute to the long term 10 years efficiency of tce decontamination by permeable reactive barriers with pore water ph above 9 graphical abstract image 1 keywords electron efficiency permeable reactive barrier ph sulfidation tce dechlorination zero valent iron 2019 4 26 1 introduction in the past two decades zero valent iron zvi has been proven to be an effective material for in situ reductive removal of chlorinated hydrocarbons in groundwater gao et al 2015 he et al 2010 matheson and tratnyek 1994 mu et al 2017 o carroll et al 2013 the most common implementation of this process is in permeable reactive barriers prbs of which there already were at least 200 cases by 2010 gillham et al 2010 the prbs were originally constructed as walls through trenching or excavation with granular zvi but later developed into more flexible forms with construction methods such as soil mixing and direct or well injection especially with microscale or colloidal zvi itrc 2011 after emplacement of zvi in subsurface complex interfacial reactions involving zvi corrosion contaminant adsorption and reduction can occur on zvi surface geochemical factors significantly influence these interfacial processes and ultimately affect the performance of prbs sun et al 2016 among all the factors ph is known to be the most important in controlling the interfacial reactions bae and hanna 2015 it is commonly documented that increasing ph decreased the kinetic rate constants of reductive removal of chlorinated compounds and inorganic contaminants by zvi alowitz and scherer 2002 chen et al 2001 dong et al 2010 liu and lowry 2006 matheson and tratnyek 1994 song and carraway 2005 2006 for instance with ph increased from 5 5 to 10 the rate of carbon tetrachloride ct dechlorination by microscale zvi almost linearly decreased with a slope of 1 08 h 1 ph matheson and tratnyek 1994 such linear decrease of k obs with the increase of ph from 6 5 to 9 was also observed for dechlorination of 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane song and carraway 2005 chcl3 matheson and tratnyek 1994 song and carraway 2006 and trichloroethene tce liu and lowry 2006 by nanoscale zvi nzvi this ph dependency is typically accepted to be induced by the accelerated zvi corrosion at low ph and the enhanced passivation of the iron surface at high ph through the formation of high valence iron hydr oxides bae and lee 2014 and the lower availability of protons required for hydrodechlorination at higher ph however lowering solution ph to 3 8 decreased the zvi reactivity due to the fast consumption of fe0 and the accumulation of h2 on particle surface which prevented the contaminants from interacting with zvi chen et al 2001 choe et al 2004 compared to particle reactivity the effect of ph on reaction pathway was less studied it was reported that the yield of carbon trichloride a hydrogenolysis product of ct dechlorination by zvi decreased with increasing ph tamara and butler 2004 this was attributed to 1 lower activities of the nascent hydrogen atom from proton reduction at higher ph 2 decreased catalytic hydrogenating capacity of the iron surface with increased ph and 3 more negative reduction potential at iron oxide water interface at higher ph decreasing the favorability of hydrogenolysis however increasing ph favored hydrogenolysis pathway of 1 1 2 2 teca dechlorination by zvi evidenced by 57 of overall removal via hydrogenolysis at ph 9 0 while only 27 via hydrogenolysis at ph 7 5 song and carraway 2005 the solution ph also significantly affected hydrogen evolution reaction her i e zvi corrosion a competing reaction of contaminant reduction increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 9 decreased the her rate of nzvi for 27 fold liu and lowry 2006 while for microscale zvi mzvi the her rate decreased about two orders of magnitude with this ph change tang et al 2017 since ph influences both contaminant reduction and her the electron utilization efficiency of zvi should also be affected electron efficiency has been growingly recognized as the most challenging aspect of zvi performance fan et al 2016a however this ph dependence of electron selectivity has not been investigated sulfidation of zvi to form secondary iron sulfide phases is a newly developed zvi modification method which enhances not only particle reactivity but also selectivity in dehalogenation bhattacharjee and ghoshal 2018 cao et al 2017 fan et al 2016b 2017 garcia et al 2016 han and yan 2016 kim et al 2011 li et al 2016 2017b rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 and sequestration of heavy metals duan et al 2019 li et al 2018 shao et al 2018 su et al 2015 2016 wang et al 2018 zou et al 2019 the effect of ph on the reactivity of sulfidated nzvi s nzvi in dechlorinating chlorinated hydrocarbon has been investigated but contradictory results were obtained it was reported that increasing ph generally increased the dechlorination rate of tce by s nzvi dong et al 2018 kim et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 this trend was opposite to the trend usually reported for zvi but consistent with the trend of fes systems butler and hayes 2001 the increase of fes reactivity with increasing ph was attributed to the increased deprotonation of fes at higher ph increasing electron availability at reactive surfaces which was demonstrated via cyclic voltammetry measurements kim et al 2015 the same ph dependance of s nzvi as that of fes was explained by the same theory kim et al 2013 however decreased debromination rate of hexabromocyclododecane by s nzvi was observed with ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 li et al 2017a the causes of this discrepancy remain unclear in addition the effect of ph on reaction pathway and electron selectivity of chlorinated hydrocarbon dechlorination by sulfidated zvi has not been investigated it should be noted that all the current ph effect work on sulfidated zvi was performed with s nzvi which is costly and typically synthesized in aqueous phase with unsafe or unstable sulfur compounds such as sulfide dithionite and thiosulfate fan et al 2017 han and yan 2016 to overcome the drawbacks of s nzvi our group recently reported the synthesis of sulfidated microscale zvi s mzvibm with zvi and elemental sulfur using a mechanochemical method that is highly amenable to up scaling gu et al 2017 huang et al 2017 the obtained s mzvibm a composite with almost homogeneously distributed fe0 iron oxides and iron sulfide phases could dechlorinate tce with at least one order magnitude faster rates and greater electron efficiencies than the unsulfidated counterparts mzvibm one important observation with s mzvibm was that it did not exhibit any particle passivation during tce dechlorination at neutral ph while the unsulfidated mzvibm suffered significant reactivity loss at later reaction stage gu et al 2017 this passivation of zvi surface was likely related to the ph increase with the reaction yet the mechanism underlying the mitigated s mzvibm passivation is unclear in addition researches have shown that dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes such as tce cannot occur at ph larger than 9 chen et al 2001 however phs in prb pore water were frequently measured to be 10 while efficient groundwater treatment was generally achieved blowes et al 1999 phillips et al 2010 warner et al 2005 a good answer for this phenomenon is also lacking the overall objective of this work is to understand the resistance of s mzvibm for particle passivation at alkaline phs through comprehensively evaluating the effect of ph on tce dechlorinaton by s mzvibm and its unsulfidated counterpart mzvibm across ph 6 10 the specific objectives are to 1 quantify and compare the reaction rate branching ratio and electron selectivity of tce dechlorination as a function of ph for both s mzvibm and mzvibm 2 explore the mechanism underlying the high reactivity and mitigated passivation with s mzvibm at alkaline phs and 3 gain insight into the long term efficiency of zvi prb with high

kresse and furthmüller 1996 kresse and hafner 1993 using the periodic supercell approach the projector augmented wave paw method was used for electron ion interactions blöchl 1994 kresse and joubert 1999 the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe function described the electron electron exchange and correlation energies perdew et al 1996 a plane wave basis set was used with an energy cutoff of 400 ev which have been proven large enough for fe catalysts wang et al 2016a spin polarized calculations were considered for fe systems to correctly capture the magnetic properties the brillouin zone of the

acting on atoms was 0 05 ev å 1 while the energy threshold defining self consistency of the electron density was 10 5 ev 3 results and discussion effect of ph on reaction products and pathways the formation and distribution of major products at the end of tce dechlorination by s mzvibm 24 h and mzvibm 8 d at buffered ph 6 10 and unbufferred ph are summarized in fig 1 significant amount of acetylene was observed with s mzvibm especially at ph 7 10 up to 32 6 of the final products while it was almost absent with mzvibm at the same ph range it is known that acetylene is formed through a β elimination pathway dichloroelimination via the transient intermediate chloroacetylene and its further hydrogenation forms ethene ethane and coupling products su et al 2019 the low accumulation of acetylene with mzvibm suggests that acetylene is extremely reactive on zvi surface to undergo hydrogenation arnold and roberts 2000 the significantly more accumulation of acetylene with s mzvibm than mzvibm however indicates that the hydrogenation of acetylene on s mzvibm was controlled by the sulfidated iron phases mainly fes in s mzvibm this is not surprising given that fes phases are the main tce dechlorination sites on s mzvibm gu et al 2017 where acetylene was generated as the hydrogenation of acetylene on fes surface was not fast enough acetylene became desorbed the hydrogenation of acetylene on the iron phase of s mzvibm also became less rapid because electrons from fe0 more selectively went to fes phases especially at ph 7 will be further discussed the accumulation of acetylene decreased with decreasing ph fig 1 which is expected since hydrogenation process requires protons and therefore is favored at low ph when the reaction solution was not buffered the solution ph varied between 8 1 and 9 4 the product distribution in this case is very similar to that at ph 8 and 9 therefore the buffer didn t pose any effects on tce dechlorination in terms of product distribution it is noteworthy that cis dce also accumulated in s mzvibm systems especially at ph 7 up to 15 4 while its accumulation in mzvibm was negligible at all phs as cis dce is a typical product of tce dechlorination mediated by fes besides acetylene it further suggests that tce dechlorination by s mzvibm is mediated by iron sulfide phases one possible pathway of tce hydrogenolysis to form cis dce associated with fes surface involves an acid base equilibrium between cis dce and its conjugated base a dichlorovinyl carbanion figure s1 butler and hayes 2001 assuming this reaction can achieve equilibrium faster than other steps involving the conjugated base lower ph would selectively drive the reaction to the cis dce side this explains the higher cis dce concentration with tce dechlorination by s mzvibm at lower ph we further note that s mzvibm cannot further reduce ethene to ethane at ph 6 9 figure s2 while mzvibm can only meaningfully convert ethene to ethane at ph 6 conversion rate 17 figure s3 therefore ethene and ethane were mainly generated in parallel from hydrogenation of acetylene especially for s mzvibm in addition further reduction of cis dce was not observed with all s mzvibm particles within the tested time period figure s4 therefore the tce dechlorination pathway on s mzvibm and mzvibm can be simplified as figure s6 the hydrogenolysis pathway of tce is only significant for s mzvibm at low ph and the hydrogenation of ethene to ethane is only applicable to mzvibm at ph 7 effect of ph on reaction kinetics the kinetics of tce dechlorination by s mzvibm at ph 6 10 and unbuffered ph via intermediates and products can be well described by a model containing first order terms figure s4 and fig 2 a and b for reaction steps shown in figure s6 the fitted rate constants of β elimination k 1 and hydrogenolysis k 2 steps as well as the tce disappearance k tce along with the surface area normalized rates k sa are given in table s1 the branching ratio of these two pathways k 1 k 2 was also quantified the increase of ph from 6 to 10 decreased the observed rate k tce from 0 25 to 0 03 h 1 both k1 and k2 decreased with the increase of ph from 6 to 10 while the branching ratio increased from 3 4 to 7 0 the large branching ratio number 1 suggests that β elimination is the primary tce dechlorination pathway by s mzvibm and increasing ph favored this pathway even more this is not surprising given that hydrogenolysis reaction requires protons when the reaction solution was not buffered ph 8 1 9 4 the observed tce dechlorination rate was comparable to that at ph 8 and 9 this result suggests that buffer itself didn t pose any effects on tce dechlorination in terms of reaction kinetics to further demonstrate this point tris buffer was also used to control solution ph at 8 for tce dechlorination by s mzvibm negligible difference was observed compared to hepes buffer figure s7 at all phs tce dechlorination by s mzvibm did not show any sign of decreased reactivity before the end of reaction e g all the data were well fitted by pseudo first order kinetics suggesting iron corrosion even at high ph did not cause passivation of reactive sites on fes in contrast tce dechlorination by mzvibm was pseudo first order for only the initial stage 24 h at ph 6 7 and then slowed down suggesting the gradual loss of particle reactivity this loss is associated with the ph rise of the reaction solution especially at ph 7 monitored ph increased from 6 to 7 7 and from 7 to 7 9 respectively due to severe iron corrosion the increase of buffer concentration from 50 mm to 100 mm at ph 6 alleviated this passivation figure s8 by reducing final ph from 7 7 to 7 5 this further confirms that the passivation of mzvibm particles at later stage was due to ph rise due to this passivation the product generation of tce dechlorination by mzvibm was not modeled but the branching ratio for mzvibm should be high since cis dce was negligible tce dechlorination rate by mzvibm during the initial stage also decreased with the increase of ph and this decrease is much more dramatic compared to s mzvibm fig 2c and d it is interesting that at ph 6 mzvibm dechlorinated tce even faster than s mzvibm 2 87 10 1 v s 1 72 10 2 l h 1 m 2 at the initial stage this indicates that at low ph when the iron surface was not passivated it was actually more reactive in mediating tce dechlorination than fes based on the redox ladder we constructed for iron couples gu et al 2017 fes fe0 has the lowest redox potential the higher reactivity of mzvibm at ph 6 suggests that either fe0 was directly exposed or the iron oxides layer was thin enough to allow more efficient electron conducting than fes however the iron surface was rapidly passivated when the ph was over 7 at ph 9 mzvibm was almost inert with only negligible tce dechlorination occurred while s mzvibm can dechlorinate 70 tce in 24 h therefore the critical advantage of s mzvibm is its ability to against surface passivation at alkaline phs it is noteworthy that tce dechlorination by s mzvibm has a same ph dependence as that by mzvibm but opposite to that by fes butler and hayes 2001 liu and lowry 2006 this is not consistent with some previous studies which showed the increased tce dechlorination rate with increasing ph by s nzvi and attributed it to a decrease in the reduction potential of fe sulfide surface with increasing ph dong et al 2018 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 however similar to our observation li et al 2017a also reported the decreased debromination rate of hexabromocyclododecane by s nzvi with ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 and attributed this decrease to the formation of iron oxides precipitates on s nzvi at high ph the underlying mechanism of this controversy is unclear but may be related to the different structure and or surface iron sulfide content and speciation of the investigated particles this is because the particle reactivity of sulfidated zvi at higher ph is a balance between enhanced electron availability on fes surface but decreased proton and or higher passivation caused by corrosion products nonetheless as a fes surface mediated reaction tce dechlorination by s mzvibm also has some characteristics of fes tce system for example more production of cis dce compared to mzvibm and increased cis dce production with decreasing ph effect of ph on h 2 evolution time series data for her by s mzvibm and mzvibm at various ph are shown in fig 3 the initial rates of her defined as the molar quantity of h2 generated at 2 h divided by the time the particle mass concentration and the surface area are also calculated and compared fig 3a and table s2 her is a two step reaction with the first step involving electron transfer from fe0 to proton on particle surface to form adsorbed atomic hydrogen conway and jerkiewicz 2002 odziemkowski and simpraga 2004 sheng et al 2013 2015 skulason et al 2010 during the second step the atomic hydrogen recombines to give out h2 either through a tafel reaction me hads me hads 2me h2 or b heyrovsky reaction me hads h e me h2 therefore her rates for both particles decreased with increasing ph as expected at ph 6 8 s mzvibm had a significant lower initial her rate than mzvibm fig 3a our previous researches showed that her sites of s mzvibm are mainly on iron hydr oxides gu et al 2017 he et al 2018 the presence of fes on s mzvibm reduces not only the her sites but also the electrons available for her because fes maintains high electron conductivity while iron hydr oxide surface becomes passivated with ph rise it is interesting that the her rate of s mzvibm became larger than mzvibm at ph 9 table s2 where the surface of iron hydr oxide became heavily passivated this is likely due to that the s sites with their non passivation ability may also alleviate the passivation of the her sites by causing favorable surface structure of corrosion products will be further discussed the her rate of the unbuffered s mzvibm and mzvibm were 1 4 10 2 and 1 0 10 2 μmol l m2 h 1 respectively consistent with the her rates of the corresponding particles in the ph range of 8 9 effect of ph on electron selectivity the εe of tce dechlorination by s mzvibm increased from 3 2 to 22 5 when ph was increase from 6 to 9 the increase of ph passivated fe hydr oxide layer therefore the electrons more selectively transported to the fes surface where most tce was efficiently dechlorinated this is evidenced by the lower production of hydrogen at higher ph the εe slightly decreased from 22 5 to 19 when the solution ph further increased from 9 to 10 due to the decrease of tce dechlorination with almost unchanged her tce dechlorination in the unbuffered solution has a εe of 21 5 as the solution ph varied between 8 1 and 9 4 the εe of tce dechlorination by mzvibm was also enhanced with the increase of ph when ph was increased from 6 to 9 the εe was increased from 0 95 to 5 3 since both tce dechlorination and her on mzvibm were mediated by the iron hydr oxide surface this suggests that her is more negatively affected by the surface passivation than tce dechlorination at higher ph liu andlowry 2006 also observed increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 9 decreased the h2 evolution rate of nzvi for 27 fold but only halved the tce dechlorination rate although they didn t quantify this as electron efficiency change mechanism of passivation mitigation by sulfidation the interaction of zvi surfaces with h2o causes corrosion based on the measured h2 and products from tce dechlorination the consumption of fe0 at different ph e g 6 9 can be calculated for mzvibm 8 d and s mzvibm 24 h figure s9 generally mzvibm had higher fe0 consumption and should have more corrosion products formed on particle surface interestingly sem images of the s mzvibm particles after reaction show a puffy layer of corrosion products in contrast to the flat surface of the reacted mzvibm particles across ph 6 9 fig 4 therefore the corrosion products on mzvibm must be denser which likely caused more particle passivation due to inhibition of mass and electron transfer both the xrd and raman spectra of s mzvi after reaction figure s10 especially at ph 8 and 9 showed the appearance of new peaks of fe3o4 suggesting that the puffy corrosion products were mainly fe3o4 xps characterization shows that s content on s mzvibm surface increased from 2 7 to 7 4 after reaction at ph 6 but decreased to 1 1 after reaction at ph 9 figure s11 therefore corrosion products still built up on the surface of s mzvibm after reaction especially at high ph however the puffy structure of the corrosion products allows effective transfer of contaminant to the fes sites and maintains particle reactivity at high ph the higher redox potential of fes sites at higher ph should also contribute to the effective tce dechlorination but only given that these sites are not passivated or blocked it is expected that with sufficiently low passivation e g high s content on surface at high ph sulfidated zvi particles could even have higher reactivity this may explain the faster tce dechlorination by sulfidated nzvi at higher ph reported by some previous studies to gain molecular insights into the effect of sulfidation in the passivation of zvi h2o interaction with fe and s fe surfaces was calculated within the framework of dft for fe bulk structure we used a 10 10 10 k point mesh and the calculated equilibrium lattice constant was 2 866 å in good agreement with previous experimental and theoretical values tian et al 2014 as shown in figure s12 3 3 and 2 2 supercells composed of four atomic layers of fe 100 surface were constructed to model zvi and sulfidated zvi in this work the 3 3 supercell was used to model fe surface and 1 9 monolayer ml s covered fe surface while the 2 2 supercell was used to model 1 4 1 2 and 1 ml s covered fe surfaces the bottom two layers of fe 100 were frozen in structural relaxation k point mesh of 5 5 1 and 7 7 1 were used for the 3 3 and 2 2 supercell units respectively the vacuum region between the slabs was 15 å to avoid interactions between periodic slabs spurious slab to slab dipole interactions were corrected vasp keywords ldipol true idipol 3 the adsorption energies of h2o were calculated using eq 1 1 eads eh2o surface especies esurface where eh2o surface is the energy of the isolated h2o esurface is the energy of the bare fe 100 1 9 1 4 and 1 ml s fe 100 surfaces and eh2o surface is the energy of the h2o adsorbed on the surface a negative δeads corresponds to a stable adsorbate surface system s atom adsorption on fe surface with respect to the fe 100 high symmetry sites atop t bridge b 4 fold hollow h is illustrated in figure s13 the most stable configuration for s adsorption was found for the situation where s was bonded with fe atoms above the hollow site on the fe 100 surface consistent with previous dft and experimental studies curulla ferré et al 2006 1 4 1 2 and 1 ml s covered fe 100 surfaces was therefore optimized with s atom above the h site as for the following calculations it is generally agreed that partial dissociation of water on metal surfaces would lead to surface passivation and water interaction with metal surfaces therefore plays a key role in surface passivation schilling and behm 2018 initial structures of h2o adsorption on fe 100 surface were constructed with respect to the adsorption sites and molecule orientation with the corresponding adsorption energies listed in table s3 in all cases h2o molecule preferred to interact with fe 100 surface above the t site after geometry optimization and the most stable adsorption configuration is illustrated in fig 5 the most stable adsorption configuration for h2o was at the t site via the oxygen fe bond with the h2o molecule parallel to the fe surface fig 5 and yielded a binding energy of 0 41 ev table s3 in agreement with the previous dft studies liu et al 2014a h2o adsorption on s covered fe 100 of different coverages 1 9 1 4 1 2 and 1 ml is summarized in table s4 with the most stable configuration illustrated in fig 5 whose eads was compared with that on the clean fe 100 in fig 6 evidently sulfidation of fe 100 surface led to a significant decrease in the value of eads of h2o for the 1 9 and 1 4 ml s covered fe 100 surface h2o also preferred to be adsorbed on the t sites by o fe bond table s4 fig 5 but the eads values were about 0 1 ev smaller than that on the clean fe 100 fig 6 the covered s atom made the h2o adsorbed on surfaces mainly in tilt form these results imply that surface covered s atom weakened the interaction of h2o molecule with fe 100 surface which was opposite to what observed for covered o atom i e the surface of iron oxyhydroxides wang et al 2016b this weak and tilt adsorption of h2o molecule on the 1 9 and 1 4 ml s covered fe 100 surfaces could be explained by what have been proposed by dzade andde leeuw 2018 that negatively charged s atom shields the inner fe atoms and gives rise to repulsive interactions between the o atom in the h2o molecule and the surface s atom further increasing s coverage on fe 100 surface gave rise to the physisorption of h2o fig 5 releasing adsorption energies of 0 05 and 0 03 ev on the 1 2 and 1 ml s covered fe 100 surfaces fig 6 the physisorption of h2o on the 1 2 and 1 ml s covered fe 100 surfaces was similar to what have been reported for h2o interaction with mackinawite fes surfaces dzade et al 2016 these weakened adsorption structures of h2o molecule suggest that s atom covered fe 100 are not efficient for h2o molecule activation for further dissociation which confirms experimental results that sulfidation could mitigate the passivation of zero valent iron in addition the loose structure of the corrosion products on s mzvibm can be explained by the lower dissociation ability of h2o on fes than fe surfaces causing uneven growth of corrosion products which further validates the dft calculation implication for long term performance of permeable reactive barrier zvi prbs were found to be efficient after treating chlorinated solvent contaminated groundwater for even more than a decade phillips et al 2010 wilkin et al 2014 this is surprising given that the ph of the prb pore water was commonly found to be over 10 where tce dechlorination cannot occur based on laboratory tests analyses of core samples from a 10 year prb revealed mineral precipitates ranging from fe hydr oxides ca and fe carbonate carbonate green rusts and fe sulfides phillips et al 2010 in particular mackinawite was detected by xrd from the up gradient influent section of the prb materials a 1 2 cm thick slightly cemented crust 6 5 m below ground surface down to 6 75 m 25 cm thick and was the main precipitates in the entrance zone in addition iron sulfide minerals were observed by sem as thin coatings on zvi filings throughout the prb microbial community analysis also showed the presence of sulfate reducing bacteria srb in almost all core and groundwater samples throughout the prb although less srb were detected in downstream due to harsh ph 9 0 a pattern consistent with fes distribution in the prb similar observation of the dominant presence of fes and srb especially at the entrance section of prb was reported for almost all full scale prbs with coring analysis performed either in north america or europe gu et al 2002 johnson et al 2008 muchitsch et al 2011 phillips et al 2000 zolla et al 2009 this suggests that microbial sulfidation of zvi within zvi prbs regularly occurred and at least partially explains the efficient treatment of tce by the prb even after a decade as sulfidated zvi can not only increase the reactivity of zvi but also can maintain this reactivity at basic ph while pristine zvi cannot another demonstration of zvi sulfidation contributing to the prolonged efficiency of zvi prb came from a column test treating chlorinated ethylene contaminated groundwater with zvi kober et al 2002 rapid decrease of dechlorination rate was observed in the initial phase until sulfate was reduced by srb after 70 pore volume when the tce dechlorination started to accelerate while the decrease of dechlorination rate of other chlorinated ethylene slowed down although the authors attributed this improvement to the uptake of electron transfer blocking h2 by bacteria it cannot be excluded that the sulfidation of zvi starting from 70 pore volume sustained the reactivity of zvi for a longer term it is worth noting that the geochemistry within the prb is complicated and many other factors may contribute to the long term efficiency of prb for example both cations such as mg2 mn2 fe2 and anions such as so4 2 and hco3 were found to be able to depassivate aged zvi or prevent the passivation of zvi particles liu et al 2013a b 2014b velimirovic et al 2018 therefore further studies using core samples from currently running prb should be performed to quantify the contribution of fes to the long term efficiency of zvi prbs 4 conclusion solution ph is one of the most important geochemical factors in controlling the interfacial reactions of zvi both previous studies and this work demonstrated the significant retardation of tce dechlorination by unmilled and milled zvi at alkaline phs in contrast s mzvibm efficiently dechlorinated tce and didn t experience any reactivity loss during the whole reaction stage across ph 6 10 although the increase of solution ph slowed down tce dechlorination by s mzvibm its reaction rate at ph 10 maintained at 0 03 h 1 increasing ph from 6 to 10 significantly decreased her rate for both mzvibm and s mzvibm particles and sulfidation inhibited her especially at low ph electron utilization efficiency calculation further showed that it increased from 0 95 to 5 3 and from 3 2 to 22 for mzvibm and s mzvibm respectively with ph increased from 6 to 9 the reacted s mzvibm particles had a puffy porous corrosion product layer on the surface allowing effective contaminant transport compared to a dense structure on the reacted mzvibm particles which explains the mitigated passivation of s mzvibm under alkaline phs dft calculations suggest that s atoms covered on fe surfaces weaken the interactions of h2o molecules with the surface to make the s sites inefficient for h2o dissociation and therefore cause uneven growth of corrosion products that favors contaminant transport this work also offers important implication that natural sulfidation may account for the effective tce decontamination by zvi prbs with pore water ph above 9 even after decades declaration of interests the authors declare that they

18779,wet chemical approach is widely applied for p extraction from incinerated sewage sludge ash issa due to the relatively simple process and low lost in this study h2so4 and h2c2o4 were compared to recover p from issa through three steps of acid leaching cation exchange resin cer purification and precipitation transformations of p speciation and mineral phases in issa from 600 to 900 c were studied the results showed that the issa samples were mainly composed of inorganic p ip and part of non apatite ip naip mainly alpo4 would transform to apatite p ap ca3 po4 2 with the increase in temperature the ratio of naip to ip dropped from 71 9 at 600 c to 53 7 at 900 c effect of acid concentration on the leaching efficiency of p from the issa samples incinerated at different temperatures by h2so4 and h2c2o4 was investigated and the leaching behaviors of key elements of p ca al and fe were compared h2c2o4 exhibited a better performance than h2so4 for the leaching efficiency of p severe sintering of ash particles occurred at temperature 800 c inhibited the p leaching by h2so4 during cer purification the impurity elements in the h2so4 leachate were easily removed by cer whereas the al and fe elements in the h2c2o4 leachate were hardly removed due to the formation of anionic complexes between al3 fe3 and oxalic ions finally high purity struvite product was synthesized from the purified h2so4 leachate which could be directly utilized as a fertilizer with negligible environmental risk amorphous aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates were obtained from the h2c2o4 leachate this study provides insights for p recovery from issa samples by different acid leaching systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus recovery incinerated sewage sludge ash acid leaching purification struvite 1 introduction phosphorous p is an indispensable element for all living organisms and human beings it plays a significant role in industrial and agricultural development in recent years the demand for phosphate is continuously increasing with rapid development in economy li et al 2015 however the phosphate ore resource in the worldwide is non renewable and is estimated to be depleted in 50 100 years cordell et al 2009 although the phosphate ore reserve in china ranks among the top three in the world the grade of ore is low and difficult to extract therefore p has been listed as one of the 20 minerals that cannot meet the demand of chinese economic growth li et al 2015 the phosphate ore is mainly processed into fertilizers and subsequently flows through the food production and consumption system however more than 80 of the p bearing fertilizer is not utilized and enters into natural water bodies mayer et al 2016 peng et al 2018 consequently p recovery from wastewater has attracted more and more attentions at present most of the sewage treatment plants apply enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr or chemical precipitation processes to treat p containing wastewater more than 90 of the phosphorus in raw wastewater will finally end up with sewage sludge however the sewage sludge cannot be directly applied for agricultural use because it also contains large amounts of organic inorganic pollutants sewage sludge incineration is increasing because it has many advantages including significant volume reduction up to 80 90 destruction of organic micro pollutants and pathogens and energy recovery after incineration most of p is concentrated in the incinerated sewage sludge ash issa and its content can vary from 10 0 to 25 7 wt as p2o5 which is comparable to the p content in phosphate ore 5 40 wt fang et al 2018 however issa often contains toxic heavy metals and the plant availability of p in issa is relatively low it is challenging to directly reutilize issa as fertilizers consequently various methods have been developed to recover p from issa removing heavy metals from issa by thermochemical treatment with inorganic mgcl2 gaseous hydrochloric acid and organic chlorinating agents polyvinylchloride at high temperatures 850 1100 c has been investigated vogel and adam 2011 vogel et al 2013 li et al 2015 in these methods most of heavy metals would be evaporated as vapors of heavy metal chlorides and the p rich residue would be post treated by acids to increase its plant availability for fertilizer applications treating issa thermochemically with sodium and potassium additives under reducing conditions to transform p bearing minerals into plant available phosphates has also been investigated herzel et al 2016 moreover some researchers investigated the recovery of p from issa through heat treatment by applying carbon as the reducing agent under inert atmospheres followed by high gradient magnetic separation hgms process córdova udaeta et al 2017 the p enriched in the nonmagnetic rich fraction was further recovered by flotation compared with heat treatment wet chemical approaches have been more widely investigated to extract p from issa due to the relatively simpler process and lower lost the leaching agents include inorganic acids organic acids alkali and chelating agents inorganic acids especially h2so4 have been widely used because of low cost and high leaching efficiency of p from issa up to 84 3 100 0 table 1 franz 2008 biswas et al 2009 donatello et al 2010 xu et al 2012 ottosen et al 2013 fang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however a considerable amount of elements including al ca mg fe and heavy metals would be co dissolved into the leachate consequently the selective recovery of p from the leachate is desirable selective adsorption biswas et al 2009 precipitation franz 2008 ion exchange franz 2008 donatello et al 2010 xu et al 2012 have been applied for separation of p and heavy metals impurities from the leachate the final p bearing product could be struvite xu et al 2012 wang et al 2018 aluminum phosphate zhao et al 2013 calcium phosphate franz 2008 or technical grade phosphoric acid donatello et al 2010 among them struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o is an ideal recovery product from issa as it is a slow release crystal fertilizer which can be directly used for agricultural applications oxalic acid h2c2o4 as a strong organic acid with a first dissociation constant pka1 of 1 252 also shows a high p leaching efficiency for issa atienza martínez et al 2014 fang et al 2018 and it is milder than h2so4 but little information is available with regards to the further recovery of p from the h2c2o4 leaching solution on the other hand most of the reported literature directly used issa incinerated at 850 c as the raw material for the recovery p the transformation of the p bearing phases with different incineration temperatures has seldom been reported the incineration temperature will affect the physical chemical properties of the issa thus affecting the leaching efficiency of p in this study the relationship between the leaching efficiency of p from issa and the existing p phases at different temperatures 600 900 c was investigated h2so4 and h2c2o4 were used as the leaching agents to compare their p recovery efficiencies from the issa samples a three step process i e acid leaching purification and precipitation was conducted to obtain the final p recovery products from the two leaching systems the flow sheet of this study is shown in fig 1 2 materials

and 900 c for 2 h respectively and cooled naturally in the furnace to room temperatures because dioxin may be released at temperature below 600 c and melting of ash may occur at temperature above 900 c wang et al 2012 the incineration temperature range was set as 600 900 c 2 2 acid leaching experiments for the leaching experiments around 0 2 g of issa sample was mixed with 30 ml of h2so4 or h2c2o4

stirred at 150 rpm for 30 min and allowed to stand for 10 min the supernatant was then filtered by a 0 45 μm filter membrane and analyzed by icp oes for elemental concentrations and the precipitate was washed and dried at 35 c to obtain the struvite product for the h2c2o4 leachate after cer treatment the ph of the purified solution was adjusted to 9 0 by naoh and the precipitate was filtered

detection limits of some elements by icp and xrf analyses in present study are provided in table s1 the standards measurements and testing smt programme extraction protocol was applied to analyze phosphorus speciation in the issa samples xie et al 2011 xu et al 2015 according to this smt protocol the total p tp can be divided into organic p op and inorganic p ip and the ip includes apatite p ap calcium bound p and non apatite ip naip p bound to aluminum iron and manganese oxides and hydroxides the morphologies of the issa samples before and after acid leaching were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem ultra 55 zeiss germany the mineral phases of the rs issa samples and recovered products were identified by an x ray diffractometer xrd xrd 7000 shimadzu japan by using

inesa scientific instrument co ltd china 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of the issa samples 3 1 1 thermal behavior of the rs the thermal analysis result of the rs is shown in fig s2 the tg profile obtained from the rs could be divided into three stages of mass loss the first stage starts from ambient temperature to 120 c which corresponds to water loss 2 9 wt the second stage ranging from 120 to 600 c is the main combustion stage mass loss of 45 4 wt of volatile and semi volatile organic matters two continuous rate peaks can be observed in the dtg curve and a higher weight loss rate is at 300 c which might be related to the degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose yang et al 2018 the third stage ranging from 600 to 1000 c is the combustion and burnout stage of some refractory organics and inorganics in the sludge samples showing small a mass loss 3 1 2 chemical compositions of the rs and issa samples table 2 presents the chemical compositions of the rs and issa samples the inorganic matters in the rs mainly consisted of si al p fe ca mg and small amounts of heavy metals relatively high al content in the rs might be due to the use of polyaluminum chlorides pac as the precipitant for p removal in the sewage treatment process the p element contents in the issa samples were in the range of 55 0 57 6 mg g issa indicating that issa is a promising secondary phosphorus source after incineration the contents of main components in the issa samples were almost twice of that in the rs which stayed stable with increase in the incineration temperature it is consistent with fig s2 that nearly half of the rs was decomposed at 600 c it also indicates that most of inorganic substances were non volatile under these incineration temperatures the contents of p in the issa samples determined by icp are a little lower than that determined by xrf similar results were reported in literature which suggested that the digestion before icp analysis was incomplete ottosen et al 2013 also different digestion methods will greatly influence the analytical results biswas et al 2009 in this study the results determined by xrf were used for reference 3 1 3 distributions of p speciation in the issa samples the tp in the issa samples and its speciation under different incineration temperatures determined by the smt method are shown in fig 2 the p in the issa samples is almost entirely composed of inorganic p ip which is consistent with fig s2 that organic matters were almost completely decomposed above 600 c as the incineration temperature increased from 600 to 900 c part of the non apatite ip naip was converted to apatite p ap while the tp remains almost unchanged the mass ratio of naip to ip dropped from 71 9 wt at 600 c to 53 7 wt at 900 c it is consistent with literature that inorganic iron and aluminum phosphates in the sludge could react with calcium compounds and silica to form acid soluble calcium phosphates and acid insoluble fe2o3 and al2o3 cohen 2009 atienza martínez et al 2014 jin et al 2017 it can be noticed that the contents of tp in the issa samples determined by the smt method are close to those determined by the xrf and icp analyses indicating that the results are reliable 3 1 4 mineral compositions of the issa samples the xrd patterns of the issa samples incinerated at different temperatures are shown in fig 3 the main mineral phases in the issa samples incinerated at 600 and 700 c were quartz sio2 hematite fe2o3 iron phosphate fepo4 and aluminum phosphate alpo4 as the incineration temperature increased to 800 c the intensities of fepo4 and alpo4 peaks weakened and a new phase of magnesium calcium phosphate mg3ca3 po4 4 appeared indicating that ca2 in whitlockite ca3 po4 2 was partially substituted by mg2 li et al 2017 with the incineration temperature further increased whitlockite was detected at 850 and 900 c this result is consistent with fig 2 that naip was converted into ap with the increasing temperature since calcium phosphate was claimed to be easier to be leached by acids cohen 2009 atienza martínez et al 2014 kleemann et al 2017 higher incineration temperatures would be favorable for p recovery from issa 3 1 5 particle size and ph of the issa samples particle size distributions of the issa samples are shown in fig s3 issa samples incinerated at different temperatures had a close d50 value around 100 μm however the mass percent of small size particles 10 μm decreased with the increase in temperature indicating agglomeration may be gradually occurred at high temperatures the ph of the issa samples was increased slightly from 7 41 to 7 58 as the incineration temperature increased from 600 to 900 c 3 2 acid leaching of p from issa samples 3 2 1 effect of acid concentration possible reactions between inorganic phosphorus phases with acid are presented in equations 1 3 petzet et al 2012 the stoichiometric molar ratio of h p is 3 0 for extracting all p from the p bearing compounds however in actual leaching process other acid soluble compounds such as cao caco3 and mgo might also react with acid so the actual acid requirement will increase a method used by the us department of agriculture has been proposed to calculate the quantity of sulfuric acid required in a superphosphate fertilizer manufacture as shown in equation 4 franz 2008 the result was multiplied by 1 1 to ensure that phosphate was present as the h3po4 species applying equation 4 to the issa samples and considering the excess 10 acid the average acid requirement for the p leaching from issa samples incinerated at 600 900 c is around 34 3 g h2so4 100 g ash molar ratio of h p 3 9 to sufficiently extract p from the issa much more acid than the stoichiometric acid requirement was required as shown in table 1 1 ca3 po4 2 6h 3ca2 2h3po4 2 alpo4 3h al3 h3po4 3 fepo4 3h fe3 h3po4 4 h2so4 g 100 g issa 1 749 cao 0 962 al2o3 0 614 fe2o3 2 443 mgo 1 582 na2o 1 041 k2o 0 691 p2o5 1 225 so3 h2so4 and h2c2o4 with the same concentration were compared to extract p from issa samples incinerated at different temperatures and two acid concentration levels 0 02 and 0 05 mol l corresponding to h p molar ratios of 3 5 and 8 8 respectively calculated on the basis of h2so4 were applied the results are shown in fig 4 generally h2c2o4 exhibited better performance than h2so4 with regards to the leaching efficiency of p when the acid concentration was 0 02 mol l the p leaching efficiency of issa samples incinerated at 600 850 c was only around 60 which may be due to the insufficient h for extracting p when the incineration temperature was 900 c obvious decreases in the p leaching efficiency in both leaching systems were observed it is reported that hematite and quartz would form eutectics at 900 c shao et al 2007 which would result in severe sintering of particles thus inhibiting the acid from entering into the pores to react with p bearing compounds when the acid concentration was elevated to 0 05 mol l the p leaching efficiency was greatly enhanced however it decreased from 95 wt at 600 and 700 c to around 80 wt at 800 and 850 c and further decreased to less than 70 wt at 900 c in the h2so4 leaching system this phenomenon is inconsistent with the previous speculation that it would be easier to extract p from the issa samples incinerated at high temperatures which contained more acid soluble ap the possible reason will be presented later however the p leaching efficiency in the h2c2o4 leaching system kept as high as 100 wt with the incineration temperature increased from 600 to 850 c in spite of decreasing to 74 wt at 900 c due to the sintering phenomenon 3 2 2 leaching concentrations of key elements to further understand the leaching behavior of p changes of leaching molar concentrations of four key elements of p ca al and fe in the leachates of the issa samples incinerated at different temperatures leached by h2so4 and h2c2o4 with different concentrations of 0 02 and 0 05 mol l are presented in fig 5 according to the determination of the p speciation and p bearing phases of the issa samples incinerated at different temperatures figs 2 and 3 naip iron and aluminum phosphates would transform into more acid soluble calcium phosphates ap with increase in incineration temperature the leaching concentration of fe in fig 5 was very low because most of fe was present as acid insoluble fe2o3 in the issa samples as shown in fig 3 the p was mainly leached from the aluminum and calcium phosphates then according to equations 1 2 the molar concentration of p is supposed to be the sum of the molar concentration of al and 0 67 times the molar concentration of ca under the assumption that leaching was complete in the h2so4 leaching system fig 5 a b when incineration temperature was low 600 and 700 c the molar concentrations of al were obviously higher than those of p indicating the presence of a large amount of acid soluble aluminum containing compounds other than alpo4 those aluminum containing compounds may be amorphous aluminosilicate which was not identified by xrd after 800 c the molar concentration of al as well as fe significantly decreased partially due to the transformation of naip to ap however the molar concentration of ca did not increase with increasing incineration temperature as expected indicating that calcium phosphate was insufficiently reacted with acids to increase the leaching efficiency of p or the leached ca2 ions precipitated with sulfate ions to form gypsum cohen 2009 ottosen et al 2013 leaching experiments were conducted to compare the p extraction from the issa samples by hcl and h2so4 with the same concentration of h the results of p leaching efficiency and concentration of ca2 in both leachates were very close data not shown indicating no gypsum was formed probably because the low acid concentration in this study therefore it is concluded that calcium phosphate in the issa samples incinerated at high temperatures did not react sufficiently with h2so4 to release p thus decreasing the p leaching efficiency the morphological images of the issa samples incinerated at 600 and 800 c before and after h2so4 leaching with concentration of 0 05 mol l are compared in fig 6 issa sample incinerated at 600 c fig 6 a exhibited a more porous and irregular surface than that incinerated at 800 c fig 6 b accordingly the bet specific surface area of the issa sample dramatically decreased from 27 9 incinerated at 600 c to 2 2 cm2 g incinerated at 800 c at higher incineration temperatures alkali metals are easy to react with sio2 to form low melting silicates shao et al 2007 which could be attributable to the blocking of pore structures in the issa samples and dramatically decreasing of surface area after reacting with acid acid soluble compounds in the issa sample incinerated at 600 c were leached out and the leaching residue still showed a porous morphology fig 6 c however the surface of the issa sample incinerated at 800 c after leaching showed a relatively compact structure fig 6 d which would inhibit some inner p bearing compounds to contact with h2so4 thus resulting in the decreasing of leaching efficiency of p as shown in fig 4 b to improve the leaching efficiency of p from issa incinerated at a temperature 800 c by h2so4 mechanical ball milling of issa powder to reduce particle size may be a feasible pretreatment method compared with the molar concentrations of key elements in the h2so4 leaching system the molar concentrations of ca in the h2c2o4 leaching system were greatly reduced fig 5 c d the ksp values of calcium oxalate and calcium sulfate are 2 32 10 9 and 4 93 10 5 respectively consequently calcium oxalate is much easier to precipitate promoting the chemical equilibrium of the reactions of acid dissociation equation 5 and calcium phosphate dissolution equation 6 to move towards the right direction thus resulting in a higher p leaching efficiency as shown in fig 4 b it also suggests that h2c2o4 has a distinct advantage over h2so4 in removing ca2 via the precipitation of calcium oxalate equation 7 and total equation 8 5 h2c2o4 2coo 2h 6 6h ca3 po4 2 3ca2 2h3po4 7 ca2 2coo ca coo 2 8 3h2c2o4 ca3 po4 2 3ca coo 2 2h3po4 the sem image of the leaching residue from issa sample incinerated at 800 c after h2c2o4 leaching with concentration of 0 05 mol l is shown in fig 6 e it is obvious that many irregular crystals were formed the eds analysis of the crystal verifies its main composition of o c and ca elements which are speculated as calcium oxalate hydrate fig 6 f xrd patterns of the leaching residue of the issa sample incinerated at 800 c after leaching by h2so4 and h2c2o4 with concentration of 0 05 mol l are presented in fig s4 after acid leaching most of the p bearing minerals were dissolved and the main mineral phases were quartz and hematite in the h2so4 leaching residue a small amount of alpo4 still existed in the leaching residues possibly because it is more soluble in an alkaline solution rather than in an acid solution li et al 2018 obvious characteristic peaks of calcium oxalate hydrate were identified in the h2c2o4 leaching residue which is consistent with the sem image in fig 6 e in addition most of the si and al elements were remained in the leaching residue which could be potentially used as supplementary cementitious materials li et al 2018 the pozzolanic activity of the leaching residue will be assessed in our future work 3 2 3 co dissolved heavy metals for the co dissolved heavy metal elements zn cu pb as and cr their concentrations showed a steep decreasing tendency with increase in incineration temperature in both leaching systems fig s5 especially after 800 c those trace heavy metals stayed at very low concentration levels this result is similar to those results in literature that higher incineration temperatures are beneficial for the solidification of heavy metals li et al 2016 consequently 800 c was chosen for subsequent leaching experiments 3 2 4 effect of liquid to solid ratio effects of liquid to solid l s ratio on the leaching efficiency of p of the issa sample incinerated at 800 c by h2so4 and h2c2o4 with the same concentration are presented in fig 7 in this experiment the acid volume was fixed at 30 ml while the mass of ash increased with the decreasing l s ratio meanwhile in order to maintain the h p moral ratio of 8 8 calculated on the basis of h2so4 the acid concentration increased from 0 05 to 0 25 mol l with the l s ratio decreased from 150 to 30 ml g with the same h p molar ratio the leaching efficiency of p increased with the decreasing l s ratio in the h2so4 leaching system and it kept as high as 100 wt in the h2c2o4 leaching system the concentrations of heavy metal impurities also increased with the decreasing l s ratio in both systems fig s6 this is because the mass transfer between solid and liquid phases could be enhanced by increasing the acid concentration taking into account both the higher p leaching efficiency and lower equipment cost at a lower l s ratio 30 ml g of l s ratio and the corresponding acid concentration of 0 25 mol l were selected for the p recovery experiment from issa 3 3 recovery of p from the acid leachate p was recovered from the issa sample through three steps of acid leaching purification and precipitation and the mass balances of key elements of p al ca and fe in the h2so4 and h2c2o4 recovery systems are shown in tables 3 4 concentrations of heavy metals in the solutions during the recovery processes are shown in table s2 firstly 3 0 g of the issa sample incinerated at 800 c was leached with 90 0 ml of h2so4 or h2c2o4 with concentration of 0 25 mol l the p leaching efficiencies in the h2so4 and h2c2o4 leaching systems were 82 3 and 92 8 wt respectively tables 3 4 which are lower than 91 1 and 100 0 wt in fig 7 with 0 2 g of the issa sample as the leaching object it indicates that the leaching of p in practical amplification leaching process should be optimized by prolonging contact time or strengthening the mass transfer between solid and liquid phases the h2so4 and h2c2o4 leachates were then treated with cer to obtain the purified p rich solution after cer treatment more than 95 1 of impurities were removed by cer in the h2so4 leachate table 3 however it is interesting to find that al and fe were hardly removed by cer in the h2c2o4 leachate table 4 it can be explained by the distributed species of al and fe elements in the al3 fe3 c2o4 2 po4 3 system simulated by medusa software as shown in fig 8 with the presence of oxalic ions al3 and fe3 would mainly exist as al c2o4 2 al c2o4 3 3 fe c2o4 2 and fe c2o4 3 3 complexes in an acidic environment which could not be removed by cationic resin it should also be noted that about 14 6 and 10 4 wt of p element was lost during the cer treatment of the h2so4 and h2c2o4 leachates respectively tables 3 4 this may be because under acidic conditions p element mainly present as h2po4 anion simulated by medusa software and it would combine with some positive charged metal ions to form m h2po4 n 1 complexes m represents metal ions like ca2 mg2 fe3 al3 n represents the valence of metal m then part of p was simultaneously removed during the cer treatment the purified p rich h2so4 leachate was further used for synthesizing struvite more than 98 3 wt of p precipitated table 3 and struvite pdf no 01 075 0674 was identified as the main crystal phase of the obtained product by xrd pattern depicted in fig 9 a quantitative xrd analysis demonstrated that the struvite product has a high purity of 90 sem image of the struvite shows rod like crystals which is consistent with literature yan and shih 2016 wang et al 2018 for the h2c2o4 leachate after treatment by cer al and fe elements were supposed to be removed by precipitation as hydroxides according to the phase diagram in fig 8 the ph was controlled at 9 0 to avoid further dissolution of al oh 3 under alkaline conditions however the results showed that around 76 0 99 3 and 99 5 wt of p al and fe elements precipitated table 4 suggesting the formation of al p and fe p precipitates in addition to al oh 3 and fe oh 3 precipitates different from literature stating that al p and fe p precipitates was formed at ph of 3 0 5 0 petzet et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 javid et al 2016 budhathoki et al 2018 the formation of complexes between al3 fe3 and oxalic ions greatly affects the precipitation condition the ksp values of al oh 3 alpo4 fe oh 3 and fepo4 are 1 30 10 33 9 84 10 21 2 79 10 39 and 9 91 10 16 respectively the aluminum and iron hydroxides are much easier to form than their phosphate precipitates the total reduced molar concentration of al 51 5 mmol l and fe 1 5 mmol l was much higher than that of p 39 2 mmol l verifying the precipitates may be a mixture of al oh 3 fe oh 3 alpo4 and fepo4 it could also be speculated that p which present mainly as hpo4 2 at ph 9 was adsorbed by the positively charged aluminum and iron hydroxides to form aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates peng et al 2007 yan and shih 2016 no crystalline peaks were observed in the xrd pattern of the recovered product fig 9 b and the sem image shows very irregular shapes both indicating aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates are amorphous which are consistent with literature zhao et al 2013 budhathoki et al 2018 wang et al 2018 some authors suggested that the alpo4 and al oh 3 precipitates could serve as potential fertilizers for crop growth zhao et al 2013 however some others claimed that al p and fe p precipitates could scarcely be absorbed by plants and not suitable as p fertilizer wang et al 2018 the recovered alpo4 based product could also be possibly used in industrial applications such as acting as a binder for ceramic coating he et al 2004 and as an additive in fire retardant materials yang et al 2018 heavy metal analysis results of two kinds of p recovery products show that only cu and zn were detected and their contents were 10 6 and 5 4 mg kg respectively in the struvite product and 30 5 and 2 2 mg kg respectively in the aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates which are below the limiting values of fertilizer standards in most countries xu et al 2012 overall approximately 70 0 wt of p in the issa sample incinerated at 800 c could be recovered as struvite product by the sequence of h2so4 leaching cer purification and struvite precipitation although the total p recovery efficiency was a little lower than that reported literature wang et al 2018 mainly because the loss of p during the cer treatment the product with a higher purity will have better application prospects on the other hand approximately 65 5 wt of p could be recovered as aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates by h2c2o4 leaching cer purification and ph adjustment 4 conclusions in this study h2so4 and h2c2o4 were compared to recover p from issa through three steps of acid leaching cer purification and precipitation the main findings of this study include the followings 1 the p was mainly existed as inorganic form in the issa and part of naip was converted to ap with the incineration temperature increased from 600 to 900 c 2 with the concentration of 0 05 mol l and l s ratio of 150 ml g the p leaching efficiency by h2so4 could reach 95 wt for the issa samples incinerated at 600 and 700 c however it continuously decreased when the incineration temperature was higher than 800 c because the sintering and melting of ash particles h2c2o4 exhibited a better performance than h2so4 which could extract 100 wt of p from the issa samples incinerated at 600 850 c 3 in the amplification recovery process more than 95 1 wt of impurities in the h2so4 leachate were removed by cer however cer were not able to remove most al and fe elements in the h2c2o4 leachate due to the formation of anionic complexes between al3 fe3 and oxalic ions 4 high purity struvite product was synthesized from the purified h2so4 leachate and amorphous aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates were obtained from the h2c2o4 leachate 5 overall approximately 70 0 and 65 5 wt of p in the issa sample incinerated at 800 c could be recovered in h2so4 and h2c2o4 recovery systems respectively further studies should be conducted to enhance the leaching efficiency in h2so4 leaching system and alternative heavy metal purification method rather than cer should be developed to realize high recovery

18779,wet chemical approach is widely applied for p extraction from incinerated sewage sludge ash issa due to the relatively simple process and low lost in this study h2so4 and h2c2o4 were compared to recover p from issa through three steps of acid leaching cation exchange resin cer purification and precipitation transformations of p speciation and mineral phases in issa from 600 to 900 c were studied the results showed that the issa samples were mainly composed of inorganic p ip and part of non apatite ip naip mainly alpo4 would transform to apatite p ap ca3 po4 2 with the increase in temperature the ratio of naip to ip dropped from 71 9 at 600 c to 53 7 at 900 c effect of acid concentration on the leaching efficiency of p from the issa samples incinerated at different temperatures by h2so4 and h2c2o4 was investigated and the leaching behaviors of key elements of p ca al and fe were compared h2c2o4 exhibited a better performance than h2so4 for the leaching efficiency of p severe sintering of ash particles occurred at temperature 800 c inhibited the p leaching by h2so4 during cer purification the impurity elements in the h2so4 leachate were easily removed by cer whereas the al and fe elements in the h2c2o4 leachate were hardly removed due to the formation of anionic complexes between al3 fe3 and oxalic ions finally high purity struvite product was synthesized from the purified h2so4 leachate which could be directly utilized as a fertilizer with negligible environmental risk amorphous aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates were obtained from the h2c2o4 leachate this study provides insights for p recovery from issa samples by different acid leaching systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus recovery incinerated sewage sludge ash acid leaching purification struvite 1 introduction phosphorous p is an indispensable element for all living organisms and human beings it plays a significant role in industrial and agricultural development in recent years the demand for phosphate is continuously increasing with rapid development in economy li et al 2015 however the phosphate ore resource in the worldwide is non renewable and is estimated to be depleted in 50 100 years cordell et al 2009 although the phosphate ore reserve in china ranks among the top three in the world the grade of ore is low and difficult to extract therefore p has been listed as one of the 20 minerals that cannot meet the demand of chinese economic growth li et al 2015 the phosphate ore is mainly processed into fertilizers and subsequently flows through the food production and consumption system however more than 80 of the p bearing fertilizer is not utilized and enters into natural water bodies mayer et al 2016 peng et al 2018 consequently p recovery from wastewater has attracted more and more attentions at present most of the sewage treatment plants apply enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr or chemical precipitation processes to treat p containing wastewater more than 90 of the phosphorus in raw wastewater will finally end up with sewage sludge however the sewage sludge cannot be directly applied for agricultural use because it also contains large amounts of organic inorganic pollutants sewage sludge incineration is increasing because it has many advantages including significant volume reduction up to 80 90 destruction of organic micro pollutants and pathogens and energy recovery after incineration most of p is concentrated in the incinerated sewage sludge ash issa and its content can vary from 10 0 to 25 7 wt as p2o5 which is comparable to the p content in phosphate ore 5 40 wt fang et al 2018 however issa often contains toxic heavy metals and the plant availability of p in issa is relatively low it is challenging to directly reutilize issa as fertilizers consequently various methods have been developed to recover p from issa removing heavy metals from issa by thermochemical treatment with inorganic mgcl2 gaseous hydrochloric acid and organic chlorinating agents polyvinylchloride at high temperatures 850 1100 c has been investigated vogel and adam 2011 vogel et al 2013 li et al 2015 in these methods most of heavy metals would be evaporated as vapors of heavy metal chlorides and the p rich residue would be post treated by acids to increase its plant availability for fertilizer applications treating issa thermochemically with sodium and potassium additives under reducing conditions to transform p bearing minerals into plant available phosphates has also been investigated herzel et al 2016 moreover some researchers investigated the recovery of p from issa through heat treatment by applying carbon as the reducing agent under inert atmospheres followed by high gradient magnetic separation hgms process córdova udaeta et al 2017 the p enriched in the nonmagnetic rich fraction was further recovered by flotation compared with heat treatment wet chemical approaches have been more widely investigated to extract p from issa due to the relatively simpler process and lower lost the leaching agents include inorganic acids organic acids alkali and chelating agents inorganic acids especially h2so4 have been widely used because of low cost and high leaching efficiency of p from issa up to 84 3 100 0 table 1 franz 2008 biswas et al 2009 donatello et al 2010 xu et al 2012 ottosen et al 2013 fang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 however a considerable amount of elements including al ca mg fe and heavy metals would be co dissolved into the leachate consequently the selective recovery of p from the leachate is desirable selective adsorption biswas et al 2009 precipitation franz 2008 ion exchange franz 2008 donatello et al 2010 xu et al 2012 have been applied for separation of p and heavy metals impurities from the leachate the final p bearing product could be struvite xu et al 2012 wang et al 2018 aluminum phosphate zhao et al 2013 calcium phosphate franz 2008 or technical grade phosphoric acid donatello et al 2010 among them struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o is an ideal recovery product from issa as it is a slow release crystal fertilizer which can be directly used for agricultural applications oxalic acid h2c2o4 as a strong organic acid with a first dissociation constant pka1 of 1 252 also shows a high p leaching efficiency for issa atienza martínez et al 2014 fang et al 2018 and it is milder than h2so4 but little information is available with regards to the further recovery of p from the h2c2o4 leaching solution on the other hand most of the reported literature directly used issa incinerated at 850 c as the raw material for the recovery p the transformation of the p bearing phases with different incineration temperatures has seldom been reported the incineration temperature will affect the physical chemical properties of the issa thus affecting the leaching efficiency of p in this study the relationship between the leaching efficiency of p from issa and the existing p phases at different temperatures 600 900 c was investigated h2so4 and h2c2o4 were used as the leaching agents to compare their p recovery efficiencies from the issa samples a three step process i e acid leaching purification and precipitation was conducted to obtain the final p recovery products from the two leaching systems the flow sheet of this study is shown in fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw sludge and issa samples preparation raw sludge rs with a water content of 97 2 wt was waste activated sludge collected from tangxun lake municipal wastewater treatment plant in wuhan china the sewage treatment at this plant is a conventional activated sludge process the process diagram of the plant is shown in fig s1 supplementary material a proximate analysis was conducted following the chinese national standards of proximate analysis of coal gb t 212 2008 the ash content volatile content and fixed carbon content of the rs were 50 2 40 7 and 3 5 wt respectively the rs sample was first dried under 105 c for 24 h and then crushed milled and screened to 0 2 mm in size five issa samples were prepared by incinerating the dried rs in a muffle furnace at 600 700 800 850 and 900 c for 2 h respectively and cooled naturally in the furnace to room temperatures because dioxin may be released at temperature below 600 c and melting of ash may occur at temperature above 900 c wang et al 2012 the incineration temperature range was set as 600 900 c 2 2 acid leaching experiments for the leaching experiments around 0 2 g of issa sample was mixed with 30 ml of h2so4 or h2c2o4 solution at a liquid to solid l s ratio of 150 ml g with the same concentration of 0 02 or 0 05 mol l leaching was performed in a conical flask placed on a thermostated shaker at 120 rpm at 25 1 c for 2 h after leaching the mixture was separated by 0 45 μm filter membrane concentrations of p and other elements in the filtrates were determined by an inductive coupled plasma emission spectrometer icp oes perking elmer 8300 usa also the element concentrations in the leached solid residue were measured by icp oes after acid digestion 2 3 recovery of p from the acid leachate the separation of impurity elements from p in the leachate is the prerequisite for high purity recovery product the acid leachate was first treated with a cation exchange resin cer732 sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china to remove most of co dissolved heavy metals xu et al 2012 a specific amount of cer was added to the leachate with an l s ratio of 2 ml g the mixture was stirred at 300 rpm for 30 min and then filtered to obtain the purified p rich solution the element concentrations in the solution before and after cer purification were measured by icp oes mgcl2 6h2o and nh4cl were added as the magnesium and nitrogen sources into the purified p rich h2so4 leachate for struvite precipitation the molar ratio of n mg p was controlled at 1 1 1 and the ph was controlled at 9 0 by naoh the mixture was stirred at 150 rpm for 30 min and allowed to stand for 10 min the supernatant was then filtered by a 0 45 μm filter membrane and analyzed by icp oes for elemental concentrations and the precipitate was washed and dried at 35 c to obtain the struvite product for the h2c2o4 leachate after cer treatment the ph of the purified solution was adjusted to 9 0 by naoh and the precipitate was filtered collected and dried at 60 c to obtain the final recovery product the concentrations of p and impurities in both recovered products were determined by icp oes after acid digestion 2 4 characterization methods the thermogravimetric tg and derivative thermogravimetric dtg profiles of the rs was performed in a pt crucible using a simultaneous thermal analyzer ta q600 usa in the range of 10 1000 c and at a ramping rate of 10 c min under an air atmosphere with a gas flow rate of 100 ml min chemical compositions of the rs and issa samples were determined by an x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf axiosmax panalytical b v netherland before xrf measurement each sample was melted to two parallel glass fuse pieces by a high frequency melting furnace analymate v4d beijing jingyuan century technology co ltd china the average values of the measured compositions were then calculated the concentrations of major elements and trace heavy metals of the rs and issa samples were also measured by icp oes after pretreatment 0 025 g of sample was mixed with 4 ml hno3 200 μl hf and 4 ml h2o and heated at 150 c for 1 h by a microwave digestion system mds 6g sineo china sandroni et al 2003 the detection limits of some elements by icp and xrf analyses in present study are provided in table s1 the standards measurements and testing smt programme extraction protocol was applied to analyze phosphorus speciation in the issa samples xie et al 2011 xu et al 2015 according to this smt protocol the total p tp can be divided into organic p op and inorganic p ip and the ip includes apatite p ap calcium bound p and non apatite ip naip p bound to aluminum iron and manganese oxides and hydroxides the morphologies of the issa samples before and after acid leaching were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem ultra 55 zeiss germany the mineral phases of the rs issa samples and recovered products were identified by an x ray diffractometer xrd xrd 7000 shimadzu japan by using cu kα radiation λ 1 54 å at 40 kv and 30 ma with a scan rate of 8 min for 2θ in the range from 10 to 75 the specific surface area of issa sample was analyzed by a bet surface area analyzer tristar 3020 micromeritics usa based on the nitrogen adsorption and desorption method particle size distribution of issa samples was measured by a particle size analyzer bt 9300h dandong baite instrument co ltd china the ph values of the issa samples were measured by suspending ash in deionized water at an l s ratio of 5 ml g after agitation for 1 h ph of supernatant was measured by a ph meter phs 3e inesa scientific instrument co ltd china 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of the issa samples 3 1 1 thermal behavior of the rs the thermal analysis result of the rs is shown in fig s2 the tg profile obtained from the rs could be divided into three stages of mass loss the first stage starts from ambient temperature to 120 c which corresponds to water loss 2 9 wt the second stage ranging from 120 to 600 c is the main combustion stage mass loss of 45 4 wt of volatile and semi volatile organic matters two continuous rate peaks can be observed in the dtg curve and a higher weight loss rate is at 300 c which might be related to the degradation of hemicellulose and cellulose yang et al 2018 the third stage ranging from 600 to 1000 c is the combustion and burnout stage of some refractory organics and inorganics in the sludge samples showing small a mass loss 3 1 2 chemical compositions of the rs and issa samples table 2 presents the chemical compositions of the rs and issa samples the inorganic matters in the rs mainly consisted of si al p fe ca mg and small amounts of heavy metals relatively high al content in the rs might be due to the use of polyaluminum chlorides pac as the precipitant for p removal in the sewage treatment process the p element contents in the issa samples were in the range of 55 0 57 6 mg g issa indicating that issa is a promising secondary phosphorus source after incineration the contents of main components in the issa samples were almost twice of that in the rs which stayed stable with increase in the incineration temperature it is consistent with fig s2 that nearly half of the rs was decomposed at 600 c it also indicates that most of inorganic substances were non volatile under these incineration temperatures the contents of p in the issa samples determined by icp are a little lower than that determined by xrf similar results were reported in literature which suggested that the digestion before icp analysis was incomplete ottosen et al 2013 also different digestion methods will greatly influence the analytical results biswas et al 2009 in this study the results determined by xrf were used for reference 3 1 3 distributions of p speciation in the issa samples the tp in the issa samples and its speciation under different incineration temperatures determined by the smt method are shown in fig 2 the p in the issa samples is almost entirely composed of inorganic p ip which is consistent with fig s2 that organic matters were almost completely decomposed above 600 c as the incineration temperature increased from 600 to 900 c part of the non apatite ip naip was converted to apatite p ap while the tp remains almost unchanged the mass ratio of naip to ip dropped from 71 9 wt at 600 c to 53 7 wt at 900 c it is consistent with literature that inorganic iron and aluminum phosphates in the sludge could react with calcium compounds and silica to form acid soluble calcium phosphates and acid insoluble fe2o3 and al2o3 cohen 2009 atienza martínez et al 2014 jin et al 2017 it can be noticed that the contents of tp in the issa samples determined by the smt method are close to those determined by the xrf and icp analyses indicating that the results are reliable 3 1 4 mineral compositions of the issa samples the xrd patterns of the issa samples incinerated at different temperatures are shown in fig 3 the main mineral phases in the issa samples incinerated at 600 and 700 c were quartz sio2 hematite fe2o3 iron phosphate fepo4 and aluminum phosphate alpo4 as the incineration temperature increased to 800 c the intensities of fepo4 and alpo4 peaks weakened and a new phase of magnesium calcium phosphate mg3ca3 po4 4 appeared indicating that ca2 in whitlockite ca3 po4 2 was partially substituted by mg2 li et al 2017 with the incineration temperature further increased whitlockite was detected at 850 and 900 c this result is consistent with fig 2 that naip was converted into ap with the increasing temperature since calcium phosphate was claimed to be easier to be leached by acids cohen 2009 atienza martínez et al 2014 kleemann et al 2017 higher incineration temperatures would be favorable for p recovery from issa 3 1 5 particle size and ph of the issa samples particle size distributions of the issa samples are shown in fig s3 issa samples incinerated at different temperatures had a close d50 value around 100 μm however the mass percent of small size particles 10 μm decreased with the increase in temperature indicating agglomeration may be gradually occurred at high temperatures the ph of the issa samples was increased slightly from 7 41 to 7 58 as the incineration temperature increased from 600 to 900 c 3 2 acid leaching of p from issa samples 3 2 1 effect of acid concentration possible reactions between inorganic phosphorus phases with acid are presented in equations 1 3 petzet et al 2012 the stoichiometric molar ratio of h p is 3 0 for extracting all p from the p bearing compounds however in actual leaching process other acid soluble compounds such as cao caco3 and mgo might also react with acid so the actual acid requirement will increase a method used by the us department of agriculture has been proposed to calculate the quantity of sulfuric acid required in a superphosphate fertilizer manufacture as shown in equation 4 franz 2008 the result was multiplied by 1 1 to ensure that phosphate was present as the h3po4 species applying equation 4 to the issa samples and considering the excess 10 acid the average acid requirement for the p leaching from issa samples incinerated at 600 900 c is around 34 3 g h2so4 100 g ash molar ratio of h p 3 9 to sufficiently extract p from the issa much more acid than the stoichiometric acid requirement was required as shown in table 1 1 ca3 po4 2 6h 3ca2 2h3po4 2 alpo4 3h al3 h3po4 3 fepo4 3h fe3 h3po4 4 h2so4 g 100 g issa 1 749 cao 0 962 al2o3 0 614 fe2o3 2 443 mgo 1 582 na2o 1 041 k2o 0 691 p2o5 1 225 so3 h2so4 and h2c2o4 with the same concentration were compared to extract p from issa samples incinerated at different temperatures and two acid concentration levels 0 02 and 0 05 mol l corresponding to h p molar ratios of 3 5 and 8 8 respectively calculated on the basis of h2so4 were applied the results are shown in fig 4 generally h2c2o4 exhibited better performance than h2so4 with regards to the leaching efficiency of p when the acid concentration was 0 02 mol l the p leaching efficiency of issa samples incinerated at 600 850 c was only around 60 which may be due to the insufficient h for extracting p when the incineration temperature was 900 c obvious decreases in the p leaching efficiency in both leaching systems were observed it is reported that hematite and quartz would form eutectics at 900 c shao et al 2007 which would result in severe sintering of particles thus inhibiting the acid from entering into the pores to react with p bearing compounds when the acid concentration was elevated to 0 05 mol l the p leaching efficiency was greatly enhanced however it decreased from 95 wt at 600 and 700 c to around 80 wt at 800 and 850 c and further decreased to less than 70 wt at 900 c in the h2so4 leaching system this phenomenon is inconsistent with the previous speculation that it would be easier to extract p from the issa samples incinerated at high temperatures which contained more acid soluble ap the possible reason will be presented later however the p leaching efficiency in the h2c2o4 leaching system kept as high as 100 wt with the incineration temperature increased from 600 to 850 c in spite of decreasing to 74 wt at 900 c due to the sintering phenomenon 3 2 2 leaching concentrations of key elements to further understand the leaching behavior of p changes of leaching molar concentrations of four key elements of p ca al and fe in the leachates of the issa samples incinerated at different temperatures leached by h2so4 and h2c2o4 with different concentrations of 0 02 and 0 05 mol l are presented in fig 5 according to the determination of the p speciation and p bearing phases of the issa samples incinerated at different temperatures figs 2 and 3 naip iron and aluminum phosphates would transform into more acid soluble calcium phosphates ap with increase in incineration temperature the leaching concentration of fe in fig 5 was very low because most of fe was present as acid insoluble fe2o3 in the issa samples as shown in fig 3 the p was mainly leached from the aluminum and calcium phosphates then according to equations 1 2 the molar concentration of p is supposed to be the sum of the molar concentration of al and 0 67 times the molar concentration of ca under the assumption that leaching was complete in the h2so4 leaching system fig 5 a b when incineration temperature was low 600 and 700 c the molar concentrations of al were obviously higher than those of p indicating the presence of a large amount of acid soluble aluminum containing compounds other than alpo4 those aluminum containing compounds may be amorphous aluminosilicate which was not identified by xrd after 800 c the molar concentration of al as well as fe significantly decreased partially due to the transformation of naip to ap however the molar concentration of ca did not increase with increasing incineration temperature as expected indicating that calcium phosphate was insufficiently reacted with acids to increase the leaching efficiency of p or the leached ca2 ions precipitated with sulfate ions to form gypsum cohen 2009 ottosen et al 2013 leaching experiments were conducted to compare the p extraction from the issa samples by hcl and h2so4 with the same concentration of h the results of p leaching efficiency and concentration of ca2 in both leachates were very close data not shown indicating no gypsum was formed probably because the low acid concentration in this study therefore it is concluded that calcium phosphate in the issa samples incinerated at high temperatures did not react sufficiently with h2so4 to release p thus decreasing the p leaching efficiency the morphological images of the issa samples incinerated at 600 and 800 c before and after h2so4 leaching with concentration of 0 05 mol l are compared in fig 6 issa sample incinerated at 600 c fig 6 a exhibited a more porous and irregular surface than that incinerated at 800 c fig 6 b accordingly the bet specific surface area of the issa sample dramatically decreased from 27 9 incinerated at 600 c to 2 2 cm2 g incinerated at 800 c at higher incineration temperatures alkali metals are easy to react with sio2 to form low melting silicates shao et al 2007 which could be attributable to the blocking of pore structures in the issa samples and dramatically decreasing of surface area after reacting with acid acid soluble compounds in the issa sample incinerated at 600 c were leached out and the leaching residue still showed a porous morphology fig 6 c however the surface of the issa sample incinerated at 800 c after leaching showed a relatively compact structure fig 6 d which would inhibit some inner p bearing compounds to contact with h2so4 thus resulting in the decreasing of leaching efficiency of p as shown in fig 4 b to improve the leaching efficiency of p from issa incinerated at a temperature 800 c by h2so4 mechanical ball milling of issa powder to reduce particle size may be a feasible pretreatment method compared with the molar concentrations of key elements in the h2so4 leaching system the molar concentrations of ca in the h2c2o4 leaching system were greatly reduced fig 5 c d the ksp values of calcium oxalate and calcium sulfate are 2 32 10 9 and 4 93 10 5 respectively consequently calcium oxalate is much easier to precipitate promoting the chemical equilibrium of the reactions of acid dissociation equation 5 and calcium phosphate dissolution equation 6 to move towards the right direction thus resulting in a higher p leaching efficiency as shown in fig 4 b it also suggests that h2c2o4 has a distinct advantage over h2so4 in removing ca2 via the precipitation of calcium oxalate equation 7 and total equation 8 5 h2c2o4 2coo 2h 6 6h ca3 po4 2 3ca2 2h3po4 7 ca2 2coo ca coo 2 8 3h2c2o4 ca3 po4 2 3ca coo 2 2h3po4 the sem image of the leaching residue from issa sample incinerated at 800 c after h2c2o4 leaching with concentration of 0 05 mol l is shown in fig 6 e it is obvious that many irregular crystals were formed the eds analysis of the crystal verifies its main composition of o c and ca elements which are speculated as calcium oxalate hydrate fig 6 f xrd patterns of the leaching residue of the issa sample incinerated at 800 c after leaching by h2so4 and h2c2o4 with concentration of 0 05 mol l are presented in fig s4 after acid leaching most of the p bearing minerals were dissolved and the main mineral phases were quartz and hematite in the h2so4 leaching residue a small amount of alpo4 still existed in the leaching residues possibly because it is more soluble in an alkaline solution rather than in an acid solution li et al 2018 obvious characteristic peaks of calcium oxalate hydrate were identified in the h2c2o4 leaching residue which is consistent with the sem image in fig 6 e in addition most of the si and al elements were remained in the leaching residue which could be potentially used as supplementary cementitious materials li et al 2018 the pozzolanic activity of the leaching residue will be assessed in our future work 3 2 3 co dissolved heavy metals for the co dissolved heavy metal elements zn cu pb as and cr their concentrations showed a steep decreasing tendency with increase in incineration temperature in both leaching systems fig s5 especially after 800 c those trace heavy metals stayed at very low concentration levels this result is similar to those results in literature that higher incineration temperatures are beneficial for the solidification of heavy metals li et al 2016 consequently 800 c was chosen for subsequent leaching experiments 3 2 4 effect of liquid to solid ratio effects of liquid to solid l s ratio on the leaching efficiency of p of the issa sample incinerated at 800 c by h2so4 and h2c2o4 with the same concentration are presented in fig 7 in this experiment the acid volume was fixed at 30 ml while the mass of ash increased with the decreasing l s ratio meanwhile in order to maintain the h p moral ratio of 8 8 calculated on the basis of h2so4 the acid concentration increased from 0 05 to 0 25 mol l with the l s ratio decreased from 150 to 30 ml g with the same h p molar ratio the leaching efficiency of p increased with the decreasing l s ratio in the h2so4 leaching system and it kept as high as 100 wt in the h2c2o4 leaching system the concentrations of heavy metal impurities also increased with the decreasing l s ratio in both systems fig s6 this is because the mass transfer between solid and liquid phases could be enhanced by increasing the acid concentration taking into account both the higher p leaching efficiency and lower equipment cost at a lower l s ratio 30 ml g of l s ratio and the corresponding acid concentration of 0 25 mol l were selected for the p recovery experiment from issa 3 3 recovery of p from the acid leachate p was recovered from the issa sample through three steps of acid leaching purification and precipitation and the mass balances of key elements of p al ca and fe in the h2so4 and h2c2o4 recovery systems are shown in tables 3 4 concentrations of heavy metals in the solutions during the recovery processes are shown in table s2 firstly 3 0 g of the issa sample incinerated at 800 c was leached with 90 0 ml of h2so4 or h2c2o4 with concentration of 0 25 mol l the p leaching efficiencies in the h2so4 and h2c2o4 leaching systems were 82 3 and 92 8 wt respectively tables 3 4 which are lower than 91 1 and 100 0 wt in fig 7 with 0 2 g of the issa sample as the leaching object it indicates that the leaching of p in practical amplification leaching process should be optimized by prolonging contact time or strengthening the mass transfer between solid and liquid phases the h2so4 and h2c2o4 leachates were then treated with cer to obtain the purified p rich solution after cer treatment more than 95 1 of impurities were removed by cer in the h2so4 leachate table 3 however it is interesting to find that al and fe were hardly removed by cer in the h2c2o4 leachate table 4 it can be explained by the distributed species of al and fe elements in the al3 fe3 c2o4 2 po4 3 system simulated by medusa software as shown in fig 8 with the presence of oxalic ions al3 and fe3 would mainly exist as al c2o4 2 al c2o4 3 3 fe c2o4 2 and fe c2o4 3 3 complexes in an acidic environment which could not be removed by cationic resin it should also be noted that about 14 6 and 10 4 wt of p element was lost during the cer treatment of the h2so4 and h2c2o4 leachates respectively tables 3 4 this may be because under acidic conditions p element mainly present as h2po4 anion simulated by medusa software and it would combine with some positive charged metal ions to form m h2po4 n 1 complexes m represents metal ions like ca2 mg2 fe3 al3 n represents the valence of metal m then part of p was simultaneously removed during the cer treatment the purified p rich h2so4 leachate was further used for synthesizing struvite more than 98 3 wt of p precipitated table 3 and struvite pdf no 01 075 0674 was identified as the main crystal phase of the obtained product by xrd pattern depicted in fig 9 a quantitative xrd analysis demonstrated that the struvite product has a high purity of 90 sem image of the struvite shows rod like crystals which is consistent with literature yan and shih 2016 wang et al 2018 for the h2c2o4 leachate after treatment by cer al and fe elements were supposed to be removed by precipitation as hydroxides according to the phase diagram in fig 8 the ph was controlled at 9 0 to avoid further dissolution of al oh 3 under alkaline conditions however the results showed that around 76 0 99 3 and 99 5 wt of p al and fe elements precipitated table 4 suggesting the formation of al p and fe p precipitates in addition to al oh 3 and fe oh 3 precipitates different from literature stating that al p and fe p precipitates was formed at ph of 3 0 5 0 petzet et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 javid et al 2016 budhathoki et al 2018 the formation of complexes between al3 fe3 and oxalic ions greatly affects the precipitation condition the ksp values of al oh 3 alpo4 fe oh 3 and fepo4 are 1 30 10 33 9 84 10 21 2 79 10 39 and 9 91 10 16 respectively the aluminum and iron hydroxides are much easier to form than their phosphate precipitates the total reduced molar concentration of al 51 5 mmol l and fe 1 5 mmol l was much higher than that of p 39 2 mmol l verifying the precipitates may be a mixture of al oh 3 fe oh 3 alpo4 and fepo4 it could also be speculated that p which present mainly as hpo4 2 at ph 9 was adsorbed by the positively charged aluminum and iron hydroxides to form aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates peng et al 2007 yan and shih 2016 no crystalline peaks were observed in the xrd pattern of the recovered product fig 9 b and the sem image shows very irregular shapes both indicating aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates are amorphous which are consistent with literature zhao et al 2013 budhathoki et al 2018 wang et al 2018 some authors suggested that the alpo4 and al oh 3 precipitates could serve as potential fertilizers for crop growth zhao et al 2013 however some others claimed that al p and fe p precipitates could scarcely be absorbed by plants and not suitable as p fertilizer wang et al 2018 the recovered alpo4 based product could also be possibly used in industrial applications such as acting as a binder for ceramic coating he et al 2004 and as an additive in fire retardant materials yang et al 2018 heavy metal analysis results of two kinds of p recovery products show that only cu and zn were detected and their contents were 10 6 and 5 4 mg kg respectively in the struvite product and 30 5 and 2 2 mg kg respectively in the aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates which are below the limiting values of fertilizer standards in most countries xu et al 2012 overall approximately 70 0 wt of p in the issa sample incinerated at 800 c could be recovered as struvite product by the sequence of h2so4 leaching cer purification and struvite precipitation although the total p recovery efficiency was a little lower than that reported literature wang et al 2018 mainly because the loss of p during the cer treatment the product with a higher purity will have better application prospects on the other hand approximately 65 5 wt of p could be recovered as aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates by h2c2o4 leaching cer purification and ph adjustment 4 conclusions in this study h2so4 and h2c2o4 were compared to recover p from issa through three steps of acid leaching cer purification and precipitation the main findings of this study include the followings 1 the p was mainly existed as inorganic form in the issa and part of naip was converted to ap with the incineration temperature increased from 600 to 900 c 2 with the concentration of 0 05 mol l and l s ratio of 150 ml g the p leaching efficiency by h2so4 could reach 95 wt for the issa samples incinerated at 600 and 700 c however it continuously decreased when the incineration temperature was higher than 800 c because the sintering and melting of ash particles h2c2o4 exhibited a better performance than h2so4 which could extract 100 wt of p from the issa samples incinerated at 600 850 c 3 in the amplification recovery process more than 95 1 wt of impurities in the h2so4 leachate were removed by cer however cer were not able to remove most al and fe elements in the h2c2o4 leachate due to the formation of anionic complexes between al3 fe3 and oxalic ions 4 high purity struvite product was synthesized from the purified h2so4 leachate and amorphous aluminum and iron hydroxyphosphates were obtained from the h2c2o4 leachate 5 overall approximately 70 0 and 65 5 wt of p in the issa sample incinerated at 800 c could be recovered in h2so4 and h2c2o4 recovery systems respectively further studies should be conducted to enhance the leaching efficiency in h2so4 leaching system and alternative heavy metal purification method rather than cer should be developed to realize high recovery
