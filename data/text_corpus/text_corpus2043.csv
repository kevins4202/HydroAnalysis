10215,sunflower helianthus annuus l has been used as an alternative summer crop in the traditional wheat triticum aestivum l fallow rotation in the great plains of the usa however few studies have been conducted to quantify sunflower productivity and water productivity wp under semi arid conditions and projected climate change experiments were conducted in 2008 2010 and 2011 on sunflowers under deficit irrigation to meet a fraction of crop evapotranspiration etc as estimated by fao 56 in eastern colorado the field data was used to calibrate and validate the csm cropgro sunflower model that is incorporated in the root zone water qualify model rzwqm2 the calibrated model was then used to simulate sunflower production under projected climate conditions with four representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 and four irrigation levels 100 60 40 etc and rainfed in the late 21st century the results showed that the model was able to adequately simulate sunflower biomass yield and soil water storage under the different irrigation treatments in all three years the corresponding relative root mean square deviation rrmsd values were between 0 05 and 0 15 for the simulations of soil water storage yield and biomass under future climate change conditions the model simulated greater impact of irrigation treatments than rcp scenarios on sunflower production for example yield was 3251 3 2638 85 and 1937 17 kg ha 1 with 100 60 and 40 etc irrigation under baseline 1992 2013 and was 2932 47 2360 53 and 1810 65 kg ha 1 with these irrigation treatments under rcp8 5 2070 2091 simulation results also showed that scheduling irrigations based on 60 of etc was the best choice for sunflower wp in eastern colorado climate change did not affect sunflower biomass yield and wp there was an increasing trend of irrigation amount was simulated from the baseline to rcp8 5 scenario to maintain a certain percent of etc due to high temperature projected for instance the irrigation amount for 100 60 and 40 of etc irrigation treatment was 16 4 17 3 and 20 0 higher under rcp8 5 than those under baseline conditions with co2 fertilization finally our results demonstrated that rzwqm2 can be used to effectively schedule sunflower irrigations based on crop evapotranspiration requirement keywords rzwqm2 cropgro crop simulation deficit irrigation irrigation management climate change 1 introduction as a deep rooted crop sunflower can exploit soil water at greater depths and less effected by short term water deficiency than other crops stone et al 2002 tolk and howell 2012 because of its high oil quality associated with concentrations of oleic and linoleic acid nasim et al 2016a sunflower has been used as a viable option for crop rotations in the great plains to intensify crop production nielsen 1998 however supplemental irrigation is needed to mitigate the detrimental effects of water shortage on sunflower production and increase water productivity under semi arid conditions herman et al 2016 falco et al 2018 karam et al 2007 reported that irrigation at early seed formation increased seed weight by increasing photosynthate partitioning to the sunflower head karam et al 2007 sezen et al 2011 showed that water stress resulted in lower seed number and weight however few studies rinaldi 2001 have been conducted to optimize irrigation scheduling for maximal sunflower water productivity wp which is defined as the amount of crop yield produced per unit of water involved in crop production in addition to numerous experimental field trials conducted worldwide ashoka and shashadhar 2020 ren et al 2018 crop models have been used to determine better sunflower management practices under limited water conditions those models include the sunflo crop model casadebaig et al 2011 the oilcrop sun model amjed et al 2014 nasim et al 2016a awais et al 2017 apsim zeng et al 2016 and the csm cropgro sunflower model tariq et al 2018 malik and dechmi 2019 rinaldi et al 2003 found that the oilcrop sun model was effective in simulating sunflower yield and seasonal evapotranspiration and that the highest sunflower yield was obtained by meeting 80 100 of crop evapotranspiration however they demonstrated that maintaining a minimum of 40 plant available water in the active root zone was a more economical irrigation strategy nasim et al 2016a reported that oilcrop sun was able to adequately simulate leaf area index biomass and yield of sunflower under arid semi arid and sub humid conditions the aquacrop model was used to simulate the effect of irrigation amount on crops including sunflower but simulated results for sunflower were poorer than for other crops andarzian et al 2011 model simulation for sunflower development and crop water use needs to be improved rzwqm2 has been successfully tested against field data under deficit irrigation conditions for several crops ma et al 2012a used both laboratory measured and field estimated soil water retention curves to calibrate the model for simulation of maize yield biomass leaf area index and soil water content their results showed that the model was capable of simulating deficit irrigation treatment effects on maize production saseendran et al 2010 also showed that the model successfully simulated spring canola brassica napus l responses to deficit irrigation levels in the great plains fang et al 2010 reported and validated various growth stage based irrigation strategies in wheat maize double crop systems in the north china plain using rzwqm2 and determined optimal partitioning of available water between wheat and maize the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 has been used to simulate climate change effects for winter wheat ko et al 2010 2012 ding et al 2016a 2016b elsayed et al 2019 maize zea mays l islam et al 2012a 2012b wang et al 2016 ma et al 2017 soybean glycine max l wang et al 2016 proso millet panicum milliaceum l ko et al 2012 and cotton gossypium hirsutum l anapalli et al 2016 chen et al 2019a islam et al 2012a showed that maize yield under full irrigation decreased in the decades of the 2050s and 2080s because the negative effects associated with higher temperatures were greater than the negligible positive effects of increasing co2 levels they further showed that the maize yield decrease was linearly related to the shortening of the growing season caused by the increased temperatures islam et al 2012b they suggested that cultivars with longer growing seasons and with tolerance to higher temperatures might be one of the possible adaptation strategies in a later study using the calibrated ceres maize model in rzwqm2 ma et al 2017 showed that projected climate change decreased maize yield of a current cultivar by 21 and biomass by 7 in the later 21st century 2070 2091 under full irrigation compared with the yield under the current climate 1992 2013 under deficit irrigation the corresponding reductions were 14 for yield and 3 for biomass few published studies have used or evaluated the csm cropgro sunflower model tariq et al 2018 malik and dechmi 2019 nasim et al 2016b especially under deficit irrigation conditions nasim et al 2016b projected a decrease of sunflower yield up to 25 by 2050 in pakistan with greater reduction under arid than under sub humid conditions and advancing planting date by 2 3 weeks could improve yield and alleviate climate change effects tariq et al 2018 used the csm cropgro sunflower model and also showed that earlier sowing was needed to mitigate climate change effects the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the newly developed csm cropgro sunflower model incorporated in rzwqm2 against three years of deficit irrigated sunflower field data from eastern colorado 2 evaluate the capability of rzwqm2 for scheduling sunflower irrigation based on crop evapotranspiration and 3 quantify the effects of projected climate change in the late 21st century on sunflower seed yield and water productivity wp under four representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios which are under 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 w m 2 of radiative forcing and four irrigation levels 100 60 40 etc and rainfed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design and measurements the field experiment was initiated in 2008 near greeley colorado 40 45 n 104

was excluded in the study sunflowers dekalb 38 45 were planted in early june at an average rate of 47 000 seeds per hectare with 0 76 m row spacing six irrigation treatments were assigned in a randomized complete block design four replicates of each irrigation treatment 24 total plots irrigation water from a groundwater well was applied through a surface drip irrigation system with drip tubing along each row irrigation water was delivered to the corner of each plot through underground pvc pipe and applied to the crop from microirrigation tubing 16 mm diameter thick walled tubing with 1 1 l h 1 conventional inline emitters spaced 30 cm apart the water distribution uniformity exceeded 95 trout and bausch 2017 individual plot size was 9 m by 40 m the six irrigation treatments were designated to meet portions of full crop evapotranspiration etc requirement allen et al 1998 during the growing season as 100 t1 85 t2 75 t3 70 t4 55 t5 and 40 t6 of etc if the plant available water was insufficient at planting the field was irrigated once following planting with sprinklers to ensure good germination all treatments were fully irrigated until growth stage v8 to ensure good crop stands and water stress treatments were initiated from v8 until crop maturity american society of civil engineers asce standardized penman monteith alfalfa reference evapotranspiration etr asce ewri 2005 was calculated from the weather data irrigations were scheduled using fao 56 dual crop coefficient methodology allen et al 1998 with basal crop coefficients adjusted for measured crop canopy growth and senescence trout and dejonge 2017 the soil water content was measured 2 or 3 times each week before and after most irrigations near the center of each plot the surface soil layer 0 15 cm was measured by a mini trase portable tdr system soil moisture equipment corp for the soil layers between 15 and 200 cm the soil water content was measured by the neutron attenuation 503 dr hydroprobe moisture gauge campbell pacific nuclear at 30 cm intervals evapotranspiration for each treatment was calculated according to the soil water balance method as described in detail in trout and dejonge 2017 and trout and bausch 2017 actual seasonal etc percentages for the six treatments relative to t1 and averaged across the three years were 100 88 80 75 60 and 52 table 1 provides management practices during the three growing seasons including the planting and harvesting dates and the irrigation amounts actual seasonal etc was calculated by measured etc from plant date to harvest date for each year sunflower heads were collected from the center four rows in each plot 70 m2 about 250 plants per plot above ground biomass was measured a day before harvest ten plants were cut at 2 cm above the soil surface the sunflower head was removed and dried separately in an oven at 60 c for about 12 h to a constant weight phenology date was recorded as days after planting dap according to the plant growth fractional canopy cover f c was measured in the center of each plot approximately weekly near solar noon with a digital camera from a nadir view 6 m above the ground surface the digital image pixels were classified into green plant canopy and other background soil surface residue and senesced leaves f c was calculated as the ratio of canopy pixels to total image pixels the sunflower kcb values used in the rzwqm2 model were derived from canopy cover measurements acquired in 2008 2010 and 2011 using the method described in trout and dejonge 2018 the kcb values ranged from 0 13 to 1 07 fig 2 the leaf area index lai was calculated based on a linear relationship lai 4 861 fc 0 831 which was developed using our sunflower lai data 2 2 rzwqm2 recently the asce reference et etr method was added into rzwqm2 to calculate crop etc based on crop coefficient kcb in addition to the commonly used shuttleworth wallace equation ma et al 2005 the standardized asce eq 1 is given as asce ewri

measured data yield biomass lai and soil water content across the six treatments in 2008 data from the other two years 2010 and 2011 were used for model validation the soil parameters were the same as used by ma et al 2016 2 3 using rzmqm2 to schedule the auto irrigation the calibrated rzwqm2 model was then used to determine its applicability as a tool for irrigation scheduling based on etc ae pe at and pt are simulated actual evaporation potential transpiration actual transpiration and potential transpiration respectively in the simulation irrigation interval was fixed at three days as was used in the field experiment irrigation amount for each treatment was estimated to meet a certain percentage of the accumulated etc requirement since the last irrigation event i e 40 55 60 70 75 85 and 100 of etc however if there was a rainfall event the estimated irrigation amount was reduced accordingly when rainfall was sufficient to meet the respectful etc requirement the irrigation event would be delayed and etc would be accumulated until next irrigation was triggered ma et al 2012b 2 4 climate change scenario projections in this study bias corrected and spatially disaggregated bcsd projections from the world climate research program s wrcp cmip5 climate projections archive ftp gdo dcp ucllnl org pub dcp archive cmip5 bcsd bcsd were used to generate multi model ensemble climate change scenarios using 25 available gcm projections to assess the impact of climate change hamlet et al 2010 islam et al 2012a 2012b the climate change scenarios for rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 were used to determine climate change impacts on sunflower production in the late 21st century the projected co2 concentrations for rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 by 2080 were 431 531 594 and 757 ppm respectively meinshausen et al 2011 also we set the co2 concentration at a constant 390 ppm to analyse the effect of climate change without co2 fertilization thirty years of weather data centered on the 2080s 2070 2099 were generated and bias corrected for air temperature and precipitation based on historic weather data from 1980 to 2009 as generated by islam et al 2012a average minimum and maximum air temperatures were projected to increase by 3 7 c compared with historical temperature averages from 1980 to 2009 under the rcp8 5 scenario depending on the month of the year in the 2080s 2070 2099 precipitation also was projected to increase in the winter months but would decrease somewhat in the summer months on an annual basis average rainfall increased by 9 from the current 24 8 27 1 cm in the 2080s and average temperature increased from 9 5 to 14 8 c projected average air temperature increased by 1 2 c for rcp2 6 and 2 4 c for rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 projected precipitation was the same for all rcp scenarios but with greater seasonal variability for rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 to simulate the impact of projected climate change the projected changes in precipitation and temperature were superimposed on the observed baseline data series for the period of 1992 2013 thus the baseline scenarios were run from 1992 to 2013 22 years instead of 30 years used in the bcsd projection and the future scenarios were from 2070 to 2091 the reason for this modification was that reliable data for solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were available for the site from 1992 onward in this study 100 full irrigation 60 40 of etc and rainfed treatments were used to evaluate responses to irrigation under climate change conditions projected climate scenarios were from previous studies at the same location for maize islam et al 2012a ma et al 2017 and winter wheat elsayed et al 2019 simulated sunflower yields and biomass using 22 years of projected climate between 2070 and 2091 were compared with baseline historical weather from 1992 to 2013 2 5 statistics for model calibration and evaluation root mean squared deviation rmsd relative rmsd rrmsd the index of agreement between

the simulation is considered acceptable when the rrmsd 0 2 an advantage of using d is that a value of 1 0 indicates perfect calibration d values decreasing from 1 0 indicate increasingly poorer model calibration values of r2 and d were used for trend analysis ma et al 2011 suggested that from previous research values of d 0 7 r2 0 7 and 15 pbias 15 indicated acceptable model simulation results in this study the least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 was used as the mean separation test using jmp version 7 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration based on sunflower growth soil water storage sws in 2008 more than half of the field sws 0 200 cm soil profile observations in 2008 were simulated within experimental error illustrating rzwqm2 was performing fairly well fig 3 model performance statistics also suggest the model was performing well with rrmsd 0 13 pbias within 9 and d 0 81 table 2 although the r2 values for t2 and t4 are lower than other treatments table 2 the rrmsd pbias and d for t2 and t4 suggested the model performed well simulating sws in 2008 the rmsd of simulated soil water content in the top two soil layers varied from 0 03 to 0 07 cm3 cm 3 and rrmsd varied from 0 19 to 0 46 table 3 the large simulation errors in the surface soil layer indicated higher uncertainty associated with rainfall irrigation and other management factors hu et al 2006 fang et al 2008 also the measured soil water content in the surface layer 0 15 cm using the mini trase portable tdr may have been less reliable than the ones in the deeper soil layers using the neutron probe wu et al 1999 fang et al 2008 simulated lai in 2008 showed similar trends to measured lai with rrmsd 0 2 d 0 8 15 pbias 15 and r2 0 7 except for t5 and t6 fig 4 among the six irrigation treatments the model over simulated lai more for the low irrigation treatments d 0 9 than for the high irrigation treatments d 0 9 especially during the middle and late growth stages this may indicate a lack of ability to simulate lai under water stress which has also been reported for maize by ma et al 2016 and saseendran et al 2005 simulated emergence occurred 10 dap for all treatments which was the same as the measured dates simulated anthesis date was close to the measured date 42 vs 40 dap for all treatments simulated maturity dates were slightly earlier than the measured dates 132 138 dap vs 139 dap simulated sunflower seed yields for the six treatments in 2008 were close to the measured values table 2 both measured and simulated yields were lower in treatments t5 and t6 compared with the other irrigation treatments e g 8 63 lower for t5 and 5 15 lower for t6 than t1 of measured yield fig 6 biomass simulation was acceptable table 2 simulated biomass ranged from 7819 to 9233 kg ha 1 which was comparable with the measured biomass range of 7480 9540 kg ha 1 both measured and simulated biomass for t5 and t6 were lower than measured and simulated biomass for t1 fig 6 simulated wp for the six treatments in 2008 were similar to the measured values table 2 3 2 model evaluation in 2010 and 2011 table 4 shows the results of model evaluation using 2010 and 2011 data simulated sws was acceptable with rmsd 3 90 cm rrmsd 0 11 2 62 pbias 9 08 and d 0 73 r2 values were also acceptable with all values 0 77 except for t1 which had an r2 of 0 69 though the rrmsd 0 2 simulated lai values in treatments t1 and t2 were acceptable with r2 0 7 pbias within 15 and d 0 8 in 2010 and 2011 however simulated lais were less accurate for the four low irrigation treatments before anthesis the simulated lai values were close to the measured values however simulated lai values were much higher than measured values after measured anthesis dates 41 dap 40 dap and were similar among all irrigation treatments before measured anthesis dates in both 2010 and 2011 fig 4 overall simulated lai by csm cropgro sunflower in rzwqm2 was not responsive enough to irrigation levels this finding is similar to the results reported by singh et al 2016 for safflower using the csm cropgro safflower model kassie et al 2016 also showed a poor simulation of lai using dssdat during the growing season they stated the low sensitivity of biomass simulations to poor simulations of lai were due to little changes in intercepted solar radiation at lai 3 and water and nitrogen stress often limiting photosynthesis and growth rather than light interception at low lai the performance of oryza v3 and apsim oryza on lai also showed the rrmse were higher than 0 30 radanielson et al 2018 simulated etc and t were acceptable with available rrmsd r2 pbias and d table 4 measured and simulated etc and t values were the lowest for treatment t6 in both 2010 and 2011 which was also observed in 2008 fig 5 etc ranged from 41 78 t6 to 54 99 t1 cm in 2008 26 53 t6 to 49 75 t1 cm in 2010 and 28 43 t6 to 52 78 t1 cm in 2011 simulated t were less than the calculated values in all three years the simulated transpiration in three years was acceptable with rrmsd 0 13 r2 0 95 15 pbias 10 and d 0 90 table 4 as shown in fig 6 the model performed well in simulating sunflower yield in 2010 and 2011 with available rrmsd r2 pbias and d measured yield in 2010 showed a 13 4 24 4 30 4 and 49 1 decrease for t3 t4 t5 and t6 respectively compared with t1 the same declining pattern in yield with decreasing irrigation amount was also simulated by rzwqm2 in 2011 measured yield ranged from 1760 kg ha 1 in t6 to 2997 kg ha 1 in t2 both measured and simulated yield for t5 and t6 were significantly less than those for other treatments the differences of the measured yield between 2010 and 2011 were caused by less irrigation and rainfall in 2010 unger 1982 reported that sunflower yield was highly correlated to irrigation amount during the flowering to late flowering stages resulting in greater wp under higher irrigation amount during the stages rather than whole growth stages simulated wp for the six treatments in 2010 and 2011 were acceptable table 4 malik and dechmi 2019 also showed a good performance for simulating sunflower of dssat in the intensive cropping systems under mediterranean conditions the result of higher yield was highly correlated to the higher irrigation also can match the results of rinaldi et al 2003 that the highest sunflower yield was obtained by meeting 80 100 of crop evapotranspiration biomass in 2010 and 2011 was acceptably simulated table 4 the lower r2 0 59 0 7 in 2010 indicated a poorly simulated biomass trend than that in 2011 compared to measurements measured biomass in 2010 ranged from 4630 to 8420 kg ha 1 which was close to simulated biomass range of 4940 8834 kg ha 1 the measured biomass was relatively lower in t1 than in t2 and t3 but the plot yield in t1 was the highest among all treatments in 2010 because measured biomass was based on only 10 plants the uncertainty in measured biomass was much higher than that in yield measurement similar to the simulated yield results there were no significant differences in simulated biomass among t1 t2 t3 and t4 in 2011 measured biomass in 2011 ranged from 5729 kg ha 1 in t6 to 9790 kg ha 1 biomass simulations were better in 2011 than in 2010 with available rrmsd r2 pbias and d 3 3 automatic irrigation based on et requirement the irrigation management in rzwqm2 includes type of irrigation application rate time and amount of irrigation and it has the advantages of combining the detailed soil water nitrogen and management modules of rzwqm2 with the detailed crop modules of dssat 4 0 rzwqm2 uses the green ampt equation for infiltration and the richards equation for redistribution of water among different soil layers ma et al 2017 chen et al 2019b ma et al 2006 showed that the rzwqm cropgro hybrid model not only provided rzwqm users a valid option of a new plant growth module but also extended cropgro to a wide soil condition another advantage to use this model is that the asce standardized reference et method in the model should be used to calculate the daily reference et instead of the shuttleworth wallace equation ordinarily used by rzwqm2 users in order to match the method used to calculate irrigation amounts in the field experiment the model simulated daily transpiration was similar to the calculated transpiration for all three years and decreased as irrigation deficit increased from t1 to t6 as shown in fig 5 fig 7 showed that the simulated actual evaporation ae accounted for 71 93 of potential evaporation pe in 2008 and 78 100 in 2011 but only 53 84 in 2010 simulated actual transpiration at for t6 in 2010 only accounted for 53 of potential transpiration pt fig 7 which agreed with the simulated water deficits and the reduced simulated yield as shown in fig 8 top panel the simulated irrigation requirement was close to the actual irrigation amount applied in the field in all treatments r2 0 91 also the simulated yield and biomass with simulated irrigation amount were also close to the yields and biomass with actual irrigation amounts r2 0 85 and 0 88 respectively therefore the model was capable of scheduling irrigation based on crop evapotranspiration requirement 3 4 climate change effects on sunflower under different deficit irrigation amounts fig 9 shows simulated variables under baseline and four climate change scenarios with fig 9a and without atmospheric co2 concentration increases fig 9b for four irrigation amounts the projected biomass and yield increased when the water consumption was increased from rainfed to 100 of et under all rcps scenarios and the greatest biomass and yield were observed under rcp8 5 fig 9a and b however the differences among the rcps were not significant as shown in fig 10 projected average seasonal temperature and co2 concentration was in the order of rcp8 5 rcp6 0 rcp4 5 rcp2 6 baseline all temperatures were within the optimum range set in the model for sunflower 19 1 34 6 higher variability among simulated years in biomass and yield was found under rcp8 5 than for under the baseline simulation fig 9 and this difference is due to the higher average annual temperature for rcp8 5 fig 10 there was no significant difference in projected yield among scenarios in both with and without co2 fertilization except for rainfed for example yield was 3251 3 2638 85 and 1937 17 kg ha 1 with 100 60 and 40 et irrigation under baseline and was 2932 47 2360 53 and 1810 65 kg ha 1 under these irrigation treatments under rcp8 5 in fig 9a however the yield for rainfed under rcp4 5 was the highest among all climate scenarios it may due to the optimum co2 concentration under rcp4 5 c3 plants may benefit from co2 enrichment especially under water deficit conditions kang et al 2002 without irrigation rainfed sunflower production in the field was simulated to be very low in both the 2070 2091 and baseline periods regardless of climate projections yield was also low under 40 of etc irrigation however irrigating to meet 60 of etc produced a simulated average yield that was comparable to that under the full irrigation treatment for instance average yield among all scenarios was 3122 45 kg ha 1 with 100 of etc irrigation and 2584 34 kg ha 1 with 60 of etc irrigation with co2 fertilization seasonal crop transpiration was not significantly different among the rcps with and without co2 fertilization but decreased with increasing irrigation deficit in each scenario wp was not significantly different either among the irrigation treatments or among the rcp scenarios except for the rainfed irrigation amount ranged from 41 5 to 48 3 cm 22 5 26 4 cm and 13 0 15 6 cm for the 100 of etc 60 of etc and 40 of etc irrigation treatments respectively for the 5 climate scenarios irrigation amount under rcp8 5 was the highest but there was no significant difference in irrigation amount among rcps the irrigation amount under rcp 8 5 was 16 4 17 3 and 20 0 higher for 100 60 and 40 etc treatment respectively than that under baseline with co2 fertilization in contrast to the simulation results obtained with the oilcrop sun model nasim et al 2016b the csm cropgro sunflower model did not simulate yield or biomass reduction under all rcps and irrigation treatments compared with the baseline simulation using historical weather data from 1992 to 2013 fig 9 in the punjab region of pakistan nasim et al 2016b found that in the arid semi arid and sub humid areas sunflower yield would decrease by 15 25 depending on the specific future climate change scenarios 4 conclusions this study showed that csm cropgro sunflower in the rzwqm2 model simulated sunflower growth yield and water use reasonably well in eastern colorado under abroad range of water deficit conditions the climate change simulation results showed that irrigation had a much greater impact on sunflower production than rcp scenarios as similarly reported in the literature for the oilcrop sun model the co2 fertilization effect was not significant for sunflower although wp was greater with increased co2 due to the combination of slightly higher yield and lower transpiration the results of this study demonstrated that the csm cropgro sunflower in rzwqm2 could be used as a tool to schedule irrigations based on crop evapotranspiration requirement once the model is parameterized however

10215,sunflower helianthus annuus l has been used as an alternative summer crop in the traditional wheat triticum aestivum l fallow rotation in the great plains of the usa however few studies have been conducted to quantify sunflower productivity and water productivity wp under semi arid conditions and projected climate change experiments were conducted in 2008 2010 and 2011 on sunflowers under deficit irrigation to meet a fraction of crop evapotranspiration etc as estimated by fao 56 in eastern colorado the field data was used to calibrate and validate the csm cropgro sunflower model that is incorporated in the root zone water qualify model rzwqm2 the calibrated model was then used to simulate sunflower production under projected climate conditions with four representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 and four irrigation levels 100 60 40 etc and rainfed in the late 21st century the results showed that the model was able to adequately simulate sunflower biomass yield and soil water storage under the different irrigation treatments in all three years the corresponding relative root mean square deviation rrmsd values were between 0 05 and 0 15 for the simulations of soil water storage yield and biomass under future climate change conditions the model simulated greater impact of irrigation treatments than rcp scenarios on sunflower production for example yield was 3251 3 2638 85 and 1937 17 kg ha 1 with 100 60 and 40 etc irrigation under baseline 1992 2013 and was 2932 47 2360 53 and 1810 65 kg ha 1 with these irrigation treatments under rcp8 5 2070 2091 simulation results also showed that scheduling irrigations based on 60 of etc was the best choice for sunflower wp in eastern colorado climate change did not affect sunflower biomass yield and wp there was an increasing trend of irrigation amount was simulated from the baseline to rcp8 5 scenario to maintain a certain percent of etc due to high temperature projected for instance the irrigation amount for 100 60 and 40 of etc irrigation treatment was 16 4 17 3 and 20 0 higher under rcp8 5 than those under baseline conditions with co2 fertilization finally our results demonstrated that rzwqm2 can be used to effectively schedule sunflower irrigations based on crop evapotranspiration requirement keywords rzwqm2 cropgro crop simulation deficit irrigation irrigation management climate change 1 introduction as a deep rooted crop sunflower can exploit soil water at greater depths and less effected by short term water deficiency than other crops stone et al 2002 tolk and howell 2012 because of its high oil quality associated with concentrations of oleic and linoleic acid nasim et al 2016a sunflower has been used as a viable option for crop rotations in the great plains to intensify crop production nielsen 1998 however supplemental irrigation is needed to mitigate the detrimental effects of water shortage on sunflower production and increase water productivity under semi arid conditions herman et al 2016 falco et al 2018 karam et al 2007 reported that irrigation at early seed formation increased seed weight by increasing photosynthate partitioning to the sunflower head karam et al 2007 sezen et al 2011 showed that water stress resulted in lower seed number and weight however few studies rinaldi 2001 have been conducted to optimize irrigation scheduling for maximal sunflower water productivity wp which is defined as the amount of crop yield produced per unit of water involved in crop production in addition to numerous experimental field trials conducted worldwide ashoka and shashadhar 2020 ren et al 2018 crop models have been used to determine better sunflower management practices under limited water conditions those models include the sunflo crop model casadebaig et al 2011 the oilcrop sun model amjed et al 2014 nasim et al 2016a awais et al 2017 apsim zeng et al 2016 and the csm cropgro sunflower model tariq et al 2018 malik and dechmi 2019 rinaldi et al 2003 found that the oilcrop sun model was effective in simulating sunflower yield and seasonal evapotranspiration and that the highest sunflower yield was obtained by meeting 80 100 of crop evapotranspiration however they demonstrated that maintaining a minimum of 40 plant available water in the active root zone was a more economical irrigation strategy nasim et al 2016a reported that oilcrop sun was able to adequately simulate leaf area index biomass and yield of sunflower under arid semi arid and sub humid conditions the aquacrop model was used to simulate the effect of irrigation amount on crops including sunflower but simulated results for sunflower were poorer than for other crops andarzian et al 2011 model simulation for sunflower development and crop water use needs to be improved rzwqm2 has been successfully tested against field data under deficit irrigation conditions for several crops ma et al 2012a used both laboratory measured and field estimated soil water retention curves to calibrate the model for simulation of maize yield biomass leaf area index and soil water content their results showed that the model was capable of simulating deficit irrigation treatment effects on maize production saseendran et al 2010 also showed that the model successfully simulated spring canola brassica napus l responses to deficit irrigation levels in the great plains fang et al 2010 reported and validated various growth stage based irrigation strategies in wheat maize double crop systems in the north china plain using rzwqm2 and determined optimal partitioning of available water between wheat and maize the root zone water quality model rzwqm2 has been used to simulate climate change effects for winter wheat ko et al 2010 2012 ding et al 2016a 2016b elsayed et al 2019 maize zea mays l islam et al 2012a 2012b wang et al 2016 ma et al 2017 soybean glycine max l wang et al 2016 proso millet panicum milliaceum l ko et al 2012 and cotton gossypium hirsutum l anapalli et al 2016 chen et al 2019a islam et al 2012a showed that maize yield under full irrigation decreased in the decades of the 2050s and 2080s because the negative effects associated with higher temperatures were greater than the negligible positive effects of increasing co2 levels they further showed that the maize yield decrease was linearly related to the shortening of the growing season caused by the increased temperatures islam et al 2012b they suggested that cultivars with longer growing seasons and with tolerance to higher temperatures might be one of the possible adaptation strategies in a later study using the calibrated ceres maize model in rzwqm2 ma et al 2017 showed that projected climate change decreased maize yield of a current cultivar by 21 and biomass by 7 in the later 21st century 2070 2091 under full irrigation compared with the yield under the current climate 1992 2013 under deficit irrigation the corresponding reductions were 14 for yield and 3 for biomass few published studies have used or evaluated the csm cropgro sunflower model tariq et al 2018 malik and dechmi 2019 nasim et al 2016b especially under deficit irrigation conditions nasim et al 2016b projected a decrease of sunflower yield up to 25 by 2050 in pakistan with greater reduction under arid than under sub humid conditions and advancing planting date by 2 3 weeks could improve yield and alleviate climate change effects tariq et al 2018 used the csm cropgro sunflower model and also showed that earlier sowing was needed to mitigate climate change effects the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the newly developed csm cropgro sunflower model incorporated in rzwqm2 against three years of deficit irrigated sunflower field data from eastern colorado 2 evaluate the capability of rzwqm2 for scheduling sunflower irrigation based on crop evapotranspiration and 3 quantify the effects of projected climate change in the late 21st century on sunflower seed yield and water productivity wp under four representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios which are under 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 w m 2 of radiative forcing and four irrigation levels 100 60 40 etc and rainfed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design and measurements the field experiment was initiated in 2008 near greeley colorado 40 45 n 104

was excluded in the study sunflowers dekalb 38 45 were planted in early june at an average rate of 47 000 seeds per hectare with 0 76 m row spacing six irrigation treatments were assigned in a randomized complete block design four replicates of each irrigation treatment 24 total plots irrigation water from a groundwater well was applied through a surface drip irrigation system with drip

2005 was calculated from the weather data irrigations were scheduled using fao 56 dual crop coefficient methodology allen et al 1998 with basal crop coefficients adjusted for measured crop canopy growth and senescence trout and dejonge 2017 the soil water content was measured 2 or 3 times each week before and after most irrigations near the center of each plot the surface soil layer 0 15 cm

moisture gauge campbell pacific nuclear at 30 cm intervals evapotranspiration for each treatment was calculated according to the soil water balance method as described in detail in trout and dejonge 2017 and trout and bausch 2017 actual seasonal etc percentages for the six treatments relative to t1 and averaged across the three years were 100 88 80 75 60 and 52 table 1 provides management practices during the three growing seasons including the planting and harvesting dates and the irrigation amounts actual seasonal etc was calculated by measured etc from plant date to harvest date for each year sunflower heads were collected from the center four rows in each plot 70 m2 about 250 plants per plot above ground biomass was measured a day before harvest ten plants were cut at 2 cm above the soil surface the sunflower head was removed and dried separately in an oven at 60 c for about 12 h to a constant weight phenology date was recorded as days after planting dap according to the plant growth fractional canopy cover f c was measured in the center of each plot approximately weekly near solar noon with a digital camera from a nadir view 6 m above the ground surface the digital image pixels were classified into green plant canopy and other background soil surface residue and senesced leaves f c was calculated as the ratio of canopy pixels to total image pixels the sunflower kcb values used in the rzwqm2 model were derived from canopy cover measurements acquired in 2008 2010 and 2011 using the method described in trout and dejonge 2018 the kcb values ranged from 0 13 to 1 07 fig 2 the leaf area index lai was calculated based on a linear relationship lai 4 861 fc 0 831 which was developed using our sunflower lai data 2 2 rzwqm2 recently the asce reference et etr method

measured data yield biomass lai and soil water content across the six treatments in 2008 data from the other two years 2010 and 2011 were used for model validation the soil parameters were the same as used by ma et al 2016 2 3 using rzmqm2 to schedule the auto irrigation the calibrated rzwqm2 model was then used to determine its applicability as a tool for irrigation scheduling based on etc ae pe at and pt are simulated actual evaporation potential transpiration actual transpiration and potential transpiration respectively in the simulation irrigation interval was fixed at three days as was used in the field experiment irrigation amount for each treatment was estimated to meet a certain percentage of the accumulated etc requirement since the last irrigation event i e 40 55 60 70 75 85 and 100 of etc however if there was a rainfall event the estimated irrigation amount was reduced accordingly when rainfall was sufficient to meet the respectful etc requirement the irrigation event would be delayed and etc would be accumulated until next irrigation was triggered ma et al 2012b 2 4 climate change scenario projections in this study bias corrected and spatially disaggregated bcsd projections from the world climate research program s wrcp cmip5 climate projections archive ftp gdo dcp ucllnl org pub dcp archive cmip5 bcsd bcsd were used to generate multi model ensemble climate change scenarios using 25 available gcm projections to assess the impact of climate change hamlet et al 2010 islam et al 2012a 2012b the climate change scenarios for rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 were used to determine climate change impacts on sunflower production in the late 21st century the projected co2 concentrations for rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 by 2080 were 431 531 594 and 757 ppm respectively meinshausen et al 2011 also we set the co2 concentration at a constant 390 ppm to analyse the effect of climate change without co2 fertilization thirty years of weather data centered on the 2080s 2070 2099 were generated and bias corrected for air temperature and precipitation based on historic weather data from 1980 to 2009 as generated by islam et al 2012a average minimum and maximum air temperatures were projected to increase by 3 7 c compared with historical temperature averages from 1980 to 2009 under the rcp8 5 scenario depending on the month of the year in the 2080s 2070 2099 precipitation also was projected to increase in the winter months but would decrease somewhat in the summer months on an annual basis average rainfall increased by 9 from the current 24 8 27 1 cm in the 2080s and average temperature increased from 9 5 to 14 8 c projected average air temperature increased by 1 2 c for rcp2 6 and 2 4 c for rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 projected precipitation was the same for all rcp scenarios but with greater seasonal variability for rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 to simulate the impact of projected climate change the projected changes in precipitation and temperature were superimposed on the observed baseline data series for the period of 1992 2013 thus the baseline scenarios were run from 1992 to 2013 22 years instead of 30 years used in the bcsd projection and the future scenarios were from 2070 to 2091 the reason for this modification was that reliable data for solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed were available for the site from 1992 onward in this study 100 full irrigation 60 40 of etc and rainfed treatments were used to evaluate responses to irrigation under climate change conditions projected climate scenarios were from previous studies at the same location for maize islam et al 2012a ma et al 2017 and winter wheat elsayed et al 2019 simulated sunflower yields and biomass using 22 years of projected climate between 2070 and 2091 were compared with baseline historical weather from 1992 to 2013 2 5 statistics for model calibration and evaluation root mean squared deviation rmsd relative rmsd rrmsd the index of agreement between

calibration values of r2 and d were used for trend analysis ma et al 2011 suggested that from previous research values of d 0 7 r2 0 7 and 15 pbias 15 indicated acceptable model simulation results in this study the least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 was used as the mean separation test using jmp version 7 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration based on sunflower growth soil water storage sws in 2008 more than half of the field sws 0 200 cm soil profile observations in 2008 were simulated within experimental error illustrating rzwqm2 was performing fairly well fig 3 model performance statistics also suggest the model was performing well with rrmsd 0 13 pbias within 9 and d 0 81 table 2 although the r2 values for t2 and t4 are lower than other treatments table 2 the rrmsd pbias and d for t2 and t4 suggested the model performed well simulating sws in 2008 the rmsd of simulated soil water content in the top two soil layers varied from 0 03 to 0 07 cm3 cm 3 and rrmsd varied from 0 19 to 0 46 table 3 the large simulation errors in the surface soil layer indicated higher uncertainty associated with rainfall irrigation and other management factors hu et al 2006 fang et al 2008 also the measured soil water content in the surface layer 0 15 cm using the mini trase portable tdr may have been less reliable than the ones in the deeper soil layers using the neutron probe wu et al 1999 fang et al 2008 simulated lai in 2008 showed similar trends to measured lai with rrmsd 0 2 d 0 8 15 pbias 15 and r2 0 7 except for t5 and t6 fig 4 among the six irrigation treatments the model over simulated lai more for the low irrigation treatments d 0 9 than for the high irrigation treatments d 0 9 especially during the middle and late growth stages this may indicate a lack of ability to simulate lai under water stress which has also been reported for maize by ma et al 2016 and saseendran et al 2005 simulated emergence occurred 10 dap for all treatments which was the same as the measured dates simulated anthesis date was close to the measured date 42 vs 40 dap for all treatments simulated maturity dates were slightly earlier than the measured dates 132 138 dap vs 139 dap simulated sunflower seed yields for the six treatments in 2008 were close to the measured values table 2 both measured and simulated yields were lower in treatments t5 and t6 compared with the other irrigation treatments e g 8 63 lower for t5 and 5 15 lower for t6 than t1 of measured yield fig 6 biomass simulation was acceptable table 2 simulated biomass ranged from 7819 to 9233 kg ha 1 which was comparable with the measured biomass range of 7480 9540 kg ha 1 both measured and simulated biomass for t5 and t6 were lower than measured and simulated biomass for t1 fig 6 simulated wp for the six treatments in 2008 were similar to the measured values table 2 3 2 model evaluation in 2010 and 2011 table 4 shows the results of model evaluation using 2010 and 2011 data simulated sws was acceptable with rmsd 3 90 cm rrmsd 0 11 2 62 pbias 9 08 and d 0 73 r2 values were also acceptable with all values 0 77 except for t1 which had an r2 of 0 69 though the rrmsd 0 2 simulated lai values in treatments t1 and t2 were acceptable with r2 0 7 pbias within 15 and d 0 8 in 2010 and 2011 however simulated lais were less accurate for the four low irrigation treatments before anthesis the simulated lai values were close to the measured values however simulated lai values were much higher than measured values after measured anthesis dates 41 dap 40 dap and were similar among all irrigation treatments before measured anthesis dates in both 2010 and 2011 fig 4 overall simulated lai by csm cropgro sunflower in rzwqm2 was not responsive enough to irrigation levels this finding is similar to the results reported by singh et al 2016 for safflower using the csm cropgro safflower model kassie et al 2016 also showed a poor simulation of lai using dssdat during the growing season they stated the low sensitivity of biomass simulations to poor simulations of lai were due to little changes in intercepted solar radiation at lai 3 and water and nitrogen stress often limiting photosynthesis and growth rather than light interception at low lai the performance of oryza v3 and apsim oryza on lai also showed the rrmse were higher than 0 30 radanielson et al 2018 simulated etc and t were acceptable with available rrmsd r2 pbias and d table 4 measured and simulated etc and t values were the lowest for treatment t6 in both 2010 and 2011 which was also observed in 2008 fig 5 etc ranged from 41 78 t6 to 54 99 t1 cm in 2008 26 53 t6 to 49 75 t1 cm in 2010 and 28 43 t6 to 52 78 t1 cm in 2011 simulated t were less than the calculated values in all three years the simulated transpiration in three years was acceptable with rrmsd 0 13 r2 0 95 15 pbias 10 and d 0 90 table 4 as shown in fig 6 the model performed well in simulating sunflower yield in 2010 and 2011 with available rrmsd r2 pbias and d measured yield in 2010 showed a 13 4 24 4 30 4 and 49 1 decrease for t3 t4 t5 and t6 respectively compared with t1 the same declining pattern in yield with decreasing irrigation amount was also simulated by rzwqm2 in 2011 measured yield ranged from 1760 kg ha 1 in t6 to 2997 kg ha 1 in t2 both measured and simulated yield for t5 and t6 were significantly less than those for other treatments the differences of the measured yield between 2010 and 2011 were caused by less irrigation and rainfall in 2010 unger 1982 reported that sunflower yield was highly correlated to irrigation amount during the flowering to late flowering stages resulting in greater wp under higher irrigation amount during the stages rather than whole growth stages simulated wp for the six treatments in 2010 and 2011 were acceptable table 4 malik and dechmi 2019 also showed a good performance for simulating sunflower of dssat in the intensive cropping systems under mediterranean conditions the result of higher yield was highly correlated to the higher irrigation also can match the results of rinaldi et al 2003 that the highest sunflower yield was obtained by meeting 80 100 of crop evapotranspiration biomass in 2010 and 2011 was acceptably simulated table 4 the lower r2 0 59 0 7 in 2010 indicated a poorly simulated biomass trend than that in 2011 compared to measurements measured biomass in 2010 ranged from 4630 to 8420 kg ha 1 which was close to simulated biomass range of 4940 8834 kg ha 1 the measured biomass was relatively lower in t1 than in t2 and t3 but the plot yield in t1 was the highest among all treatments in 2010 because measured biomass was based on only 10 plants the uncertainty in measured biomass was much higher than that in yield measurement similar to the simulated yield results there were no significant differences in simulated biomass among t1 t2 t3 and t4 in 2011 measured biomass in 2011 ranged from 5729 kg ha 1 in t6 to 9790 kg ha 1 biomass simulations were better in 2011 than in 2010 with available rrmsd r2 pbias and d 3 3 automatic irrigation based on et requirement the irrigation management in rzwqm2 includes type of irrigation application rate time and amount of irrigation and it has the advantages of combining the detailed soil water nitrogen and management modules of rzwqm2 with the detailed crop modules of dssat 4 0 rzwqm2 uses the green ampt equation for infiltration and the richards equation for redistribution of water among different soil layers ma et al 2017 chen et al 2019b ma et al 2006 showed that the rzwqm cropgro hybrid model not only provided rzwqm users a valid option of a new plant growth module but also extended cropgro to a wide soil condition another advantage to use this model is that the asce standardized reference et method in the model should be used to calculate the daily reference et instead of the shuttleworth wallace equation ordinarily used by rzwqm2 users in order to match the method used to calculate irrigation amounts in the field experiment the model simulated daily transpiration was similar to the calculated transpiration for all three years and decreased as irrigation deficit increased from t1 to t6 as shown in fig 5 fig 7 showed that the simulated actual evaporation ae accounted for 71 93 of potential evaporation pe in 2008 and 78 100 in 2011 but only 53 84 in 2010 simulated actual transpiration at for t6 in 2010 only accounted for 53 of potential transpiration pt fig 7 which agreed with the simulated water deficits and the reduced simulated yield as shown in fig 8 top panel the simulated irrigation requirement was close to the actual irrigation amount applied in the field in all treatments r2 0 91 also the simulated yield and biomass with simulated irrigation amount were also close to the yields and biomass with actual irrigation amounts r2 0 85 and 0 88 respectively therefore the model was capable of scheduling irrigation based on crop evapotranspiration requirement 3 4 climate change effects on sunflower under different deficit irrigation amounts fig 9 shows simulated variables under baseline and four climate change scenarios with fig 9a and without atmospheric co2 concentration increases fig 9b for four irrigation amounts the projected biomass and yield increased when the water consumption was increased from rainfed to 100 of et under all rcps scenarios and the greatest biomass and yield were observed under rcp8 5 fig 9a and b however the differences among the rcps were not significant as shown in fig 10 projected average seasonal temperature and co2 concentration was in the order of rcp8 5 rcp6 0 rcp4 5 rcp2 6 baseline all temperatures were within the optimum range set in the model for sunflower 19 1 34 6 higher variability among simulated years in biomass and yield was found under rcp8 5 than for under the baseline simulation fig 9 and this difference is due to the higher average annual temperature for rcp8 5 fig 10 there was no significant difference in projected yield among scenarios in both with and without co2 fertilization except for rainfed for example yield was 3251 3 2638 85 and 1937 17 kg ha 1 with 100 60 and 40 et irrigation under baseline and was 2932 47 2360 53 and 1810 65 kg ha 1 under these irrigation treatments under rcp8 5 in fig 9a however the yield for rainfed under rcp4 5 was the highest among all climate scenarios it may due to the optimum co2 concentration under rcp4 5 c3 plants may benefit from co2 enrichment especially under water deficit conditions kang et al 2002 without irrigation rainfed sunflower production in the field was simulated to be very low in both the 2070 2091 and baseline periods regardless of climate projections yield was also low under 40 of etc irrigation however irrigating to meet 60 of etc produced a simulated average yield that was comparable to that under the full irrigation treatment for instance average yield among all scenarios was 3122 45 kg ha 1 with 100 of etc irrigation and 2584 34 kg ha 1 with 60 of etc irrigation with co2 fertilization seasonal crop transpiration was not significantly different among the rcps with and without co2 fertilization but decreased with increasing irrigation deficit in each scenario wp was not significantly different either among the irrigation treatments or among the rcp scenarios except for the rainfed irrigation amount ranged from 41 5 to 48 3 cm 22 5 26 4 cm and 13 0 15 6 cm for the 100 of etc 60 of etc and 40 of etc irrigation treatments respectively for the 5 climate scenarios irrigation amount under rcp8 5 was the highest but there was no significant difference in irrigation amount among rcps the irrigation amount under rcp 8 5 was 16 4 17 3 and 20 0 higher for 100 60 and 40 etc treatment respectively than that under baseline with co2 fertilization in contrast to the simulation results obtained with the oilcrop sun model nasim et al 2016b the csm cropgro sunflower model did not simulate yield or biomass reduction under all rcps and irrigation treatments compared with the baseline simulation using historical weather data from 1992 to 2013 fig 9 in the punjab region of pakistan nasim et al 2016b found that in the arid semi arid and sub humid areas sunflower yield would decrease by 15 25 depending on the specific future climate change scenarios 4 conclusions this study showed that csm cropgro sunflower in the rzwqm2 model simulated sunflower growth yield and water use reasonably well in eastern colorado under abroad range of water deficit conditions the climate change simulation results showed that irrigation had a much greater impact on sunflower production than rcp scenarios as similarly reported in the literature for the oilcrop sun model the co2 fertilization effect was not significant for sunflower although wp was greater with increased co2 due to the combination of slightly higher yield and lower transpiration the results of this study demonstrated that the csm cropgro sunflower in rzwqm2 could be used as a tool to schedule irrigations based on crop evapotranspiration requirement once the model is parameterized however

10216,in this study a fuzzy multi objective m λ measure dependent chance programming model was proposed to optimize limited irrigation water among three crops and five subareas in hetao irrigation district hid under uncertainties with the objectives of ensuring food security and maximizing economic benefits three levels of droughts 100 85 and 70 of annual average water diversion that may happen in hid were set as future possible droughts scenarios the optimization model considered the detailed physical process of soil water balance which is necessary for irrigation districts where groundwater recharge plays a major role when available water limited moreover sensitivities of crop yield to water deficit during crop growth periods were involved in model formulation to reflect the difference of crop water demand in different subareas in optimization model m λ measure was introduced into the first objective to quantify optimistic and pessimistic decision attitudes of decision makers and a series of alternatives were obtained the obtained results indicate that 1 the irrigation water of wheat maize and sunflower at rapid growth stage and middle growth stage should be preferentially guaranteed due to their high water deficit sensitivities the water demand at initial growth stage and late growth stage can be satisfied by soil water and groundwater recharge 2 maize has the priority of irrigation in almost all subareas while sunflower has to face water deficit when drought occurs 3 allocating more irrigation water to yongji and jiefangzha subareas can help increase food production 4 the irrigation water allocated to grain crops increases along with the decrease of λ representing decision makers more conservative preference the optimization model and results in this study provide decision makers abundant water allocation schemes under drought conditions keywords fuzzy dependent chance programming hetao irrigation district optimization food security drought mλ measure 1 introduction in recent years water availability and food production have been significantly affected by climate changes population growing and water pollution marin et al 2020 these changes do harm to food security and farmers incomes in rural areas over the 21 century ipcc 2014 the decrease of available water resources usually brings crop failures and starvation which calls for effective water use strategy to eliminate these negative impacts thus how to optimally allocate limited irrigation water resources to meet food demand and achieve income goals may be a continuous challenge for decision makers when drought occurs following principles are always used in irrigation water allocation 1 preferentially distribute to key crop growth stage many researches have revealed that slight water deficit at some growth stage sometimes not lead to significant yield reduction because of different water deficit sensitivities mandal et al 2020 comas et al 2019 moderate water deficit at some growth stages can even help improve photosynthesis ability at the later growth stage sales et al 2013 smilovic et al 2016 therefore identifying key growth stages and reducing unnecessary irrigation water is necessary when conducting irrigation water optimization 2 preferentially distribute to crops or regions with high water productivities or economic benefits the condition of soil and climate is varying with geolocation and allocating more water to those areas with well condition is more likely to achieve high yield additionally practical food demand and planting benefit play important roles when determining which kind of crop should be first irrigated 3 pay attention to groundwater recharge in shallow groundwater areas groundwater recharge is a vital water source for crop growth which contributes to replenishing soil moisture and can be absorbed by crop roots kisekka et al 2019 however if groundwater cannot be replenished by irrigation or precipitation in time the groundwater table will fall as continuous phreatic water evaporation the interaction relationship of groundwater table changes and crop water utilization during crop growth period to maximize yield is a question deserving research especially under drought conditions the above three principles are effective for optimizing irrigation water and helpful for improving water use efficiency which should be considered simultaneously in decision making process nevertheless few researches combined these principles in one framework this study makes an attempt to integrate these considerations into an optimization model to deal with agricultural water management problems in arid regions the agricultural water resources management system is complex because of various factors in the dynamic system such as meteorological conditions hydrological factors socio economic parameters etc generally these factors are uncertain and fluctuating within a range or following a specific stochastic distribution li et al 2017 the uncertain information should be considered in mathematical model formulation to reflect system dynamics and to cope with changing circumstances in the future in order to solve this problem grey numbers fuzzy sets and probability distributions of parameters have been introduced into system models dai et al 2014 many uncertain programming methods have been widely used for addressing water resource allocation problems among these uncertain programming methods fuzzy dependent chance multi objective programming is related to maximizing some chance functions of events in an uncertain environment by using fuzzy mathematical programming which can handle optimization problems with non stochastic distribution and vagueness and can undertake multiple conflicting events in complex decision systems liu 2000 then the concept of possibility measure credibility measure and necessity measure was put forward to measure a fuzzy event by zadeh 1978 liu and liu 2002 and li and liu 2006 however possibility measure and necessity measure are both suitable for extreme cases that rarely happen in real life based on traditional methods m λ measure was first introduced into uncertain programming establishing a linear relationship between possibility and necessity measures yang and iwamura 2008 the λ in m λ measure is used to quantify the level of optimism in decision making given based on decision makers knowledge and personal experience in optimization model formulation m λ measure is usually seen in constraints which allow decision makers make judgment about possible available resources and limitations according to their subject preference but these studies usually ignore that decision makers optimism or pessimism attitudes should be measured in objective function therefore applying m λ measure into fuzzy dependent chance multi objective programming can provide abundant decision schemes to meet the decision making demand of decision makers with different preferences and help to take early action to defense against droughts impacts wilhite 2016 this study proposes a fuzzy multi objective m λ measure dependent chance programming method to optimize limited irrigation water in arid regions this paper consists of the following three contents 1 introduce the practical problem facing by hetao irrigation district 2 establish an optimization model under droughts scenarios 3 analyze results obtained under uncertainties 4 assess crop water consumption after optimization under droughts 2 study system 2 1 study area hetao irrigation district hid is one of the largest irrigation areas in china including five subareas yongji subarea uulanbuh subarea yichang subarea jiefangzha subarea and urat subarea it locates in the west of inner mongolia autonomous region 40 13 42 28 n 105 12 109 53 e fig 1 and belongs to arid and semi arid region with a typical temperate continental semiarid and monsoon climate sun 2014 the annual average temperature in hid is 6 10 с the maximum and minimum temperature occur in july around 23 72 с and in january around 9 58 с the annual average precipitation is less than 250 mm mostly concentrating from june to september while the evaporation reaches 2011 2300 mm every year xue 2018 high evaporation and low precipitation make local people divert a lot of water from the yellow river to meet irrigation needs and the decrease of water diversion from april to september the major growth period of crops is regarded as a trigger for agricultural drought in hid and may pose a potential threat to local food security xue 2018 luan et al 2018 in the past 30 years the maximum and minimum of total water diversion april to september occurred in 1991 4 036 billion m3 and 2012 2 324 billion m3 respectively and the minimum was around 70 of the average 3 404 billion m3 to reflect possible drought situations in hid this study set three water diversion levels 100 no drought 85 moderate drought and 70 severe drought as drought scenarios the water diversion in 2010 is taken as 100 diversion scenario because its total diversion from april to september 3 399 billion m3 is closest to annual average water diversion level 3 404 billion m3 the monthly water diversion of other two drought scenarios can be obtained by multiplying 0 85 and 0 70 with corresponding monthly diversion amounts in 2010 respectively meteorological data in 2010 are collected and regarded as meteorological inputs of model hid is featured as its shallow groundwater depth and much frequent water exchange between surface water and groundwater experimental observations show that the average annual groundwater depth in hid is fluctuating between 1 5 m and 3 m and groundwater recharge can provide around 1 3 of total crop water consumption xu et al 2010 sun et al 2016 therefore groundwater recharge must be considered in agricultural water management models the initial groundwater table and related parameters can be found in table 4 hid is an important commodity grain base of china and more than 80 planted area is used for growing wheat maize and sunflower however when drought occurs these three kinds of crops can hardly be irrigated adequately the priority of irrigation for grain crops wheat and maize or economic crops sunflower must be made by decision makers for local people grain crops are essential materials for living on and economic crops are important for improving incomes there is a competition between water needed for grain crops growth and economic crops under limited water these two objectives need to be balanced under drought conditions in this study wheat maize and sunflower are selected as study crops their growth periods are all divided into four stages initial growth stage stage i rapid growth stage stage ii middle growth stage stage iii and late growth stage stage iv the detailed time period of crop growth stages can be found in table 1 2 2 data collection most data used in this study was collected from local yearbooks and research papers jiang et al 2016 xue et al 2017 2018 yue 2004 hou et al 2016 such as the amount of water diversion and crop planting area table 2 rainfall of each subarea table 3 crop information table 4 and crop water requirement at each growth stage table 5 meteorological data was acquired from local meteorological station and downloaded from the website of china meteorological data service center the e t m the maximum water requirement of crops mm is calculated based on the single crop coefficient approach proposed by fao 56 table 5 allen et al 1998 its calculation formula is as follows 1 e t m k c e t 0 where k c crop coefficient was collected from fao 56 allen et al 1998 the reference crop evapotranspiration e t 0 was calculated by fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 3 model development 3 1 technical framework in this study water movement and crop water production functions are integrated into one optimization model reflecting the relationship between irrigation water allocation and crops yield various uncertain factors such as evapotranspiration of crops utilization coefficients of irrigation water preference of decision makers etc are involved in the model formulation two objective functions are set as 1 grain crop yield should be greater than or equal to the average level over the years for ensuring food security 2 economic benefits are maximized as much as possible for maximizing economic benefits the first objective is the main concern of decision makers under drought conditions and decision makers preference can be described by m λ measure fig 2 as the basis of model establishment two hypotheses have been made before model formulation 1 the growth environment of the same crop in the same subarea is consistent 2 crops in any areas are mutually independent the technical framework is shown as follows 3 2 multi objective m λ fuzzy dependent chance programming multi objective m λ fuzzy dependent chance programming is developed via combing fuzzy dependent chance programming m λ measure and multi objectives programming the detailed multi objective m λ fuzzy dependent chance programming will be introduced in the following parts 3 2 1 m λ measure fuzzy dependent chance programming 1 possibility necessity and m λ measure p o s a and n e c a respectively describe the possibility and necessity of event a in a fuzzy environment their relationship can be expressed as eq 2 according to concepts of possibility and necessity measure liu and liu 2002 2 n e c a 1 p o s a for example the membership function of triangular fuzzy number b b 1 b 2 b 3 can be expressed as 3 μ x x b 1 b 2 b 1 i f b 1 x b 2 x b 3 b 2 b 3 i f b 2 x b 3 0 o t h e r s according to the definition of possibility and necessity the p o s x b and n e c x b can be expressed as follows 4 p o s x b 0 i f x b 1 x b 1 b 2 b 1 i f b 1 x b 2 1 i f x b 2 5 n e c x b 0 i f x b 2 x b 2 b 3 b 2 i f b 2 x b 3 1 i f x b 3 in reality the possibility measure means a kind of extreme optimistic judgment about possible opportunities while the necessity measure is used for describing the extreme pessimistic attitudes worrying about potential risks however such extreme situations hardly exist in reality decision makers have to make a tradeoff between possible opportunities and risks and thus the m λ measure was introduced in this study to tackle such problems and help reflect decision makers decision preference zhang et al 2017 6 m λ x b λ p o s x b 1 λ n e c x b the parameter λ is between 0 and 1 which is determined by decision makers personal optimism and pessimism preference λ 0 λ 0 5 and λ 1 indicate the necessity measure credibility measure and the possibility measure respectively according to the above formula the m λ measure expression of triangular fuzzy number b b 1 b 2 b 3 can be described as follows 7 m λ x b 0 i f x b 1 λ x λ b 1 b 2 b 1 i f b 1 x b 2 λ b 3 1 λ x b 2 b 3 b 2 i f b 2 x b 3 1 i f x b 3 2 m λ measure fuzzy dependent chance programming objective function 8 max m λ i 1 l j 1 m a i j x i j b constraints 9 g q x i j 0 i 1 2 l j 1 2 m k 1 2 q 10

replaced by c the objective function is modified as follows 11 max m λ c b let μ b c b represent the m λ measure of the variable c to b the possibility necessity and m λ measure of the triangular fuzzy number b b 1 b 2 b 3 can be expressed as fig 3 3 2 2 interval multi objective programming the practical optimization problems usually have to address multiple conflicting objectives which cannot be maximized simultaneously the typical multi objective programming is shown as follows 12 max i 1 m ω i f i x s t g j x 0 j 1 2 p where ω i ω 2 ω m are weight coefficients and ω i ω 2 ω m 1 to deal with interval numbers in the optimization model the interval programming was introduced into multi objective programming the obtained interval multi objective programming can be shown as eq 13 13 max i 1 m λ i f i x s t g j x 0 j 1 2 p where the parameter with superscript represents interval numbers with upper bound and lower bound to solve the model it can be converted into two deterministic submodels through the interactive algorithm 3 3 optimization model 3 3 1 objective function two objective functions of ensuring food security and maximizing economic benefits can be expressed as follows objective function 1 14 max f 1 c r i 1 5 j 1 2 y a i j a i j y objective function 2 15 max f 2 i 1 5 j 1 3 y a i j a i j e j where i is index of subareas in hid i 1 2 3 4 a n d 5 represent

objective functions respectively denote food security guarantee and economic income the above two objectives were addressed by weighting method the weights of objectives can be obtained by ahp method zhang et al 2019 the obtained ω 1 and ω 2 are respectively taken as 0 75 and 0 25 it indicates that the first objective has higher weight than the second objective because grain crops should be guaranteed primarily for food security under drought conditions finally two objective functions can be converted into one objective function as follows 16 max f ω 1 c r ω 2 f 2 f 2 min f 2 max f 2 min the y a i j in this model can be calculated by jensen model igbadun et al 2007 saseendran et al 2015 17 y a y m i 1 n e t a t e t m t β t where y a and y m respectively represent the actual and

step 1 collect necessary data including interval and fuzzy parameters 2 step 2 build the original model 3 step 3 select different λ values according to the preference of decision makers 4 step 4 split

solution f o p t f o p t and x o p t x o p t then return to step 3 7 step 7 obtain optimized schemes with nine λ values 0 1 0 9 4 results analysis 4 1 optimization results the optimization results provide the allocation of irrigation water fig 4 final yield and water use efficiency with λ in each subarea fig 5 1 irrigation water allocation among different crops the water demand of crops with high water productivities is preferentially satisfied under drought conditions maize occupies the maximum water allocation among three crops when water diversion is 100 more than 70 of maize is allocated irrigation water over 300 mm and the maximum is 377 45 382 83 mm in jiefangzha subarea the actual water consumption of about 80 of maize is over 90 of its maximum water demand this ensures about 86 of maize yield achieves 10 000 kg hm2 greater than 90 of its maximum yield in contrast the wheat yield after optimization only reaches to 64 47 86 00 of its maximum yield the water allocation to sunflower an economic crop remains the minimum level because of its lower water requirement and lower importance than other two grain crops on the whole three crops rank of total water allocation is maize sunflower wheat 2 irrigation water allocation in subareas the water allocation to different crops is greatly different in five subareas especially to sunflower when water diversion is 100 the water allocation to sunflower in urat subarea is quite lower than ulanbuh subarea in urat subarea the sunflower grows mainly depending on rainfall and recharge of groundwater there are two possible reasons 1 crops in urat subarea need less irrigation water because the precipitation here is higher than that in other subareas 2 the model tends to allocate more water to other subareas because the irrigation water use efficiency in these subareas is higher than urat subarea therefore water use efficiency is an important factor for selecting the irrigation priority among subareas 3 water consumption during the whole growth period of crops in most cases irrigation water is the main source of irrigation because soil water and the recharge of groundwater is limited and largely affected by initial soil water content rainfall and irrigation however soil water and the recharge of groundwater are important water sources for crops growth in hid for instance the water supply from soil and groundwater in ulanbuh subarea nearly reaches 1 3 water demand of maize at 175 27 189 23 mm it can be also observed from fig 4 f and fig 4 i that precipitation and water supply from soil and groundwater hold the key to crops growth in urat subarea where little irrigation water is allocated 4 influence of preference coefficient λ the preference coefficient λ reflects the optimistic and pessimistic attitudes of decision makers greater λ means decision makers hold more optimistic attitudes and more concern system possible chances in this paper with the increase of λ the water allocation to sunflower economic crop climbs slowly while the water allocation to maize and wheat grain crops shows a steadily decreasing trend the big water allocation gap with taking different λ indicates that decision makers preference will make a huge difference on water allocation for example the water allocation to wheat in jiefangzha subarea at λ 0 1 188 06 210 45 mm is roughly twice the water allocation at λ 0 9 95 70 112 66 mm fig 4 a besides the water allocation in some subareas almost remains the same level when λ changes such as the water allocation to maize in yongji and yichang subareas 5 influence of water diversion the water allocation to three crops does not decline linearly with water diversion decreasing to 85 or 70 levels because many formulas in this model are highly nonlinear and different crops have different weights as a crop with high weight maize in yichang subarea is still allocated high level irrigation water when water diversion is only 70 higher than the 70 reference line 68 09 82 67 mm and the water allocation to wheat and sunflower is lower or equal to the 85 and 70 reference lines besides low water diversion widens the water allocation gap between different crops more water is allocated to grain crops and less water is allocated to economic crops it is noteworthy that impacts of preference coefficient λ on water allocation become small when water diversion reduced to 70 it may be because the decrease of water diversion reduces the decision making space of decision makers 6 yield and water use efficiency at different water diversion scenarios the maize yield all reaches to high values closing to its maximum yield fig 5 b e h while the wheat yield and sunflower yield only account for 2 3 of maximum yield as for water use efficiency wue its rank of three crops among three scenarios is maize wheat sunflower which are 1 68 2 34 kg m3 1 37 1 79 kg m3 and 0 60 1 02 kg m3 respectively at 100 water diversion when water diversion decreases to 85 and 70 the maize wue slightly raises to 1 81 2 42 kg m3 and 1 91 2 42 kg m3 in addition the wues of grain crops are improved with the increase of preference coefficient λ which may be caused by decreasing water allocation to grain crops 4 2 water consumption of crops during the growing period in this study the allocation results of wheat in ulanbuh subarea fig 6 a maize in urat subarea fig 6 b and sunflower in yongji subarea fig 6 c are chosen as examples to analyze optimization results in each growth stage as fig 6 shown the water allocation mainly concentrates on stage ii and stage iii because these two growth stages have higher yield sensitivities to water deficit than other two growth stages low water allocation at stage ii and stage iii may cause serious losses in yield as fig 6 b shows the water allocation to maize at stage ii and stage iii are 51 59 104 45 mm and 88 62 170 81 mm however its water allocation at stage i is close to zero at this stage soil and groundwater can provide much water for maize growth because of saturated moisture and shallow groundwater table at the initial time it is worthy noted that the water supply from soil and groundwater in stage ii are negative numbers fig 6 b indicating that the rainfall and irrigation in stage ii are more than the actual water demand of maize so the surplus water is stored in the soil and will be consumed in the next growth stage 4 3 economic benefits compared with other two crops sunflower is the main source of local agricultural economic benefits it contributes more than half of total benefits in each subarea as shown in fig 7 firstly sunflower is largely planted due to its high economic value occupying 43 831 51 934 43 410 hm2 in yongji yichang and urat subarea respectively table 2 secondly its low water requirement makes it easier to get satisfying yield even though its allocated irrigation water is limited for example at 100 water diversion scenario the economic benefit of sunflower in yongji subarea is 16 68 18 79 108 yuan λ 0 5 at 70 water diversion scenario its economic benefit slightly falls to 15 02 16 13 108 yuan λ 0 5 if decision makers choose to adopt a conservative scheme λ 0 1 its economic benefit will drop to 14 36 15 43 108 yuan 5 discussion 1 the preference coefficient λ gives decision makers more decision choices in this study decision makers have increasing optimistic attitude with λ rising from 0 1 to 0 9 a more optimistic preference will decrease water allocation of grain crops and bring more risks that food demand cannot be met although the case λ 0 5 credibility measure offers a compromised solution and can be used to achieve a balance between extreme optimistic case and extreme pessimistic case it is also possible for decision makers to choose other risk levels according to complex actual situations for example if abnormally high temperature weather and continuous rainless days last for a long time crop evapotranspiration will increase dramatically and thus crop water demand is higher than available water crop water deficit will inevitably happen and crop yield will decrease which will threaten the local food security in this case decision makers are more likely to adopt a more conservative plan λ 0 5 to allocate more irrigation water to grain crops for ensuring food production therefore different preference coefficient λ does provide decision makers more choices in judging objective values of food security under different conditions 2 the weight between food security guarantee and economic benefits maximization is also a question worth discussing in this study the same weight is applied in three diversion scenarios there are two reasons 1 the weight is applicable within a certain range 2 applying the same weight is convenient for results comparison under different scenarios the weight of objective functions has a strong binding force to the model it greatly influences the preference satisfaction of objective functions the setting of multi objective weights can not only take multiple objectives into account but also flexibly reflect the importance of multiple objectives in varying scenarios 3 in agricultural water resources system irrigation water has a direct impact on soil water content crops evapotranspiration crops growth and crops yield the increase of irrigation water will improve irrigation infiltration and arise groundwater table therefore for arid area irrigation water can change crops living environment including ecological environment these aspects can be considered in future researches 4 obviously optimization schemes are obtained from a series of parameters calculations with certain objective functions and constraints these parameters include irrigation water utilization coefficient water sensitivity coefficient maximum yield the weight etc the correlations among them can be expressed by water balance formula crop actual water consumption formula groundwater table calculation formula etc however parameters collection may face difficulties some parameters and empirical formulas are obtained from long term experimental observations the accuracy of these parameters and the understanding of their physical processes will directly affect optimization results 6 conclusion in order to ensure food security and maximize economic benefits under drought conditions a multi objective m λ measure fuzzy dependent chance programming is developed in this study the advantages of this model are 1 consider the soil water and groundwater recharge to reflect the practical utilization mode of water 2 consider crops yield sensitivities to water deficit in each growth stage to achieve optimal water allocation in time 3 introduce m λ measure into objective functions to well reflect the optimistic and pessimistic decision making attitudes in optimization 4 make a tradeoff between ensuring food security and maximizing economic benefits the model successfully optimizes water allocation among wheat maize and sunflower in 5 subareas of hetao irrigation district the main conclusions are 1 maize should be firstly irrigated in order to ensure food production its water consumption still reaches to 62 97 of water requirement even under 70 water diversion scenario 2 allocating more irrigation water to yongji and jiefangzha subareas can help achieve more food production because of their high water use efficiencies 3 rapid growth stage and middle growth stage should be given priorities when allocating irrigation water under drought conditions at initial growth stage and late growth stage crops mainly consume rainfall soil moisture and groundwater recharge 4 when decision makers tend to hold a more optimistic attitude towards local food security high λ the water allocation to grain crops will be reduced that to economic crops will increase which may help improve total economic benefits when water diversion is at a low level the impact of the preference coefficient λ will be narrowed the model established in this study can handle optimal problems of irrigation water allocation in arid and semi arid areas with shallow groundwater under drought conditions and the way to consider decision makers preference can be used in other optimization problems for generating more alternatives however the dynamic impacts of changing irrigation water on ecological environment is significant for regional environment and haven t been considered in this model which should be furtherly studied in the

10216,in this study a fuzzy multi objective m λ measure dependent chance programming model was proposed to optimize limited irrigation water among three crops and five subareas in hetao irrigation district hid under uncertainties with the objectives of ensuring food security and maximizing economic benefits three levels of droughts 100 85 and 70 of annual average water diversion that may happen in hid were set as future possible droughts scenarios the optimization model considered the detailed physical process of soil water balance which is necessary for irrigation districts where groundwater recharge plays a major role when available water limited moreover sensitivities of crop yield to water deficit during crop growth periods were involved in model formulation to reflect the difference of crop water demand in different subareas in optimization model m λ measure was introduced into the first objective to quantify optimistic and pessimistic decision attitudes of decision makers and a series of alternatives were obtained the obtained results indicate that 1 the irrigation water of wheat maize and sunflower at rapid growth stage and middle growth stage should be preferentially guaranteed due to their high water deficit sensitivities the water demand at initial growth stage and late growth stage can be satisfied by soil water and groundwater recharge 2 maize has the priority of irrigation in almost all subareas while sunflower has to face water deficit when drought occurs 3 allocating more irrigation water to yongji and jiefangzha subareas can help increase food production 4 the irrigation water allocated to grain crops increases along with the decrease of λ representing decision makers more conservative preference the optimization model and results in this study provide decision makers abundant water allocation schemes under drought conditions keywords fuzzy dependent chance programming hetao irrigation district optimization food security drought mλ measure 1 introduction in recent years water availability and food production have been significantly affected by climate changes population growing and water pollution marin et al 2020 these changes do harm to food security and farmers incomes in rural areas over the 21 century ipcc 2014 the decrease of available water resources usually brings crop failures and starvation which calls for effective water use strategy to eliminate these negative impacts thus how to optimally allocate limited irrigation water resources to meet food demand and achieve income goals may be a continuous challenge for decision makers when drought occurs following principles are always used in irrigation water allocation 1 preferentially distribute to key crop growth stage many researches have revealed that slight water deficit at some growth stage sometimes not lead to significant yield reduction because of different water deficit sensitivities mandal et al 2020 comas et al 2019 moderate water deficit at some growth stages can even help improve photosynthesis ability at the later growth stage sales et al 2013 smilovic et al 2016 therefore identifying key growth stages and reducing unnecessary irrigation water is necessary when conducting irrigation water optimization 2 preferentially distribute to crops or regions with high water productivities or economic benefits the condition of soil and climate is varying with geolocation and allocating more water to those areas with well condition is more likely to achieve high yield additionally practical food demand and planting benefit play important roles when determining which kind of crop should be first irrigated 3 pay attention to groundwater recharge in shallow groundwater areas groundwater recharge is a vital water source for crop growth which contributes to replenishing soil moisture and can be absorbed by crop roots kisekka et al 2019 however if groundwater cannot be replenished by irrigation or precipitation in time the groundwater table will fall as continuous phreatic water evaporation the interaction relationship of groundwater table changes and crop water utilization during crop growth period to maximize yield is a question deserving research especially under drought conditions the above three principles are effective for optimizing irrigation water and helpful for improving water use efficiency which should be considered simultaneously in decision making process nevertheless few researches combined these principles in one framework this study makes an attempt to integrate these considerations into an optimization model to deal with agricultural water management problems in arid regions the agricultural water resources management system is complex because of various factors in the dynamic system such as meteorological conditions hydrological factors socio economic parameters etc generally these factors are uncertain and fluctuating within a range or following a specific stochastic distribution li et al 2017 the uncertain information should be considered in mathematical model formulation to reflect system dynamics and to cope with changing circumstances in the future in order to solve this problem grey numbers fuzzy sets and probability distributions of parameters have been introduced into system models dai et al 2014 many uncertain programming methods have been widely used for addressing water resource allocation problems among these uncertain programming methods fuzzy dependent chance multi objective programming is related to maximizing some chance functions of events in an uncertain environment by using fuzzy mathematical programming which can handle optimization problems with non stochastic distribution and vagueness and can undertake multiple conflicting events in complex decision systems liu 2000 then the concept of possibility measure credibility measure and necessity measure was put forward to measure a fuzzy event by zadeh 1978 liu and liu 2002 and li and liu 2006 however possibility measure and necessity measure are both suitable for extreme cases that rarely happen in real life based on traditional methods m λ measure was first introduced into uncertain programming establishing a linear relationship between possibility and necessity measures yang and iwamura 2008 the λ in m λ measure is used to quantify the level of optimism in decision making given based on decision makers knowledge and personal experience in optimization model formulation m λ measure is usually seen in constraints which allow decision makers make judgment about possible available resources and limitations according to their subject preference but these studies usually ignore that decision makers optimism or pessimism attitudes should be measured in objective function therefore applying m λ measure into fuzzy dependent chance multi objective programming can provide abundant decision schemes to meet the decision making demand of decision makers with different preferences and help to take early action to defense against droughts impacts wilhite 2016 this study proposes a fuzzy multi objective m λ measure dependent chance programming method to optimize limited irrigation water in arid regions this paper consists of the following three contents 1 introduce the practical problem facing by hetao irrigation district 2 establish an optimization model under droughts scenarios 3 analyze results obtained under uncertainties 4 assess crop water consumption after optimization under droughts 2 study system 2 1 study area hetao irrigation district hid is one of the largest irrigation areas in china including five subareas yongji subarea uulanbuh subarea yichang subarea jiefangzha subarea and urat subarea it locates in the west of inner mongolia autonomous region 40 13 42 28 n 105 12 109 53 e fig 1 and belongs to arid and semi arid region with a typical temperate continental semiarid and monsoon climate sun 2014 the annual average temperature in hid is 6 10 с the maximum and minimum temperature occur in july around 23 72 с and in january around 9 58 с the annual average precipitation is less than 250 mm mostly concentrating from june to september while the evaporation reaches 2011 2300 mm every year xue 2018 high evaporation and low precipitation make local people divert a lot of water from the yellow river to meet irrigation needs and the decrease of water diversion from april to september the major growth period of crops is regarded as a trigger for agricultural drought in hid and may pose a potential threat to local food security xue 2018 luan et al 2018 in the past 30 years the maximum and minimum of total water diversion april to september occurred in 1991 4 036 billion m3 and 2012 2 324 billion m3 respectively and the minimum was around 70 of the average 3 404 billion m3 to reflect possible drought situations in hid this study set three water diversion levels 100 no drought 85 moderate drought and 70 severe drought as drought scenarios the water diversion in 2010 is taken as 100 diversion scenario because its total diversion from april to september 3 399 billion m3 is closest to annual average water diversion level 3 404 billion m3 the monthly water diversion of other two drought scenarios can be obtained by multiplying 0 85 and 0 70 with corresponding monthly diversion amounts in 2010 respectively meteorological data in 2010 are collected and regarded as meteorological inputs of model hid is featured as its shallow groundwater depth and much frequent water exchange between surface water and groundwater experimental observations show that the average annual groundwater depth in hid is fluctuating between 1 5 m and 3 m and groundwater recharge can provide around 1 3 of total crop water consumption xu et al 2010 sun et al 2016 therefore groundwater recharge must be considered in agricultural water management models the initial groundwater table and related parameters can be found in table 4 hid is an important commodity grain base of china and more than 80 planted area is used for growing wheat maize and sunflower however when drought occurs these three kinds of crops can hardly be irrigated adequately the priority of irrigation for grain crops wheat and maize or economic crops sunflower must be made by decision makers for local people grain crops are essential materials for living on and economic crops are important for improving incomes there is a competition between water needed for grain crops growth and economic crops under limited water these two objectives need to be balanced under drought conditions in this study wheat maize and sunflower are selected as study crops their growth periods are all divided into four stages initial growth stage stage i rapid growth stage stage ii middle growth stage stage iii and late growth stage stage iv the detailed time period of crop growth stages can be found in table 1 2 2 data collection most data used in this study was collected from local yearbooks and research papers jiang et al 2016 xue et al 2017 2018 yue 2004 hou et al 2016 such as the amount of water diversion and crop planting area table 2 rainfall of each subarea table 3 crop information table 4 and crop water requirement at each growth stage table 5 meteorological data was acquired from local meteorological station and downloaded from the website of china meteorological data service center the e t m the maximum water requirement of crops mm is calculated based on the single crop coefficient approach proposed by fao 56 table 5 allen et al 1998 its calculation formula is as follows 1 e t m k c e t 0 where k c crop coefficient was collected from fao 56 allen et al 1998 the reference crop evapotranspiration e t 0 was calculated by fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 3 model development 3 1 technical framework in this study water movement and crop water production functions are integrated into one optimization model reflecting the relationship between irrigation water allocation and crops yield various uncertain factors such as evapotranspiration of crops utilization coefficients of irrigation water preference of decision makers etc are involved in the model formulation two objective functions are set as 1 grain crop yield should be greater than or equal to the average level over the years for ensuring food security 2 economic benefits are maximized as much as possible for maximizing economic benefits the first objective is the main concern of decision makers under drought conditions and decision makers preference can be described by m λ measure fig 2 as the basis of model establishment two hypotheses have been made before model formulation 1 the growth environment of the same crop in the same subarea is consistent 2 crops in any areas are mutually independent the technical framework is shown as follows 3 2 multi objective m λ fuzzy dependent chance programming multi objective m λ fuzzy dependent chance programming is developed via combing fuzzy dependent chance programming m λ measure and multi objectives programming the detailed multi objective m λ fuzzy dependent chance programming will be introduced in the following parts 3 2 1 m λ measure fuzzy dependent chance programming 1 possibility necessity and m λ measure p o s a and n e c a respectively describe the possibility and necessity of event a in a fuzzy environment their relationship can be expressed as eq 2 according to concepts of possibility and necessity measure liu and liu 2002 2 n e c a 1 p o s a for example the membership function of triangular fuzzy number b b 1 b 2 b 3 can be expressed as 3 μ x x b 1 b 2 b 1 i f b 1 x b 2 x b 3 b 2 b 3 i f b 2 x b 3 0 o t h e r s according to the definition of possibility and necessity the p o s x b and n e c x b can be expressed as follows 4 p o s x b 0 i f x b 1 x b 1 b 2 b 1 i f b 1 x b 2 1 i f x b 2 5 n e c x b 0 i f x b 2 x b 2 b 3 b 2 i f b 2 x b 3 1 i f x b 3 in reality the possibility measure means a kind of extreme optimistic judgment about possible opportunities while the necessity measure is used for describing the extreme pessimistic attitudes worrying about potential risks however such extreme situations hardly exist in reality decision makers have to make a tradeoff between possible opportunities and risks and thus the m λ measure was introduced in this study to tackle such problems and help reflect decision makers decision preference zhang et al 2017 6 m λ x b λ p o s x b 1 λ n e c x b the parameter λ is between 0 and 1 which is determined by decision makers personal optimism and pessimism preference λ 0 λ 0 5 and λ 1 indicate the necessity measure credibility measure and the possibility measure respectively according to the above formula the m λ measure expression of triangular fuzzy number b b 1 b 2 b 3 can be described as follows 7 m λ x b 0 i f x b 1 λ x λ b 1 b 2 b 1 i f b 1 x b 2 λ b 3

replaced by c the objective function is modified as follows 11 max m λ c b let μ b c b represent the m λ measure of the variable c to b the possibility necessity and m λ measure of the triangular fuzzy number b b 1 b 2 b 3 can be expressed as fig 3 3 2 2 interval multi objective programming the practical optimization problems usually have to address multiple conflicting objectives which cannot be maximized simultaneously the typical multi objective programming is shown as follows 12 max i 1 m ω i f i x s t g j x 0 j 1 2 p where ω i ω 2 ω m are weight coefficients and ω i ω 2 ω m 1 to deal with interval numbers in the optimization model the interval programming was introduced into multi objective programming the obtained interval multi objective programming can be shown as eq 13 13 max i 1 m λ i f i x s t g j x 0 j 1 2 p where the parameter with superscript represents interval numbers with upper bound and lower bound to solve the model it can be converted into two deterministic submodels through the interactive algorithm 3 3 optimization model 3 3 1 objective function two objective functions of ensuring food security and maximizing economic benefits can be expressed as follows objective function 1 14 max f 1 c r i 1 5 j 1 2 y a i j a i j y objective function 2 15 max f 2 i 1 5 j 1 3 y a i j a i j e j where i is index of subareas in hid i 1 2 3 4 a n d 5 represent

objective functions respectively denote food security guarantee and economic income the above two objectives were addressed by weighting method the weights of objectives can be obtained by ahp method zhang et al 2019 the obtained ω 1 and ω 2 are respectively taken as 0 75 and 0 25 it indicates that the first objective has higher weight than the second objective because grain crops should be guaranteed primarily for food security under drought conditions finally two objective functions can be converted into one objective function as follows 16 max f ω 1 c r ω 2 f 2 f 2 min f 2 max f 2 min the y a i j in this model can be calculated by jensen model igbadun et al 2007 saseendran et al 2015 17 y a y m i 1 n e t a t e t m t β t where y a and y m respectively represent the actual and

step 1 collect necessary data including interval and fuzzy parameters 2 step 2 build the original model 3 step 3 select different λ values according to the preference of decision makers 4 step 4 split upper and lower submodels according to interactive algorithm and solve the upper submodel firstly then the upper decision solution can be obtained x i j o p t f o p t 5 step 5 solve the lower submodel considering the upper decision solution and then the lower decision solution can be generated x i j o p t f o p t 6 step 6 combine the upper and lower decision solutions to obtain the final decision solution f o p t f o p t and x o p t x o p t then return to step 3 7 step 7 obtain optimized schemes with nine λ values 0 1 0 9 4 results analysis 4 1 optimization results the optimization results provide the allocation of irrigation water fig 4 final yield and water use efficiency with λ in each subarea fig 5 1 irrigation water allocation among different crops the water demand of crops with high water productivities is preferentially satisfied under drought conditions maize occupies the maximum water allocation among three crops when water diversion is 100 more than 70 of maize is allocated irrigation water over 300 mm and the maximum is 377 45 382 83 mm in jiefangzha subarea the actual water consumption of about 80 of maize is over 90 of its maximum water demand this ensures about 86 of maize yield achieves 10 000 kg hm2 greater than 90 of its maximum yield in contrast the wheat yield after optimization only reaches to 64 47 86 00 of its maximum yield the water allocation to sunflower an economic crop remains the minimum level because of its lower water requirement and lower importance than other two grain crops on the whole three crops rank of total water allocation is maize sunflower wheat 2 irrigation water allocation in subareas the water allocation to different crops is greatly different in five subareas especially to sunflower when water diversion is 100 the water allocation to sunflower in urat subarea is quite lower than ulanbuh subarea in urat subarea the sunflower grows mainly depending on rainfall and recharge of groundwater there are two possible reasons 1 crops in urat subarea need less irrigation water because the precipitation here is higher than that in other subareas 2 the model tends to allocate more water to other subareas because the irrigation water use efficiency in these subareas is higher than urat subarea therefore water use efficiency is an important factor for selecting the irrigation priority among subareas 3 water consumption during the whole growth period of crops in most cases irrigation water is the main source of irrigation because soil water and the recharge of groundwater is limited and largely affected by initial soil water content rainfall and irrigation however soil water and the recharge of groundwater are important water sources for crops growth in hid for instance the water supply from soil and groundwater in ulanbuh subarea nearly reaches 1 3 water demand of maize at 175 27 189 23 mm it can be also observed from fig 4 f and fig 4 i that precipitation and water supply from soil and groundwater hold the key to crops growth in urat subarea where little irrigation water is allocated 4 influence of preference coefficient λ the preference coefficient λ reflects the optimistic and pessimistic attitudes of decision makers greater λ means decision makers hold more optimistic attitudes and more concern system possible chances in this paper with the increase of λ the water allocation to sunflower economic crop climbs slowly while the water allocation to maize and wheat grain crops shows a steadily decreasing trend the big water allocation gap with taking different λ indicates that decision makers preference will make a huge difference on water allocation for example the water allocation to wheat in jiefangzha subarea at λ 0 1 188 06 210 45 mm is roughly twice the water allocation at λ 0 9 95 70 112 66 mm fig 4 a besides the water allocation in some subareas almost remains the same level when λ changes such as the water allocation to maize in yongji and yichang subareas 5 influence of water diversion the water allocation to three crops does not decline linearly with water diversion decreasing to 85 or 70 levels because many formulas in this model are highly nonlinear and different crops have different weights as a crop with high weight maize in yichang subarea is still allocated high level irrigation water when water diversion is only 70 higher than the 70 reference line 68 09 82 67 mm and the water allocation to wheat and sunflower is lower or equal to the 85 and 70 reference lines besides low water diversion widens the water allocation gap between different crops more water is allocated to grain crops and less water is allocated to economic crops it is noteworthy that impacts of preference coefficient λ on water allocation become small when water diversion reduced to 70 it may be because the decrease of water diversion reduces the decision making space of decision makers 6 yield and water use efficiency at different water diversion scenarios the maize yield all reaches to high values closing to its maximum yield fig 5 b e h while the wheat yield and sunflower yield only account for 2 3 of maximum yield as for water use efficiency wue its rank of three crops among three scenarios is maize wheat sunflower which are 1 68 2 34 kg m3 1 37 1 79 kg m3 and 0 60 1 02 kg m3 respectively at 100 water diversion when water diversion decreases to 85 and 70 the maize wue slightly raises to 1 81 2 42 kg m3 and 1 91 2 42 kg m3 in addition the wues of grain crops are improved with the increase of preference coefficient λ which may be caused by decreasing water allocation to grain crops 4 2 water consumption of crops during the growing period in this study the allocation results of wheat in ulanbuh subarea fig 6 a maize in urat subarea fig 6 b and sunflower in yongji subarea fig 6 c are chosen as examples to analyze optimization results in each growth stage as fig 6 shown the water allocation mainly concentrates on stage ii and stage iii because these two growth stages have higher yield sensitivities to water deficit than other two growth stages low water allocation at stage ii and stage iii may cause serious losses in yield as fig 6 b shows the water allocation to maize at stage ii and stage iii are 51 59 104 45 mm and 88 62 170 81 mm however its water allocation at stage i is close to zero at this stage soil and groundwater can provide much water for maize growth because of saturated moisture and shallow groundwater table at the initial time it is worthy noted that the water supply from soil and groundwater in stage ii are negative numbers fig 6 b indicating that the rainfall and irrigation in stage ii are more than the actual water demand of maize so the surplus water is stored in the soil and will be consumed in the next growth stage 4 3 economic benefits compared with other two crops sunflower is the main source of local agricultural economic benefits it contributes more than half of total benefits in each subarea as shown in fig 7 firstly sunflower is largely planted due to its high economic value occupying 43 831 51 934 43 410 hm2 in yongji yichang and urat subarea respectively table 2 secondly its low water requirement makes it easier to get satisfying yield even though its allocated irrigation water is limited for example at 100 water diversion scenario the economic benefit of sunflower in yongji subarea is 16 68 18 79 108 yuan λ 0 5 at 70 water diversion scenario its economic benefit slightly falls to 15 02 16 13 108 yuan λ 0 5 if decision makers choose to adopt a conservative scheme λ 0 1 its economic benefit will drop to 14 36 15 43 108 yuan 5 discussion 1 the preference coefficient λ gives decision makers more decision choices in this study decision makers have increasing optimistic attitude with λ rising from 0 1 to 0 9 a more optimistic preference will decrease water allocation of grain crops and bring more risks that food demand cannot be met although the case λ 0 5 credibility measure offers a compromised solution and can be used to achieve a balance between extreme optimistic case and extreme pessimistic case it is also possible for decision makers to choose other risk levels according to complex actual situations for example if abnormally high temperature weather and continuous rainless days last for a long time crop evapotranspiration will increase dramatically and thus crop water demand is higher than available water crop water deficit will inevitably happen and crop yield will decrease which will threaten the local food security in this case decision makers are more likely to adopt a more conservative plan λ 0 5 to allocate more irrigation water to grain crops for ensuring food production therefore different preference coefficient λ does provide decision makers more choices in judging objective values of food security under different conditions 2 the weight between food security guarantee and economic benefits maximization is also a question worth discussing in this study the same weight is applied in three diversion scenarios there are two reasons 1 the weight is applicable within a certain range 2 applying the same weight is convenient for results comparison under different scenarios the weight of objective functions has a strong binding force to the model it greatly influences the preference satisfaction of objective functions the setting of multi objective weights can not only take multiple objectives into account but also flexibly reflect the importance of multiple objectives in varying scenarios 3 in agricultural water resources system irrigation water has a direct impact on soil water content crops evapotranspiration crops growth and crops yield the increase of irrigation water will improve irrigation infiltration and arise groundwater table therefore for arid area irrigation water can change crops living environment including ecological environment these aspects can be considered in future researches 4 obviously optimization schemes are obtained from a series of parameters calculations with certain objective functions and constraints these parameters include irrigation water utilization coefficient water sensitivity coefficient maximum yield the weight etc the correlations among them can be expressed by water balance formula crop actual water consumption formula groundwater table calculation formula etc however parameters collection may face difficulties some parameters and empirical formulas are obtained from long term experimental observations the accuracy of these parameters and the understanding of their physical processes will directly affect optimization results 6 conclusion in order to ensure food security and maximize economic benefits under drought conditions a multi objective m λ measure fuzzy dependent chance programming is developed in this study the advantages of this model are 1 consider the soil water and groundwater recharge to reflect the practical utilization mode of water 2 consider crops yield sensitivities to water deficit in each growth stage to achieve optimal water allocation in time 3 introduce m λ measure into objective functions to well reflect the optimistic and pessimistic decision making attitudes in optimization 4 make a tradeoff between ensuring food security and maximizing economic benefits the model successfully optimizes water allocation among wheat maize and sunflower in 5 subareas of hetao irrigation district the main conclusions are 1 maize should be firstly irrigated in order to ensure food production its water consumption still reaches to 62 97 of water requirement even under 70 water diversion scenario 2 allocating more irrigation water to yongji and jiefangzha subareas can help achieve more food production because of their high water use efficiencies 3 rapid growth stage and middle growth stage should be given priorities when allocating irrigation water under drought conditions at initial growth stage and late growth stage crops mainly consume rainfall soil moisture and groundwater recharge 4 when decision makers tend to hold a more optimistic attitude towards local food security high λ the water allocation to grain crops will be reduced that to economic crops will increase which may help improve total economic benefits when water diversion is at a low level the impact of the preference coefficient λ will be narrowed the model established in this study can handle optimal problems of irrigation water allocation in arid and semi arid areas with shallow groundwater under drought conditions and the way to consider decision makers preference can be used in other optimization problems for generating more alternatives however the dynamic impacts of changing irrigation water on ecological environment is significant for regional environment and haven t been considered in this model which should be furtherly studied in the

10217,it is generally recognized that the success of agricultural innovations depends to a large extent on farmers satisfaction with them while the acceptance of drip irrigation among iranian farmers is low this study aims to investigate farmers satisfaction with drip irrigation technology and related factors the european satisfaction model esm was used to achieve this aim a cross sectional paper based survey was conducted among farmers n 174 in the behbahan county of southwest iran the esm analysis results showed that perceived hard quality was positive in predicting perceived value results also indicated that perceived value perceived image and both hard and human quality directly affected farmers satisfaction these four variables were able to predict 68 variance in farmers satisfaction moreover loyalty was firmly positively affected by satisfaction and perceived image based on these results policies were suggested to increase farmers satisfaction and consequently to extend drip

national food security desertification the development of wastelands destruction of natural ecosystems and ultimately threats to national security in this regard michailidis et al 2011 argue that increased stresses due to water scarcity have compelled the agricultural sector to conserve water and optimize its use action is now needed to ensure that access to water and competition for it do not impede future prosperity and development world bank 2017 conservation of water resources and cost effective and sustainable use of irrigation water are essential for reducing the water scarcity problem in iran tweet 2015 nazari et al 2018 given iran s water status reduced water consumption through water conservation is the country s first and last choice for avoiding significant physical water scarcity in the future particularly in the agricultural sector which is the biggest consumer of fresh water in iran 93 ashraf et al 2019 agricultural water use efficiency in iran 35 is however very low madani 2014 world bank 2017 compared to the developed countries where it is over 70 fao 2016 zhang et al 2019 in light of the progressively worsening water situation methods have been used to alleviate this crisis in iran with water saving irrigation being one crucial approach to encouraging water conservation in irrigated areas nikouei et al 2012 pakmehr et al 2020a 2020b improving water efficiency in the agriculture sector is thus a critical target for conserving water and alleviating the water crisis yazdanpanah et al 2014 2015 rahimi feyzabad et al 2020 azadi et al 2019 modern irrigation systems have many advantages hanjra and qureshi 2010 balana et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 and the adoption of efficient irrigation techniques by farmers is critical to mitigating water problems tang et al 2016 efficient irrigation is regularly recommended in connection with water use on farms as drip irrigation is considered to be the best option for increasing efficiency garb and friedlander 2014 the iranian government has made substantial efforts to facilitate adoption of these new systems by farmers for example by investing through subsidies and long term low interest loans the government has also supplied equipment extension and advisory services and other the necessary inputs however there have been reports bagheri and ghorbani 2011 that the adoption of efficient irrigation techniques in iran has remained unexpectedly low in spite of this encouragement indeed the international commission on irrigation and drainage icid 2012 has declared that even though the benefits of drip irrigation have been confirmed and widely promoted over the past couple of decades worldwide acceptance is still under 4 of total irrigated land area it is generally recognized that the success of such initiatives depends basically on end user implementation and of course approval luo and timothy 2017 lopus et al 2017 have argued that the failure of the new irrigation system could result from user dissatisfaction although a huge body of studies have been undertaken in iran to identify factors relating to adoption of the new irrigation system these studies have failed to take account of farmers post adoption experience of it and thus the system s potential for adoption in the future in other words these studies have not considered the impact of farmers disconfirmed beliefs perceptions on their satisfaction and whether they have enough loyalty to the technology to continue using it in the future longevity thus given that the contribution of new irrigation systems to water security globally has been emphasized but adoption of them has been low it is well worth asking what the factors are that contribute to user satisfaction dissatisfaction the adoption of innovation in the agriculture sector is rarely fast and this includes new irrigation systems van rijn et al 2012 innovation is often seen as threatening involving uncertainty about what the appropriate applications are scale suitability and whether it will work in the predominant environment significantly technological innovations also affect users opinions expectations and outlooks mottaleb 2018 investigating farmers expectations and outlooks about such innovations is thus important for guaranteeing acceptance and scaling up of the innovation and thus for the progress development and sustainability of agriculture as a whole mottaleb 2018 xiao et al 2019 evaluating farmers satisfaction regarding new agriculture technology is an important indicator of their perceptions and expectations this kind of evaluation can minimize the gap between the actual and the expected performance of a new agricultural technology which in turn can critically influence its adoption and diffusion mottaleb 2018 in this regard gomo et al 2014 have argued that such an evaluation can have various advantages for example it can be used as a performance criterion for a modern irrigation plan furthermore lopus et al 2017 believe that sustainable management of common resources in irrigation systems is dependent on farmers being satisfied with the performance of those systems in the water crisis of today it is reasonable to investigate farmers satisfaction with new and innovative irrigation systems agricultural innovation always has a problem with acceptability because many stakeholders do not believe that an innovation is applicable to them and resist it indeed stakeholders assert that some agricultural innovations stop them making their own judgment as to whether the technology involved is applicable or suitable according to some policy evaluations micro irrigation systems have not operated successfully and have not generally been useful for irrigating cropland huang et al 2010 wang et al 2017 this perspective has been borne out through participatory development technology in this regard many studies lopus et al 2017 have highlighted the significance of farmers involvement in designing technology and have acknowledged that experts and designers must consider the farmers needs and expectations based on their socioeconomic and ecological setting they point out that technology driven research must be participatory to allow farmers to be thoroughly involved in the development of the technology that affects them farmers are more likely to accept new technology if they recognize that their wishes and expectations have been taken into consideration when it was being designed yazdanpanah et al 2013 not unpredictably farmers will adopt innovations if the innovations meet their preferences needs and expectations in other words the adoption and continued use by farmers of a new irrigation system is probably equivalent to expressing satisfaction with it thus the evaluation of farmers satisfaction with the performance of new irrigation systems has been strongly recommended as a tool to improve those systems see yazdanpanah and feyzabad 2017 new irrigation systems are expensive alcon et al 2014 for farmers to be able to use new technology proficiently policymakers and the designers of new technologies need decision making tools that can help them address the wishes and needs of farmers such tools can also help achieve farmers satisfaction if policymakers and designers evaluate how satisfied farmers are with a new irrigation system they can use this information along with user suggestions to come up with innovations that meet farmers needs so that products are designed to be more compatible with farmers expectations and demands yazdanpanah et al 2013 tebebal and mathewos 2016 furthermore from the perspective of public performance evaluation theories it is very important for the products and services to be evaluated through public consent and to be identified as high performance products and services elias et al 2015 farmer satisfaction acts as an internal impact assessment that can provide policymakers with a starting point for understanding why adoption may be low the sustainability of these innovation programs depends on the willingness of farmers to continue to participate in them which itself ultimately depends on their satisfaction with the product elias et al 2015 if the rural community is satisfied sustainable development which has become the principal objective of scientific investigation and policy outlines ridaura et al 2002 then becomes a more achievable proposition luo and timothy 2017 flores and sarandón 2004 have argued that farmer satisfaction reflects a significant display of sustainability in conclusion evaluation of the performance of new irrigation systems through measuring farmers satisfaction is crucial for both internal and external reasons anderson 1994 internally client satisfaction will help monitor performance allocate resources and compensate employees externally it will provide information to farmers investors policymakers and even taxpayers yazdanpanah and feyzabad 2017 finally loyalty that results naturally from individual satisfaction has positive marketing benefits such as decreasing prices the winning of new clients and greater trade leverage aaker 1991 in other words modern irrigation systems will spread among farmers more quickly and will cost less the concept of farmer satisfaction should thus be translated into a number of measurable parameters and water managers should undertake surveys to ascertain farmers specific needs and expectations about new water systems this will draw farmers into the problem identification process and help create better understanding and evaluation of these targets see yazdanpanah et al 2013 however there has been little study of farmers satisfaction and to the authors knowledge no research of this type undertaken in iran the performance of these systems and user satisfaction must be evaluated so that the positives and negatives of any plan can be identified in advance and the results used to improve irrigation efficiency systems evaluating the performance of new installed irrigation systems comes into the same category identifying the how satisfied farmers are with their new irrigation system is crucial not only in terms of the design and implementation of such systems but also to adjusting government policies regarding irrigation maskey and weber 1996 furthermore from the management view it is imperative for those who make and sell such systems as well as those who provide the services associated with them to understand who their customers are and what their situations are only then can they build an ongoing relationship with them and ensure strong client loyalty askariazad and babakhani 2015 however to the best of the authors knowledge few studies have evaluated farmers satisfaction with regard to their new irrigation system thus the goal of this study was to quantity the satisfaction of farmers in iran with their new irrigation system and to improve our understanding as to why farmers adopt or do not adopt such technology or alternatively why they acquire it and stop using it this research should fill information gaps on both the theoretical and practical side of new irrigation systems in developing countries on the theoretical side we propose and empirically test a customer satisfaction index the european customer satisfaction index ecsi on the practical side the model can serve as a diagnostic tool to determine why farmers are satisfied or dissatisfied whether the complaints handling procedure is effective how to improve farmers satisfaction and how effective the efforts at improving farmers satisfaction are the paper is structured as follows section 2 described the european customer satisfaction index as research theoretical framework section 3 present research methods which include study design research population and sampling and questionnaire section 4 presents the results and section 5 discusses the results and implication policies 2 european customer satisfaction index ecsi the european customer satisfaction index ecsi builds upon previous customer satisfaction indexes in particular the swedish customer satisfaction barometer scsb and the american customer satisfaction index acsi eklof 2000 the origins of customer satisfaction models date back in fact to the establishment of the scsb by fornell 1992 ecsi is a new version of acsi eklof 2000 however there are three main differences among the indexes first the ecsi no longer includes complaints when measuring satisfaction and second in association with original norwegian customer satisfaction barometer ecsi includes a new latent construct called corporate image johnson et al 2001 finally in ecsi perceived quality is separated into two different subcomponents hard ware and human ware this terminology is explained in detail below kristensen et al 2001 the ecsi model thus contains seven latent variables of which four are determinants of satisfaction including expectations perceived quality hardware and human ware perceived value and perceived image while loyalty is a result of satisfaction see figure1 the ecsi satisfaction index is calculated using an econometric model that in terms of a causal relationship links a set of latent constructs to a customer satisfaction index the model then links satisfaction to customer loyalty josé vilares and simões coelho 2003 briefly satisfaction has been defined as an overall positive evaluation of a product s post purchase performance or service utilization fornell 1992 or a customer s positive overall experience to date of a product or service provider johnson and fornell 1991 the first determinant of satisfaction is customer expectations about the performance of a product or service however rather than being a normative standard that the customer should expect it represents what a customer assesses that he she should expect this variable acts as a cognitive anchor in the evaluation process and also has a direct and positive relation with satisfaction johnson et al 2001 therefore based on the publications cited we hypothesized h1 relationship between farmers expectation and farmers perceived value and h2 relationship between farmers expectation and farmers satisfaction the second determinant of satisfaction is perceived value this can either relate to customer attitudes to performance or be a comparison between the degree of quality perceived by the customer and the price paid for the product service as well as the money and time spent on it by the consumer regarding the relation between this construct and satisfaction the main estimate is a direct and positive one namely the difference between perceived value and customer expectations throughout the length of the consumption experience while the former value emphasizes individual recent consumption experience the latter focuses on individual experience prior to consumption regarding a product or services or through another type of information gathering such as advertising and personal recommendation johnson et al 2001 consequently the following hypothesis has been derived h3 relationship between farmers perceived value and farmers satisfaction the third determinants of satisfaction are perceived quality perceived quality is the customer s evaluation of recent consumption experience two primary components of perceived quality are the degree to which a product or service provides key customer requirements customization and the degree to which a firm s offering is reliable standardized and free from defects reliability fornell et al 1996 as mentioned earlier in the ecsi perceived quality is separated into two different subcomponents hard ware and human ware hard ware is the quality of the product service features and human ware embodies the associated customer communications linked to the service that is the way personnel treat the customer and how good the service environment is kristensen et al 2001 hence based on this framework we hypothesized h4 the relationship between farmers perceived quality hard ware and farmers perceived value h5 the relationship between farmers perceived quality hard ware and farmers satisfaction h6 the relationship between farmers perceived quality soft ware and farmers perceived value and h7 the relationship between farmers perceived quality soft ware and farmers satisfaction the last determinant of satisfaction is corporate image which refers to the overall impression that has formed in the consumer s mind about a firm askariazad and babakhani 2015 based on this index we thus hypothesized that h8 relationship between farmers perceived image and farmers satisfaction and h9 relationship between farmers perceived image and farmers loyalty satisfaction results in loyalty and based on the model assumptions the direct result of client satisfaction will be increased loyalty toward organization or products loyalty due to its impacts on actual client maintenance with organization product or services and ensuing profitability is the ultimate outcome of this model johnson et al 2001 therefore we assumed h10 relationship between farmers satisfaction and farmers loyalty 3 research methods this study was designed to determine farmers satisfaction regarding modern irrigation systems and factors determining this satisfaction in behbahan district behbahan county is located in southeast of khuzestan province in southwest iran see map in fig 1 behbahan is 313 m above sea level at latitude 30 35 45 24 n and longitude 50 14 30 12 e this county is one of the most important agricultural areas of khuzestan province and of iran as a whole due to the maroon zohreh and kheirabad rivers and fertile soil its most important agricultural products are wheat maize barley rice alfalfa sesame safflower and dates a cross sectional paper based survey was undertaken in this county the statistical population of this study includes farmers using drip irrigation systems on their farm n n 174 the average age of respondents was 53 years sd 9 40 the average length of farmers experience was 28 years sd 11 37 the average size of farm was 19 ha the minimum farm size was 2 ha and the maximum was 160 ha the majority of the farmers surveyed 98 3 99 4 in the study are male and married nearly one third 28 7 of the respondents have an off farm income regarding educational levels most of the farmers had primary and high school education 27 43 only 16 had secondary and 14 university education the research data was gathered based on a paper questionnaire based on past related literature focused mostly on individual satisfaction farmers answered several items using a likert type 5 point scale table 1 the use of multiple items as variables increased the accuracy of the estimate rather than just one item being applied fornell 1994 ryane et al 1995 fornell et al 1996 to develop the questionnaire and guarantee the validity of the measures we acquired most items through a comprehensive review of past related literature focused mostly on customer satisfaction these items were modified to be appropriate to the current study before the final stage of data gathering to ensure that questions were worded clearly that potential responses covered common themes and that topics were relevant to our sample we asked a panel of experts in disciplines such as agricultural education and extension economics water science and environmental psychology to examine the validity of the questionnaire we also tested reliability of the questionnaire via a pilot study with 30 farmers this revealed the reliability of the questionnaire variables 0 63 0 90 as good to excellent 4 results 4 1 descriptive statistics of variables in order to determine the descriptive analysis of expectation perceived quality of human ware perceived quality of hard ware perceived image perceived value satisfaction and loyalty of farmers the standard deviation distance index of interval of standard deviation from the mean isdm gangadharappa et al 2007 was used according to the isdm individuals responses were categorized into three levels low medium and high as follows low a mean 1 2 sd medium mean 1 2 sd b mean 1 2 sd high c mean 1 2 sd the descriptive statistics the mean and standard deviation of dependent variable satisfaction and loyalty and independent variables image expectation perceived quality hard ware perceived quality human ware and perceived value are presented in tables 1 and 2 and fig 1 the mean score for expectation variable was 3 96 the descriptive finding showed that mean score for the perceived quality hard ware and human ware were 3 74 and 2 85 respectevely the descriptive results also show that the mean score for expectation perceived image perceived value satisfaction and loyalty were 3 96 3 96 3 98 4 26 and 4 07 respectively in evaluating the status of research variables based on the isdm index the results showed that only the perceived quality hard ware is in good condition because more than 50 of respondents were at a high level however other variables such as expectations perceived quality human ware image perceived value and loyalty were moderate furthermore the satisfaction construct is not in a good situation because most of the respondents are at a low level table 2 4 2 correlation the result of correlation among all constructs of the ecsi model are shown in table 3 statistically significant correlations were noted between farmers satisfaction and other constructs of this model except farmers expectation interestingly farmers expectation is not correlated with the other constructs of this model except farmers perceived image 4 3 data analysis 4 3 1 measurement model structural equation modeling sem methodology is a sophisticated method that includes a whole series of multivariate analyses comprising factor analysis multiple regression analysis of variance anova and many others sem with confirmatory factor analysis cfa and path analysis is a versatile multivariate approach for measuring latent variables and structural relationships between the variables under study for determining causal relationships between independent and dependent variables pawaskar et al 2017 structural equation modeling involves two separate stages of confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the fit of the measurement model and then to perform structural equation modeling to estimate the relationships between latent variables the measurement model postulates how latent variables should be evaluated in terms of the observed variables and it represents the validity and reliability of the responses of observed variables to latent variables bagozzi and yi 1988 hair et al 2006 confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the χ2 of the measurement model is 523 393 with 380 degrees of freedom df p 0 05 implying that the measurement model was not a good fit with the data however a large sample size can hinder this test s ability to assess model fitness because sample size can affect the χ2 value mcdonald and ho 2002 the present study used various indices to determine the adequacy of the model such as root mean square error of approximation rmsea adjusted good ness of fit index agfi goodness of fit index gfi tucker lewis index tli comparative fit index cfi incremental fit index ifi normed fit index nfi and standardized root mean square residual srmr for rmsea less than 0 06 is generally considered a very good fit 0 08 or higher is considered a reasonable fit and greater than 0 10 is considered a poor fit hu and bentler 1999 for tli values around 0 90 or higher indicate a good fit for agfi values must be greater than 0 8 nfi ifi gfi tli and cfi must be greater than 0 9 henry and stone 1994 scott 1994 srmr values less than 0 80 are usually considered to represent an acceptable model hair et al 2010 based on a summary of their results the measurement model satisfies the criteria of the gfi of 0 830 agfi of 0 792 tli of 0 942 ifi of 0 950 nfi of 0 821 cfi of 0 939 rmsea of 0 049 and srmr of 0 0627 therefore the research measurement model has an acceptable fit however gfi has a marginal value and therefore the model should be interpreted with caution table 1 lists factor loadings cronbach s alpha average variance extracted ave and composite reliability cr for the latent variables the reliability of the variables is frequently verified by means of cronbach s alpha and composite reliability value the suggested situation value of these is 0 70 which recommends that when the value of both the cronbach s alpha and composite reliability are more than 0 70 the variable has good reliability fornell and larcker 1981 results show that all cr values and cronbach s alpha exceeded 0 70 indicating that the latent variables had internal consistency jöreskog and sörbom 1996 and thus supported the reliability of this research fornell and larcker 1981 construct validity can be tested using convergent validity and discriminant validity convergent validity was also evaluated by using average variance extracted ave for this assessment the criterion was that average variance should exceed 0 5 bagozzi and yi 1988 in this study the ave for all variables exceeded the threshold of 0 5 indicating that this study had adequate convergent validity 4 3 2 structural equation modeling the structural equation model sem analysis was conducted to assess the proposed research hypotheses see table 4 the results uncovered the acceptable fit of the model to the dataset χ2 df 1 396 gfi 0 830 agfi 0 795 cfi 0 941 ifi 0 942 nfi 0 821 rmsea 0 048 rmr 0 040 and srmr 0 0730 the sem analysis results were shown in fig 2 and the hypothesis testing results were summarized in table 4 it is known that farmers perceived quality of hard was positive in predicting farmers perceived value with a path coefficient of 0 56 t 4 314 p 0 001 this variable predicted 37 of the variance of farmers perceived value in addition the analytical results indicated that the farmers perceived value β 0 61 farmers perceived image β 0 17 and farmers perceived hard ware quality β 0 35 and farmers perceived human ware quality β 0 29 affected farmers satisfaction directly these four variables could predict 68 variance in farmers satisfaction furthermore farmers loyalty was firmly positively affected by farmers satisfaction with a path coefficient of 0 32 and farmers perceived image with a path coefficient of 0 56 additionally the squared multiple correlation equivalent to r2 was 0 53 for farmers loyalty indicating that 53 of the variance in farmers loyalty was predicted by the model 5 discussion the application of innovation such as the implementation of a new irrigation system in rural and farming areas has various benefits including climate adaptation where there is water scarcity protection of water resources improvement of agriculture production and poverty reduction such innovations are promoted by and invested in by policymakers in many developing countries evaluating the success of these policies is essential for continued investment and future sustainability there is mounting recognition that successful innovation may basically depend on farmers satisfaction in fact farmers satisfaction can be crucial in exploratory assessments of the real effects of new irrigation systems luo and timothy 2017 the aim of the current study was to evaluate the performance of new irrigation systems from the perspectives of farmers to the best of the authors knowledge the current study is the first in the middle east if not in the world to apply a satisfaction scale to evaluate farmers satisfaction regarding their new irrigation system adoption decisions are fairly complex to evaluate yazdanpanah et al 2013 however the evaluation of social projects like this that are invested in by governments using public money is highly recommended see yazdanpanah and feyzabad 2017 we believe that evaluating the performance of irrigation systems can have a significant impact on reducing farmers rejection of these innovations if the results of this evaluation are considered by policymakers such evaluations can also be an effective tool in ensuring that farmers actually accept an innovation in other words the results of our study allow government irrigation system producers and retailers to understand what factors significantly encouragement overall farmer satisfaction these factors can be seen in the causal relationship in the ecsi model and the strategic management map see elias et al 2015 our results revealed that only hard ware quality can predict farmers perceived value and that farmers expectation and farmers percieved human ware quality have no any effect on farmers perceived value this demonstrates that for iranian farmers value is seen only in the quality of their systems in other words if policymakers wish to increase farmers perceived value as a main predictor of farmers satisfaction special emphasis should be placed on producing quality components and tools for irrigation systems see yazdanpanah et al 2013 assessments of the achievements of new irrigation systems should give more careful consideration to the value of perceived performance rather than simply to operational performance on the ground concerns about farmers satisfaction with new irrigation systems need to be explored further to correct any shortcomings in the product that may cause disappointment this will help achieve the goal of improving the performance of public investment in new irrigation systems furthermore sem results revealed that jointly the farmers percieved quality aspects farmers perceived value and farmers perceived image can determine farmers satisfaction our results revealed that the price value of irrigation system and the hard quality of systems are not the only factor determining the success or failure of a new irrigation system project see yazdanpanah et al 2013 in other words concentrating only on a single aspect may decrease farmers satisfaction the findings confirmed that value together with the quality of the services that farmers receive both components and the image of the agricultural office as the provider of irrigation systems have an effect on improving farmers satisfaction with new irrigation systems see yazdanpanah and feyzabad 2017 this means that although the value of the irrigation system is very important to farmers and will help them to adapt to water scarcity other aspects of quality johnson et al 2001 parasuraman et al 1988 such as good communication reliability responsiveness assurance and empathy are also very important for farmers satisfaction in other words policymakers and practitioners should not only focus on money price for farmer satisfaction finally farmers satisfaction and farmers perceived image can predict farmers loyalty from a policy perspective it is suggested that first of all iranian farmers should assess the value of modern irrigation systems in terms of the quality of the components and the hard ware ضع of these systems companies supplying these appliances should take care not to sacrifice long term profit for short term profit by providing quality equipment they can increase the perceived value of these systems to farmers moreover careful monitoring by the relevant government agencies regarding the performance of the companies supplying these systems is essential in other words unless such monitoring take place the value perceived by farmers as the main predictor of farmers satisfaction will decrease and that will subsequently severely undermine the sustainability of iranian water conservation project see also kulecho and weatherhead 2005 moreover the rapid expansion of modern irrigation systems without attention to the quality of the staff supporting them can be a major threat to the value perceived by farmers their satisfaction and their loyalty and thus to the sustainable adoption of new irrigation system by farmers as end users increasing the farmers perceived value by providing quality equipment is the most important determinant of farmers satisfaction however providing good quality support staff can directly increase farmers satisfaction furthermore as well as the equipment being of good quality it is important for companies supplying installing and servicing the equipment to have a good relationship with their client note that farmers have argued that support agents could not help with repairs or did not know how to deal with blockages and other common problems considering the needs and demands of farmers a great impact on increasing the quality received from the human aspect can be achieved through speed and accuracy of implementation availability of professionals and experts quick solutions to the problems of farmers has kulecho and weatherhead 2005 that will ultimately increase farmers satisfaction in other words well managed irrigation systems have the potential to improve the resilience of farmers to water shortage this will thus ultimately lead to the satisfaction of the farmers and presumably to system longevity lopus et al 2017 the present study demonstrates the need for continuous modification of a new technology based on the requirements of the farmers percieved image by farmers is other important factor that influences both thier satisfaction and loyalty it is recommended that agriculture organizations as well as government organizations involved in expanding new irrigation systems try to provide a positive frame of mind on the part of the farmers in other words farmers will have more confidence in the organization and consequently innovations will be adopted by farmers at less cost and effort if a positive mindset is maintained at the end some limitations of the current study should also be acknowledged this study is a correlation study rather than causal inferences therefore it is important to note that no causal inferences are drawn furthermore current study carries out in a county with small sample farmers in southwest iran that may not be representative of the whole of the iranian farmers finally the dependence on self reported responses of satisfaction and loyalty were also other constraint of the current study 6 conclusion there is recognition that success of an innovation may basically depend on farmers satisfaction in fact farmers satisfaction can be crucial in exploratory assessments of the real effects of new irrigation systems the aim of the current study was to evaluate the performance of new irrigation systems from the perspectives of farmers through european customer satisfaction index results of study revealed that only farmers percieved hard ware quality can predict farmers perceived value and that farmers expectation and farmers percieved human ware quality have no any effect on farmers perceived value this demonstrates that for iranian farmers value is seen only in the quality of their systems assessments of the achievements of new irrigation systems should give more careful consideration to the value of perceived performance rather than simply to operational performance on the ground concerns about farmers satisfaction with new irrigation systems need to be explored further to correct any shortcomings in the product that may cause

not the only factor determining the success or failure of a new irrigation system project the findings confirmed that value together with the quality of the services that farmers receive both components and the percieved image of the agricultural office as the provider of irrigation systems have an effect on improving farmers satisfaction with new irrigation systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10217,it is generally recognized that the success of agricultural innovations depends to a large extent on farmers satisfaction with them while the acceptance of drip irrigation among iranian farmers is low this study aims to investigate farmers satisfaction with drip irrigation technology and related factors the european satisfaction model esm was used to achieve this aim a cross sectional paper based survey was conducted among farmers n 174 in the behbahan county of southwest iran the esm analysis results showed that perceived hard quality was positive in predicting perceived value results also indicated that perceived value perceived image and both hard and human quality directly affected farmers satisfaction these four variables were able to predict 68 variance in farmers satisfaction moreover loyalty was firmly positively affected by satisfaction and perceived image based on these results policies were suggested to increase farmers satisfaction and consequently to extend drip irrigation among iranian farmers keywords water scarcity drip irrigation performance evaluation agriculture extension iran 1 introduction iran is currently experiencing a serious water crisis yazdanpanah et al 2013 madani 2014 tatar et al 2019 delfiyan et al 2020 with water resources in most parts of iran having been significantly reduced due to increased demand and frequent and prolonged periods of drought ashraf vaghefi et al 2013 boazar et al 2020 mohammadinezhad and ahmadvand 2020 neisi et al 2020 for example the amount of water in 16 of iran s 30 river basins has been heavily depleted ashraf et al 2019 according to the world resources institute wri iran ranks fourth in severe water stress in the middle east and north africa wri 2019 according to research climate change is the cause of the water crisis and is expected to reduce water supply and availability by about 50 by 2050 yazdanpanah et al 2013 boazar et al 2019 the country s total per capita renewable water is also predicted to decrease to about 800 m3 by 2021 less than the global threshold of 1000 m3 gorjian and ghobadian 2015 a report by the iran plan and budget organization report 2018 also states that unless this improves there will be a domino effect causing for example evacuation of villages widespread migration intensification of urbanization social crises unemployment and poverty threats to national food security desertification the development of wastelands destruction of natural ecosystems and ultimately threats to national security in this regard michailidis et al 2011 argue that

take account of farmers post adoption experience of it and thus the system s potential for adoption in the future in other words these studies have not considered the impact of farmers disconfirmed beliefs perceptions on their satisfaction and whether they have enough loyalty to the technology to continue using it in the future longevity thus given that the contribution of new irrigation systems to water security globally has been emphasized but adoption of them has been low it is well worth asking what the factors are that contribute to user satisfaction dissatisfaction the adoption of innovation in the agriculture sector is rarely fast and this includes new irrigation systems van rijn et al 2012 innovation is often seen as threatening involving uncertainty about what the appropriate applications are scale suitability and whether it will work in the predominant environment significantly technological innovations also affect users opinions expectations and outlooks mottaleb 2018 investigating farmers expectations and outlooks about such innovations is thus important for guaranteeing acceptance and scaling up of the innovation and thus for the progress development and sustainability of agriculture as a whole mottaleb 2018 xiao et al 2019 evaluating farmers satisfaction regarding new agriculture technology is an important indicator of their perceptions and expectations this kind of evaluation can minimize the gap between the actual and the expected performance of a new agricultural technology which in turn can critically influence its adoption and diffusion mottaleb 2018 in this regard gomo et al 2014 have argued that such an evaluation can have various advantages for example it can be used as a performance criterion for a modern irrigation plan furthermore lopus et al 2017 believe that sustainable management of common resources in irrigation systems is dependent on farmers being satisfied with the performance of those systems in the water crisis of today it is reasonable to investigate farmers satisfaction with new and innovative irrigation systems agricultural innovation always has a problem with acceptability because many stakeholders do not believe that an innovation is applicable to them and resist it indeed stakeholders assert that some agricultural innovations stop them making their own judgment as to whether the technology involved is applicable or suitable according to some policy evaluations micro irrigation systems have not operated successfully and have not generally been useful for irrigating cropland huang et al 2010 wang et al 2017 this perspective has been borne out through participatory development technology in this regard many studies lopus et al 2017 have highlighted the significance of farmers involvement in designing technology and have acknowledged that experts and designers must consider the farmers needs and expectations based on their socioeconomic and ecological setting they point out that technology driven research must be participatory to allow farmers to be thoroughly involved in the development of the technology that affects them farmers are more likely to accept new technology if they recognize that their wishes and expectations have been taken into consideration when it was being designed yazdanpanah et al 2013 not unpredictably farmers will adopt innovations if the innovations meet their preferences needs and expectations in other words the adoption and continued use by farmers of a new irrigation system is probably equivalent to expressing satisfaction with it thus the evaluation of farmers satisfaction with the performance of new irrigation systems has been strongly recommended as a tool to improve those systems see yazdanpanah and feyzabad 2017 new irrigation systems are expensive alcon et al 2014 for farmers to be able to use new technology proficiently policymakers and the designers of new technologies need decision making tools that can help them address the wishes and needs of farmers such tools can also help achieve farmers satisfaction if policymakers and designers evaluate how satisfied farmers are with a new irrigation system they can use this information along with user suggestions to come up with innovations that meet farmers needs so that products are designed to be more compatible with farmers expectations and demands yazdanpanah et al 2013 tebebal and mathewos 2016 furthermore from the perspective of public performance evaluation theories it is very important for the products and services to be evaluated through public consent and to be identified as high performance products and services elias et al 2015 farmer satisfaction acts as an internal impact assessment that can provide policymakers with a starting point for understanding why adoption may be low the sustainability of these innovation programs depends on the willingness of farmers to continue to participate in them which itself ultimately depends on their satisfaction with the product elias et al 2015 if the rural community is satisfied sustainable development which has become the principal objective of scientific investigation and policy outlines ridaura et al 2002 then becomes a more achievable proposition luo and timothy 2017 flores and sarandón 2004 have argued that farmer satisfaction reflects a significant display of sustainability in conclusion evaluation of the performance of new irrigation systems through measuring farmers satisfaction is crucial for both internal and external reasons anderson 1994 internally client satisfaction will help monitor performance allocate resources and compensate employees externally it will provide information to farmers investors policymakers and even taxpayers yazdanpanah and feyzabad 2017 finally loyalty that results naturally from individual satisfaction has positive marketing benefits such as decreasing prices the winning of new clients and greater trade leverage aaker 1991 in other words modern irrigation systems will spread among farmers more quickly and will cost less the concept of farmer satisfaction should thus be translated into a number of measurable parameters and water managers should undertake surveys to ascertain farmers specific needs and expectations about new water systems this will draw farmers into the problem identification process and help create better understanding and evaluation of these targets see yazdanpanah et al 2013 however there has been little study of farmers satisfaction and to the authors knowledge no research of this type undertaken in iran the performance of these systems and user satisfaction must be evaluated so that the positives and negatives of any plan can be identified in advance and the results used to improve irrigation efficiency systems evaluating the performance of new installed irrigation systems comes into the same category identifying the how satisfied farmers are with their new irrigation system is crucial not only in terms of the design and implementation of such systems but also to adjusting government policies regarding irrigation maskey and weber 1996 furthermore from the management view it is imperative for those who make and sell such systems as well as those who provide the services associated with them to understand who their customers are and what their situations are only then can they build an ongoing relationship with them and ensure strong client loyalty askariazad and babakhani 2015 however to the best of the authors knowledge few studies have evaluated farmers satisfaction with regard to their new irrigation system thus the goal of this study was to quantity the satisfaction of farmers in iran with their new irrigation system and to improve our understanding as to why farmers adopt or do not adopt such technology or alternatively why they acquire it and stop using it this research should fill information gaps on both the theoretical and practical side of new irrigation systems in developing countries on the theoretical side we propose and empirically test a customer satisfaction index the european customer satisfaction index ecsi on the practical side the model can serve as a diagnostic tool to determine why farmers are satisfied or dissatisfied whether the complaints handling procedure is effective how to improve farmers satisfaction and how effective the efforts at improving farmers satisfaction are the paper is structured as follows section 2 described the european customer satisfaction index as research theoretical framework section 3 present research methods which include study design research population and sampling and questionnaire section 4 presents the results and section 5 discusses the results and implication policies 2 european customer satisfaction index ecsi the european customer satisfaction index ecsi builds upon previous customer satisfaction indexes in particular the swedish customer satisfaction barometer scsb and the american customer satisfaction index acsi eklof 2000 the origins of customer satisfaction models date back in fact to the establishment of the scsb by fornell 1992 ecsi is a new version of acsi eklof 2000 however there are three main differences among the indexes first the ecsi no longer includes complaints when measuring satisfaction and second in association with original norwegian customer satisfaction barometer ecsi includes a new latent construct called corporate image johnson et al 2001 finally in ecsi perceived quality is separated into two different subcomponents hard ware and human ware this terminology is explained in detail below kristensen et al 2001 the ecsi model thus contains seven latent variables of which four are determinants of satisfaction including expectations perceived quality hardware and human ware perceived value and perceived image while loyalty is a result of satisfaction see figure1 the ecsi satisfaction index is calculated using an econometric model that in terms of a causal relationship links a set of latent constructs to a customer satisfaction index the model then links satisfaction to customer loyalty josé vilares and simões coelho 2003 briefly satisfaction has been defined as an overall positive evaluation of a product s post purchase performance or service utilization fornell 1992 or a customer s positive overall experience to date of a product or service provider johnson and fornell 1991 the first determinant of satisfaction is customer expectations about the performance of a product or service however rather than being a normative standard that the customer should expect it represents what a customer assesses that he she should expect this variable acts as a cognitive anchor in the evaluation process and also has a direct and positive relation with satisfaction johnson et al 2001 therefore based on the publications cited we hypothesized h1 relationship between farmers expectation and farmers perceived value and h2 relationship between farmers expectation and farmers satisfaction the second determinant of satisfaction is perceived value this can either relate to customer attitudes to performance or be a comparison between the degree of quality perceived by the customer and the price paid for the product service as well as the money and time spent on it by the consumer regarding the relation between this construct and satisfaction the main estimate is a direct and positive one namely the difference between perceived value and customer expectations throughout the length of the consumption experience while the former value emphasizes individual recent consumption experience the latter focuses on individual experience prior to consumption regarding a product or services or through another type of information gathering such as advertising and personal recommendation johnson et al 2001 consequently the following hypothesis has been derived h3 relationship between farmers perceived value and farmers satisfaction the third determinants of satisfaction are perceived quality perceived quality is the customer s evaluation of recent consumption experience two primary components of perceived quality are the degree to which a product or service provides key customer requirements customization and the degree to which a firm s offering is reliable standardized and free from defects reliability fornell et al 1996 as mentioned earlier in the ecsi perceived quality is separated into two different subcomponents hard ware and human ware hard ware is the quality of the product service features and human ware embodies the associated customer communications linked to the service that is the way personnel treat the customer and how good the service environment is kristensen et al 2001 hence based on this framework we hypothesized h4 the relationship between farmers perceived quality hard ware and farmers perceived value h5 the relationship between farmers perceived quality hard ware and farmers satisfaction h6 the relationship between farmers perceived quality soft ware and farmers perceived value and h7 the relationship between farmers perceived quality soft ware and farmers satisfaction the last determinant of satisfaction is corporate image which refers to the overall impression that has formed in the consumer s mind about a firm askariazad and babakhani 2015 based on this index we thus hypothesized that h8 relationship between farmers perceived image and farmers satisfaction and h9 relationship between farmers perceived image and farmers loyalty satisfaction results in loyalty and based on the model assumptions the direct result of client satisfaction will be increased loyalty toward organization or products loyalty due to its impacts on actual client maintenance with organization product or services and ensuing profitability is the ultimate outcome of this model johnson et al 2001 therefore we assumed h10 relationship between farmers satisfaction and farmers loyalty 3 research methods this study was designed to determine farmers satisfaction regarding modern irrigation systems and factors determining this satisfaction in behbahan district behbahan county is located in southeast of khuzestan province in southwest iran see map in fig 1 behbahan is 313 m above sea level at latitude 30 35 45 24 n and longitude 50 14 30 12 e this county is one of the most important agricultural areas of khuzestan province and of iran as a whole due to the maroon zohreh and kheirabad rivers and fertile soil its most important agricultural products are wheat maize barley rice alfalfa sesame safflower and dates a cross sectional paper based survey was undertaken in this county the statistical population of this study includes farmers using drip irrigation systems on their farm n n 174 the average age of respondents was 53 years sd 9 40 the average length of farmers experience was 28 years sd 11 37 the average size of farm was 19 ha the minimum farm size was 2 ha and the maximum was 160 ha the majority of the farmers surveyed 98 3 99 4 in the study are male and married nearly one third 28 7 of the respondents have an off farm income regarding educational levels most of the farmers had primary and high school education 27 43 only 16 had secondary and 14 university education the research data was gathered based on a paper questionnaire based on past related literature focused mostly on individual satisfaction farmers answered several items using a likert type 5 point scale table 1 the use of multiple items as variables increased the accuracy of the estimate rather than just one item being applied fornell 1994 ryane et al 1995 fornell et al 1996 to develop the questionnaire and guarantee the validity of the measures we acquired most items through a comprehensive review of past related literature focused mostly on customer satisfaction these items were modified to be appropriate to the current study before the final stage of data gathering to ensure that questions were worded clearly that potential responses covered common themes and that topics were relevant to our sample we asked a panel of experts in disciplines such as agricultural education and extension economics water science and environmental psychology to examine the validity of the questionnaire we also tested reliability of the questionnaire via a pilot study with 30 farmers this revealed the reliability of the questionnaire variables 0 63 0 90 as good to excellent 4 results 4 1 descriptive statistics of variables in order to determine the descriptive analysis of expectation perceived quality of human ware perceived quality of hard ware perceived image perceived value satisfaction and loyalty of farmers the standard deviation distance index of interval of standard deviation from the mean isdm gangadharappa et al 2007 was used according to the isdm individuals responses were categorized into three levels low medium and high as follows low a mean 1 2 sd medium mean 1 2 sd b mean 1 2 sd high c mean 1 2 sd the descriptive statistics the mean and standard deviation of dependent variable satisfaction and loyalty and independent variables image expectation perceived quality hard ware perceived quality human ware and perceived value are presented in tables 1 and 2 and fig 1 the mean score for expectation variable was 3 96 the descriptive finding showed that mean score for the perceived quality hard ware and human ware were 3 74 and 2 85 respectevely the descriptive results also show that the mean score for expectation perceived image perceived value satisfaction and loyalty were 3 96 3 96 3 98 4 26 and 4 07 respectively in evaluating the status of research variables based on the isdm index the results showed that only the perceived quality hard ware is in good condition because more than 50 of respondents were at a high level however other variables such as expectations perceived quality human ware image perceived value and loyalty were moderate furthermore the satisfaction construct is not in a good situation because most of the respondents are at a low level table 2 4 2 correlation the result of correlation among all constructs of the ecsi model are shown in table 3 statistically significant correlations were noted between farmers satisfaction and other constructs of this model except farmers expectation interestingly farmers expectation is not correlated with the other constructs of this model except farmers perceived image 4 3 data analysis 4 3 1 measurement model structural equation modeling sem methodology is a sophisticated method that includes a whole series of multivariate analyses comprising factor analysis multiple regression analysis of variance anova and many others sem with confirmatory factor analysis cfa and path analysis is a versatile multivariate approach for measuring latent variables and structural relationships between the variables under study for determining causal relationships between independent and dependent variables pawaskar et al 2017 structural equation modeling involves two separate stages of confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the fit of the measurement model and then to perform structural equation modeling to estimate the relationships between latent variables the measurement model postulates how latent variables should be evaluated in terms of the observed variables and it represents the validity and reliability of the responses of observed variables to latent variables bagozzi and yi 1988 hair et al 2006 confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the χ2 of the measurement model is 523 393 with 380 degrees of freedom df p 0 05 implying that the measurement model was not a good fit with the data however a large sample size can hinder this test s ability to assess model fitness because sample size can affect the χ2 value mcdonald and ho 2002 the present study used various indices to determine the adequacy of the model such as root mean square error of approximation rmsea adjusted good ness of fit index agfi goodness of fit index gfi tucker lewis index tli comparative fit index cfi incremental fit index ifi normed fit index nfi and standardized root mean square residual srmr for rmsea less than 0 06 is generally considered a very good fit 0 08 or higher is considered a reasonable fit and greater than 0 10 is considered a poor fit hu and bentler 1999 for tli values around 0 90 or higher indicate a good fit for agfi values must be greater than 0 8 nfi ifi gfi tli and cfi must be greater than 0 9 henry and stone 1994 scott 1994 srmr values less than 0 80 are usually considered to represent an acceptable model hair et al 2010 based on a summary of their results the measurement model satisfies the criteria of the gfi of 0 830 agfi of 0 792 tli of 0 942 ifi of 0 950 nfi of 0 821 cfi of 0 939 rmsea of 0 049 and srmr of 0 0627 therefore the research measurement model has an acceptable fit however gfi has a marginal value and therefore the model should be interpreted with caution table 1 lists factor loadings cronbach s alpha average variance extracted ave and composite reliability cr for the latent variables the reliability of the variables is frequently verified by means of cronbach s alpha and composite reliability value the suggested situation value of these is 0 70 which recommends that when the value of both the cronbach s alpha and composite reliability are more than 0 70 the variable has good reliability fornell and larcker 1981 results show that all cr values and cronbach s alpha exceeded 0 70 indicating that the latent variables had internal consistency jöreskog and sörbom 1996 and thus supported the reliability of this research fornell and larcker 1981 construct validity can be tested using convergent validity and discriminant validity convergent validity was also evaluated by using average variance extracted ave for this assessment the criterion was that average variance should exceed 0 5 bagozzi and yi 1988 in this study the ave for all variables exceeded the threshold of 0 5 indicating that this study had adequate convergent validity 4 3 2 structural equation modeling the structural equation model sem analysis was conducted to assess the proposed research hypotheses see table 4 the results uncovered the acceptable fit of the model to the dataset χ2 df 1 396 gfi 0 830 agfi 0 795 cfi 0 941 ifi 0 942 nfi 0 821 rmsea 0 048 rmr 0 040 and srmr 0 0730 the sem analysis results were shown in fig 2 and the hypothesis testing results were summarized in table 4 it is known that farmers perceived quality of hard was positive in predicting farmers perceived value with a path coefficient of 0 56 t 4 314 p 0 001 this variable predicted 37 of the variance of farmers perceived value in addition the analytical results indicated that the farmers perceived value β 0 61 farmers perceived image β 0 17 and farmers perceived hard ware quality β 0 35 and farmers perceived human ware quality β 0 29 affected farmers satisfaction directly these four variables could predict 68 variance in farmers satisfaction furthermore farmers loyalty was firmly positively affected by farmers satisfaction with a path coefficient of 0 32 and farmers perceived image with a path coefficient of 0 56 additionally the squared multiple correlation equivalent to r2 was 0 53 for farmers loyalty indicating that 53 of the variance in farmers loyalty was predicted by the model 5 discussion the application of innovation such as the implementation of a new irrigation system in rural and farming areas has various benefits including climate adaptation where there is water scarcity protection of water resources improvement of agriculture production and poverty reduction such innovations are promoted by and invested in by policymakers in many developing countries evaluating the success of these policies is essential for continued investment and future sustainability there is mounting recognition that successful innovation may basically depend on farmers satisfaction in fact farmers satisfaction can be crucial in exploratory assessments of the real effects of new irrigation systems luo and timothy 2017 the aim of the current study was to evaluate the performance of new irrigation systems from the perspectives of farmers to the best of the authors knowledge the current study is the first in the middle east if not in the world to apply a satisfaction scale to evaluate farmers satisfaction regarding their new irrigation system adoption decisions are fairly complex to evaluate yazdanpanah et al 2013 however the evaluation of social projects like this that are invested in by governments using public money is highly recommended see yazdanpanah and feyzabad 2017 we believe that evaluating the performance of irrigation systems can have a significant impact on reducing farmers rejection of these innovations if the results of this evaluation are considered by policymakers such evaluations can also be an effective tool in ensuring that farmers actually accept an innovation in other words the results of our study allow government irrigation system producers and retailers to understand what factors significantly encouragement overall farmer satisfaction these factors can be seen in the causal relationship in the ecsi model and the strategic management map see elias et al 2015 our results revealed that only hard ware quality can predict farmers perceived value and that farmers expectation and farmers percieved human ware quality have no any effect on farmers perceived value this demonstrates that for iranian farmers value is seen only in the quality of their systems in other words if policymakers wish to increase farmers perceived value as a main predictor of farmers satisfaction special emphasis should be placed on producing quality components and tools for irrigation systems see yazdanpanah et al 2013 assessments of the achievements of new irrigation systems should give more careful consideration to the value of perceived performance rather than simply to operational performance on the ground concerns about farmers satisfaction with new irrigation systems need to be explored further to correct any shortcomings in the product that may cause disappointment this will help achieve the goal of improving the performance of public investment in new irrigation systems furthermore sem results revealed that jointly the farmers percieved quality aspects farmers perceived value and farmers perceived image can determine farmers satisfaction our results revealed that the price value of irrigation system and the hard quality of systems are not the only factor determining the success or failure of a new irrigation system project see yazdanpanah et al 2013 in other words concentrating only on a single aspect may decrease farmers satisfaction the findings confirmed that value together with the quality of the services that farmers receive both components and the image of the agricultural office as the provider of irrigation systems have an effect on improving farmers satisfaction with new irrigation systems see yazdanpanah and feyzabad 2017 this means that although the value of the irrigation system is very important to farmers and will help them to adapt to water scarcity other aspects of quality johnson et al 2001 parasuraman et al 1988 such as good communication reliability responsiveness assurance and empathy are also very important for farmers satisfaction in other words policymakers and practitioners should not only focus on money price for farmer satisfaction finally farmers satisfaction and farmers perceived image can predict farmers loyalty from a policy perspective it is suggested that first of all iranian farmers should assess the value of modern irrigation systems in terms of the quality of the components and the hard ware ضع of these systems companies supplying these appliances should take care not to sacrifice long term profit for short term profit by providing quality equipment they can increase the perceived value of these systems to farmers moreover careful monitoring by the relevant government agencies regarding the performance of the companies supplying these systems is essential in other words unless such monitoring take place the value perceived by farmers as the main predictor of farmers satisfaction will decrease and that will subsequently severely undermine the sustainability of iranian water conservation project see also kulecho and weatherhead 2005 moreover the rapid expansion of modern irrigation systems without attention to the quality of the staff supporting them can be a major threat to the value perceived by farmers their satisfaction and their loyalty and thus to the sustainable adoption of new irrigation system by farmers as end users increasing the farmers perceived value by providing quality equipment is the most important determinant of farmers satisfaction however providing good quality support staff can directly increase farmers satisfaction furthermore as well as the equipment being of good quality it is important for companies supplying installing and servicing the equipment to have a good relationship with their client note that farmers have argued that support agents could not help with repairs or did not know how to deal with blockages and other common problems considering the needs and demands of farmers a great impact on increasing the quality received from the human aspect can be achieved through speed and accuracy of implementation availability of professionals and experts quick solutions to the problems of farmers has kulecho and weatherhead 2005 that will ultimately increase farmers satisfaction in other words well managed irrigation systems have the potential to improve the resilience of farmers to water shortage this will thus ultimately lead to the satisfaction of the farmers and presumably to system longevity lopus et al 2017 the present study demonstrates the need for continuous modification of a new technology based on the requirements of the farmers percieved image by farmers is other important factor that influences both thier satisfaction and loyalty it is recommended that agriculture organizations as well as government organizations involved in expanding new irrigation systems try to provide a positive frame of mind on the part of the farmers in other words farmers will have more confidence in the organization and consequently innovations will be adopted by farmers at less cost and effort if a positive mindset is maintained at the end some limitations of the current study should also be acknowledged this study is a correlation study rather than causal inferences therefore it is important to note that no causal inferences are drawn furthermore current study carries out in a county with small sample farmers in southwest iran that may not be representative of the whole of the iranian farmers finally the dependence on self reported responses of satisfaction and loyalty were also other constraint of the current study 6 conclusion there is recognition that success of an innovation may basically depend on farmers satisfaction in fact farmers satisfaction can be crucial in exploratory assessments of the real effects of new irrigation systems the aim of the current study was to evaluate the performance of new irrigation systems from the perspectives of farmers through european customer satisfaction index results of study revealed that only farmers percieved hard ware quality can predict farmers perceived value and that farmers expectation and farmers percieved human ware quality have no any effect on farmers perceived value this demonstrates that for iranian farmers value is seen only in the quality of their systems assessments of the achievements of new irrigation systems should give more careful consideration to the value of perceived performance rather than simply to operational performance on the ground concerns about farmers satisfaction with new irrigation systems need to be explored further to correct any shortcomings in the product that may cause

not the only factor determining the success or failure of a new irrigation system project the findings confirmed that value together with the quality of the services that farmers receive both components and the percieved image of the agricultural office as the provider of irrigation systems have an effect on improving farmers satisfaction with new irrigation systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
10218,comparisons of variable rate irrigation vri and variable rate fertigation vrf with fixed rate irrigation fri no irrigation ni and conventional fertilizer management for maize zea mays l under three soil types s1 s2 and s3 were made for three years 2015 2016 and 2017 the research quantified and compared maize growth and development leaf area index lai and plant height grain yield crop evapotranspiration etc irrigation yield production functions iypf evapotranspiration yield production functions etypf and crop water productivity cwp under vri fri and ni at fixed rate fertigation frf vrf and pre plant nitrogen pp management in the same environment and under the same agroomic management practices the vrf treatment used 20 less fertilizer as compred with pp and frf treatment without significantly p 0 05 reducing the grain yield in the higher elevation soil s1 the grain yield was not significantly different p 0 05 between fri and vri treatments however in s2 and s3 which have lower elevation yield in fri was 43 and 55 greater than the yield in vri respectively on average under vri management total irrigation amount 24 lower than fri in s1 with only 4 reduction in yield as compared with fri soil type impacted the response of maize grain yield to etc and the responses also varied between fri and vri for all soil types and years higher etc was observed in fri treatment except in 2015 for s1 and s2 where highest etc was observed in vri fri had greater productivity per unit of etc than vri observing the linear relationship of the pooled data for each soil type a 25 4 mm of etc beyond the intercept resulted in 0 48 and 0 35 ton ha 1 maize yield for fri and vri treatment respectively in s1 0 75 and 0 45 ton ha 1 for fri and vri respectively in s2 and 0 71 and 0 43 ton ha 1 for fri and vri respectively in s3 vri strategy increased the variability in grain yield etc and cwp as compared with fri management s1 had the lowest grain yield variability as compared with s2 and s3 the coefficient of variation cv of grain yield ranged from 8 in s1 fri to as high as 35 3 in s3 vri fri treatment in all soil types and years had less variation in yield as compared with vri soil type had impact on cwp on a three year average basis cwp was 2 higher in vri in s1 whereas 11 lower in s2 and s3 than fri cwp stronger grain yield response to irrigation and etc iypf and etypf were observed for fri than vri and ni at all nitrogen levels the results of this research indicated that in most cases fri had superior performance in terms of maintaining optimum crop yield and reducing yield variations than vri vri management based on soil water status has potential of maintaining maize grain yield and improving cwp as compared with fri in certain conditions or soil types such as in s1 however further research is needed to validate justify its adoption for the fields with significant spatial soil heterogeneity both in horizontal and vertical domains and to understand the economics of vri vrf systems these results would be beneficial for maize growers and their advisors in terms of understanding the productivity responses to water under vri and fri management strategies with vrf frf and pp nitrogen application keywords irrigation management maize nitrogen soil type variable rate management 1 introduction irrigation is one of the major users of the world s freshwater and accounts for about four fifth of world s freshwater pumped from surface and groundwater resources postel 1999 however with declining availability of freshwater resources competition by different water users has been increasing further stress on freshwater resources is expected throughout the world due to increasing population and urban and industrial development especially with expected population increase to about 9 5 billion people by year 2050 especially with increasing air temperature and uncertainty in climatic conditions in such scenarios significant changes and novel approaches in agricultural water management to meet the food and fiber demands of increasing population are needed effective irrigation management strategies that increases crop water productivity cwp aka crop water use efficiency and reduce consumptive water use especially non beneficial use of water resources should be developed or current practices should be improved evaluated and implemented in production fields irmak 2015a 2015b in irrigated agriculture maximum cwp can be achieved by applying the right amount of water at the right time using appropriate methods single mean value of crop response to water and evapotranspiration et for deciding water application depth and timing has been used for irrigation traditionally resulting in excessive or deficit water applications at certain locations in the field king et al 2006 in addition to the water application in some cases uniform application of fertilizers might lead to excessive application of fertilizers at some points in the field which can have negative environmental consequences such as pollution of ground and surface water resources with the advent of precision agricultural technology and knowledge and understanding about soil variability within a field the interest in the concept of variable rate irrigation vri and variable rate fertigation vrf sharma and irmak 2020 to manage spatial and temporal variabilities within an agricultural field has increased evans et al 2013 variable rate technologies have the capability to deliver the desired amount of water and fertilizer to specific locations in the field which makes it possible for addressing the temporal and spatial variability of the soil and plants within a field limited studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential benefits of vri regarding water conservation and impact of vri on plant growth and development grain yield evapotranspiration and cwp through detailed and carefully conducted field research the lack of scientific and research based data and information could influence the adoption of vri technology in production fields out of approximately 230 000 center pivot and linear move sprinkler irrigation systems existed in the usa in 2013 usda nass 2014 only about 200 of them have the capability of zone control variable rate management and only less than 50 are being used as variable rate strategies for crop water management evans et al 2013 some of the major reasons for scant adoption are the costs associated with vri technology inadequate technical assistance lack of consistent economic and agronomic advantages and most importantly the lack of supporting research lamb et al 2008 among aforementioned reasons perhaps the lack of conclusive research that demonstrates the economic advantage of vri method enhancing yield reducing consumptive water use reducing energy use for irrigation and increasing in cwp are some of the primary reasons for limited adoption of this technology by producers in production fields among limited studies to evaluate the profitability of vri and variable nitrogen management al kufaishi et al 2006 investigated the feasibility of using vri rather than uniform irrigation for a 7 ha field with sugar beat in germany using a daily soil water balance simulation model irrigation application of 20 30 and 40 mm were simulated and management zones were decided based on available soil water holding capacity they observed that at 20 mm water application vri management used 13 less water than uniform application however in their study whether the uniform water application strategy was a proper and effective irrigation management or it was an over irrigated strategy is not clear hedley and yule 2009 compared vri and uniform irrigation scenarios for three years of climate data on a 156 ha pasture and a 53 ha maize field in new zealand the management zones for vri were delineated by relating apparent electrical conductivity with available soil water holding capacity a soil water balance prediction model on daily basis was used for simulations of irrigation strategies the result showed that vri scenarios saved 23 26 of irrigation water as compared with uniform irrigation same model was used by hedley et al 2009 on a 40 ha pasture a 24 ha potato and a 22 ha maize sites to evaluate differences in irrigation water use drainage water use and nitrogen leaching between vri and uniform irrigation scenarios they reported an annual water use reduction of 9 19 under vri as compared with uniform irrigation however all these studies utilized computer simulations to compare conventional and vri technology by over simplifying various processes and procedures some of the real world challenges difficulties when managing vri and uniform rate irrigation in the field conditions have been ignored in these simulation studies which could have resulted in incomplete conclusions while computer simulations can provide important understanding of different processes their ability to account for factors that play important role in comparing vri to fixed rate water and fertilizer management in real world conditions can be significantly lacking a field study conducted by sui and yan 2017 in stoneville mississippi usa compared the crop yield and water productivity of vri and uniform rate irrigation uri they reported 25 reduction in irrigation water application in vri treatment as compared with uri with no significant difference in maize yields they also reported higher water productivity in vri than in uri koch et al 2004 assessed the economics of uniform vs variable rate n fertilizer application through a field study and found that less total n fertilizer 6 46 was used with the variable rate n management with net returns of 18 21 to 29 57 ha 1 more than uniform n management khosla et al 2002 found that n management using site specific management zones that account for soil variability and productivity improved n use efficiency of the applied n to increase yields and reduce n losses to the environment while benefits of vri have been reported in some cases studies also suggested that vri or vrf technologies management strategies did not improve or impact crop productivity e g yield or cwp or water conservation feinerman and voet 2000 suggested that while studies conducted stochastic optimization of agricultural inputs e g water in a spatially variable field using vri the real world challenges and issues in large scale production fields are usually ignored they conducted site specific management analyses via subdivision of the spatially variable field area into a controlled number of individually irrigated management units mus and observed that utilization of site specific irrigation and or cultivation technologies do not guarantee water saving périard et al 2012 studied irrigation management performances water and energy consumption nitrogen leaching and yield for lettuce in two scales site specific i e local and large field scale i e global they observed that local irrigation management resulted in marketable yield increase of 16 5 18 2 depending on the year but required 21 2 23 6 more water and consequently more energy they also observed that higher frequency and amount of water in site specific irrigation resulted in higher tracer nitrogen leaching king et al 2006 used a center pivot equipped with vri to compare vri and conventional fixed rate irrigation management cuim on an 11 5 ha potatoes field in idaho for two years and found no significant difference in yield or water use between vri and cuim nijbroek et al 2003 used a process oriented crop model for soybean to compare water use drainage and gross margin of vri versus cuim for a 10 ha field in georgia coupled with using long term 25 years simulations of yield irrigation water use and water drainage and 10 year market price they observed that yield water use and leaching were not significantly different between vri and cuim marek et al 2001 conducted an economic analysis of vri using site specific yield data from 15 000 ha irrigated land area in the northern texas high plains they concluded that considerable increase in grain yield using vri would be required to justify adoption of this technology stone et al 2015 evaluated the peanut water use and yield under vri and fri method using a decision support system irrigator pro and found that the peanut yield and water use were not significantly different between vri and uniform rate irrigation treatments most of the studies reported in the literature used non dynamic management zones for vri they did not use real time or near real time measured soil water and soil variability information data to manage irrigations which can result in unfair or incomplete performance assessments when comparing vri and fri also many vri related studies carried out in non spatially variable fields which can further introduce biases errors into the results and conclusions and non realistic or non representative assessments furthermore to the best of our knowledge field research that couples the impacts of vri and fri as well as no irrigation and no fertilizer nitrogen management on performance indicators in crop production e g crop growth and development grain yield evapotranspiration crop production functions crop water productivity under the same climate and crop management conditions in different soil types does not exist the specific objective of this research was to quantify and evaluate the impact of different irrigation management practices vri fri and ni under different nitrogen management practices frf vrf and pp nitrogen on maize growth and development yield evapotranspiration irrigation yield production functions iypf evapotranspiration yield production functions etypf and cwp under the same conditions but in three different soil types to infer if the performance variables when comparing vri to fri are impacted by variable and fixed rate irrigation and nitrogen management and soil types 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design as part of a long term vri and vrf fundamentals research program in the irmak research laboratory irl at the university of nebraska lincoln field experiments were conducted at the south central agricultural laboratory scal near clay center nebraska usa in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons an advanced hydraulic and variable rate lateral move sprinkler irrigation system in the irl scal was installed in a field that has spatial variability attributes and also has three different soil types making this site uniquely suited for investigating fundamentals of site specific production functions and to research the aforementioned objectives scal is located at latitude 40 34 n and longitude 98 8 w with an elevation of 552 m above mean sea level the long term average annual precipitation at the research site is 680 mm the long term maximum and minimum temperatures at the research site are 25 c and 5 c respectively irmak and mutiibwa 2009 the research was conducted on a 2 3 ha field with a considerable spatial variability in soil properties with a west to east elevation gradient in the field ranging from 550 8 m to 552 1 m above mean sea level fig 1 the research site is in the transition zone between sub humid and semiarid zones there were three soil types in the research field i crete silt loam 0 1 slope soil 1 s1 ii hastings silty clay loam 3 7 slope soil 2 s2 and iii hastings silt loam 1 3 slope soil 3 s3 table 1 and fig 1 the primary production systems in the research area are continuous maize and maize soybean rotation primarily under center pivot about 80 85 of the total 3 6 ha irrigated land and about 15 under surface gravity irrigation primarily furrow irrigation a two span 75 m long 7000sl variable rate linear move sprinkler irrigation system t l irrigation co hastings ne was operated throughout three growing seasons to achieve fixed and variable rate water and nitrogen applications fig 1 the linear move system has a variable rate irrigation controller that manages the watering regime of the system using up to 48 watering channels 12 zones 4 sprinklers in each zone the controllers manage the watering rates by solenoid actuated sprinklers to deliver the desired water rates sprinkler spacing on the lateral was 1 2 m and sprinklers were mounted on drop tubes at approximately 2 2 m above the ground level in the initial stages of the experiment extensive soil sampling was done to determine the existing conditions of the soil in terms of soil physical hydraulic and chemical properties to determine soil fertilizer recommendations as well as for determining irrigation management variables soil samples were collected from 42 locations within the field in march or april before planting of each growing season multiple soil samples were collected from each location at a depth of 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 0 90 1 20 and 1 20 1 50 m with a giddings soil sampling machine giddings machine co fort collins colorado usa multiple cores from each location were mixed per soil depth and all soil analyses were done by a local soil and plant analysis laboratory ward laboratory kearney ne usa soils from all depths were analyzed for nitrate n for all three years to determine the nitrogen requirements for each treatment separately at the beginning of the experiment i e for the first soil sampling in april 2015 soil samples were also analyzed for bulk density bd electrical conductivity ec organic matter content omc field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp and soil particle size distribution sand silt and clay these soil properties were used in estimating site specific nitrogen and irrigation requirements for all three years for each experimental plot individually an inverse distance weighted interpolation method was used in arcgis software ver 10 1 esri redlands california usa for mapping spatial distribution of some of the soil physical properties the extract by mask tool was used in arcgis to determine the value of all soil properties for each plot by this method fc pwp omc particle size distribution and soil nitrate n for each plot was determined using these spatial soil properties data all irrigation and nitrogen amounts were quantified for each plot before each irrigation detailed description of soil properties is presented in a companion paper sharma and irmak 2020 three irrigation levels fixed uniform rate irrigation fri variable rate irrigation vri and no irrigation ni and three nitrogen n fertilizer levels fixed uniform rate fertilizer frf variable rate fertilizer vrf and pre plant n pp fertilizer management in each soil type were imposed fig 1 in each growing season the treatment combination of ni and pp was not studied in this research due to ability to fit additional treatments in the research field but ni and no nitrogen combination treatment was evaluated treatments were randomly assigned to the experimental plots in each growing season each plot was 6 m x 6 m in size with a 6 m x 6 m buffer plot on all four sides of each plot the buffer plots were established to prevent eliminate sprinkler overlap between the plots as the sprinkler maximum wetting diameter is about 4 5 m in 2015 maize hybrid p1151amx was planted on may 27 with population density of 84 500 plants ha 1 the growing season in 2015 was 146 days long and harvest was done on october 19 in 2016 and 2017 earlier planting occurred due to warmer temperature in these years as compared with 2015 a maize hybrid g07f23 3111 and channel 209 53stxrib were planted on may 6 and may 5 in 2016 and 2017 respectively with population density of 84 500 plants ha 1 in both seasons maize was harvested on october 13 161 days after planting and october 25 174 days after planting in 2016 and 2017 respectively pesticides were applied uniformly to all plots as required sharma and irmak 2020 2 2 soil moisture measurements and irrigation management the volumetric soil water content vswc for all irrigation treatments was determined through measuring soil matric potential smp the smp was measured using watermark granular matrix wgm irrometer co riverside ca sensors installed at four depths 0 30 0 60 0 90 and 1 20 m from the soil surface in the middle of each plot two replications of each treatment in a representative location the instrumentation was installed following the crop emergence each year and were removed from the field at the end of each growing season prior to harvest wgm sensors were used to monitor smp kpa on an hourly basis which was then converted to vswc using pre determined soil water retention curves for each soil type for the research site developed by irmak 2019 since there were differences in the soil textural properties in vertical direction in addition to horizontal domain different soil water retention curves were used for each depth at the same location irmak 2019 in total there were six types of soils that existed in the research field these soil types were silt loam silty clay loam clay loam loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam these soil types were determined from the extensive soil sampling results presented in the companion paper of this research sharma and irmak 2020 the vswc was multiplied by the representative soil depth intervals 0 30 0 60 0 90 and 1 20 m to determine the total soil water stored in each depth and then summed up to obtain total soil water for the 0 1 20 m soil profile for each plot irrigation timing for both vri and fri treatments was managed by keeping total soil water depletion lower than 40 of swhc in the root depth for fri plots the amount of each irrigation was at 25 4 mm which is a typical practice that most of the irrigators follow in nebraska and other midwestern states on average a total of 1 7 5 irrigations of 25 4 mm each and 2 irrigations of 31 7 mm each and 10 irrigations were applied to fri plots in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively for vri plots irrigation amounts were applied to bring the soil water to approximately 90 of swhc to be able to store at least a portion of any potential precipitation event in each irrigation only those plots which needed irrigation calculated according to the measured soil moisture readings were irrigated for vri plots thus the number and amount of irrigation events for each vri plot varied in each season and between the vri treatments plots within a growing season the irrigation timing and amount and soil water dynamics information under each treatment and year is presented in detail in the companion paper of this research sharma and irmak 2020 to accomplish vri and fri the wmgm sensors data were downloaded from each plot datalogger every other day and processed using an irrigation management worksheet developed in the irmak research laboratory for each plot based on the plot specific soil properties computed irrigation values were then used to develop a water control maps for irrigation of each experimental unit plot the final irrigation application map prescription was then uploaded to the linear move system s control panel and irrigation was completed for different plots on the same day 2 3 crop evapotranspiration calculations seasonal maize evapotranspiration etc from emergence until harvest was calculated using a soil water balance equation 1 et c p i u runoff δ sws dp where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm u is upward water flux mm runoff is surface runoff from individual treatments mm δsws is change in soil water storage mm in the soil profile between the beginning and end of the growing season and dp is the deep percolation from the crop root zone mm since the water table is approximately 30 m below the surface upward water flux was assumed to be negligible irmak 2015a the surface runoff was estimated using the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs formerly called as the soil conservation service scs curve number procedure usda nrcs 1985 the runoff was determined for each day over the growing seasons and then summed up for individual treatment for the growing season the scs curve number method relates runoff curve number cn to runoff accounting for initial abstraction losses and the soil infiltration rate the following equation was used to estimate runoff from each treatment 2 ro p i a 2 p i a s for p 0 2 s where ia is initial abstraction mm and s is the maximum retention after runoff begins mm given by 3 s 25400 cn 254 initial abstraction ia represents the water loss before runoff begins and includes water retained in surface depressions water intercepted by vegetation evaporation and infiltration the ia value is usually well correlated with soil and surface residue cover from many small agricultural watershed studies usda nrcs 1985 ia is approximated by the following empirical equation 4 i a 0 2 s the cn is dependent on surface cover type hydrological soil group treatment and hydrologic condition according to the silt loam s1 and s3 and silty clay loam s2 soil at the research site and known row cropping in all soil types curve numbers were determined as 78 89 and 78 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively for average antecedent runoff condition from the usda nrcs 1985 tables runoff is affected by soil water content before a precipitation event which is also known as the antecedent moisture condition amc prior to estimating precipitation excess infiltration the curve number was adjusted based on the five day antecedent precipitation the curve number as mentioned above may also be termed as amc ii or average soil moisture the other moisture conditions are dry amc i and moist amc iii the curve number can be adjusted by amc ii factors where amc i factors are less than 1 reducing cn and potential runoff and amc iii factors are greater than 1 increasing cn and potential runoff deep percolation was estimated using the daily soil water balance computer program payero et al 2009a 2009b bryant et al 1992 djaman and irmak 2012 irmak 2015a 2015b 2 4 nitrogen management there were three n fertilizer treatments fixed rate frf variable rate vrf and pre plant n pp for the pp treatment 246 kg ha 1 of urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 was applied in 2015 2016 and 2017 on may 27 april 13 and april 19 respectively before planting in season fertilizer was applied in vrf and frf treatments using the linear move sprinkler irrigation system the n fertilizer rate for vrf plots was calculated using n recommendation algorithms by the university of nebraska lincoln fertilizer guidelines shapiro et al 2008 these fertilizer requirements for maize were based on the expected yield and current soil nutrient levels the equation that was used for determining n requirements is 5 n need lb ac 35 1 2 ey 8 no 3 nppm 0 14 ey omc other n credits price adj timing adj where ey is expected yield bu ac 1 no3 n ppm is average nitrate n concentration in the root zone 0 60 1 2 m depth ppm omc is organic matter content other credits were assumed to be negligible priceadj is the adjustment for prices of maize and n and timingadj was the adjustment factor for fall spring and split n applications the expected yield was 105 of the five year average yield of the field five year yield data for the research field were available in the irmak research laboratory database nitrate n and omc for each plot was obtained from soil sampling data in this manner the current n requirement for a given growing season for each vrf plot was determined price and timing adjustments were calculated using the equation from shapiro et al 2008 based on the current maize market price for vrf treatment on average 217 234 and 221 kg ha 1 n fertilizer was applied in fri vri and ni irrigation treatments respectively in the 2015 growing season in the 2016 growing season these values were 205 206 and 202 kg ha 1 respectively and in 2017 they were 172 161 and 168 kg ha 1 respectively since it is assumed that multiple applications of n is generally more efficient than single large doses due to n loss potential the n fertilizer application was divided in two applications half of the required n was applied at v2 stage of maize plant growth and other at v8 stage shapiro et al 2008 for both vrf and frf plots 2 5 plant height and leaf area index measurements and calculation of crop water productivity plant height and leaf area index lai were measured on a weekly basis from each plot in each growing season the lai was measured using a model lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor biosciences lincoln ne u s a plant height was measured from the ground surface to the tip of the tallest leaf three plants from each plot i e 9 readings per treatment were measured in each measurement day in addition maize phenological development information was visually observed and recorded cwp was calculated to evaluate the response of maize yield under various irrigation and nitrogen application treatments in different soil types cwp was calculated as the ratio of grain yield y to seasonal crop evapotranspiration etc 6 cwp y etc where cwp is expressed in kg m 3 y is grain yield kg m 2 adjusted to 15 5 grain moisture content 2 6 grain yield and statistical analysis each year each plot was harvested using a two row plot combine equipped with grain yield monitor to record yield data the harvested grain was adjusted to 15 5 moisture content and expressed as per unit ground area yield and etc data were statistically analyzed using proc glimmix procedure in sas sas institute inc cary nc usa to compare the effects of irrigation treatment nitrogen n treatment and soil type on maize grain yield and etc the means were separated using least significant difference lsd test at the 95 level of significance to identify any potential significant differences in grain yield and etc between treatments when no significant interactions occurred between the treatments main effects were evaluated data were analyzed in two ways with a full factorial design in the first approach the ni level was excluded from the model and any differences caused by nitrogen treatments at vri and fri irrigation levels were determined in the second statistical approach the pp nitrogen level was excluded to analyze the difference in irrigation under vrf and frf treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions during 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the growing season precipitation in 2015 2016 and 2017 was 353 375 and 467 mm respectively even though total growing season precipitation in 2015 was lower than in 2016 and 2017 2015 experienced very heavy rainfall events in june 226 mm which was 131 mm higher than long term average table 2 and fig 2 on average 2015 growing season was warmer than 2016 and 2017 the highest monthly average temperature in all years occurred in july warmer temperatures in 2015 accelerated the crop development hence physiological maturity was 15 days and 28 days earlier than 2016 and 2017 respectively maize was harvested 145 days after planting dap with a cumulative growing degree days cgdd of 1640 c in 2015 whereas in 2016 and 2017 it was harvested at 160 dap cgdd of 1781 c and 173 dap cgdd of 1783 c respectively evaporation losses from the surface and water used by plant transpiration are heavily influenced by numerous climatic variables including wind speed relative humidity solar radiation air temperature vapor pressure deficit etc on average greater wind speed was observed in 2016 as compared with 2015 and 2017 also greater wind speeds were observed in the early growing season in all three years may to june which is common for the area the 2017 growing season experienced below normal wind speed toward late growing season august and september because of minimal precipitation amounts in june in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons as compared with 2015 large differences in relative humidity rh were observed the monthly average rh in june was 75 60 and 61 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively as compared with the long term average of 68 5 the incoming solar radiation was on average greater in 2017 than in 2015 and 2016 in general vpd in the 2017 growing season was greater than in 2015 and 2016 temporal variations in weather variables are presented in the companion paper sharma and irmak 2020 3 2 effect of fixed uniform and variable rate irrigation and nitrogen treatments on plant growth in different soil types the seasonal trends of lai and plant height as a function of dap and calendar date for fri vri and ni at all n levels for three soil types in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are presented in figs 3 and 4 the lai and plant height exhibited variation between the treatments in the same soil and for the same treatments between the soils overall in 2015 there was a significant interaction between soil type and irrigation and nitrogen combination treatments as well as soil type and date for lai p 0 05 the maximum lai in 2015 in s1 was 6 3 and was observed in fri pp treatment since irrigation applications were less in 2015 than in other years and since other environmental conditions were the same it was assumed that the differences in lai between the treatments were primarily due to the difference in nitrogen amount averaged over the irrigation levels from the beginning of the growing season until dap 65 july 31 2015 pp treatments had the highest lai this can be attributed to the 246 kg ha 1 of application of pre plant nitrogen in the pp treatments due to which they had higher foliage density and plant size thus higher lai after the nitrogen application in vrf and frf plots on july 16 2015 dap 50 the lai in these treatments started to increase no significant differences p 0 05 between pp vrf or frf treatments were observed after dap 65 lai in fri was significantly p 0 05 higher than vri and ni from dap 78 to dap 85 maximum plant height varied from 2 5 m in fri vrf treatment to 2 8 m in fri pp treatment similar results were obtained in s2 however in this soil after dap 65 lai in frf treatment was still significantly lower p 0 05 than those in pp and vrf treatments the maximum lai in s2 was 6 8 and was observed in fri pp treatment at dap 78 however for the rest of the growing season maximum lai was observed in vri pp treatment and the same results were observed for the plant height as well the maximum plant height varied from 2 5 m in vri frf treatment to 3 m in vri pp treatment no significant differences p 0 05 were observed in lai in 2015 season due to irrigation treatments similar to s1 and s2 lai was highest in pp treatment in s3 the pp treatment showed a maximum difference from vrf and frf before dap 65 in s3 comparing irrigation treatments averaged across the nitrogen treatments unlike s1 and s2 the maximum lai in s3 was observed in ni treatment at dap 78 which was 5 3 also maximum plant height of 2 7 m was observed in ni vrf and fri pp treatments at dap 78 in 2015 growing season in all soil types and treatments maximum lai and plant height was obtained between dap 78 and dap 85 which corresponded to r2 r3 maize growth stage in 2016 growing season the maximum lai in s1 s2 and s3 was 5 8 in fri frf treatment 6 2 in fri pp treatment and 5 1 in fri pp treatment respectively this trend was similar to 2015 growing season where s2 had the highest lai followed by s1 and s3 throughout the growing season lai in pp treatment was greater than vrf and frf treatments in all three soil types the progression of lai was similar for all irrigation treatments from the planting date to dap 77 in s1 dap 69 in s2 and s3 which corresponded to the irrigation applications after this period lai showed some differences between the treatments as a function of irrigation and soil water status after irrigations begun the first irrigation in 2016 growing season was applied on dap 66 the fri treatment had the greatest lai followed by vri and ni the maximum plant height in s1 s2 and s3 was the same 2 5 2 5 and 2 4 m respectively in fri vrf treatment from dap 88 to dap 98 in 2017 growing season larger differences in lai and plant height between the irrigation treatments were observed averaged over the irrigation levels lai was similar between n treatments in all soil types averaged over the n treatments fri treatment had higher lai and plant height than vri and ni treatments for dap 51 which corresponds to the first irrigation application in vri and fri comparing vri treatment with ni larger difference was observed in lai in s1 whereas lai in vri and ni was essentially the same throughout the growing season in s2 and s3 due to similar amount of irrigation the maximum lai in s1 s2 and s3 was 5 8 in fri vrf treatment 5 8 in fri pp treatment and 5 9 in fri frf treatment respectively the maximum plant height in s1 s2 and s3 was 2 7 m in fri vrf treatment 2 6 m in fri frf and 2 5 m in fri frf respectively in general for all growing seasons lai is directly related to the amount of nitrogen and water applied since the amount of nitrogen in frf and pp treatment was the same the highest lai was observed in either of these treatments the minimum lai of 4 2 and 3 7 was observed for ni nn treatment in 2016 and 2017 respectively in all seasons highest water was applied in fri treatments and these treatments also had the highest lai both fri and vri are full irrigation treatments with only difference in the amount and timing of irrigation the higher lai and plant height in fri likely suggest that more water uptake in fri treatment was used for transpiration which increased the plant growth and development 3 3 effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on crop evapotranspiration with respect to soil types the seasonal etc at each irrigation and nitrogen level for three soil types in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are summarized in table 4 the results of statistical analyses for etc are shown in table 3 in 2015 no significant differences p 0 05 in etc were observed between soil types irrigation treatments or nitrogen treatments due to lower irrigation amounts in this season than an average year in all treatments and the differences in irrigation amounts between the treatments was also low generally etc values were higher for both fri and vri treatments in s1 than other soils in 2016 no interaction between soil type irrigation or nitrogen treatment was observed however irrigation had a significant effect p 0 05 on etc in 2017 growing season soil and nitrogen interaction were significant p 0 05 and irrigation level had a significant effect on etc in 2015 growing season etc ranged from 300 mm in ni treatment in s1 to 389 mm in fri in s1 etc values for all soil types and treatments were higher in 2016 and 2017 than in 2015 due to higher seasonal rainfall and higher vpd also due to very heavy rainfall in the beginning of growing season and more uniform temporal distribution of rainfall until about dap 100 in 2015 there were fewer irrigation events in 2015 than in 2016 and 2017 the etc ranged from 336 mm in s2 in ni and no nitrogen fertilizer treatment to 649 mm in s1 fri pp treatment in 2016 in 2017 it ranged from 362 mm in s2 vri and vrf treatment to 634 mm in s3 fri vrf treatment on average maximum etc was observed in fri treatment in all years and soil types except in 2015 where maximum etc was either in fri or vri treatments on average the minimum etc was observed in ni treatment in all years and soil types djaman et al 2013 and irmak 2015a 2015b reported similar seasonal etc at the same research site with a range of 480 mm rainfed to 634 mm full irrigation and 387 mm rainfed to 690 mm full irrigation respectively etc values also varied between the years for the same treatments and between the soil types in 2016 significant impact of irrigation treatments on etc was observed averaged over the nitrogen treatments and soil types etc under fri 561 mm was significantly p 0 05 higher than vri treatment 481 mm and ni treatment 395 mm similar results were obtained in 2017 growing season where etc in fri treatment 577 mm was significantly p 0 05 higher than vri treatment 560 mm significant p 0 05 interactions between soil type and nitrogen treatments were also observed in 2017 growing season table 3 etc in vrf treatment was significantly lower p 0 05 than frf and pp treatment in s1 and s2 this means that applying in season nitrogen variably and uniformly might have different impacts on crop growth in different soil types etc increased with increase in irrigation and nitrogen amounts frf and pp treatments no difference in etc between frf and pp indicates that in season fertilizer application using irrigation system could be a beneficial option for farmers for maize production in this region since in the vri treatments the total amount of water and nitrogen applied was less than uniform application treatments of irrigation and nitrogen the etc in vri plots was also less as compared with uniform treatments to understand potential benefits of vri the impact of this reduction in etc in vri treatment on crop yield needs to be determined which is presented in the next section 3 4 effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on maize grain yield and yield variability grain yield summary for each treatment and year is presented in table 4 and a summary of statistical analysis is presented in table 3 maize yield ranged from 5 8 ton ha 1 to 11 6 ton ha 1 in 2015 5 6 ton ha 1 to 14 8 ton ha 1 in 2016 and from 7 1 ton ha 1 to 15 4 ton ha 1 in 2017 higher grain yields in irrigated treatments in 2017 than in 2016 and 2015 were due to more irrigation amounts in 2017 because of higher temperature and higher vpd especially during the first three months of the growing season higher temperatures more evaporative demand and sufficient water in the profile allowed near potential transpiration rates which increased grain yield howell et al 1995 reported a difference of 365 mm of irrigation water for full irrigation treatment between 1992 and 1993 growing seasons at bushland texas this study reported that a large gap in irrigation amounts between two consecutive years was due to higher evaporative demand conditions in one of the years in which plants developed higher leaf area which resulted in higher grain yield in the present research no significant impact p 0 05 of nitrogen application method on grain yield was observed in any of the years which indicates a potential advantage of in season fertilizer application both vrf and frf over pre plant nitrogen application for achieving optimum crop yield in season fertigation has several benefits over pre plant nitrogen application including spreading the work away from the busy planting season avoiding the frequent wet field conditions in spring and reducing in season n loss potential in wet years scharf et al 2002 the benefits of vrf has been reported by several other studies where it was shown no increase or decrease in grain yield by variable rate nitrogen application kitchen et al 1995 koch et al 2004 khosla et al 2002 these studies indicated economic and environmental benefits of utilizing site specific management zones for vrf application over conventional uniform application optimum n rates as required by the crop in vrf application helped in reducing the total nitrogen applied economic benefit and nitrate n leaching environmental benefit in this current research on average vrf used 20 less nitrogen fertilizer as compared with frf and pp indicating potential economic benefit of vrf grain yield was significantly different p 0 05 between the soil types in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons s1 had highest grain yield followed by s2 and s3 this illustrated that s1 had high yield potential and grain yield could be increased if adequate growth conditions such as soil water is maintained similar results were reported by sui and yan 2017 who found higher yields in management zones with low electrical conductivity ec similar to their study in our research s1 had the lower ec as compared with s2 and s3 sharma and irmak 2020 although interaction of soil with irrigation was not significant in any season the yield differences between the irrigation treatments in each soil type were evaluated to infer additional information about irrigation s impact on grain yield fig 5 shows the grain yield for three irrigation treatments averaged over nitrogen treatments in 2015 2016 2017 and average of three years under three soil types there was no significant yield difference p 0 05 among irrigation treatments in 2015 in any soil type due to large amount of rainfall in the early growing season and relatively uniform temporal distribution of rainfall until 100 dap only about 25 mm of water was applied to fri and vri the first irrigation application in 2015 was around 100 dap when crop was close to r4 growth stage since application of water at this growth stage did not have substantial influence on grain yield production it was not sufficient to cause significant differences in yields between the treatments therefore the impact of irrigation on maize yield was more pronounced in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in 2016 fri in s1 had the highest yield 14 1 ton ha 1 and the lowest yield was obtained in s2 in ni treatment 6 2 ton ha 1 yield in s1 was significantly higher p 0 05 than yield in s2 and s3 in 2016 comparing irrigation levels in each soil type yield in fri was not significantly different p 0 05 from vri in s1 however it was significantly higher than vri and ni in s2 and s3 fig 5 the irrigation amount applied to fri in all three soil types in 2016 was 191 mm whereas in vri it was 141 159 and 108 mm in s1 s2 and s3 respectively although irrigation amount gap in vri and fri was minimum in s2 as compared with other soil types yield was significantly lower p 0 05 in vri treatment in s1 irrigation amount in vri treatment was 50 mm lower than fri but the grain yield was not significantly impacted these results indicated that yield response to type of irrigation is soil type dependent as was also suggested by sadler et al 2002 similar results were obtained in 2017 where fri treatment had the highest grain yield 14 3 ton ha 1 followed by vri 10 6 ton ha 1 and ni 9 4 ton ha 1 averaged over three soil types grain yield was not significantly different between fri and vri treatment in s1 however in s2 and s3 yield in fri was 43 and 55 higher than vri p 0 05 respectively the irrigation water applied in s1 in fri and vri plots on average was 254 and 161 mm respectively fri being 93 mm higher than vri overall combining all years while there was no impact of nitrogen treatment on grain yield significant soil and irrigation effects were observed in s1 grain yield was not significantly different between fri and vri and both treatments had significantly higher p 0 05 yield than ni in s2 grain yield in fri was significantly higher than vri and ni and yield in vri was significantly higher than ni in s3 yield in fri was significantly higher than vri and ni and no difference was observed between vri and ni treatments the results of this research suggested that soil properties and field topography especially elevation and slope played a role in yield response to irrigation by redirecting and altering soil water dynamics and availability through the influence of some of the soil properties organic matter content soil temperature water holding capacity particle size distribution etc jiang and thelen 2004 on soil water and crop growth and yield relationships kravchenko and bullock 2000 found that elevation was the most important contributing topographic factor which had negative correlation with maize yield jiang and thelen 2004 found a significant negative correlation between field slope and maize yield higher maize yield in s1 in this research can be related to higher elevation and lower slope in that soil type within the field this can also be attributed to higher soil water holding capacity swhc in s1 than in s2 and s3 due to higher swhc frequent irrigations as in fri were not required and plant growth was sustained with less frequent irrigations as in vri lower grain yields in s2 and s3 might be related to low lying areas fig 1 where extreme precipitation caused temporary flooding water ponding resulting in poor aeration and significant problems with crop development sharma and irmak 2020 which were also observed by sudduth et al 1996 and benedetto et al 2017 because of suboptimal crop development in s2 and s3 evident from plant height lai and visual observations figs 3 and 4 plant roots could be shallow which were not able to effectively use available water from the deeper soils sadler et al 2005 the potential impact of fri and vri strategies on grain variability within each soil type was also determined via coefficient of variation cv table 5 the grain yield cv values ranged from 8 in s1 fri treatment to as high as 35 3 in s3 vri treatment fri treatment in all soil types had less variation in crop yield as compared with vri comparing the variability between soil types s1 had the lowest maize grain yield variability as compared with s2 and s3 these results indicate that both within soil variability and variability among soil types in term of topography elevation and slope and swhc should be considered to understand if vri could be a beneficial strategy in specific soil and management conditions 3 5 relationship between irrigation and grain yield irrigation yield production functions iypf maize yields had strong correlation with seasonal irrigation amounts in vri and fri treatments at all nitrogen levels figs 6 and 7 and the relationships were explained by quadratic functions higher r2 values for iypfs were observed for fri treatment at all levels of nitrogen when compared with vri treatment at corresponding nitrogen levels soil type did not have significant impact on the iypfs in fri treatment comparing fig 6m n and o whereas due to higher variability in grain yield among the soil types under vri treatment the r2 values decreased from s1 0 59 to s2 0 53 to s3 0 28 comparing fig 7m n and o comparing the nitrogen treatments pp nitrogen treatment showed the strongest relationship r2 with yield with seasonal irrigation in both fri and vri treatments similar results were reported by sadler et al 2002 for usa southeastern coastal plains region where they observed significant variation in yield response to irrigation among and within soil map units with vri the iypfs developed in this research for different irrigation management strategies fri and vri are some of the first iypfs developed for different soil types in the same environment managed under fri and vri under different nitrogen management and are important to growers irrigators water regulatory and management agencies and other irrigation professionals for understanding the optimum values of irrigation for maximum yield under different management practices irmak 2015b stated that while iypfs can provide invaluable data and information about crop yield response to water instead of irrigation water applied etc is a stronger and perhaps more relevant indicator of crop water productivity because not all water applied to a given field is used by plants for productivity thus direct response of grain yield to water losses from the field as a function of climatic conditions soil water and crop management is better represented by etc irmak 2015b therefore et yield production functions for each treatment in this research were also developed to quantify crop productivity based on amount of water used etc rather than applied irrigation 3 6 relationship between maize evapotranspiration and grain yield evapotranspiration yield production functions etypf the etypfs were developed for fri vri and ni treatments at all levels of nitrogen treatments and pooled data to assess the impact of various irrigation and nitrogen management strategies on yield productivity per unit of etc etypfs exhibited considerable variation between irrigation and nitrogen treatments as well as soil types maize grain yield had a linear relationship with seasonal etc for all treatments with r2 ranging from 0 69 to 0 95 in fri treatment fig 8 and from 0 02 to 0 85 in vri treatment fig 9 ni treatments in all soil types and all nitrogen treatments had weaker relationship than irrigated treatments fig 10 higher r2 values were observed in fri treatments at all nitrogen levels than in vri averaged over all soil types and nitrogen treatments grain yield in fri treatment had the strongest correlation to etc r2 0 70 followed by vri r2 0 40 and ni r2 0 05 fig 8p p and p pooled soil types data at each nitrogen treatment showed that r2 values had a decreasing trend from fri to vri comparing figs 8d h and l with 9d h and l respectively the decrease in correlation can be attributed to more variability and inconsistency in the grain yield trends in vri treatments as compared with fri comparing the nitrogen treatments in fri the highest correlation was observed in pp r2 0 76 fig 8d however in vri the highest correlation was observed in frf nitrogen treatment r2 0 58 fig 9h the slopes of etypfs for fri ranged from 0 0191 ton ha 1 in s1 pp nitrogen treatment fig 8a to 0 039 ton ha 1 in s2 vrf treatment fig 8j comparing soil types for fri treatments s1 had a positive slope of 0 02 ton ha 1 with an intercept of 3 37 ton ha 1 fig 8m whereas s2 and s3 had a negative slope of 0 03 ton ha 1 fig 8n and o in s1 etypf at all levels of nitrogen treatments under fri management showed a positive intercept which can be attributed to higher grain yields even at lower irrigation levels in s1 which also indicates that s1 had a higher yield potential as compared with s2 and s3 it is important to note that similar to increased variation in grain yield under vri the variation in etc for the same treatments in different soil types with vri also increased as compared with fri the standard deviation sd values of etc were 4 4 30 2 and 22 5 mm in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively for fri whereas they were much higher as 7 22 1 and 69 4 mm in vri for the same years respectively the slopes of etypfs for vri treatment ranged from 0 006 ton ha 1 in s2 pp treatment fig 9b to 0 03 ton ha 1 in s3 vrf treatment fig 9g for all treatments slopes were less steep in vri as compared with fri positive intercepts of etypf were obtained in s1 at all nitrogen levels whereas the trend was inconsistent for s2 and s3 the overall pooled response i e nitrogen levels of grain yield to etc at each soil type fig 9m n and o showed positive etypf intercepts since the basic idea of vri management was to apply the right amount of water at the right location and at the right time by considering field s spatially variable attributes higher yields under low irrigations were expected at the places where soil has enough water that it did not require supplemental irrigation since irrigation has a linear relationship with etc irmak 2015a 2015b lower irrigations resulted in lower etc however yield was not impacted less steep slope of etypf in vri as compred to fri figs 8 and 9 the aforementioned analyses presented the etypfs and iypfs based on pooled etc data irrigation and grain yield for three years 2015 2016 and 2017 individual etypfs of individual treatments were also quantified figs 8 9 and 10 and a unit increase in maize grain yield in response to a unit 25 4 mm of etc are presented in table 6 this was done to infer more detailed information about maize productivity response to individual treatments the lowest yield of 0 16 ton ha 1 per unit of etc 25 4 mm was observed in s2 vri pp treatment while the highest 0 99 ton ha 1 was observed in s2 s2 fri vrf this showed that soil type had an impact on the response of maize grain yield to etc and that this response also varied between fri and vri observing the linear relationship of the pooled data for each soil type a 25 4 mm of etc beyond the intercept resulted in 0 48 and 0 35 ton ha 1 maize yield for fri and vri treatment respectively in s1 0 75 and 0 45 ton ha 1 for fri and vri respectively in s2 and 0 71 and 0 43 ton ha 1 for fri and vri respectively in s3 figs 8m 9m 8n 9n 8o and 9o respectively for the same location djaman et al 2013 reported the values of 1 2 and 1 7 ton ha 1 per 25 4 mm of etc in 2009 and 2010 respectively beyond 280 mm in 2009 and 403 mm in 2010 of etc that was used by maize to start producing grain yield basal et at clay center ne for the same location from a long term research irmak 2015a 2015b reported a long term average grain production of 0 48 ton ha 1 for fit full irrigation treatment for a 25 4 mm of etc from 2005 to 2010 and this value had considerable interannual variation payero et al 2006 reported a value of 0 71 ton ha 1 per 25 4 mm of etc in west central nebraska payero et al 2006 collected and reported nine linear relationships of etc with grain yield and concluded that maize response to water can changes with environments and time as new hybrids are developed and management practices improve in addition the variability in reported slopes of the linear functions in this research can be due to the differences in seasonal precipitation distribution among different plots soil and crop characteristics and other climatic and management conditions irmak 2015a 2015b moreover the results of the present research showed that changing only the soil characteristics while considering all other variables to be similar or the same can create substantial differences in the slopes and intercepts of the etypf which agrees with the results obtained by sadler et al 2002 in practical applications and modeling efforts these etypfs can be very useful and informative for evaluating optimum management scenarios by understanding the grain yield responses to water under vri and fri management strategies with vrf frf and pp nitrogen application 3 7 treatment effects on crop water productivity cwp aka crop water use efficiency cwue the cwp values for irrigation treatments and soil types for 2015 2016 and 2017 growing season are presented in table 7 the cwp ranged from 1 92 kg m 3 s2 ni to 2 77 kg m 3 s1 vri with an average of 2 21 kg m 3 in 2015 from 1 77 kg m 3 s2 ni to 2 70 kg m 3 s1 vri with an average of 2 23 kg m 3 in 2016 and from 1 85 kg m 3 s3 ni to 2 56 kg m 3 s2 fri with an average of 2 29 kg m 3 in 2017 as no significant impact p 0 05 of nitrogen treatments was observed on grain yield cwp of fri vri and ni averaged over the nitrogen treatments was presented the cwp in vri treatment was 13 12 and 2 3 greater than fri in s1 s2 and s3 respectively in 2015 this can be attributed to slightly higher grain yield in vri as compared with fri with similar etc similarly in 2016 cwp was 7 higher in vri treatment than in fri in s1 due to larger magnitude of change in etc between fri and vri however in s2 and s3 fri cwp was 3 and 17 higher than vri respectively higher cwp in s1 vri can also be attributed to slightly lower but not significantly different p 0 05 yield and etc in vri than in fri due to which the ratio of yield and etc in vri was greater than fri the lowest cwp in this season was obtained in ni due to lower grain yields in 2017 cwp in fri was higher than vri and ni in all soil types the lower cwp in vri as compared with fri in 2017 was due to substantially larger magnitude of difference in grain yield between vri and fri fri grain yield being greater than vri grain yield on a three year average basis cwp was 2 higher in vri in s1 whereas 11 lower in s2 and s3 than fri similar to grain yield and etc cwp in vri treatments had higher variation than those in fri treatments the sd values of cwp were 0 27 0 23 and 0 06 kg m 3 in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively for fri whereas they were 0 40 0 44 and 0 12 kg m 3 for vri for the same years respectively in addition to the soil water availability soil properties such as ec and swhc play an important role in deciding irrigation and consequently the grain yield sui and yan 2017 and cwp in this research soil with lower ec and higher soil water holding capacity i e s1 has higher yields and cwue as compared with other soil types the cwp values reported in this research are greater than the cwp range of 0 80 1 60 kg m 3 as reported in fao 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 however agreed with the results reported by djaman and irmak 2012 and irmak 2015a 2015b for the same location the fact that vri management using soil moisture sensors increased the variability in grain yield etc and cwp and that the performance of vri varies within a field based on soil properties shows that the point measurement of soil water content using soil moisture sensors was not sufficient to manage the vri and that other sources or factors unrelated to soil water also influence crop yield jones 1990a suggested that the actual tissue water potential of a plant does not just depend on the soil water status but also on the rate of water flow through the plant they mentioned that in soil water based irrigation scheduling many features of plant physiology plant and root tissues respond to the changes in bulk soil water content rather than changes in water status in the tissues itself therefore for efficient and precise irrigation management for vri plant sensing should be considered in addition to soil water sensing future research is required to understand how crop water status measurements and plant response differ from soil water status and how irrigation scheduling based on crop water status compares to soil water irrigation scheduling 4 summary and conclusions impacts of fri vri and ni under frf vrf and pp nitrogen management on maize lai plant height grain yield etc iypf etypf and cwp was investigated in three soil types through carefully conducted extensive field research campaigns in 2015 2016 and 2017 the findings and conclusions of the research are summarized as for all growing seasons lai is directly related to the amount of nitrogen and water since the amount of nitrogen in frf and pp treatment was similar and was greater than vrf the highest lai was observed in frf and pp treatments among the irrigation levels the highest lai was observed in fri for all seasons plant height did not vary notably between the treatments as plants usually attained their maximum height before the irrigations started significant effect of irrigation on etc was observed in 2016 and 2017 and significant interactions between soil type and nitrogen treatments were observed in 2017 growing season for all soil types and years higher etc was observed in fri treatment except s1 and s2 in 2015 where highest etc was observed in vri the minimum etc in all soil types and years was observed in ni treatment soil type had significant impact on grain yield in 2015 and 2016 with grain yield in s1 being significantly higher than yield in s2 and s3 no significant impact of nitrogen application method on grain yield was observed in any of the seasons which indicates a potential benefit of in season fertilizer application both with vrf and frf over pre plant nitrogen application on average vrf used 20 less nitrogen fertilizer than frf and pp indicating potential economic benefit of vrf over frf and pp although reduced n use with vrf needs to be considered with grain yield obtained under vrf for detailed economic analyses higher maize yield was observed in s1 that had significantly lower ec than s2 and s3 on average amount of water used for irrigation under vri management was 24 lower than fri in s1 whereas yield was only 4 lower in vri as compared with fri the results of this research indicate that in cases where soil properties such as topography negatively impact etc and grain yield water application by any irrigation scheduling method would have negative impact on yield grain yield had a quadratic relationship with seasonal irrigation amounts in vri and fri treatments at all nitrogen levels a stronger higher r2 yield response to irrigation was observed for fri treatment at all levels of nitrogen than vri treatments at corresponding nitrogen levels maize grain yield had a linear and strong r2 relationship with seasonal etc for all the treatments with r2 ranging from 0 69 to 0 95 in fri treatment and 0 02 0 85 in vri treatment fri treatments had stronger yield response to etc than vri treatments ni treatments in all soil types and all levels of nitrogen treatment showed weaker relationship than irrigated treatments higher variability in grain yield etc and cwp was observed in vri management strategy as compared with fri management cwp was 2 higher in vri in s1 whereas 11 lower in s2 and s3 than fri cwp exhibited substantial variation between the years and the irrigation treatments our results indicated that in most cases fri had superior performance than vri the vri management using soil moisture sensors alone may have the potential of maintaining maize grain yield and improving cwp as compared with fri in certain conditions or soil types such as in s1 however future research is required to validate justify its adoption for the fields with significant spatial soil heterogeneity and to understand the economics of vri management the results of this research can be useful and informative for maize growers and their advisors state and federal water management agencies decision makers and crop modelers in the regions with similar climate and soil conditions

lower elevation yield in fri was 43 and 55 greater than the yield in vri respectively on average under vri management total irrigation amount 24 lower than fri in s1 with only 4 reduction in yield as compared with fri soil type impacted the response of maize grain yield to etc and the responses also varied between fri and vri for all soil types and years higher etc was observed in fri treatment except in 2015 for s1 and s2 where highest etc was observed in vri fri had greater productivity per unit of etc than vri observing the linear relationship of the pooled data for each soil type a 25 4 mm of etc beyond the intercept resulted in 0 48 and 0 35 ton ha 1 maize yield for fri and vri treatment respectively in s1 0 75 and 0 45 ton ha 1 for fri and vri respectively in s2 and 0 71 and 0 43 ton ha 1 for fri and vri respectively in s3 vri strategy increased the variability in grain yield etc and cwp as compared with fri management s1 had the lowest grain yield variability as compared with s2 and s3 the coefficient of variation cv of grain yield ranged from 8 in s1 fri to as high as 35 3 in s3 vri fri treatment in all soil types and years had less variation in yield as compared with vri

were observed for fri than vri and ni at all nitrogen levels the results of this research indicated that in most cases fri had superior performance in terms of maintaining optimum crop yield and reducing yield variations than vri vri management based on soil water status has potential of maintaining maize grain yield and improving cwp as compared with fri in certain conditions or soil types such as in s1 however further research is needed to validate justify its adoption for the fields with significant spatial soil heterogeneity both in horizontal and vertical domains and to understand the economics of vri vrf systems these results would be beneficial for maize growers and their advisors in terms of understanding the productivity responses to water under vri and fri management strategies with vrf frf and pp nitrogen application keywords irrigation management maize nitrogen soil type variable rate management 1 introduction irrigation is one of the major users of the world s freshwater and accounts for about four fifth of world s freshwater pumped from surface and groundwater resources postel 1999 however with declining availability of freshwater resources competition by different water users has been increasing further stress on freshwater resources is expected throughout the world due to increasing population and urban and industrial development especially with expected population increase to about 9 5 billion people by year 2050 especially with increasing air temperature and uncertainty in climatic conditions in such scenarios significant changes and novel approaches in agricultural water management to meet the food and fiber demands of increasing population are needed effective irrigation management strategies that increases crop water productivity cwp aka crop water use efficiency and reduce consumptive water use especially non beneficial use of water resources should be developed or current practices should be improved evaluated and implemented in production fields irmak 2015a 2015b in irrigated agriculture maximum cwp can be achieved by applying the right amount of water at the right time using appropriate methods single mean value of crop response to water and evapotranspiration et for deciding water application depth and timing has been used for irrigation traditionally resulting in excessive or deficit water applications at certain locations in the field king et al 2006 in addition to the water application in some cases uniform application of fertilizers might lead to excessive application of fertilizers at some points in the field which can have negative environmental consequences such as pollution of ground and surface water resources with the advent of precision agricultural technology and knowledge and understanding about soil variability within a field the interest in the concept of variable rate irrigation vri and variable rate fertigation vrf sharma and irmak 2020 to manage spatial and temporal variabilities within an agricultural field has increased evans et al 2013 variable rate technologies have the capability to deliver the desired amount of water and fertilizer to specific locations in the field which makes it possible for addressing the temporal and spatial variability of the soil and plants within a field limited studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential benefits of vri regarding water conservation and impact of vri on plant growth and development grain yield evapotranspiration and cwp through detailed and carefully conducted field research the lack of scientific and research based data and information could influence the adoption of vri technology in production fields out of approximately 230 000 center pivot and linear move sprinkler irrigation systems existed in the usa in 2013 usda nass 2014 only about 200 of them have the capability of zone control variable rate management and only less than 50 are being used as variable rate strategies for crop water management evans et al 2013 some of the major reasons for scant adoption are the costs associated with vri technology inadequate technical assistance lack of consistent economic and agronomic advantages and most importantly the lack of supporting research lamb et al 2008 among aforementioned reasons perhaps the lack of conclusive research that demonstrates the economic advantage of vri method enhancing yield reducing consumptive water use reducing energy use for irrigation and increasing in cwp are some of the primary reasons for limited adoption of this technology by producers in production fields among limited studies to evaluate the profitability of vri and variable nitrogen management al kufaishi et al 2006 investigated the feasibility of using vri rather than uniform irrigation for a 7 ha field with sugar beat in germany using a daily soil water balance simulation model irrigation application of 20 30 and 40 mm were simulated and management zones were decided based on available soil water holding capacity they observed that at 20 mm water application vri management used 13 less water than uniform application however in their study whether the uniform water application strategy was a proper and effective irrigation management or it was an over irrigated strategy is not clear hedley and yule 2009 compared vri and uniform irrigation scenarios for three years of climate data on a 156 ha pasture and a 53 ha maize field in new zealand the management zones for vri were delineated by relating apparent electrical conductivity with available soil water holding capacity a soil water balance prediction model on daily basis was used for simulations of irrigation strategies the result showed that vri scenarios saved 23 26 of irrigation water as compared with uniform irrigation same model was used by hedley et al 2009 on a 40 ha pasture a 24 ha potato and a 22 ha maize sites to evaluate differences in irrigation water use drainage water use and nitrogen leaching between vri and uniform irrigation scenarios they reported an annual water use reduction of 9 19 under vri as compared with uniform irrigation however all these studies utilized computer simulations to compare conventional and vri technology by over simplifying various processes and procedures some of the real world challenges difficulties when managing vri and uniform rate irrigation in the field conditions have been ignored in these simulation studies which could have resulted in incomplete conclusions while computer simulations can provide important understanding of different processes their ability to account for factors that play important role in comparing vri to fixed rate water and fertilizer management in real world conditions can be significantly lacking a field study conducted by sui and yan 2017 in stoneville mississippi usa compared the crop yield and water productivity of vri and uniform rate irrigation uri they reported 25 reduction in irrigation water application in vri treatment as compared with uri with no significant difference in maize yields they also reported higher water productivity in vri than in uri koch et al 2004 assessed the economics of uniform vs variable rate n fertilizer application through a field study and found that less total n fertilizer 6 46 was used with the variable rate n management with net returns of 18 21 to 29 57 ha 1 more than uniform n management khosla et al 2002 found that n management using site specific management zones that account for soil variability and productivity improved n use efficiency of the applied n to increase yields and reduce n losses to the environment while benefits of vri have been reported in some cases studies also suggested that vri or vrf technologies management strategies did not improve or impact crop productivity e g yield or cwp or water conservation feinerman and voet 2000 suggested that while studies conducted stochastic optimization of agricultural inputs e g water in a spatially variable field using vri the real world challenges and issues in large scale production fields are usually ignored they conducted site specific management analyses via subdivision of the spatially variable field area into a controlled number of individually irrigated management units mus and observed that utilization of site specific irrigation and or cultivation technologies do not guarantee water saving périard et al 2012 studied irrigation management performances water and energy consumption nitrogen leaching and yield for lettuce in two scales site specific i e local and large field scale i e global they observed that local irrigation management resulted in marketable yield increase of 16 5 18 2 depending on the year but required 21 2 23 6 more water and consequently more energy they also observed that higher frequency and amount of water in site specific irrigation resulted in higher tracer nitrogen leaching king et al 2006 used a center pivot equipped with vri to compare vri and conventional fixed rate irrigation management cuim on an 11 5 ha potatoes field in idaho for two years and found no significant difference in yield or water use between vri and cuim nijbroek et al 2003 used a process oriented crop model for soybean to compare water use drainage and gross margin of vri versus cuim for a 10 ha field in georgia coupled with using long term 25 years simulations of yield irrigation water use and water drainage and 10 year market price they observed that yield water use and leaching were not significantly different between vri and cuim marek et al 2001 conducted an economic analysis of vri using site specific yield data from 15 000 ha irrigated land area in the northern texas high plains they concluded that considerable increase in grain yield using vri would be required to justify adoption of this technology stone et al 2015 evaluated the peanut water use and yield under vri and fri method using a decision support system irrigator pro and found that the peanut yield and water use were not significantly different between vri and uniform rate irrigation treatments most of the studies reported in the literature used non dynamic management zones for vri they did not use real time or near real time measured soil water and soil variability information data to manage irrigations which can result in unfair or incomplete performance assessments when comparing vri and fri also many vri related studies carried out in non spatially variable fields which can further introduce biases errors into the results and conclusions and non realistic or non representative assessments furthermore to the best of our knowledge field research that couples the impacts of vri and fri as well as no irrigation and no fertilizer nitrogen management on performance indicators in crop production e g crop growth and development grain yield evapotranspiration crop production functions crop water productivity under the

three soil types in the research field i crete silt loam 0 1 slope soil 1 s1 ii hastings silty clay loam 3 7 slope soil 2 s2 and iii hastings silt loam 1 3 slope soil 3 s3 table 1 and fig 1 the primary production systems in the research area are continuous maize and maize soybean rotation primarily under center pivot about 80 85 of the total 3 6 ha irrigated land and about 15 under surface gravity irrigation primarily furrow irrigation a two span 75 m long 7000sl variable rate linear move sprinkler irrigation system t l irrigation co hastings ne was operated throughout three growing seasons to achieve fixed and variable rate water and nitrogen applications fig 1 the linear move system has a variable rate irrigation controller that manages the watering regime of the system using up to 48 watering channels 12 zones 4 sprinklers in each zone the controllers manage the watering rates by solenoid actuated sprinklers to deliver the desired water rates sprinkler spacing on the lateral was 1 2 m and sprinklers were mounted on drop tubes at approximately 2 2 m above the ground level in the initial stages of the experiment extensive soil sampling was done to determine the existing conditions of the soil in terms of soil physical hydraulic and chemical properties to determine soil fertilizer recommendations as well as for determining irrigation management variables soil samples were collected from 42 locations within the field in march or april before planting of each growing season multiple soil samples were collected from each location at a depth of 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 0 90 1 20 and 1 20 1 50 m with a giddings soil sampling machine giddings machine co fort collins colorado usa multiple cores from each location were mixed per soil depth and all soil analyses were done by a local soil and plant analysis laboratory ward laboratory kearney ne usa soils from all depths were analyzed for nitrate n for all three years to determine the nitrogen requirements for each treatment separately at the beginning of the experiment i e for the first soil sampling in april 2015 soil samples were also analyzed for bulk density bd electrical conductivity ec organic matter content omc field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp and soil particle size distribution sand silt and clay these soil properties were used in estimating site specific nitrogen and irrigation requirements for all three years for each experimental plot individually an inverse distance weighted interpolation method was used in arcgis software ver 10 1 esri redlands california usa for mapping spatial distribution of some of the soil physical properties the extract by mask tool was used in arcgis to determine the value of all soil properties for each plot by this method fc pwp omc particle size distribution and soil nitrate n for each plot was determined using these spatial soil properties data all irrigation and nitrogen amounts were quantified for each plot before each irrigation detailed description of soil properties is presented in a companion paper sharma and irmak 2020 three irrigation levels fixed uniform rate irrigation fri variable rate irrigation vri and no irrigation ni and three nitrogen n fertilizer levels fixed uniform rate fertilizer frf variable rate fertilizer vrf and pre plant n pp fertilizer management in each soil type were imposed fig 1 in each growing season the treatment combination of ni and pp was not studied in this research due to ability to fit additional treatments in the research field but ni and no nitrogen combination treatment was evaluated treatments were randomly assigned to the experimental plots in each growing season each plot was 6 m x 6 m in size with a 6 m x 6 m buffer plot on all four sides of each plot the buffer plots were established to prevent eliminate sprinkler overlap between the plots as the sprinkler maximum wetting diameter is about 4 5 m in 2015 maize hybrid p1151amx was planted on may 27 with population density of 84 500 plants ha 1 the growing season in 2015 was 146 days long and harvest was done on october 19 in 2016 and 2017 earlier planting occurred due to warmer temperature in these years as compared with 2015 a maize hybrid g07f23 3111 and channel 209 53stxrib were planted on may 6 and may 5 in 2016 and 2017 respectively with population density of 84 500 plants ha 1 in both seasons maize was harvested on october 13 161 days after planting and october 25 174 days after planting in 2016 and 2017 respectively pesticides were applied uniformly to all plots as required sharma and irmak 2020 2 2 soil moisture measurements and irrigation management the volumetric soil water content vswc for all irrigation treatments was determined through measuring soil matric potential smp the smp was measured using watermark granular matrix wgm irrometer co riverside ca sensors installed at four depths 0 30 0 60 0 90 and 1 20 m from the soil surface in the middle of each plot two replications of each treatment in a representative location the instrumentation was installed following the crop emergence each year and were removed from the field at the end of each growing season prior to harvest wgm sensors were used to monitor smp kpa on an hourly basis which was then converted to vswc using pre determined soil water retention curves for each soil type for the research site developed by irmak 2019 since there were differences in the soil textural properties in vertical direction in addition to horizontal domain different soil water retention curves were used for each depth at the same location irmak 2019 in total there were six types of soils that existed in the research field these soil types were silt loam silty clay loam clay loam loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam these soil types were determined from the extensive soil sampling results presented in the companion paper of this research sharma and irmak 2020 the vswc was multiplied by the representative soil depth intervals 0 30 0 60 0 90 and 1 20 m to determine the total soil water stored in each depth and then summed up to obtain total soil water for the 0 1 20 m soil profile for each plot irrigation timing for both vri and fri treatments was managed by keeping total soil water depletion lower than 40 of swhc in the root depth for fri plots the amount of each irrigation was at 25 4 mm which is a typical practice that most of the irrigators follow in nebraska and other midwestern states on average a total of 1 7 5 irrigations of 25 4 mm each and 2 irrigations of 31 7 mm each and 10 irrigations were applied to fri plots in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively for vri plots irrigation amounts were applied to bring the soil water to approximately 90 of swhc to be able to store at least a portion of any potential precipitation event in each irrigation only those plots which needed irrigation calculated according to the measured soil moisture readings were irrigated for vri plots thus the number and amount of irrigation events for each vri plot varied in each season and between the vri treatments plots within a growing season the irrigation timing and amount and soil water dynamics information under each treatment and year is presented in detail in the companion paper of this research sharma and irmak 2020 to accomplish vri and fri the wmgm sensors data were downloaded from each plot datalogger every other day and processed using an irrigation management worksheet developed in the irmak research laboratory for each plot based on the plot specific soil properties computed irrigation values were then used to develop a water control maps for irrigation of each experimental unit plot the final irrigation application map prescription was then uploaded to the linear move system s control panel and irrigation was completed for different plots on the same day 2 3 crop evapotranspiration calculations seasonal maize evapotranspiration etc from emergence until harvest was calculated using a soil water balance equation 1 et c p i u runoff δ sws dp where etc is crop evapotranspiration mm p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm u is upward water flux mm runoff is surface runoff from individual treatments mm δsws is change in soil water storage mm in the soil profile between the beginning and end of the growing season and dp is the deep percolation from the crop root zone mm since the water table is approximately 30 m below the surface upward water flux was assumed to be negligible irmak 2015a the surface runoff was estimated using the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs formerly called as the soil conservation service scs curve number procedure usda nrcs 1985 the runoff was determined for each day over the growing seasons and then summed up for individual treatment for the growing season the scs curve number method relates runoff curve number cn to runoff accounting for initial abstraction losses and the soil infiltration rate the following equation was used to estimate runoff from each treatment 2 ro p i a 2 p i a s for p 0 2 s where ia is initial abstraction mm and s is the maximum retention after runoff begins mm given by 3 s 25400 cn 254 initial abstraction ia represents the water loss before runoff begins and includes water retained in surface depressions water intercepted by vegetation evaporation and infiltration the ia value is usually well correlated with soil and surface residue cover from many small agricultural watershed studies usda nrcs 1985 ia is approximated by the following empirical equation 4 i a 0 2 s the cn is dependent on surface cover type hydrological soil group treatment and hydrologic condition according to the silt loam s1 and s3 and silty clay loam s2 soil at the research site and known row cropping in all soil types curve numbers were determined as 78 89 and 78 for s1 s2 and s3 respectively for average antecedent runoff condition from the usda nrcs 1985 tables runoff is affected by soil water content before a precipitation event which is also known as the antecedent moisture condition amc prior to estimating precipitation excess infiltration the curve number was adjusted based on the five day antecedent precipitation the curve number as mentioned above may also be termed as amc ii or average soil moisture the other moisture conditions are dry amc i and moist amc iii the curve number can be adjusted by amc ii factors where amc i factors are less than 1 reducing cn and potential runoff and amc iii factors are greater than 1 increasing cn and potential runoff deep percolation was estimated using the daily soil water balance computer program payero et al 2009a 2009b bryant et al 1992 djaman and irmak 2012 irmak 2015a 2015b 2 4 nitrogen management there were three n fertilizer treatments fixed rate frf variable rate vrf and pre plant n pp for the pp treatment 246 kg ha 1 of urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 was applied in 2015 2016 and 2017 on may 27 april 13 and april 19 respectively before planting in season fertilizer was applied in vrf and frf treatments using the linear move sprinkler irrigation system the n fertilizer rate for vrf plots was calculated using n recommendation algorithms by the university of nebraska lincoln fertilizer guidelines shapiro et al 2008 these fertilizer requirements for maize were based on the expected yield and current soil nutrient levels the equation that was used for determining n requirements is 5 n need lb ac 35 1 2 ey 8 no 3 nppm 0 14 ey omc other n credits price adj timing adj where ey is expected yield bu ac 1 no3 n ppm is average nitrate n concentration in the root zone 0 60 1 2 m depth ppm omc is organic matter content other credits were assumed to be negligible priceadj is the adjustment for prices of maize and n and timingadj was the adjustment factor for fall spring and split n applications the expected yield was 105 of the five year average yield of the field five year yield data for the research field were available in the irmak research laboratory database nitrate n and omc for each plot was obtained from soil sampling data in this manner the current n requirement for a given growing season for each vrf plot was determined price and timing adjustments were calculated using the equation from shapiro et al 2008 based on the current maize market price for vrf treatment on average 217 234 and 221 kg ha 1 n fertilizer was applied in fri vri and ni irrigation treatments respectively in the 2015 growing season in the 2016 growing season these values were 205 206 and 202 kg ha 1 respectively and in 2017 they were 172 161 and 168 kg ha 1 respectively since it is assumed that multiple applications of n is generally more efficient than single large doses due to n loss potential the n fertilizer application was divided in two applications half of the required n was applied at v2 stage of maize plant growth and other at v8 stage shapiro et al 2008 for both vrf and frf plots 2 5 plant height and leaf area index measurements and calculation of crop water productivity plant height and leaf area index lai were measured on a weekly basis from each plot in each growing season the lai was measured using a model lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor biosciences lincoln ne u s a plant height was measured from the ground surface to the tip of the tallest leaf three plants from each plot i e 9 readings per treatment were measured in each measurement day in addition maize phenological development information was visually observed and recorded cwp was calculated to evaluate the response of maize yield under various irrigation and nitrogen application treatments in different soil types cwp was calculated as the ratio of grain yield y to seasonal crop evapotranspiration etc 6 cwp y etc where cwp is expressed in kg m 3 y is grain yield kg m 2 adjusted to 15 5 grain moisture content 2 6 grain yield and statistical analysis each year each plot was harvested using a two row plot combine equipped with grain yield monitor to record yield data the harvested grain was adjusted to 15 5 moisture content and expressed as per unit ground area yield and etc data were statistically analyzed using proc glimmix procedure in sas sas institute inc cary nc usa to compare the effects of irrigation treatment nitrogen n treatment and soil type on maize grain yield and etc the means were separated using least significant difference lsd test at the 95 level of significance to identify any potential significant differences in grain yield and etc between treatments when no significant interactions occurred between the treatments main effects were evaluated data were analyzed in two ways with a full factorial design in the first approach the ni level was excluded from the model and any differences caused by nitrogen treatments at vri and fri irrigation levels were determined in the second statistical approach the pp nitrogen level was excluded to analyze the difference in irrigation under vrf and frf treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions during 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the growing season precipitation in 2015 2016 and 2017 was 353 375 and 467 mm respectively even though total growing season precipitation in 2015 was lower than in 2016 and 2017 2015 experienced very heavy rainfall events in june 226 mm which was 131 mm higher than long term average table 2 and fig 2 on average 2015 growing season was warmer than 2016 and 2017 the highest monthly average temperature in all years occurred in july warmer temperatures in 2015 accelerated the crop development hence physiological maturity was 15 days and 28 days earlier than 2016 and 2017 respectively maize was harvested 145 days after planting dap with a cumulative growing degree days cgdd of 1640 c in 2015 whereas in 2016 and 2017 it was harvested at 160 dap cgdd of 1781 c and 173 dap cgdd of 1783 c respectively evaporation losses from the surface and water used by plant transpiration are heavily influenced by numerous climatic variables including wind speed relative humidity solar radiation air temperature vapor pressure deficit etc on average greater wind speed was observed in 2016 as compared with 2015 and 2017 also greater wind speeds were observed in the early growing season in all three years may to june which is common for the area the 2017 growing season experienced below normal wind speed toward late growing season august and september because of minimal precipitation amounts in june in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons as compared with 2015 large differences in relative humidity rh were observed the monthly average rh in june was 75 60 and 61 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively as compared with the long term average of 68 5 the incoming solar radiation was on average greater in 2017 than in 2015 and 2016 in general vpd in the 2017 growing season was greater than in 2015 and 2016 temporal variations in weather variables are presented in the companion paper sharma and irmak 2020 3 2 effect of fixed uniform and variable rate irrigation and nitrogen treatments on plant growth in different soil types the seasonal trends of lai and plant height as a function of dap and calendar date for fri vri and ni at all n levels for three soil types in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are presented in figs 3 and 4 the lai and plant height exhibited variation between the treatments in the same soil and for the same treatments between the soils overall in 2015 there was a significant interaction between soil type and irrigation and nitrogen combination treatments as well as soil type and date for lai p 0 05 the maximum lai in 2015 in s1 was 6 3 and was observed in fri pp treatment since irrigation applications were less in 2015 than in other years and since other environmental conditions were the same it was assumed that the differences in lai between the treatments were primarily due to the difference in nitrogen amount averaged over the irrigation levels from the beginning of the growing season until dap 65 july 31 2015 pp treatments had the highest lai this can be attributed to the 246 kg ha 1 of application of pre plant nitrogen in the pp treatments due to which they had higher foliage density and plant size thus higher lai after the nitrogen application in vrf and frf plots on july 16 2015 dap 50 the lai in these treatments started to increase no significant differences p 0 05 between pp vrf or frf treatments were observed after dap 65 lai in fri was significantly p 0 05 higher than vri and ni from dap 78 to dap 85 maximum plant height varied from 2 5 m in fri vrf treatment to 2 8 m in fri pp treatment similar results were obtained in s2 however in this soil after dap 65 lai in frf treatment was still significantly lower p 0 05 than those in pp and vrf treatments the maximum lai in s2 was 6 8 and was observed in fri pp treatment at dap 78 however for the rest of the growing season maximum lai was observed in vri pp treatment and the same results were observed for the plant height as well the maximum plant height varied from 2 5 m in vri frf treatment to 3 m in vri pp treatment no significant differences p 0 05 were observed in lai in 2015 season due to irrigation treatments similar to s1 and s2 lai was highest in pp treatment in s3 the pp treatment showed a maximum difference from vrf and frf before dap 65 in s3 comparing irrigation treatments averaged across the nitrogen treatments unlike s1 and s2 the maximum lai in s3 was observed in ni treatment at dap 78 which was 5 3 also maximum plant height of 2 7 m was observed in ni vrf and fri pp treatments at dap 78 in 2015 growing season in all soil types and treatments maximum lai and plant height was obtained between dap 78 and dap 85 which corresponded to r2 r3 maize growth stage in 2016 growing season the maximum lai in s1 s2 and s3 was 5 8 in fri frf treatment 6 2 in fri pp treatment and 5 1 in fri pp treatment respectively this trend was similar to 2015 growing season where s2 had the highest lai followed by s1 and s3 throughout the growing season lai in pp treatment was greater than vrf and frf treatments in all three soil types the progression of lai was similar for all irrigation treatments from the planting date to dap 77 in s1 dap 69 in s2 and s3 which corresponded to the irrigation applications after this period lai showed some differences between the treatments as a function of irrigation and soil water status after irrigations begun the first irrigation in 2016 growing season was applied on dap 66 the fri treatment had the greatest lai followed by vri and ni the maximum plant height in s1 s2 and s3 was the same 2 5 2 5 and 2 4 m respectively in fri vrf treatment from dap 88 to dap 98 in 2017 growing season larger differences in lai and plant height between the irrigation treatments were observed averaged over the irrigation levels lai was similar between n treatments in all soil types averaged over the n treatments fri treatment had higher lai and plant height than vri and ni treatments for dap 51 which corresponds to the first irrigation application in vri and fri comparing vri treatment with ni larger difference was observed in lai in s1 whereas lai in vri and ni was essentially the same throughout the growing season in s2 and s3 due to similar amount of irrigation the maximum lai in s1 s2 and s3 was 5 8 in fri vrf treatment 5 8 in fri pp treatment and 5 9 in fri frf treatment respectively the maximum plant height in s1 s2 and s3 was 2 7 m in fri vrf treatment 2 6 m in fri frf and 2 5 m in fri frf respectively in general for all growing seasons lai is directly related to the amount of nitrogen and water applied since the amount of nitrogen in frf and pp treatment was the same the highest lai was observed in either of these treatments the minimum lai of 4 2 and 3 7 was observed for ni nn treatment in 2016 and 2017 respectively in all seasons highest water was applied in fri treatments and these treatments also had the highest lai both fri and vri are full irrigation treatments with only difference in the amount and timing of irrigation the higher lai and plant height in fri likely suggest that more water uptake in fri treatment was used for transpiration which increased the plant growth and development 3 3 effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on crop evapotranspiration with respect to soil types the seasonal etc at each irrigation and nitrogen level for three soil types in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are summarized in table 4 the results of statistical analyses for etc are shown in table 3 in 2015 no significant differences p 0 05 in etc were observed between soil types irrigation treatments or nitrogen treatments due to lower irrigation amounts in this season than an average year in all treatments and the differences in irrigation amounts between the treatments was also low generally etc values were higher for both fri and vri treatments in s1 than other soils in 2016 no interaction between soil type irrigation or nitrogen treatment was observed however irrigation had a significant effect p 0 05 on etc in 2017 growing season soil and nitrogen interaction were significant p 0 05 and irrigation level had a significant effect on etc in 2015 growing season etc ranged from 300 mm in ni treatment in s1 to 389 mm in fri in s1 etc values for all soil types and treatments were higher in 2016 and 2017 than in 2015 due to higher seasonal rainfall and higher vpd also due to very heavy rainfall in the beginning of growing season and more uniform temporal distribution of rainfall until about dap 100 in 2015 there were fewer irrigation events in 2015 than in 2016 and 2017 the etc ranged from 336 mm in s2 in ni and no nitrogen fertilizer treatment to 649 mm in s1 fri pp treatment in 2016 in 2017 it ranged from 362 mm in s2 vri and vrf treatment to 634 mm in s3 fri vrf treatment on average maximum etc was observed in fri treatment in all years and soil types except in 2015 where maximum etc was either in fri or vri treatments on average the minimum etc was observed in ni treatment in all years and soil types djaman et al 2013 and irmak 2015a 2015b reported similar seasonal etc at the same research site with a range of 480 mm rainfed to 634 mm full irrigation and 387 mm rainfed to 690 mm full irrigation respectively etc values also varied between the years for the same treatments and between the soil types in 2016 significant impact of irrigation treatments on etc was observed averaged over the nitrogen treatments and soil types etc under fri 561 mm was significantly p 0 05 higher than vri treatment 481 mm and ni treatment 395 mm similar results were obtained in 2017 growing season where etc in fri treatment 577 mm was significantly p 0 05 higher than vri treatment 560 mm significant p 0 05 interactions between soil type and nitrogen treatments were also observed in 2017 growing season table 3 etc in vrf treatment was significantly lower p 0 05 than frf and pp treatment in s1 and s2 this means that applying in season nitrogen variably and uniformly might have different impacts on crop growth in different soil types etc increased with increase in irrigation and nitrogen amounts frf and pp treatments no difference in etc between frf and pp indicates that in season fertilizer application using irrigation system could be a beneficial option for farmers for maize production in this region since in the vri treatments the total amount of water and nitrogen applied was less than uniform application treatments of irrigation and nitrogen the etc in vri plots was also less as compared with uniform treatments to understand potential benefits of vri the impact of this reduction in etc in vri treatment on crop yield needs to be determined which is presented in the next section 3 4 effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on maize grain yield and yield variability grain yield summary for each treatment and year is presented in table 4 and a summary of statistical analysis is presented in table 3 maize yield ranged from 5 8 ton ha 1 to 11 6 ton ha 1 in 2015 5 6 ton ha 1 to 14 8 ton ha 1 in 2016 and from 7 1 ton ha 1 to 15 4 ton ha 1 in 2017 higher grain yields in irrigated treatments in 2017 than in 2016 and 2015 were due to more irrigation amounts in 2017 because of higher temperature and higher vpd especially during the first three months of the growing season higher temperatures more evaporative demand and sufficient water in the profile allowed near potential transpiration rates which increased grain yield howell et al 1995 reported a difference of 365 mm of irrigation water for full irrigation treatment between 1992 and 1993 growing seasons at bushland texas this study reported that a large gap in irrigation amounts between two consecutive years was due to higher evaporative demand conditions in one of the years in which plants developed higher leaf area which resulted in higher grain yield in the present research no significant impact p 0 05 of nitrogen application method on grain yield was observed in any of the years which indicates a potential advantage of in season fertilizer application both vrf and frf over pre plant nitrogen application for achieving optimum crop yield in season fertigation has several benefits over pre plant nitrogen application including spreading the work away from the busy planting season avoiding the frequent wet field conditions in spring and reducing in season n loss potential in wet years scharf et al 2002 the benefits of vrf has been reported by several other studies where it was shown no increase or decrease in grain yield by variable rate nitrogen application kitchen et al 1995 koch et al 2004 khosla et al 2002 these studies indicated economic and environmental benefits of utilizing site specific management zones for vrf application over conventional uniform application optimum n rates as required by the crop in vrf application helped in reducing the total nitrogen applied economic benefit and nitrate n leaching environmental benefit in this current research on average vrf used 20 less nitrogen fertilizer as compared with frf and pp indicating potential economic benefit of vrf grain yield was significantly different p 0 05 between the soil types in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons s1 had highest grain yield followed by s2 and s3 this illustrated that s1 had high yield potential and grain yield could be increased if adequate growth conditions such as soil water is maintained similar results were reported by sui and yan 2017 who found higher yields in management zones with low electrical conductivity ec similar to their study in our research s1 had the lower ec as compared with s2 and s3 sharma and irmak 2020 although interaction of soil with irrigation was not significant in any season the yield differences between the irrigation treatments in each soil type were evaluated to infer additional information about irrigation s impact on grain yield fig 5 shows the grain yield for three irrigation treatments averaged over nitrogen treatments in 2015 2016 2017 and average of three years under three soil types there was no significant yield difference p 0 05 among irrigation treatments in 2015 in any soil type due to large amount of rainfall in the early growing season and relatively uniform temporal distribution of rainfall until 100 dap only about 25 mm of water was applied to fri and vri the first irrigation application in 2015 was around 100 dap when crop was close to r4 growth stage since application of water at this growth stage did not have substantial influence on grain yield production it was not sufficient to cause significant differences in yields between the treatments therefore the impact of irrigation on maize yield was more pronounced in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in 2016 fri in s1 had the highest yield 14 1 ton ha 1 and the lowest yield was obtained in s2 in ni treatment 6 2 ton ha 1 yield in s1 was significantly higher p 0 05 than yield in s2 and s3 in 2016 comparing irrigation levels in each soil type yield in fri was not significantly different p 0 05 from vri in s1 however it was significantly higher than vri and ni in s2 and s3 fig 5 the irrigation amount applied to fri in all three soil types in 2016 was 191 mm whereas in vri it was 141 159 and 108 mm in s1 s2 and s3 respectively although irrigation amount gap in vri and fri was minimum in s2 as compared with other soil types yield was significantly lower p 0 05 in vri treatment in s1 irrigation amount in vri treatment was 50 mm lower than fri but the grain yield was not significantly impacted these results indicated that yield response to type of irrigation is soil type dependent as was also suggested by sadler et al 2002 similar results were obtained in 2017 where fri treatment had the highest grain yield 14 3 ton ha 1 followed by vri 10 6 ton ha 1 and ni 9 4 ton ha 1 averaged over three soil types grain yield was not significantly different between fri and vri treatment in s1 however in s2 and s3 yield in fri was 43 and 55 higher than vri p 0 05 respectively the irrigation water applied in s1 in fri and vri plots on average was 254 and 161 mm respectively fri being 93 mm higher than vri overall combining all years while there was no impact of nitrogen treatment on grain yield significant soil and irrigation effects were observed in s1 grain yield was not significantly different between fri and vri and both treatments had significantly higher p 0 05 yield than ni in s2 grain yield in fri was significantly higher than vri and ni and yield in vri was significantly higher than ni in s3 yield in fri was significantly higher than vri and ni and no difference was observed between vri and ni treatments the results of this research suggested that soil properties and field topography especially elevation and slope played a role in yield response to irrigation by redirecting and altering soil water dynamics and availability through the influence of some of the soil properties organic matter content soil temperature water holding capacity particle size distribution etc jiang and thelen 2004 on soil water and crop growth and yield relationships kravchenko and bullock 2000 found that elevation was the most important contributing topographic factor which had negative correlation with maize yield jiang and thelen 2004 found a significant negative correlation between field slope and maize yield higher maize yield in s1 in this research can be related to higher elevation and lower slope in that soil type within the field this can also be attributed to higher soil water holding capacity swhc in s1 than in s2 and s3 due to higher swhc frequent irrigations as in fri were not required and plant growth was sustained with less frequent irrigations as in vri lower grain yields in s2 and s3 might be related to low lying areas fig 1 where extreme precipitation caused temporary flooding water ponding resulting in poor aeration and significant problems with crop development sharma and irmak 2020 which were also observed by sudduth et al 1996 and benedetto et al 2017 because of suboptimal crop development in s2 and s3 evident from plant height lai and visual observations figs 3 and 4 plant roots could be shallow which were not able to effectively use available water from the deeper soils sadler et al 2005 the potential impact of fri and vri strategies on grain variability within each soil type was also determined via coefficient of variation cv table 5 the grain yield cv values ranged from 8 in s1 fri treatment to as high as 35 3 in s3 vri treatment fri treatment in all soil types had less variation in crop yield as compared with vri comparing the variability between soil types s1 had the lowest maize grain yield variability as compared with s2 and s3 these results indicate that both within soil variability and variability among soil types in term of topography elevation and slope and swhc should be considered to understand if vri could be a beneficial strategy in specific soil and management conditions 3 5 relationship between irrigation and grain yield irrigation yield production functions iypf maize yields had strong correlation with seasonal irrigation amounts in vri and fri treatments at all nitrogen levels figs 6 and 7 and the relationships were explained by quadratic functions higher r2 values for iypfs were observed for fri treatment at all levels of nitrogen when compared with vri treatment at corresponding nitrogen levels soil type did not have significant impact on the iypfs in fri treatment comparing fig 6m n and o whereas due to higher variability in grain yield among the soil types under vri treatment the r2 values decreased from s1 0 59 to s2 0 53 to s3 0 28 comparing fig 7m n and o comparing the nitrogen treatments pp nitrogen treatment showed the strongest relationship r2 with yield with seasonal irrigation in both fri and vri treatments similar results were reported by sadler et al 2002 for usa southeastern coastal plains region where they observed significant variation in yield response to irrigation among and within soil map units with vri the iypfs developed in this research for different irrigation management strategies fri and vri are some of the first iypfs developed for different soil types in the same environment managed under fri and vri under different nitrogen management and are important to growers irrigators water regulatory and management agencies and other irrigation professionals for understanding the optimum values of irrigation for maximum yield under different management practices irmak 2015b stated that while iypfs can provide invaluable data and information about crop yield response to water instead of irrigation water applied etc is a stronger and perhaps more relevant indicator of crop water productivity because not all water applied to a given field is used by plants for productivity thus direct response of grain yield to water losses from the field as a function of climatic conditions soil water and crop management is better represented by etc irmak 2015b therefore et yield production functions for each treatment in this research were also developed to quantify crop productivity based on amount of water used etc rather than applied irrigation 3 6 relationship between maize evapotranspiration and grain yield evapotranspiration yield production functions etypf the etypfs were developed for fri vri and ni treatments at all levels of nitrogen treatments and pooled data to assess the impact of various irrigation and nitrogen management strategies on yield productivity per unit of etc etypfs exhibited considerable variation between irrigation and nitrogen treatments as well as soil types maize grain yield had a linear relationship with seasonal etc for all treatments with r2 ranging from 0 69 to 0 95 in fri treatment fig 8 and from 0 02 to 0 85 in vri treatment fig 9 ni treatments in all soil types and all nitrogen treatments had weaker relationship than irrigated treatments fig 10 higher r2 values were observed in fri treatments at all nitrogen levels than in vri averaged over all soil types and nitrogen treatments grain yield in fri treatment had the strongest correlation to etc r2 0 70 followed by vri r2 0 40 and ni r2 0 05 fig 8p p and p pooled soil types data at each nitrogen treatment showed that r2 values had a decreasing trend from fri to vri comparing figs 8d h and l with 9d h and l respectively the decrease in correlation can be attributed to more variability and inconsistency in the grain yield trends in vri treatments as compared with fri comparing the nitrogen treatments in fri the highest correlation was observed in pp r2 0 76 fig 8d however in vri the highest correlation was observed in frf nitrogen treatment r2 0 58 fig 9h the slopes of etypfs for fri ranged from 0 0191 ton ha 1 in s1 pp nitrogen treatment fig 8a to 0 039 ton ha 1 in s2 vrf treatment fig 8j comparing soil types for fri treatments s1 had a positive slope of 0 02 ton ha 1 with an intercept of 3 37 ton ha 1 fig 8m whereas s2 and s3 had a negative slope of 0 03 ton ha 1 fig 8n and o in s1 etypf at all levels of nitrogen treatments under fri management showed a positive intercept which can be attributed to higher grain yields even at lower irrigation levels in s1 which also indicates that s1 had a higher yield potential as compared with s2 and s3 it is important to note that similar to increased variation in grain yield under vri the variation in etc for the same treatments in different soil types with vri also increased as compared with fri the standard deviation sd values of etc were 4 4 30 2 and 22 5 mm in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively for fri whereas they were much higher as 7 22 1 and 69 4 mm in vri for the same years respectively the slopes of etypfs for vri treatment ranged from 0 006 ton ha 1 in s2 pp treatment fig 9b to 0 03 ton ha 1 in s3 vrf treatment fig 9g for all treatments slopes were less steep in vri as compared with fri positive intercepts of etypf were obtained in s1 at all nitrogen levels whereas the trend was inconsistent for s2 and s3 the overall pooled response i e nitrogen levels of grain yield to etc at each soil type fig 9m n and o showed positive etypf intercepts since the basic idea of vri management was to apply the right amount of water at the right location and at the right time by considering field s spatially variable attributes higher yields under low irrigations were expected at the places where soil has enough water that it did not require supplemental irrigation since irrigation has a linear relationship with etc irmak 2015a 2015b lower irrigations resulted in lower etc however yield was not impacted less steep slope of etypf in vri as compred to fri figs 8 and 9 the aforementioned analyses presented the etypfs and iypfs based on pooled etc data irrigation and grain yield for three years 2015 2016 and 2017 individual etypfs of individual treatments were also quantified figs 8 9 and 10 and a unit increase in maize grain yield in response to a unit 25 4 mm of etc are presented in table 6 this was done to infer more detailed information about maize productivity response to individual treatments the lowest yield of 0 16 ton ha 1 per unit of etc 25 4 mm was observed in s2 vri pp treatment while the highest 0 99 ton ha 1 was observed in s2 s2 fri vrf this showed that soil type had an impact on the response of maize grain yield to etc and that this response also varied between fri and vri observing the linear relationship of the pooled data for each soil type a 25 4 mm of etc beyond the intercept resulted in 0 48 and 0 35 ton ha 1 maize yield for fri and vri treatment respectively in s1 0 75 and 0 45 ton ha 1 for fri and vri respectively in s2 and 0 71 and 0 43 ton ha 1 for fri and vri respectively in s3 figs 8m 9m 8n 9n 8o and 9o respectively for the same location djaman et al 2013 reported the values of 1 2 and 1 7 ton ha 1 per 25 4 mm of etc in 2009 and 2010 respectively beyond 280 mm in 2009 and 403 mm in 2010 of etc that was used by maize to start producing grain yield basal et at clay center ne for the same location from a long term research irmak 2015a 2015b reported a long term average grain production of 0 48 ton ha 1 for fit full irrigation treatment for a 25 4 mm of etc from 2005 to 2010 and this value had considerable interannual variation payero et al 2006 reported a value of 0 71 ton ha 1 per 25 4 mm of etc in west central nebraska payero et al 2006 collected and reported nine linear relationships of etc with grain yield and concluded that maize response to water can changes with environments and time as new hybrids are developed and management practices improve in addition the variability in reported slopes of the linear functions in this research can be due to the differences in seasonal precipitation distribution among different plots soil and crop characteristics and other climatic and management conditions irmak 2015a 2015b moreover the results of the present research showed that changing only the soil characteristics while considering all other variables to be similar or the same can create substantial differences in the slopes and intercepts of the etypf which agrees with the results obtained by sadler et al 2002 in practical applications and modeling efforts these etypfs can be very useful and informative for evaluating optimum management scenarios by understanding the grain yield responses to water under vri and fri management strategies with vrf frf and pp nitrogen application 3 7 treatment effects on crop water productivity cwp aka crop water use efficiency cwue the cwp values for irrigation treatments and soil types for 2015 2016 and 2017 growing season are presented in table 7 the cwp ranged from 1 92 kg m 3 s2 ni to 2 77 kg m 3 s1 vri with an average of 2 21 kg m 3 in 2015 from 1 77 kg m 3 s2 ni to 2 70 kg m 3 s1 vri with an average of 2 23 kg m 3 in 2016 and from 1 85 kg m 3 s3 ni to 2 56 kg m 3 s2 fri with an average of 2 29 kg m 3 in 2017 as no significant impact p 0 05 of nitrogen treatments was observed on grain yield cwp of fri vri and ni averaged over the nitrogen treatments was presented the cwp in vri treatment was 13 12 and 2 3 greater than fri in s1 s2 and s3 respectively in 2015 this can be attributed to slightly higher grain yield in vri as compared with fri with similar etc similarly in 2016 cwp was 7 higher in vri treatment than in fri in s1 due to larger magnitude of change in etc between fri and vri however in s2 and s3 fri cwp was 3 and 17 higher than vri respectively higher cwp in s1 vri can also be attributed to slightly lower but not significantly different p 0 05 yield and etc in vri than in fri due to which the ratio of yield and etc in vri was greater than fri the lowest cwp in this season was obtained in ni due to lower grain yields in 2017 cwp in fri was higher than vri and ni in all soil types the lower cwp in vri as compared with fri in 2017 was due to substantially larger magnitude of difference in grain yield between vri and fri fri grain yield being greater than vri grain yield on a three year average basis cwp was 2 higher in vri in s1 whereas 11 lower in s2 and s3 than fri similar to grain yield and etc cwp in vri treatments had higher variation than those in fri treatments the sd values of cwp were 0 27 0 23 and 0 06 kg m 3 in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively for fri whereas they were 0 40 0 44 and 0 12 kg m 3 for vri for the same years respectively in addition to the soil water availability soil properties such as ec and swhc play an important role in deciding irrigation and consequently the grain yield sui and yan 2017 and cwp in this research soil with lower ec and higher soil water holding capacity i e s1 has higher yields and cwue as compared with other soil types the cwp values reported in this research are greater than the cwp range of 0 80 1 60 kg m 3 as reported in fao 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 however agreed with the results reported by djaman and irmak 2012 and irmak 2015a 2015b for the same location the fact that vri management using soil moisture sensors increased the variability in grain yield etc and cwp and that the performance of vri varies within a field based on soil properties shows that the point measurement of soil water content using soil moisture sensors was not sufficient to manage the vri and that other sources or factors unrelated to soil water also influence crop yield jones 1990a suggested that the actual tissue water potential of a plant does not just depend on the soil water status but also on the rate of water flow through the plant they mentioned that in soil water based irrigation scheduling many features of plant physiology plant and root tissues respond to the changes in bulk soil water content rather than changes in water status in the tissues itself therefore for efficient and precise irrigation management for vri plant sensing should be considered in addition to soil water sensing future research is required to understand how crop water status measurements and plant response differ from soil water status and how irrigation scheduling based on crop water status compares to soil water irrigation scheduling 4 summary and conclusions impacts of fri vri and ni under frf vrf and pp nitrogen management on maize lai plant height grain yield etc iypf etypf and cwp was investigated in three soil types through carefully conducted extensive field research campaigns in 2015 2016 and 2017 the findings and conclusions of the research are summarized as for all growing seasons lai is directly related to the amount of nitrogen and water since the amount of nitrogen in frf and pp treatment was similar and was greater than vrf the highest lai was observed in frf and pp treatments among the irrigation levels the highest lai was observed in fri for all seasons plant height did not vary notably between the treatments as plants usually attained their maximum height before the irrigations started significant effect of irrigation on etc was observed in 2016 and 2017 and significant interactions between soil type and nitrogen treatments were observed in 2017 growing season for all soil types and years higher etc was observed in fri treatment except s1 and s2 in 2015 where highest etc was observed in vri the minimum etc in all soil types and years was observed in ni treatment soil type had significant impact on grain yield in 2015 and 2016 with grain yield in s1 being significantly higher than yield in s2 and s3 no significant impact of nitrogen application method on grain yield was observed in any of the seasons which indicates a potential benefit of in season fertilizer application both with vrf and frf over pre plant nitrogen application on average vrf used 20 less nitrogen fertilizer than frf and pp indicating potential economic benefit of vrf over frf and pp although reduced n use with vrf needs to be considered with grain yield obtained under vrf for detailed economic analyses higher maize yield was observed in s1 that had significantly lower ec than s2 and s3 on average amount of water used for irrigation under vri management was 24 lower than fri in s1 whereas yield was only 4 lower in vri as compared with fri the results of this research indicate that in cases where soil properties such as topography negatively impact etc and grain yield water application by any irrigation scheduling method would have negative impact on yield grain yield had a quadratic relationship with seasonal irrigation amounts in vri and fri treatments at all nitrogen levels a stronger higher r2 yield response to irrigation was observed for fri treatment at all levels of nitrogen than vri treatments at corresponding nitrogen levels maize grain yield had a linear and strong r2 relationship with seasonal etc for all the treatments with r2 ranging from 0 69 to 0 95 in fri treatment and 0 02 0 85 in vri treatment fri treatments had stronger yield response to etc than vri treatments ni treatments in all soil types and all levels of nitrogen treatment showed weaker relationship than irrigated treatments higher variability in grain yield etc and cwp was observed in vri management strategy as compared with fri management cwp was 2 higher in vri in s1 whereas 11 lower in s2 and s3 than fri cwp exhibited substantial variation between the years and the irrigation treatments our results indicated that in most cases fri had superior performance than vri the vri management using soil moisture sensors alone may have the potential of maintaining maize grain yield and improving cwp as compared with fri in certain conditions or soil types such as in s1 however future research is required to validate justify its adoption for the fields with significant spatial soil heterogeneity and to understand the economics of vri management the results of this research can be useful and informative for maize growers and their advisors state and federal water management agencies decision makers and crop modelers in the regions with similar climate and soil conditions

10219,in arid and semi arid regions plant responses to water deficits at different phenological stages should be investigated for efficient use of water resources and sustainable irrigation management this study was conducted under the regional conditions in the konya province with a semi arid climate for two years 2016 17 to determine the effects of irrigation applied at different growth stages on yield and quality traits of melon cucumis melo l cv dardanos thus a total of eight different irrigation treatments were implemented at three different growth stages of melon from planting to flowering v flowering to fruit swelling f and fruit swelling to harvesting m these treatments were specified as single stage irrigation v f and m two stage irrigation vf vm and fm irrigation for the whole season vfm stress free and non irrigated the seasonal total water consumption varied between 129 7 and 418 5 mm in 2016 and between 161 8 and 428 6 mm in 2017 the greatest fruit yield 52 9 t ha was obtained from stress free vfm treatment however significant decreases were observed in fruit yields for other treatments when yield and quality traits were assessed together principal component analysis pca revealed that vf and fm treatments had similar values to vfm treatment with regard to irrigation water productivity iwp there were no significant differences between vm and vfm treatments and vm treatment provided about 47 water saving on the other hand significant decreases were observed in fruit yields of v f and m treatments in which irrigation and the water stress were applied during only a single phenological stage and the other two periods respectively since the yield response factor ky for the whole growing season of melon was greater than 1 0 1 30 the melon was considered sensitive to water stress under semi arid climatic conditions in conclusion two stage irrigation treatments vf vm and fm could be applied in well scheduled irrigation programs of melon for efficient use of water resources and sustainable irrigation management in arid and semi arid regions keywords drip irrigation phenological period irrigation water productivity yield response factor principal component analysis 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions there is a lack of sufficient precipitation and rainfall is not equally distributed throughout the whole growing season the rapid depletion of available water resources and the increasing demands of domestic and industrial sectors have emphasized the need for water conservation in agriculture fernandez et al 2002 deng et al 2006 therefore in these regions irrigation is an essential component of sustainable agriculture for optimal plant growth and yield irrigation has made significant contributions to the development of agricultural practices and crop yield and quality the konya plain has an annual precipitation of 323 mm and a semi arid climate with limited water resources it constitutes about 8 of available arable lands of turkey yavuz et al 2015 the average annual precipitation throughout the growing season may october is only 100 mm while total evaporation during this period is about 1150 mm therefore irrigation is essential for optimal crop yield and quality in the konya plain in this region the largest percentage of water consumption in agriculture is supplied by groundwater aquifers thus groundwater levels are decreasing rapidly and groundwater quality is suffering due to insufficient water resources dry farming is practiced in over 1 3 million ha of konya plain yavuz et al 2020 therefore the efficient use of scarce water resources for sustainable water management for agriculture in the konya plain is a serious challenge the cropping pattern in this region should be altered in this regard instead of high water consuming species like sugar beet maize and carrot economically valuable and low water consuming species like melon should be cultivated in semi arid regions like the konya plain melon cucumis melo l is a fruit of high consumption grown in various parts of the world it is also an excellent nutritional source due to its phytochemical constituents the substances such as cucurbitacin β lithium and zinc in melon fruits which play an essential role in the prevention of cancer and ulcer boost the immune system lester 1997 melon is mainly grown in open fields around 27 3 million tons of melon are produced in over 1 05 million ha area worldwide turkey with an average annual production of 1 75 million tons ranked the second largest melon producer in the world after china with about 6 4 of the world s melon production faostat 2020 in arid and semi arid areas scarce water resources and high energy costs result in less income per unit of area for the farmers in these regions the majority of energy consumption for crop production comes from irrigation practices yavuz et al 2016 topak et al 2010 water deficits and high energy costs led both producers and water management authorities to reduce agricultural water use and manage water resources more efficiently thus deficit irrigation di strategies have emerged to increase water savings in agriculture di strategies improve water use efficiency thereby allowing a higher yield per unit of irrigation water applied costa et al 2007 fereres and soriano 2007 in this method plants are exposed to water stress either throughout the whole growing season or during certain growth stages english and raja 1996 some researchers suggested that melon should be irrigated throughout the whole growing season yıldırım et al 2009 şengül 2009 similarly mishra et al 2017 stated that the melon should not be exposed to water stress to obtain the maximum yield in contrast some researchers have reported the highest fruit yield under mild water stress al mefleh et al 2012 da silva et al 2007 however melon exhibits different responses to water stress applied at different growth stages in different regions one study conducted in spain found that water stress applied during the flowering period negatively influenced the fruit yield and quality of muskmelon cv piel de sapo but did not affect fruit yield during the ripening period fabeiro et al 2002 another study carried out by wang et al 2017 in china under dry climate conditions reported that for the cultivation of melon cv huanghemi 3 soil moisture content based on field capacity to initiate irrigation should not drop below a threshold value of 55 during the flowering fruit set period and 65 in the fruit enlargement period the yield response factor is commonly used to assess plant response to water stress according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 ky 1 indicates the plant sensitivity to water stress and ky 1 indicates the plant tolerance to water deficit therefore it is necessary to determine yield response factors of melon during different growth periods in semi arid regions water yield relations of the melon should be investigated to adopt appropriate irrigation programs and water saving technologies in arid and semi arid regions with scarce water resources therefore this study was conducted to determine yield and quality traits water consumption water productivity and irrigation water productivity of melon exposed to water stress applied at different phenological stages and to determine yield response factors during specific growth stages under central anatolian conditions in a semi arid climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 climate and soil characteristics of the studied site the present study was conducted at the experimental field of sarıcalar research and implementation center of selçuk university in 2016 and 2017 the experimental site located at 38ο 05 north latitudes and 32ο 36 east longitudes has an average altitude of 1006 m in both the years climate data from the seedling planting to fruit harvesting were acquired from an automatic weather station davis vantage pro2 placed in the research site and long term data were obtained from the konya regional directorate of meteorology table 1 total precipitation throughout the vegetation period was 51 4 mm in 2016 and 91 0 mm in 2017 during the vegetative growth period of melon all the precipitation 51 4 mm and precipitation of 80 73 2 mm occurred in 2016 and 2017 respectively and most of the precipitation occurred before the first irrigation in both the years there was no rainfall during other stages of growth flowering and maturation in 2016 and the rainfall during flowering and maturation stages in 2017 was insignificant moreover the mean precipitation during the whole vegetation period of melon is about 80 mm according to long term records average of 56 years in the region therefore there is no difference in mean precipitation between a long term experiment and the current experiment similarly the average temperature relative humidity and wind speed values did not exhibit remarkable differences based on both experimental durations and long term climate data the physical and chemical characteristics of experimental soils are presented in table 2 soil texture classes from the top to bottom layers varied from silty clay loam to clay total available water taw was 148 8 mm and soil ph values and organic matter contents varied between 7 70 and 7 98 and between 0 93 and 1 55 at 0 90 cm soil profile respectively experimental soils were suitable for the cultivation of melon in terms of both physical and chemical characteristics 2 2 water resources and irrigation system irrigation water was supplied by a deep well located around 50 m away from the studied site irrigation water quality was identified as a c2s1 class irrigation water was applied to the experimental field using a drip irrigation system composed of 16 mm drip lines with 4 l h drippers operating at 100 kpa main and manifold lines were composed of 63 and 32 mm pe pipes respectively flow meters 3 4 in were installed at the plot inlet to control the volume of irrigation water applied to plots 2 3 plant material the cultivar kırkağaç type dardanos f1 of melon widely grown in open fields of the region was used as the plant material in the study dardanos f1 is a high yielding hybrid cultivar suitable for cultivation in open fields it has a strong root system and elliptical fruits with green and yellow spotted rind the fruit flesh is thick and white and has a higher soluble solids content ssc fruits are highly resistant to transportation conditions and have a thick rind 2 4 the design of the drip irrigation system and plot sizes to determine dripper spacing and percentage of wetted area trials were conducted based on soil characteristics with a lateral line and dripper discharge rate of 4 l h operated at 100 kpa pressure the wetted diameter at a depth of 30 cm was 88 cm the percentage of wetted area at around 30 cm under the single dripper could be calculated by dividing the width of the wetted line with lateral spacing keller and bliesner 1990 yıldırım 2003 in the present experiments the wetted area percentage was 44 88 cm 200 cm x100 dripper spacing of 40 cm was selected based on soil characteristics and dripper discharge a drip irrigation system was installed in the field for two years before planting melon seedlings lateral pipes of 5 m long were placed in 5 m experimental plots with four plant rows in each plot and a lateral spacing of 2 m there was a distance of about 3 m between the blocks and plots in each plot twenty melon seedlings were planted with 2 m row spacing and 1 m on row plant spacing and a lateral line was placed for each plant row fig 1 2 5 experimental treatments there were eight different irrigation treatments table 3 applied at three different phenological stages from planting to flowering v flowering to fruit swelling f and swelling to harvest m treatments included irrigation in a single period v f and m irrigation in two periods vf vm and fm irrigation in all three periods vfm non stressed and non irrigated in all three periods vfm was considered as the control treatment and all parameters at different phenological stages were determined based on this control treatment a period of v started during planting and ended at about 50 flowering the period of f started during 50 flowering and ended when the first five fruits reached about 15 cm vertical diameters the period of m started with ending the f period and ended at the harvesting time 2 6 phenological durations melon vegetative development period flowering fruit set period and fruit swelling maturation period are presented in table 4 in both the years periods of flowering fruit set and fruit swelling maturation periods had the same durations however in 2017 the vegetative development period was nine days longer than in 2016 and a larger number of rainy days especially during the vegetation period in june and lower temperatures inhibited plant growth which resulted in a prolonged the vegetative development period for about 8 10 d however this situation did not negatively affect the yield and its components in other words no significant differences were found between trials for two years 2 7 agronomic practices around 2 3 days before planting dap diammonium phosphate fertilizer at a rate of 200 kg ha was applied and incorporated into the soil with a rototiller moreover using a drip irrigation system 50 kg ha pure nitrogen was applied melon seedlings were planted on the 11th of may in 2016 and the 15th of may in 2017 for healthy growth and development after planting 20 mm of water was applied in both the years disease and pest control practices were adopted as necessary throughout the vegetation period before the harvesting the margins of plots were removed and fruit harvesting was carried out on september 1 and 6 in 2016 and on september 12 and 18 in 2017 2 8 irrigation water amount and plant water consumption vfm control treatment was considered for the determination of irrigation timing and the amount of irrigation water applied to each treatment in the control treatment irrigation was initiated when the total available water taw at 0 90 cm soil profile dropped to about 50 55 p 0 50 0 55 and the amount of available water was at field capacity for each irrigation soil moisture content was measured by the gravimetric method from samples taken from 0 to 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm soil depths using an auger before each irrigation in each irrigation the soil moisture deficit at 0 90 cm depth root zone was multiplied by the plot size 40 m2 and the wetted area percentage 0 44 to obtain the amount of irrigation water in liters applied to the control treatment in other experimental treatments considering the growth stages during which plants were exposed to water stress table 3 irrigation was practiced at the same time and the same amount of water was applied to the control treatment plant water consumption et was calculated based on the soil water budget equation james 1988 units are in mm 1 e t i r d p c p r f δ s where i the amount of applied irrigation water r effective rainfall dp deep percolation calculated according to the gravimetric method from samples taken from 90 to 120 cm soil depths before and after the irrigation cp capillary rise δs the difference in soil moisture content between planting and harvesting rf surface runoff since there was no seepage below 90 cm soil depth deep percolation was assumed to be zero since the research site did not have any drainage and salinity problems the capillary rise was not taken into consideration and surface runoff was also not taken into account because drip irrigation was used in this study the irrigation water compensation was calculated using eq 2 howell et al 1990 2 i r c i e t x 100 where irc the irrigation water compensation i total irrigation depth mm and et seasonal plant water consumption 2 9 yield response factor ky water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp the relationship between plant water consumption and fruit yields was determined with the following eq 3 developed by doorenbos and kassam

subjected to tests of homogeneity of variance and error variances for the years were found to be homogeneous therefore the combined analysis of variance was applied to experimental data of two years significant differences were compared using the lsd test at a 5 significance level the analysis of variance and lsd tests were conducted using the spss 22 0 software principal component analysis pca allowing the overall assessment of yield and yield components was performed with the jmp 10software 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation water productivity et and yield the amount of irrigation water applied in experimental treatments precipitation measured throughout the growing season plant water consumption et and the irrigation water compensation i rc are given in table 5 the total amount of irrigation water applied in experimental treatments varied between 20 and 340 mm in 2016 and between 20 and 318 mm in 2017 when both years were assessed together a higher amount of irrigation water was applied in vfm treatment considering the irrigation in two periods a higher volume of irrigation water was applied in fm treatment while for single period irrigation f treatment received a larger amount of irrigation water total precipitation throughout the growing season was 51 4 mm in 2016 and 91 0 mm in 2017 in 2016 the whole rainfall occurred in the vegetative development period whereas in the other periods no precipitation was captured in 2017 total precipitation values during the vegetative development flowering fruit set and fruit swelling maturation periods were 73 2 5 8 mm and 12 mm respectively plant water consumption values varied between 129 7 and 418 5 mm in 2016 and between 161 8 and 428 6 mm in 2017 in both the years the highest plant water consumption was recorded in vfm treatment in a study carried out by şensoy et al 2007 on the effect of different irrigation levels on melon plant water consumption of 637 mm was obtained for full irrigation treatment on the other hand the maximum plant water consumption values of melon were reported to be 599 2 mm kuşçu 2017 and 604 7 mm şengül 2009 in this study plant water consumption in a full irrigation treatment was lower than that obtained from the previous studies which can be attributed to differences in climate soil cultivar and especially irrigation method and schedule however some other studies on water yield relations of melon reported similar findings to those of the present study for instance in a region of spain with an annual average precipitation of 400 mm water consumption of melon was 419 5 mm cabello et al 2009 on the other hand dogan et al 2008 conducted a two year study and reported the highest yields for the treatments which received 311 and 370 mm irrigation water in the first and second year respectively lower yields were obtained in treatments with larger or smaller amounts of irrigation water similarly fabeiro et al 2002 stated that the amount of irrigation water should not exceed 400 mm for the optimal yield of melon under semi arid climatic conditions in spain wang et al 2017 conducted a study under dry climatic conditions in china at different phenological stages of melon and reported seasonal plant water consumption between 251 9 and 335 7 mm in different treatments the irrigation water i rc compensation in full irrigation treatment vfm was 81 in 2016 and 74 in 2017 table 5 in previous studies on water yield relations in full irrigation treatment irc values were 82 in pumpkin yavuz et al 2015 88 in sugar beet topak et al 2016 and 89 in sunflower yavuz et al 2019 these findings indicate that in melon and other plants irrigation water compensates for the majority of plant water consumption in semi arid areas a graph was drawn to present the amount of irrigation water et precipitation and yields together fig 2 as shown in this graph the highest yield 52 9 t ha was obtained in vfm treatment without water stress with a significant difference with other treatments according to the results of the lsd test p 0 05 as compared to the vfm treatment decreases in fruit yields varied between 29 in water stress treatment fm and 84 in non irrigated treatment among the treatments with irrigation in two periods the highest yield was obtained in the fm treatment 37 6 t ha moreover differences in yields of vf and vm treatments were not significant among single period irrigation treatments with the water stress applied during the other two periods the highest yield 26 7 t ha was obtained in the f treatment the differences in yields of v and m treatments were not significant but remarkable reductions 66 67 were observed in fruit yields obtained from these treatments as compared to the control treatment in general decreased fruit yields were observed with reducing irrigation water quantities fig 2 cabello et al 2009 reported that full irrigation treatment produced the highest yield 37 2 t ha while the yield reduction of about 22 was observed in 40 water deficit treatment under mediterranean climate conditions likewise the highest yield 69 7 t ha was obtained in full irrigation whereas deficit irrigation caused significant yield losses in the marmara region kuşçu 2017 sharma et al 2014 conducted a study in the usa texas and reported the highest yield 77 1 t ha in the full irrigation treatment and about 30 of yield reduction in 50 water deficit treatment the findings reveal significant yield reductions in melon with deficit irrigation the apparent effect of irrigation could be clearly seen when comparing the full irrigation and non irrigated treatments as compared to vfm treatment without water stress the yield reduction of about 84 was observed in non irrigated treatment in other words in semi arid regions like the konya plain a 6 fold increase in melon yield could be achieved under full irrigation fig 2 3 2 yield components the number of fruits per plant average fruit weight length width soluble solids content ssc and ph values are given in table 6 irrigation at different periods significantly influenced the number of fruits per plant and the greatest value was obtained in the vfm treatment but its difference with that of the fm treatment receiving irrigation not only during the vegetative development period was not significant previous studies reported a decreased number of fruits per plant under drought salinity and other abiotic stress factors botia et al 2005 tedeschi et al 2011 sharma et al 2014 rad et al 2017 pereira et al 2017 observed that the numbers of fruits per plant in melon irrigated with saline irrigation water ranged from 1 1 to 3 9 the number of fruits per plant may also vary with the melon cultivars hybrid cultivars generally produce the greater numbers of fruits per plant and thus higher yields in the present study dardanos f1 which is a hybrid cultivar had a high fruit set similar to the findings of previous studies water stress applied in different periods negatively influenced the number of fruits per plant in the present study there were significant differences in fruit weight and length between experimental treatments and the best results were achieved in vfm treatment water stress applied in different growth periods negatively influenced the fruit weight which is closely related to total yields and therefore decreased fruit weights caused significant decreases in the total yield al mefleh et al 2012 reported a positive correlation between the amount of applied irrigation water and fruit weight in melon zeng et al 2009 conducted a study on the influence of deficit irrigation on melon and reported decreased fruit lengths with reducing the quantity of irrigation water fruits width varied from 15 0 to 18 5 cm the vfm vm and fm were placed in the same treatment groups irrigation applied during fruit swelling to harvesting had positive effects on fruit width in a previous study with different melon genotypes average and the greatest fruit width values of 12 3 and 15 8 cm were reported respectively rad et al 2017 soluble solids content ssc values varied between 10 9 and 13 3 and greater ssc values were observed in water stress treatments both non irrigated treatment and the v treatment with irrigation applied only in the vegetative development period and without irrigation in the other two periods had high ssc values doğan et al 2008 reported the greatest brix value in melon 12 1 in the non irrigated treatment brix values between 11 7 and 12 5 12 8 14 3 and 10 4 11 7 were observed by hartz 1997 li et al 2012 and cabello et al 2009 respectively in studies on the water yield relation of melon greater brix values were found at higher stress levels akrami and arzani 2019 conducted a study in iran and reported that salt stress negatively influenced the yield performance of melon but enhanced the taste of fruits similar findings were observed in the present study as in treatment with water stress applied especially during the fruit swelling and maturation periods as well as non irrigated treatment brix values increased the ph values of experimental treatments did not vary much and therefore the differences in ph values were not significant table 6 cabello et al 2009 reported ph values of 5 54 5 65 in melon at different irrigation levels indicating that differences in ph values of irrigation treatments were not significant rind and flesh thickness seed yield per fruit 1000 seed weight and seed length and width values are given in table 7 differences in rind thickness 1000 seed weight and seed width values of the experimental treatments were not significant fruit flesh thickness varied between 24 3 and 35 3 mm and had the highest values in the fm treatment with water stress applied only during the vegetative development period as well as vfm vm and f treatments in general flesh thickness values decreased with decreasing the quantities of irrigation water doğan et al 2008 observed the flesh thickness values of 34 46 mm under different irrigation levels and also reported decreased flesh thickness values in water deficit treatments similarly li et al 2012 reported flesh thickness values between 19 3 and 23 8 mm under different irrigation water levels and decreased flesh thicknesses with increasing water stress in another study conducted on galia type melon irrigated with saline water significant decreases in flesh thickness were reported with an increasing salt concentration of irrigation water del amor et al 1999 seed yield per fruit varied between 22 5 and 35 8 g with the highest value in the vfm treatment there were no significant differences in seed yields between vfm vf fm and v treatments the irrigation applied especially during the vegetative development and flowering fruit set periods had a significant effect on seed yield per fruit drought is a significant factor limiting plant growth development and productivity the water stress applied at various stages of seed development significantly influenced seed yield and quality dornbos et al 1989 smiciklas et al 1992 heatherly 1993 egli et al 2005 in another study on the pumpkin water stress treatments negatively influenced seed yields yavuz et al 2015 the greatest seed length 11 2 cm was obtained in the non irrigated treatment followed by v and vf treatments seed length decreased in the water stress treatment applied in the vegetative development period similarly çiftçi 2013 reported that the seed length of melon varied between 11 55 and 12 00 mm and deficit irrigation did not have any significant effects on seed length the seed lengths of different melon genotypes ranged from 9 14 to 11 55 mm tur 2016 3 3 water yield relations the total amount of irrigation water applied to each treatment and the relationship between plant water consumption and fruit yields are graphically presented in fig 3 in both the years separately 2016 and 2017 and the average of two years there were linear relationships among the amount of irrigation water plant water consumption and fruit yield at the 99 confidence level the equations and coefficients of determination are presented in the figure similarly kırnak et al 2005 reported the strong linear relationship between fruit yield and plant water consumption of melon yield response factors k y indicating the effects of the relative decrease in plant water consumption on the relative reduction in fruit yield were determined for both the whole growing season and different growth periods fig 4 therefore relationships between seasonal plant water consumption in different irrigation treatments and fruit yields were investigated using the regression analysis since both years had similar plant water consumption and fruit yield values of both the years were homogeneous the average values of fruit yield for 2016 and 2017 were used in ky calculations the ky value for the whole growing season was 1 30 fig 4 in previous studies conducted in the same region ky values were 1 08 for the pumpkin yavuz et al 2015 and 1 12 for watermelon yavuz et al 2020 in central anatolia the grafted and ungrafted sinem f1 hybrid cultivar had the ky values of 1 2 and 1 1 respectively keskin 2016 the greatest ky value 2 14 was obtained in the vf treatment with water stress applied during the fruit swelling maturity period in other words significant decreases were observed in fruit yield when irrigations were made in the vegetative development and flowering fruit set and water stress was applied in the fruit swelling maturity periods similarly high ky value of 1 96 was obtained for the plants treated with water stress during the vegetative development period fig 4 doorenbos and kassam 1979 indicated that when the k y 1 plants are considered sensitive to water deficit therefore since k y values of melon were higher than 1 0 during the whole growing season as well as specific growth periods the melon was considered sensitive to water stress under semi arid climate conditions water productivity wp a significant indicator of water yield relations which is expressed as the benefit per unit water and irrigation water productivity iwp values are presented in fig 5 the greatest wp value 12 5 kg m3 was obtained in the vfm treatment followed by the vm treatment iwp values varied between 13 5 and 8 4 kg m3 in general except for the m treatment iwp values were greater than wp values the lower iwp value than wp in the m treatment was due to the fact that fruit yield in the non irrigated treatment was taken into consideration while calculating iwp values for each treatment therefore the iwp value of melon decreased when the plants were irrigated during only the fruit swelling maturity period in arid and semi arid regions achieving the maximum benefit per unit of water is aimed in this regard for water saving in arid and semi arid regions about 47 of water saving could be achieved when the plants were not irrigated between flowering and fruit swelling period therefore with less strong pressure on water resources the larger size of lands could be irrigated with the available water resources 3 4 principal component analysis for the overall assessment of yield and quality parameters experimental data were subjected to principal component analysis pca two principal components pc1 and pc2 with an eigenvalues of greater than 1 0 explained 83 5 of the total variation table 8 such a high explained variance ratio of the first two principal components indicated that yield and quality parameters could strongly be explained with pca the first principal component pc1 explaining 71 0 of the total variation exhibited significant positive correlations with fruit yield number of fruits per plant average fruit weight length width and irrigation depth on the other hand the second principal component pc2 explaining 12 5 of the total variation had significant positive correlations with ph seed yield length width and 1000 seed weight a loading plot was drawn using the pc1 and pc2 to display the relationship between the yield and quality traits fig 6a in this plot vector angles narrower than 90o indicate a positive correlation while vector angles of 90o and wider indicate no correlation and negative correlation respectively in this regard there were significant positive correlations among fruit yield number of fruits per plant fruit weight length width rind thickness flesh thickness seed yield width and irrigation depth similarly ssc ph 1000 seed weight and seed length exhibited significant positive correlations several researchers used pca loadings plot and score plots for genetic classification and the assessment of fruit yield and quality parameters and achieved promising results di vaio et al 2015 kyriacou et al 2016 seymen et al 2019 yavuz et al 2020 in the present study loadings and score plots yielded significant results for the assessment of yield and quality parameters fig 6b there were four different sections in the score plot drawn using pc1 and pc2 vfm treatment was placed in the positive region of pc1 and pc2 the vf and fm treatments were also placed into the same region as the vfm treatment in other words treatments placed in this region were those in which water stress was not applied during the flowering fruit set period when the score and loading plots were assessed together vfm vf and fm treatments had high values of fruit yield number of fruits per plant fruit length rind thickness seed yield and seed width such findings indicated that melon should be irrigated during the flowering fruit set period the v treatment in which irrigation was applied only in the vegetative development period as well as the non irrigated treatment were located in the negative pc1 and positive pc2 and had high ssc and ph values the m treatment in which irrigation was applied after the fruit swelling period was placed in the negative region of pc1 and pc2 and did not have any significant effect on yield and quality traits of melon 4 conclusion in this study the higher fruit yield 52 9 t ha was obtained in the non stressed vfm treatment which was significantly different from the water stress treatments as compared to the vfm treatment decreases in fruit yields varied between 29 in water stress treatment fm and 84 in non irrigated treatment additionally since ky values of melon were higher than 1 0 for the whole growing 1 30 season and at various growth stages 1 05 2 14 the melon was considered sensitive to the water stress in other words in the arid and semi arid regions the melon should be irrigated during all growth periods to prevent yield losses however in the overall assessment of the data for yield and its components the principal component analysis revealed that vf and fm stress treatments had a close performance to the non stressed vfm treatment with regard to irrigation water productivity iwp as compared to vfm treatment vm treatment provided about 47 water saving on the other hand significant decreases were observed in fruit yields of v f and m treatments in which irrigation was practiced only in an individual phenological stage and water stress was applied in the other two periods in arid and semi arid regions with limited water resources efficient water use is a significant challenge for sustainable agriculture therefore vf vm and fm treatments with only one phenological stage submitted to water stress could be applied in irrigation programs which are sustainable water management strategies for the cultivation of melon in arid and semi arid regions to reduce the pressure on water resources declaration of competing interest the authors

10219,in arid and semi arid regions plant responses to water deficits at different phenological stages should be investigated for efficient use of water resources and sustainable irrigation management this study was conducted under the regional conditions in the konya province with a semi arid climate for two years 2016 17 to determine the effects of irrigation applied at different growth stages on yield and quality traits of melon cucumis melo l cv dardanos thus a total of eight different irrigation treatments were implemented at three different growth stages of melon from planting to flowering v flowering to fruit swelling f and fruit swelling to harvesting m these treatments were specified as single stage irrigation v f and m two stage irrigation vf vm and fm irrigation for the whole season vfm stress free and non irrigated the seasonal total water consumption varied between 129 7 and 418 5 mm in 2016 and between 161 8 and 428 6 mm in 2017 the greatest fruit yield 52 9 t ha was obtained from stress free vfm treatment however significant decreases were observed in fruit yields for other treatments when yield and quality traits were assessed together principal component analysis pca revealed that vf and fm treatments had similar values to vfm treatment with regard to irrigation water productivity iwp there were no significant differences between vm and vfm treatments and vm treatment provided about 47 water saving on the other hand significant decreases were observed in fruit yields of v f and m treatments in which irrigation and the water stress were applied during only a single phenological stage and the other two periods respectively since the yield response factor ky for the whole growing season of melon was greater than 1 0 1 30 the melon was considered sensitive to water stress under semi arid climatic conditions in conclusion two stage irrigation treatments vf vm and fm could be applied in well scheduled irrigation programs of melon for efficient use of water resources and sustainable irrigation management in arid and semi arid regions keywords drip irrigation phenological period irrigation water productivity yield response factor principal component analysis 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions there is a lack of sufficient precipitation and rainfall is not equally distributed throughout the whole growing season the rapid depletion of available water resources and the increasing demands of domestic and industrial sectors have emphasized the need for water conservation in agriculture fernandez et al 2002 deng et al 2006 therefore in these regions irrigation is an essential component of sustainable agriculture for optimal plant growth and yield irrigation has made significant contributions to the development of agricultural practices and crop yield and quality the konya plain has an annual precipitation of 323 mm and a semi arid climate with limited water resources it constitutes about 8 of available arable lands of turkey yavuz et al 2015 the average annual precipitation throughout the growing season may october is only 100 mm while total evaporation during this period is about 1150 mm therefore irrigation is essential for optimal crop yield and quality in the konya plain in this region the largest percentage of water consumption in agriculture is supplied by groundwater aquifers thus groundwater levels are decreasing rapidly and groundwater quality is suffering due to insufficient water resources dry farming is practiced in over 1 3 million ha of konya plain yavuz et al 2020 therefore the efficient use of scarce water resources for sustainable water management for agriculture in the konya plain is a serious challenge the cropping pattern in this region should be altered in this regard instead of high water consuming species like sugar beet maize and carrot economically valuable and low water consuming species like melon should be cultivated in semi arid regions like the konya plain melon cucumis melo l is a fruit of high consumption grown in various parts of the world it is also an excellent nutritional source due to its phytochemical constituents the substances such as cucurbitacin β lithium and zinc in melon fruits which play an essential role in the prevention of cancer and ulcer boost the immune system lester 1997 melon is mainly grown in open fields around 27 3 million tons of melon are produced in over 1 05 million ha area worldwide turkey with an average annual production of 1 75 million tons ranked the second largest melon producer in the world after china with about 6 4 of the world s melon production faostat 2020 in arid and semi arid areas scarce water resources and high energy costs result in less income per unit of area for the farmers in these regions the majority of energy consumption for crop production comes from irrigation practices yavuz et al 2016 topak et al 2010 water deficits and high energy costs led both producers and water management authorities to reduce agricultural water use and manage water resources more efficiently thus deficit irrigation di strategies have emerged to increase water savings in agriculture di strategies improve water use efficiency thereby allowing a higher yield per unit of irrigation water applied costa et al 2007 fereres and soriano 2007 in this method plants are exposed to water stress either throughout the whole growing season or during certain growth stages english and raja 1996 some researchers suggested that melon should be irrigated throughout the whole growing season yıldırım et al 2009 şengül 2009 similarly mishra et al 2017 stated that the melon should not be exposed to water stress to obtain the maximum yield in contrast some researchers have reported the highest fruit yield under mild water stress al mefleh et al 2012 da silva et al 2007 however melon exhibits different responses to water stress applied at different growth stages in different regions one study conducted in spain found that water stress applied during the flowering period negatively influenced the fruit yield and quality of muskmelon cv piel de sapo but did not affect fruit yield during the ripening period fabeiro et al 2002 another study carried out by wang et al 2017 in china under dry climate conditions reported that for the cultivation of melon cv huanghemi 3 soil moisture content based on field capacity to initiate irrigation should not drop below a threshold value of 55 during the flowering fruit set period and 65 in the fruit enlargement period the yield response factor is commonly used to assess plant response to water stress according to doorenbos and kassam 1979 ky 1 indicates the plant sensitivity to water stress and ky 1 indicates the plant tolerance to water deficit therefore it is necessary to determine yield response factors of melon during different growth periods in semi arid regions water yield relations of the melon should be investigated to adopt appropriate irrigation programs and water saving technologies in arid and semi arid regions with scarce water resources therefore this study was conducted to determine yield and quality traits water consumption water productivity and irrigation water productivity of melon exposed to water stress applied at different phenological stages and to determine yield response factors during specific growth stages under central anatolian conditions in a semi arid climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 climate and soil characteristics of the studied site the present study was conducted at the experimental field of sarıcalar research and implementation center of selçuk university in 2016 and 2017 the experimental site located at 38ο 05 north latitudes and 32ο 36 east longitudes has an average altitude of 1006 m in both the years climate data from the seedling planting to fruit harvesting were acquired from an automatic weather station davis vantage pro2 placed in the research site and long term data were obtained from the konya regional directorate of meteorology table 1 total precipitation throughout the vegetation period was 51 4 mm in 2016 and 91 0 mm in 2017 during the vegetative growth period of melon all the precipitation 51 4 mm and precipitation of 80 73 2 mm occurred in 2016 and 2017 respectively and most of the precipitation occurred before the first irrigation in both the years there was no rainfall during other stages of growth flowering and maturation in 2016 and the rainfall during flowering and maturation stages in 2017 was insignificant moreover the mean precipitation during the whole vegetation period of melon is about 80 mm according to long term records average of 56 years in the region therefore there is no difference in mean precipitation between a long term experiment and the current experiment similarly the average temperature relative humidity and wind speed values did not exhibit remarkable differences based on both experimental durations and long term climate data the physical and chemical characteristics of experimental soils are presented in table 2 soil texture classes from the top to bottom layers varied from silty clay loam to clay total available water taw was 148 8 mm and soil ph values and organic matter contents varied between 7 70 and 7 98 and between 0 93 and 1 55 at 0 90 cm soil profile respectively experimental soils were suitable for the cultivation of melon in terms of both physical and chemical characteristics 2 2 water resources and irrigation system irrigation water was supplied by a deep well located around 50 m away from the studied site irrigation water quality was identified as a c2s1 class irrigation water was applied to the experimental field using a drip irrigation system composed of 16 mm drip lines with 4 l h drippers operating at 100 kpa main and manifold lines were composed of 63 and 32 mm pe pipes respectively flow meters 3 4 in were installed at the plot inlet to control the volume of irrigation water applied to plots 2 3 plant material the cultivar kırkağaç type dardanos f1 of melon widely grown in open fields of the region was used as the plant material in the study dardanos f1 is a high yielding hybrid cultivar suitable for cultivation in open fields it has a strong root system and elliptical fruits with green and yellow spotted rind the fruit flesh is thick and white and has a higher soluble solids content ssc fruits are highly resistant to transportation conditions and have a thick rind 2 4 the design of the drip irrigation system and plot sizes to determine dripper spacing and percentage of wetted area trials were conducted based on soil characteristics with a lateral line and dripper discharge rate of 4 l h operated at 100 kpa pressure the wetted diameter at a depth of 30 cm was 88 cm the percentage of wetted area at around 30 cm under the single dripper could be calculated by dividing the width of the wetted line with lateral spacing keller and bliesner 1990 yıldırım 2003 in the present experiments the wetted area percentage was 44 88 cm 200 cm x100 dripper spacing of 40 cm was selected based on soil characteristics and dripper discharge a drip irrigation system was installed in the field for two years before planting melon seedlings lateral pipes of 5 m long were placed in 5 m experimental plots with four plant rows in each plot and a lateral spacing of 2 m there was a distance of about 3 m between the blocks and plots in each plot twenty melon seedlings were planted with 2 m row spacing and 1 m on row plant spacing and a lateral line was placed for each plant row fig 1 2 5 experimental treatments there were eight different irrigation treatments table 3 applied at three different phenological stages from planting to flowering v flowering to fruit swelling f and swelling to harvest m treatments included irrigation in a single period v f and m irrigation in two periods vf vm and fm irrigation in all three periods vfm non stressed and non irrigated in all three periods vfm was considered as the control treatment and all parameters at different phenological stages were determined based on this control treatment a period of v started during planting and ended at about 50 flowering the period of f started during 50 flowering and ended when the first five fruits reached about 15 cm vertical diameters the period of m started with ending the f period and ended at the harvesting time 2 6 phenological durations melon vegetative development period flowering fruit set period and fruit swelling maturation period are presented in table 4 in both the years periods of flowering fruit set and fruit swelling maturation periods had the same durations however in 2017 the vegetative development period was nine days longer than in 2016 and a larger number of rainy days especially during the vegetation period in june and lower temperatures inhibited plant growth which resulted in a prolonged the vegetative development period for about 8 10 d however this situation did not negatively affect the yield and its components in other words no significant differences were found between trials for two years 2 7 agronomic practices around 2 3 days before planting dap diammonium phosphate fertilizer at a rate of 200 kg ha was applied and incorporated into the soil with a rototiller moreover using a drip irrigation system 50 kg ha pure nitrogen was applied melon seedlings were planted on the 11th of may in 2016 and the 15th of may in 2017 for healthy growth and development after planting 20 mm of water was applied in both the years disease and pest control practices were adopted as necessary throughout the vegetation period before the harvesting the margins of plots were removed and fruit harvesting was carried out on september 1 and 6 in 2016 and on september 12 and 18 in 2017 2 8 irrigation water amount and plant water consumption vfm control treatment was considered for the determination of irrigation timing and the amount of irrigation water applied to each treatment in the control treatment irrigation was initiated when the total available water taw at 0 90 cm soil profile dropped to about 50 55 p 0 50 0 55 and the amount of available water was at field capacity for each irrigation soil moisture content was measured by the gravimetric method from samples taken from 0 to 30 30 60 60 90 and 90 120 cm soil depths using an auger before each irrigation in each irrigation the soil moisture deficit at 0 90 cm depth root zone was multiplied by the plot size 40 m2 and the wetted area percentage 0 44 to obtain the amount of irrigation water in liters applied to the control treatment in other experimental treatments considering the growth stages during which plants were exposed to water stress table 3 irrigation was practiced at the same time and the same amount of water was applied to the control treatment plant water consumption et was calculated based on the soil water budget equation james 1988 units are in mm 1 e t i r d p c p r f δ s where i the amount of applied irrigation water r effective rainfall dp deep percolation calculated according to the gravimetric method from samples taken from 90 to 120 cm soil depths before and after the irrigation cp capillary rise δs the difference in soil moisture content between planting and harvesting rf surface runoff since there was no seepage below 90 cm soil depth deep percolation was assumed to be zero since the research site did not have any drainage and salinity problems the capillary rise was not taken into consideration and surface runoff was also not taken into account because drip irrigation was used in this study the irrigation water compensation was calculated using eq 2 howell et al 1990 2 i r c i e t x 100 where irc the irrigation water compensation i total irrigation depth mm and et seasonal plant water consumption 2 9 yield response factor ky water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity iwp the relationship between plant water consumption and fruit yields was determined with the following eq 3 developed by doorenbos and kassam

subjected to tests of homogeneity of variance and error variances for the years were found to be homogeneous therefore the combined analysis of variance was applied to experimental data of two years significant differences were compared using the lsd test at a 5 significance level the analysis of variance and lsd tests were conducted using the spss 22 0 software principal component analysis pca allowing the overall assessment of yield and yield components was performed with the jmp 10software 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation water productivity et and yield the amount of irrigation water applied in experimental treatments precipitation measured throughout the growing season plant water consumption et and the irrigation water compensation i rc are given in table 5 the total amount of irrigation water applied in experimental treatments varied between 20 and 340 mm in 2016 and between 20 and 318 mm in 2017 when both years were assessed together a higher amount of irrigation water was applied in vfm treatment considering the irrigation in two periods a higher volume of irrigation water was applied in fm treatment while for single period irrigation f treatment received a larger amount of irrigation water total precipitation throughout the growing season was 51 4 mm in 2016 and 91 0 mm in 2017 in 2016 the whole rainfall occurred in the vegetative development period whereas in the other periods no precipitation was captured in 2017 total precipitation values during the vegetative development flowering fruit set and fruit swelling maturation periods were 73 2 5 8 mm and 12 mm respectively plant water consumption values varied between 129 7 and 418 5 mm in 2016 and between 161 8 and 428 6 mm in 2017 in both the years the highest plant water consumption was recorded in vfm treatment in a study carried out by şensoy et al 2007 on the effect of different irrigation levels on melon plant water consumption of 637 mm was obtained for full irrigation treatment on the other hand the maximum plant water consumption values of melon were reported to be 599 2 mm kuşçu 2017 and 604 7 mm şengül 2009 in this study plant water consumption in a full irrigation treatment was lower than that obtained from the previous studies which can be attributed to differences in climate soil cultivar and especially irrigation method and schedule however some other studies on water yield relations of melon reported similar findings to those of the present study for instance in a region of spain with an annual average precipitation of 400 mm water consumption of melon was 419 5 mm cabello et al 2009 on the other hand dogan et al 2008 conducted a two year study and reported the highest yields for the treatments which received 311 and 370 mm irrigation water in the first and second year respectively lower yields were obtained in treatments with larger or smaller amounts of irrigation water similarly fabeiro et al 2002 stated that the amount of irrigation water should not exceed 400 mm for the optimal yield of melon under semi arid climatic conditions in spain wang et al 2017 conducted a study under dry climatic conditions in china at different phenological stages of melon and reported seasonal plant water consumption between 251 9 and 335 7 mm in different treatments the irrigation water i rc compensation in full irrigation treatment vfm was 81 in 2016 and 74 in 2017 table 5 in previous studies on water yield relations in full irrigation treatment irc values were 82 in pumpkin yavuz et al 2015 88 in sugar beet topak et al 2016 and 89 in sunflower yavuz et al 2019 these findings indicate that in melon and other plants irrigation water compensates for the majority of plant water consumption in semi arid areas a graph was drawn to present the amount of irrigation water et precipitation and yields together fig 2 as shown in this graph the highest yield 52 9 t ha was obtained in vfm treatment without water stress with a significant difference with other treatments according to the results of the lsd test p 0 05 as compared to the vfm treatment decreases in fruit yields varied between 29 in water stress treatment fm and 84 in non irrigated treatment among the treatments with irrigation in two periods the highest yield was obtained in the fm treatment 37 6 t ha moreover differences in yields of vf and vm treatments were not significant among single period irrigation treatments with the water stress applied during the other two periods the highest yield 26 7 t ha was obtained in the f treatment the differences in yields of v and m treatments were not significant but remarkable reductions 66 67 were observed in fruit yields obtained from these treatments as compared to the control treatment in general decreased fruit yields were observed with reducing irrigation water quantities fig 2 cabello et al 2009 reported that full irrigation treatment produced the highest yield 37 2 t ha while the yield reduction of about 22 was observed in 40 water deficit treatment under mediterranean climate conditions likewise the highest yield 69 7 t ha was obtained in full irrigation whereas deficit irrigation caused significant yield losses in the marmara region kuşçu 2017 sharma et al 2014 conducted a study in the usa texas and reported the highest yield 77 1 t ha in the full irrigation treatment and about 30 of yield reduction in 50 water deficit treatment the findings reveal significant yield reductions in melon with deficit irrigation the apparent effect of irrigation could be clearly seen when comparing the full irrigation and non irrigated treatments as compared to vfm treatment without water stress the yield reduction of about 84 was observed in non irrigated treatment in other words in semi arid regions like the konya plain a 6 fold increase in melon yield could be achieved under full irrigation fig 2 3 2 yield components the number of fruits per plant average fruit weight length width soluble solids content ssc and ph values are given in table 6 irrigation at different periods significantly influenced the number of fruits per plant and the greatest value was obtained in the vfm treatment but its difference with that of the fm treatment receiving irrigation not only during the vegetative development period was not significant previous studies reported a decreased number of fruits per plant under drought salinity and other abiotic stress factors botia et al 2005 tedeschi et al 2011 sharma et al 2014 rad et al 2017 pereira et al 2017 observed that the numbers of fruits per plant in melon irrigated with saline irrigation water ranged from 1 1 to 3 9 the number of fruits per plant may also vary with the melon cultivars hybrid cultivars generally produce the greater numbers of fruits per plant and thus higher yields in the present study dardanos f1 which is a hybrid cultivar had a high fruit set similar to the findings of previous studies water stress applied in different periods negatively influenced the number of fruits per plant in the present study there were significant differences in fruit weight and length between experimental treatments and the best results were achieved in vfm treatment water stress applied in different growth periods negatively influenced the fruit weight which is closely related to total yields and therefore decreased fruit weights caused significant decreases in the total yield al mefleh et al 2012 reported a positive correlation between the amount of applied irrigation water and fruit weight in melon zeng et al 2009 conducted a study on the influence of deficit irrigation on melon and reported decreased fruit lengths with reducing the quantity of irrigation water fruits width varied from 15 0 to 18 5 cm the vfm vm and fm were placed in the same treatment groups irrigation applied during fruit swelling to harvesting had positive effects on fruit width in a previous study with different melon genotypes average and the greatest fruit width values of 12 3 and 15 8 cm were reported respectively rad et al 2017 soluble solids content ssc values varied between 10 9 and 13 3 and greater ssc values were observed in water stress treatments both non irrigated treatment and the v treatment with irrigation applied only in the vegetative development period and without irrigation in the other two periods had high ssc values doğan et al 2008 reported the greatest brix value in melon 12 1 in the non irrigated treatment brix values between 11 7 and 12 5 12 8 14 3 and 10 4 11 7 were observed by hartz 1997 li et al 2012 and cabello et al 2009 respectively in studies on the water yield relation of melon greater brix values were found at higher stress levels akrami and arzani 2019 conducted a study in iran and reported that salt stress negatively influenced the yield performance of melon but enhanced the taste of fruits similar findings were observed in the present study as in treatment with water stress applied especially during the fruit swelling and maturation periods as well as non irrigated treatment brix values increased the ph values of experimental treatments did not vary much and therefore the differences in ph values were not significant table 6 cabello et al 2009 reported ph values of 5 54 5 65 in melon at different irrigation levels indicating that differences in ph values of irrigation treatments were not significant rind and flesh thickness seed yield per fruit 1000 seed weight and seed length and width values are given in table 7 differences in rind thickness 1000 seed weight and seed width values of the experimental treatments were not significant fruit flesh thickness varied between 24 3 and 35 3 mm and had the highest values in the fm treatment with water stress applied only during the vegetative development period as well as vfm vm and f treatments in general flesh thickness values decreased with decreasing the quantities of irrigation water doğan et al 2008 observed the flesh thickness values of 34 46 mm under different irrigation levels and also reported decreased flesh thickness values in water deficit treatments similarly li et al 2012 reported flesh thickness values between 19 3 and 23 8 mm under different irrigation water levels and decreased flesh thicknesses with increasing water stress in another study conducted on galia type melon irrigated with saline water significant decreases in flesh thickness were reported with an increasing salt concentration of irrigation water del amor et al 1999 seed yield per fruit varied between 22 5 and 35 8 g with the highest value in the vfm treatment there were no significant differences in seed yields between vfm vf fm and v treatments the irrigation applied especially during the vegetative development and flowering fruit set periods had a significant effect on seed yield per fruit drought is a significant factor limiting plant growth development and productivity the water stress applied at various stages of seed development significantly influenced seed yield and quality dornbos et al 1989 smiciklas et al 1992 heatherly 1993 egli et al 2005 in another study on the pumpkin water stress treatments negatively influenced seed yields yavuz et al 2015 the greatest seed length 11 2 cm was obtained in the non irrigated treatment followed by v and vf treatments seed length decreased in the water stress treatment applied in the vegetative development period similarly çiftçi 2013 reported that the seed length of melon varied between 11 55 and 12 00 mm and deficit irrigation did not have any significant effects on seed length the seed lengths of different melon genotypes ranged from 9 14 to 11 55 mm tur 2016 3 3 water yield relations the total amount of irrigation water applied to each treatment and the relationship between plant water consumption and fruit yields are graphically presented in fig 3 in both the years separately 2016 and 2017 and the average of two years there were linear relationships among the amount of irrigation water plant water consumption and fruit yield at the 99 confidence level the equations and coefficients of determination are presented in the figure similarly kırnak et al 2005 reported the strong linear relationship between fruit yield and plant water consumption of melon yield response factors k y indicating the effects of the relative decrease in plant water consumption on the relative reduction in fruit yield were determined for both the whole growing season and different growth periods fig 4 therefore relationships between seasonal plant water consumption in different irrigation treatments and fruit yields were investigated using the regression analysis since both years had similar plant water consumption and fruit yield values of both the years were homogeneous the average values of fruit yield for 2016 and 2017 were used in ky calculations the ky value for the whole growing season was 1 30 fig 4 in previous studies conducted in the same region ky values were 1 08 for the pumpkin yavuz et al 2015 and 1 12 for watermelon yavuz et al 2020 in central anatolia the grafted and ungrafted sinem f1 hybrid cultivar had the ky values of 1 2 and 1 1 respectively keskin 2016 the greatest ky value 2 14 was obtained in the vf treatment with water stress applied during the fruit swelling maturity period in other words significant decreases were observed in fruit yield when irrigations were made in the vegetative development and flowering fruit set and water stress was applied in the fruit swelling maturity periods similarly high ky value of 1 96 was obtained for the plants treated with water stress during the vegetative development period fig 4 doorenbos and kassam 1979 indicated that when the k y 1 plants are considered sensitive to water deficit therefore since k y values of melon were higher than 1 0 during the whole growing season as well as specific growth periods the melon was considered sensitive to water stress under semi arid climate conditions water productivity wp a significant indicator of water yield relations which is expressed as the benefit per unit water and irrigation water productivity iwp values are presented in fig 5 the greatest wp value 12 5 kg m3 was obtained in the vfm treatment followed by the vm treatment iwp values varied between 13 5 and 8 4 kg m3 in general except for the m treatment iwp values were greater than wp values the lower iwp value than wp in the m treatment was due to the fact that fruit yield in the non irrigated treatment was taken into consideration while calculating iwp values for each treatment therefore the iwp value of melon decreased when the plants were irrigated during only the fruit swelling maturity period in arid and semi arid regions achieving the maximum benefit per unit of water is aimed in this regard for water saving in arid and semi arid regions about 47 of water saving could be achieved when the plants were not irrigated between flowering and fruit swelling period therefore with less strong pressure on water resources the larger size of lands could be irrigated with the available water resources 3 4 principal component analysis for the overall assessment of yield and quality parameters experimental data were subjected to principal component analysis pca two principal components pc1 and pc2 with an eigenvalues of greater than 1 0 explained 83 5 of the total variation table 8 such a high explained variance ratio of the first two principal components indicated that yield and quality parameters could strongly be explained with pca the first principal component pc1 explaining 71 0 of the total variation exhibited significant positive correlations with fruit yield number of fruits per plant average fruit weight length width and irrigation depth on the other hand the second principal component pc2 explaining 12 5 of the total variation had significant positive correlations with ph seed yield length width and 1000 seed weight a loading plot was drawn using the pc1 and pc2 to display the relationship between the yield and quality traits fig 6a in this plot vector angles narrower than 90o indicate a positive correlation while vector angles of 90o and wider indicate no correlation and negative correlation respectively in this regard there were significant positive correlations among fruit yield number of fruits per plant fruit weight length width rind thickness flesh thickness seed yield width and irrigation depth similarly ssc ph 1000 seed weight and seed length exhibited significant positive correlations several researchers used pca loadings plot and score plots for genetic classification and the assessment of fruit yield and quality parameters and achieved promising results di vaio et al 2015 kyriacou et al 2016 seymen et al 2019 yavuz et al 2020 in the present study loadings and score plots yielded significant results for the assessment of yield and quality parameters fig 6b there were four different sections in the score plot drawn using pc1 and pc2 vfm treatment was placed in the positive region of pc1 and pc2 the vf and fm treatments were also placed into the same region as the vfm treatment in other words treatments placed in this region were those in which water stress was not applied during the flowering fruit set period when the score and loading plots were assessed together vfm vf and fm treatments had high values of fruit yield number of fruits per plant fruit length rind thickness seed yield and seed width such findings indicated that melon should be irrigated during the flowering fruit set period the v treatment in which irrigation was applied only in the vegetative development period as well as the non irrigated treatment were located in the negative pc1 and positive pc2 and had high ssc and ph values the m treatment in which irrigation was applied after the fruit swelling period was placed in the negative region of pc1 and pc2 and did not have any significant effect on yield and quality traits of melon 4 conclusion in this study the higher fruit yield 52 9 t ha was obtained in the non stressed vfm treatment which was significantly different from the water stress treatments as compared to the vfm treatment decreases in fruit yields varied between 29 in water stress treatment fm and 84 in non irrigated treatment additionally since ky values of melon were higher than 1 0 for the whole growing 1 30 season and at various growth stages 1 05 2 14 the melon was considered sensitive to the water stress in other words in the arid and semi arid regions the melon should be irrigated during all growth periods to prevent yield losses however in the overall assessment of the data for yield and its components the principal component analysis revealed that vf and fm stress treatments had a close performance to the non stressed vfm treatment with regard to irrigation water productivity iwp as compared to vfm treatment vm treatment provided about 47 water saving on the other hand significant decreases were observed in fruit yields of v f and m treatments in which irrigation was practiced only in an individual phenological stage and water stress was applied in the other two periods in arid and semi arid regions with limited water resources efficient water use is a significant challenge for sustainable agriculture therefore vf vm and fm treatments with only one phenological stage submitted to water stress could be applied in irrigation programs which are sustainable water management strategies for the cultivation of melon in arid and semi arid regions to reduce the pressure on water resources declaration of competing interest the authors
