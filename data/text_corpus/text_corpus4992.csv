24960,many areas on the earth are facing the threat of ecological degradation and unreasonable economic development has further exacerbated environmental problems constructing ecological security patterns based on an ecological network is such an integrated approach to protecting regional ecological sustainability this paper selected denko county of bayannaoer city inner mongolia which is located in the desert oasis area as the study area ecological sources were identified through ecosystem importance assessment and interaction force theory was used to model ecosystem processes in heterogeneous landscapes via comparing the minimum cumulative ecological resistance and the maximum ecological gravity between ecological sources and thus to identify ecological corridors and to constructing forest grass ecological network fg eco network of the study area this paper also set 11 development scenarios to study the impact of different development strategies on the fg ecological network moreover the complex network theory was used to analyze the topology and statistical characteristics of the fg eco network in 11 development scenarios the results show that the ecological network in the study area has been gradually destroyed with the increase of the proportion of economic development in the development scenario the connection between some ecological patches has changed and the connectivity and coreness pagerank etc have gradually decreased the study found that the network density increases slightly in the 0 9 0 1 mode while it gradually decreases in other scenarios with the increase of the proportion of economic development moreover in the 0 9 0 1 mode although the destruction occurred at the edge of the desert the fg eco network within the sample circle expanded this represents that economic development does not necessarily lead to the deterioration of the ecological environment in this area under the existing natural conditions the study area still has room for economic development but space is limited based on the interaction force theory this study provides a new approach to identifying the ecological network also the development scenarios set up in this study can provide a reference for sustainable development keywords multi scene simulation ecological resistance fg eco network desert oasis area ecological gravity 1 introduction the ecosystem is the material basis for human survival and development it is also the life support system of human beings hooper et al 2005 the survival and development of human beings depend on the stability and health of the ecosystem however over the past century the scale and intensity of land use and exploitation have increased dramatically particularly in arid regions this increased exploitation eventually led to serious damage to the structure and function of ecosystems resulting in a series of ecological problems such as a sharp decline in biodiversity myers et al 2000 soil degradation zika et al 2017 and desertification in arid regions as the transition zones between water deficient deserts and water rich farmland systems desert oasis ecotones play a key role in ensuring regional ecological security and maintaining regional internal stabilization however they are also fragile systems and can be modified easily by development strategy changes sawut et al 2013 for a long time the ecological security and sustainable development of desert oasis ecotone have been the focus of scientific research the ecological security pattern in arid areas is of great significance for maintaining regional ecological security and sustainable development as a key component of regional ecological security pattern the ecological network connects isolated landscape patches through ecological corridors from the perspective of the ecological network the process of land desertification is the process of destroying ecological nodes and ecological corridors in ecological networks zhang et al 2009 in this process the integrity and ecological functions of the network structure are continuously declining and the channels of material and energy transmission in the network are gradually blocked ishiyama et al 2018 the ecological network connects the isolated ecological patches in the desert oasis ecotone through linear corridors which constitute a spatial ecological security pattern that combines point line and surface enhancing the ability of landscape self regulation maintaining the stability of the regional ecological environment and resisting the risk of desertification niu 2009 at present the construction of an ecological network has formed one research paradigm including the identification of the ecological source and ecological corridor it mainly identifies the ecological source by assessing ecological suitability ecological importance or ecological connectivity su et al 2016 teng et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 among these methods ecological importance evaluation is the most common li et al 2010 liang et al 2018 lin et al 2016 the method of identifying ecological corridor through constructing the resistance surface mcrae 2006 which is commonly based on the value assignment of land cover keeley et al 2016 additionally the least cost path analysis is often used to extract ecological corridors adriaensen et al 2003 doetzer rosot et al 2018 although these studies considered the hindrance of landscape heterogeneity to ecological flow they neglected the attraction between ecological sources and did not consider the interaction between ecological sources the application of gravitational model in spatial interaction provides a way of thinking for studying the interaction between ecological sources in this paper the gravitational model was first applied to the study of spatial structure between cities cao et al 2018 and was later widely used to study regional economy meng and lu 2011 urban group interaction chen 2009 and inter city trade studies gordillo et al 2010 at present gravity models have been widely used in the study of regional economic linkages or spatial interactions based on the interaction force theory the improved mcr model and gravity model are used to extract the fg ecological network of the study area by comparing the minimum cumulative ecological resistance and the maximum ecological gravity between ecological sources however the ecological network is dynamic it is a fragile system which is affected by both natural conditions and economic activities fath et al 2017 different development strategies will have different impacts on the ecological environment whether economic priority or ecological priority policymakers need to use scientific and evidence based scenario models to study regional characteristics and fully assess the impact of different development strategies whether they focus on economic growth or environmental protection sustainable development can be achieved by formulating development strategies adapted to local conditions in arid areas the contradiction between economic development and ecological development is dualistic and difficult to coordinate christina et al 2012 economic activities are the primary obstacles to ecological development therefore based on the current state of the natural environment by adjusting the proportion of economic development and ecological protection in the development strategy namely increase the proportion of the economy reduce the proportion of ecological protection to explore the impact of different development strategies on ecological networks and the possibility of economic development in the study area therefore it is of great significance to simulate the ecological network of the study area in multiple scenarios this paper set up a variety of development scenarios to simulate and analyze the evolution characteristics of the current ecological network it is not only helpful to explore the development strategies suitable for arid areas but also helpful for policy makers to adjust the relevant planning and social development strategies in the region to promote regional sustainable development however the evolution of the ecological network is different from the evolution of land use it is not only affected by the ecological matrix but also by the interaction between ecological patches therefore a quantitative description of the interaction between ecological patches is very important for the evolution simulation of the ecological network the ecological network is complex analysis of the ecological network using the complex theory is one of the frontier directions in this field hoctor et al 2000 therefore this paper took the typical desert oasis ecotone in northwestern china as the study area using the gravity model and minimum cumulative resistance mcr model to extract the forest grass ecological network fg ecological network in the study area ecological sources which were identified through ecosystem importance assessment the minimum cumulative ecological resistance between ecological sources was calculated by using the improved ecological resistance model and the improved ecological gravitation model was used to calculate the ecological gravitation between ecological sources based on the interaction force theory the ecological corridor is identified by comparing the resultant forces among different ecological sources one by one additionally a variety of scenarios of development strategies have been set up by adjusting the proportion of economic and ecological protection in the development strategy the impact of different development strategies on the ecological network and the possibility of economic development in the study area have been explored the topology analysis and spatial structure analysis of the forest and grass ecological networks in the study area were analyzed using complex network analysis methods this paper hopes to provide a new method for the simulation of ecological network and a new perspective for the study of economic development and ecological environment protection in arid areas to provide a reference and guide for arid areas ecological protection policy making and planning and also to provide theoretical support for sustainable development in arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area 106 7 107 23 e 39 56 40 56 n in this paper is located on the northeastern margin of the ulanbuh desert with an area of 5923 9 km2 the majority of

which is an important grain producing area in china the west side of the study area is the wolf mountain and its southwest is the hinterland of the ulanbuh desert according to the meteorological data for 1983 2016 from the denko desert ecological station which belongs to the national forestry and grassland bureau of china the annual average precipitation in the region is 144 5 mm while the average annual evaporation is 2398 mm the location of the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2 data and processing the remote sensing image of sentinel 2 was used in this paper with a resolution of 20 m the

regions sciences data center at lanzhou http westdc westgis ac cn the ecological life production land spatial planning data was obtained from the denko county ecological environment bureau http www nmgdk gov cn the spatial distribution data of groundwater depth were derived from the research results of ma huan which are the preliminary research results of this study ma et al 2017 2 3 method 2 3 1 identifying ecological network the essence of identifying ecological network is to construct a pattern that contains an integrated network of ecological sources corridors which can well guarantee regional ecosystem services and ecological processes three steps are included in identifying the ecological network in this study the first was to identify ecological sources based on the assessment of the importance of the ecosystem the second was to extract ecological corridors based on interaction force theory the third was to simulate the ecological network the specific framework was shown in fig 2 2 3 1 1 extracting ecological sources the ecological source is high quality and quantity of key ecological patch that provides a variety of ecosystem services maintains the stability of the ecosystem and plays an important role in preventing ecosystem degradation martin et al 2005 therefore ecological sources can be identified by evaluating the importance of the ecosystem this study selected three kinds of landscape types of forest land grassland and water which have important ecological significance to the study area the ecological source was identified by the size of the patch the ndvi means the mndwi means and the shape index patch area was calculated by using arcgis software esri inc redlands ca usa ndvi average and ndwi average were calculated by using zonal statics tools and patch shape index was calculated by using fragstats computer software program produced by the authors at the university of massachusetts amherst available at the following web site http www umass edu landeco research fragstats fragstats html the weights of the patch area ndvi average mndwi average and shape index were determined by entropy method and the ecosystem importance of each landscape patch was evaluated comprehensively then according to the statistical distribution characteristics of the degree of importance of patch ecosystem the top 60 of the patches were selected as the ecological sources 2 3 1 2 interaction between ecological sources a ecological resistance the minimum cumulative resistance model mcr was proposed by the dutch ecologist knappen knaapen et al 1992 li et al 2015 this model was first applied to the diffusion process of species and it can describe the difficulty of species crossing different habitat patches and study the horizontal resistance of species to ecological processes it has since been widely used in landscape pattern analysis to study the effects of landscape heterogeneity on ecological flow albanese and haukos 2017 beier et al 2008 spear et al 2010 the model can be used to measure the magnitude of ecological resistance quantitatively marrotte et al 2014 the formula is 1 v m c r f m i n i 1 j 1 i m j n d i j r i where v m c r represents the value of the minimum cumulative resistance surface f m i n represents the function of the minimum resistance value d i j represents the spatial distance from the source to the landscape unit and r i represents the coefficient of resistance in the process of source movement the mcr model only considers the distance between the ecological source and the matrix characteristics when calculating the resistance this paper improved the mcr model based on the characteristics of the study area we believe that different sources have different ecological energies and their ability to radiate and transmit energy is not only related to their area but also the type and shape of the source at present some scholars have conducted research and discussion on this yu et al 2017 the size of the ecological source will have a strong influence on the material exchange or energy flow urban et al 1987 and its edge can also affect the material energy and future species distribution ewers et al 2007 ribeiro et al 2016 therefore this paper uses a shape index l i ndvi defries and townshend 1994 and mndwi liu et al 2016 to describe the characteristics of the ecological source because the study area is located in an arid area the importance level of the blue source river lake should be higher than that of the green source forest grassland moreover we proposed the concept of ecological source quality to quantitatively evaluate the eco source the definition of the quality of the ecological source is that any ecological source has the property of radiating outward transmitting energy or receiving energy and its quality of ecological resources is related to the area shape and attributes of the source 2 l i e i 2 π a i where l i represents the shape index of the ecological source i e i represents the perimeter of the ecological source i and a i represents the area of the ecological source i 3 m i a i l i i i where m i represents the quality of the ecological source i a i represents the area of the ecological source i l i represents the shape index of the ecological source i and i i represents the average of the normalized index of the ecological source i the improved mcr model considers three factors ecological source quality distance and matrix characteristics the improved formula is 4 v m c r f m i n i 1 j 1 i m j n d i j r j m i where v m c r represents the minimum cumulative resistance value of the ecological source expansion and m i represents the ecological quality of the source i b ecological gravity the gravity model is a model that studies the interaction of two objects or spaces which is derived from newton s law of universal gravitation katsikadelis 2018 in the 19th century scholars introduced the gravity model into the study of geospatial space when studying the interaction of urban systems liu et al 2014 later geographers conducted extensive research on the gravity model pekkanen et al 1997 and used it to analyze the interactions between cities or countries bergstrand 1985 yang and wong 2012 zhang 1989 in 2010 keum demonstrated the usability of gravity models in international trade and tourism keum 2010 in this paper we try to introduce the gravity model into the landscape ecology field and calculate the ecological gravity between the ecological sources because of the differences between the research fields and objects we modified the model so that it can be applied to landscape ecology ecological gravitation is inversely proportional to the square of the minimum cumulative cost distance between them and is proportional to the quality of the source the ecological gravitational model is as follows 5 f i j g α i m i α j m j d i j 2 where f i j represents the ecological gravitation between the source i and the source j d i j 2 represents the spatial distance between the source i and the source j α i α j represents the type of the ecological source i j m i m j represents the ecological quality of the source i j and g represents a constant and is generally expressed as 1 grosche et al 2007 jiang et al 2014 2 3 1 3 fg eco network simulation through eco networks a more stable ecological pattern has been established in arid regions and maintained regional ecological security xue et al 2013 in the ecological network an ecological source is a spatial unit or ecosystem that provides various substances and energy and the ecological corridor is an important channel for energy and material flow the interaction between ecological sources will engender ecological gravity but at the same time it will also be subject to resistance from the matrix as shown in fig 3 detailed algorithm steps of the eco network multi scenario simulation model are as follows 1 calculate the maximum ecological gravity and minimum cumulative resistance between ecological sources when the ecological gravity is greater than the ecological resistance an ecological corridor will be formed between the sources and the ecological flow will be transmitted between the sources through the corridor when the ecological gravity is less than the ecological resistance there will be no ecological corridor between the sources when the ecological gravity equals the ecological resistance the ecological corridor between the sources will be very fragile and slight changes in the matrix may lead to ecological corridor fracture 2 the calculation will not stop until the entire fg eco network source traverse as well as the fg eco network spatial distribution grid simulation results are finally obtained then the spatial distribution of the fg ecological network in the next development scenario is simulated until all scenarios are simulated 2 3 2 multi scenario development program most scholars focus on the study of future development scenarios kraxner et al 2013 however few studies have focused on current natural conditions due to the impact of different development strategies on the ecological environment whether to develop economy first or to protect ecology first especially at the turning point of current urbanization population growth economic prosperity and environmental protection hartmann 1998 it is necessary for policymakers to use scientific and evidence based scenario models to guide future social development and to fully assess the impact of different development strategies whether they focus on economic growth or environmental protection koricheva and kulinskaya 2019 the ecological environment of the study area is extremely fragile and is an important area for desertification control moreover the chinese government has promulgated the strictest ecological protection policy imposing strict restrictions on the economic development of the region which mainly focuses on improving and protecting the ecology since the implementation of the policy is uniform it is often not tailored to local conditions cheng et al 2000 based on the current natural environment situation this study explored the impact of different development strategies on the ecological network and the possibility of economic development in the study area by adjusting the proportion of economic and ecological protection in the development strategy i e increasing the proportion of the economy and reducing the proportion of ecological protection these scenarios not only help to explore development strategies suitable for arid areas but also help policy makers adjust relevant planning and social development strategies in arid areas two basic scenarios were set up 1 current development mode 2 pure economic development mode the development of the research area has both ecological protection and economic development however the ecological environment in this area is extremely fragile and the government restricts economic development by implementing strict ecological protection policies therefore the current development model of the study area can be regarded as a development model based on ecological protection the development strategy of each development scenario is defined as 1 the proportion of ecological protection is expressed in m while n represents the proportion of economic development so that m n 1 when m 1 0 and n 0 1 0 0 represents the current development mode that is the development strategy of the research area with the priority of ecological protection when m 0 and n 1 0 0 1 0 represents a purely economic development mode that is the study area prioritizes the development of the economy by changing the weights of n and m 11 developmental scenarios were obtained 1 0 0 0 9 0 1 0 8 0 2 0 7 0 3 0 6 0 4 0 5 0 5 0 4 0 6 0 3 0 7 0 2 0 8 0 1 0 9 0 1 0 2 3 3 eco network performance analysis in this paper six graph theory indicators for measuring network topology and node importance in complex network analysis were used to reveal the connection characteristics of fg ecological networks of various development strategies which could provide an important reference for the optimization of fg ecological networks the performance of an ecological network is analyzed from network integrity and importance of nodes the characteristics of the network are evaluated by four indicators connectivity c g shanahan and wildie 2012 coreness k g li 2013 density d g lancichinetti and fortunato 2012 average number of nodes connected a g betweenness b i and pagerank p i evaluate the importance of nodes liu et al 2017 1 c g c g represents the connectivity of a complex network including point connectivity and edge connectivity generally speaking the higher the connectivity of a network the better its stability this paper focuses on the point connectivity of eco network and its definition is given below 6 c g min s v s ω g s 2 o r g s i s t r i v i a l g r a p h where v represents the node set of the network g s represents the proper subset of v ω g s represents the number of connected branches in the sub network g s after deleting the point set s from the network g and g s represents the dataset after deleting all nodes in s and all edges associated with it in network g it can be seen that the node connectivity in the network will be the minimum number of nodes deleted if g is not connected or becomes a trivial graph namely a graph with only one node and no edges if c g 0 g can be considered as a disconnected network or a trivial graph when g indicates a complete graph with n nodes c g n 1 2 k g k g represents the maximum coreness of a complex network the coreness of a complex network represents a subset of the remaining network after the nodes with a degree less than k have been removed coreness is a parameter to measure the characteristics of complex networks for example the connectivity the larger the coreness of a network the stronger its connectivity and the robustness of its random faults become the maximum coreness of all nodes in the network is the coreness of the network 3 d g d g represents the tightness of connections between nodes in complex networks the density of the complex network g is defined as 7 d g 2 m n n 1 where m represents the actual number of connections in the network and n represents the number of nodes in the network 4 a g a g represents the average number of nodes connected the number of nodes connected with other nodes in aggregation also known as the average path length the larger the average number of nodes connected the more paths through the network the more complex the network connection 4 b i betweenness can reflect the role and influence of nodes in the whole network this paper focuses on the point betweenness of eco network the betweenness of the node i is defined as 8 b i 1 j l n j i l n j l i n j l where n j l represents the shortest path between nodes v j and v l and njl i represents the number of the shortest path between nodes vj and vi passing through node vi and n represents the total number of nodes in the network 5 p i pagerank can describe the importance of nodes in the network the pagerank of the node i is defined as 9 p i 1 d n d p j m p j w i j p r p j k j where w i j represents the edge weight between node i and node j k j represents the degree of node j d represents the damping coefficient n represents the total number of nodes p r p j represents the pagerank value of node p j p j represents the ecological node and m p j represents the set of all entries of node p j 3 results 3 1 fg ecological network identification 3 1 1 ecological source extraction the patch area shape index and ndvi mndwi of each patch were normalized the weights of each index were calculated by the entropy method in the matlab the weights of each index were 0 5878 0 2539 and 0 1583 respectively the weighted summation calculation was performed by using the calculation results of each index and its weight and the importance degree evaluation result of each patch was obtained as shown in fig 4 a according to the statistical distribution characteristics of the importance degree of each plaque the first 60 of the plaques in the importance ranking were selected as the ecological source and finally 481 ecological sources were obtained the finely divided and isolated plaques were largely removed during the screening process and the core plaques in the landscape unit were retained the extraction results are shown in fig 4b 3 1 2 ecological resistance and ecological gravity simulation a construction of the resistance model the resistance value is not only related to the distance of ecological flow but also is associated with land cover and human disturbance consequently most researches were based on expert experiences to assign resistance values corresponding to land use types keeley et al 2016 in this study an evaluation system of ecological resistance was established from 16 factors including topographic slope vegetation cover hydrological distribution soil land cover government planning distance factor and density factor the factor affecting the resistance value of the matrix consists of two parts on the one hand they are influenced by current natural conditions for example the smaller the ndvi value of the ecological flow the smaller the resistance and otherwise the greater the resistance the closer the distance to the water the easier it is for the ecological source to replenish water and the more favorable it is for the development of the ecological source on the contrary the more unfavorable the development of the ecological source on the other hand economic development as the main cause of interference affecting ecological development will affect the resistance value of some factors and ultimately affect the distribution of the resistance of the matrix in the study area for example the spatial planning of ecological living production land is a mandatory measure implemented by the chinese government to regulate the scope of production and living activities currently this plan has been launched nationwide in the development strategy of priority ecological protection ecological sources and other ecological spaces will be well protected and developed and ecological development is limited to natural conditions while in the development strategy of priority economic development the ecological protection policy that constrains economic development will not play a role and areas with better water conditions and vegetation conditions such as ecological conservation redline eco redline will be used immediately to develop the economy at this time the ecology will be destroyed the resistance of ecological development will suddenly increase and the resistance value of the original town is relatively small the resistance values of each factor are set according to the evaluation system shown in table 1 the impact factors were divided into five levels and their resistance levels were expressed by 1 3 5 7 and 9 respectively the results of each single factor evaluation were made by arcgis software and the comprehensive evaluation results of the ecological resistance surface of the current development model and the pure economic development model were obtained by overlapped grid calculation as shown in fig 5 the ecological resistance surfaces of the current development model 1 0 0 and pure economic development model 0 1 0 are shown in fig 5 the value at each raster location represents the cost per unit distance for moving through the raster in 1 0 0 mode the ecological resistance of the matrix is 17 34 which gradually increases from northeast to southwest the areas with a lower resistance value are mainly located in the northeast because of the abundant water resources near the yellow river while the areas with a higher resistance value are located in the ulanbuh desert near the wolf mountains and on the east bank of the yellow river which is the western margin of the kubuqi desert in this development model the economic development is strictly restricted and the development strategy of ecological protection is given priority so that water resources and forestry and grassland are better protected the ecological sources of the study area and the surrounding areas have lower ecological resistance values in the 0 1 0 model the ecological resistance of the matrix is 22 2 34 water resources are mainly used for agricultural production and industrial manufacturing and are rarely used for ecological construction and protection which causes higher matrix resistance values in the northeast region in areas like the ulanbuh desert in the central part and the frontal alluvial fan of the wolf mountain the matrix resistance is relatively lower the above situation shows that a vigorous development of the economy given the present situation will seriously hinder the flow of ecological flow between sources and affect the development of ecology tables 2 and 3 the minimum cumulative ecological resistance is the minimum cumulative cost of the ecological flow from one ecological source to another to overcome the ecological resistance surface the ecological resistance surface as the resistance coefficient of each landscape unit of the ecological flow in the study area can only represent the resistance value of the ecological flow through a single grid hence based on the improved minimum cumulative resistance surface model the cost distance model was used to calculate the ecological cumulative resistance between different ecological sources the cost distance raster identifies for each cell the minimum cumulative ecological resistance over a cost surface to the identified ecological source locations the minimum cumulative ecological resistance surfaces of the current development model 1 0 0 and pure economic development model 0 1 0 are shown in fig 6 as can be seen from fig 6 a in the 0 1 0 development scenario the maximum cumulative resistance value is 382 673 and the minimum value is 28 459 the areas with large cumulative resistance values are mainly located in the southern ulanbuh desert on the one hand because the ecological and environmental conditions in the region are relatively harsh the resistance values of groundwater depth water density ndvi and other factors are higher on the other hand the ecological landscape of the region is less plaque and farther away from other ecological sources which makes the cumulative value of ecological resistance larger in the northern part of the study area there is also a region with a large cumulative resistance value while the ecological conditions are good at this location the area has cultivated the land which is an ecological barrier with a large resistance value moreover water resources are widely used in agricultural production including groundwater and surface water resulting in lower water supply from ecological sources which also leads to a larger ecological cumulative resistance value of the matrix in the 0 1 0 development model as can be seen from fig 6 b in the 0 1 0 development scenario the maximum cumulative ecological resistance value is 349 835 and the minimum value is 17 467 the area with a higher cumulative resistance value is also mainly located in the southern ulanbuh desert due to poor ecological conditions unlike the 0 1 0 model the area with a smaller ecological resistance value increased significantly in this model b ecological gravity model by inputting the quality of the ecological sources and minimum cumulative resistance distance between them into the ecological gravity model the ecological gravitational force between any ecological sources could be calculated while ecological sources are hindered by the matrix they may still form links through ecological corridors the greater the ecological gravitation the closer the relationship between ecological sources and the more frequent the ecological flow between them transferring energy and matter is moreover when ecological gravity is large enough the ecological source will expand its scale by continuously absorbing and merging external resources however if the ecological gravity is very small it is unlikely that the likelihood of forming an ecological corridor between ecological sources will be high and there will be no connection between them unless the matrix changes taking ecological source 1 as an example the table shows the ecological gravitation between source 1 and other sources because the ecological gravitation ranks first between source 1 and source 342 and source 233 the possibility of forming an ecological corridor between them is the highest in comparison it is very difficult to form an ecological corridor between source 1 and source 35 or source 66 because they have the least ecological gravitation between them 3 1 3 fg eco network simulation by simulating the minimum cumulative resistance surface of the matrix in different development scenarios comparing the ecological resistance and gravity between ecological sources to determine whether they can form an ecological corridor the fg ecological network of the research area is constructed the python scripting language was used to simulate the interaction between the ecological gravitation and resistance in ecological sources and construct the fg eco network the simulation results are as follows in fig 7 the fg ecological network is unevenly distributed for example the number of ecological corridors between ecological resources in the north is greater and the ecological network is more complex while the fg eco network in the south shows the opposite characteristics it is obvious that the fg eco network of the 1 0 0 mode is more complex than that of the 0 1 0 mode and the connections between the ecological sources in the 1 0 0 mode are more closely connected in the transition from the 1 0 0 mode to the 0 1 0 mode the proportion of economic development in the development strategy increases and the ecological resistance in some regions gradually increases the minimum cumulative ecological resistance between the ecological sources is greater than the ecological gravitation between them which causes the ecological corridor to break and leads to the destruction of the fg eco network for example the fg eco network in the sample circle of the study area has changed significantly 3 2 multi scenario simulation the ecological gravitation is determined by the nature of ecological sources and gravitational radii between them and does not fluctuate with changes in the matrix in comparison the minimum cumulative ecological resistance between the sources is closely related to the matrix this study set up 11 development scenarios 1 0 0 0 9 0 1 0 8 0 2 0 7 0 3 0 6 0 4 0 5 0 5 0 4 0 6 0 3 0 7 0 2 0 8 0 1 0 9 0 1 0 among them the current development model 1 0 0 and pure economic development model 0 1 0 had been obtained based on the 1 0 0 status development model 0 1 0 pure economic development model using the raster calculator module of arcgis software the minimum cumulative ecological resistance surface of the other nine modes was obtained by changing the weight values of n m as shown in fig 8 the ranges of cumulative resistance in the 9 modes is 27 360 379 389 26 261 376 105 25 161 372 821 24 062 369 538 22 963 366 254 21 864 362 970 20 765 359 686 19 665 356 403 and 18 566 353 119 it can be seen that the areas with large cumulative resistance values are located in the ulanbuh desert in the south and the agricultural development areas near the hetao plain in the north as the weight of economic development increases the weight of ecological protection gradually decreases and the gray areas that represent less ecological accumulation resistance are gradually decreasing which will make the possibility of energy and material exchange between ecological resources smaller 3 3 eco network performance analysis matlab was used to calculate the connectivity number of cores and density of the fg eco networks of different scenarios the 1 0 0 mode is the current development model of the research area which has the largest network connectivity 329 accounting for 68 24 of the total number of ecological sources in the network the results show that the removal of 329 ecological sources can transform the fg eco network of the 1 0 0 model into a trivial graph and then the ecological function of the network will be completely lost as the weight of economic development increases and the weight of ecological protection decreases in the development strategy the connectivity of the fg eco networks will gradually decrease and the stability of the fg eco networks will deteriorate with the decrease of connectivity in the pure economic development 0 1 0 model the fg eco network has the lowest connectivity only 265 ecological resources need to be removed to transform the fg eco network of the 0 1 0 mode into a trivial graph the changing coreness trend is the same as that of the connectivity as the proportion of economic development gradually increases the number of cores in the fg eco network decreases and the connectivity and robustness of the network are gradually weakened in terms of network density the density is the highest in the 0 9 0 1 mode and it decreases rapidly during the evolution from the 1 0 0 to the 0 1 0 mode 3 4 eco network sample circle analysis according to the results when the proportion of economic development is 0 1 and the proportion of ecological protection is 0 9 although the connectivity of the 0 1 0 9 mode is slightly less than that of the 0 1 0 mode the 0 1 0 9 mode and 1 0 0 mode have the same coreness and the network density of the 0 1 0 9 mode is greater than that of the 0 1 0 mode which indicates that economic development does not necessarily lead to the deterioration of the fg eco network to more accurately analyze the changes in the fg ecological network from the evolution of 1 0 0 to 0 1 0 the periphery area of the jinshataohai sample circle which was seriously damaged in the northern part of the study area was selected for detailed study fig 9 it can be seen from the above figures that in the 0 9 0 1 mode the resistance value in the middle of the sample circle increased the corridors between ecological sources appeared to break and some corridors disappeared but new connections were created between the eastern ecological sources in the 0 8 0 2 mode the resistance value in the middle of the sample circle continued to increase the corridor continued to break the connection between the ecological sources on both sides of the sample circle was weakened and the degree of damage to the network also increased in the 0 7 0 3 mode the resistance value of the sample circle in the west increased significantly the corridor disappeared more seriously and the complexity of the network structure decreased in the 0 6 0 4 mode the value of the cumulative ecological resistance increased in the middle of the sample circle which further weakened the connection between the eastern and western ecological sources in the 0 5 0 5 mode the eastern fg eco network differentiation was further enhanced with the increase of the resistance value in the eastern part of the sample circle some ecological corridors near the nalintaohai farm disappeared and corridor reorganization between ecological sources which led to changes in the network structure took place in the 0 4 0 6 mode the cumulative resistance value of the sample center is higher than the ecological gravity resulting in an inability to form an ecological corridor connecting the fg eco networks on both sides in the 0 3 0 7 mode the fg eco network grid near the sun temple farm in the north of the sample circle gradually disappeared and the ecological corridors in the east and south were broken in the 0 2 0 8 mode the eastern and southern fg eco networks of the sample circle became more fragmented and the corridor disappeared in the 0 1 0 9 mode the eastern ecological corridor of the sample circle disappeared and the ecological source became an isolated island which could not form any connection with other ecological resources in the 0 1 0 mode the ecological corridor disappeared in large quantities the ecological source was isolated and an ecological corridor only formed between large ecological sources through the ditch with the decrease of the proportion of ecological protection in the development strategy the minimum ecological cumulative resistance value of the matrix in the study area gradually increases which leads to the collapse of the ecological corridor and damage to the fg eco network according to research a significant increase in the proportion of economic development will cause irreparable damage to the fg eco network in the study area while in the 0 9 0 1 mode there is a new connection between the ecological sources within the sample circle which makes the fg eco network expand slightly however the fg ecological network in the subsequent development model showed a state of continuous destruction this indicates that the study area may have room for further economic development but the space is not large 4 discussion in the past 40 years while developing the economy and realizing modernization china s ecological environment has been under tremendous pressure resulting in different levels of ecological imbalance gao 2004 northwest china is located in the hinterland of the mainland with water shortages and fragile ecology unreasonable economic development activities in the western region have led to land degradation and rapid desert expansion wei et al 2018 the desert oasis ecotone in arid areas is the priority area of desertification which responds quickly to ecological changes if the ecology improves the desert will gradually become an oasis and if the ecology degenerates the oasis will gradually become a desert which is the process of desertification wang et al 2007 therefore achieving the ecological stability and healthy development of the desert oasis ecotone is of great significance for maintaining regional ecological security controlling desert expansion and improving the ecological environment identifying and protecting ecological networks that are important to regional ecological security can provide a win win solution for economic development and ecological protection an ecological network formed by the ecological corridor connecting the isolated ecological patches in the desert oasis interlaced area can enhance the self regulation ability of ecological patches control desert expansion and maintain ecological stability however there are many ways to establish an ecological network noss proposed three main steps including the identification of special areas feature analysis and network extraction noss 1983 ashley et al 2004 believe that the construction of an ecological network should generally include the following steps first assess the land use status of the study area evaluate the habitat status and landscape suitability extract the key nodes in the landscape and evaluate the landscape connectivity and finally extract the ecological network hu et al 2018 identified the ecological source and ecological nodes using the cumulative cost resistance model and established an ecological network these methods point out the basic steps involved in establishing an ecological network identify the source node extract a corridor and establish a network these studies only consider the hindrance of the matrix but ignore the ecological gravity within the network which is crucial in landscape expansion in this paper an improved gravitational model is used to quantify the ecological forces based on the land use data the ecological source is screened according to the ecological importance of the ecological land considering a variety of factors including topographic factors vegetation cover factors hydrological factors government planning and density factors ecological resistance surfaces in the study area can be constructed the minimum cumulative resistance model was used to calculate the cumulative ecological resistance of the matrix and the improved gravity model was used to calculate the ecological gravity between the sources by comparing the minimum ecological cumulative resistance and the ecological gravity between the ecological sources to judge whether the conditions of the corridor are satisfied the fg ecological network of the study area can be established this paper also used the theory of complex networks to analyze the topology of ecological networks there has been controversy concerning economic development and ecological protection warford 2010 for example murphy and gouldson 2010 established an economic industrial structure optimization model based on the water environment in the recommended industrial structure the economy can be guaranteed to develop at the speed of planning and it can also achieve the goal of controlling water pollution protecting the water environment and achieving the coordinated development of the water environment and economy however other researchers believe that economic development leads to ecological changes and different policy systems will cause different economic states leading to the ecological state having different characteristics gowdy 1994 li 2003 these scholars all believe that ecological problems appear in the process of economic development but they do not describe how the proportion of economic development and ecological protection in development strategies should be coordinated and only put forward development proposals additionally existing research usually only focuses on the future development trend and predicts the future development scenario kareiva 2001 few scholars have studied the impact of different development strategies on ecology based on current natural conditions however it is necessary for policy makers to use scientific evidence based simulation models to assess the impact of different development strategies behague et al 2009 despite this the chinese government has strictly restricted economic development in ecologically fragile areas and implemented the strictest ecological protection policy ever with a view to protecting and improving the ecological environment however the policy is standardized and lacks pertinence it may make some areas limited by environmental protection policies and unable to properly develop the economy in order to improve people s living conditions and reduce the number of poor people this study based on the current natural environment situation this study explored the impact of different development strategies on the ecological network and the possibility of economic development in the study area by adjusting the proportion of economic and ecological protection in the development strategy i e increasing the proportion of economy and reducing the proportion of ecological protection to explore how economic development affects ecology about development strategies we use the scenario simulation method and set up 11 development strategies for research the results show that with the increase in the proportion of economic development the complexity robustness and stability of the fg ecological network decrease however the study found that in the study area when the proportion of ecological protection is 0 9 and the economic development is 0 1 new ecological corridors were created between the ecological sources inside the sample circle the fg ecological network of the 0 9 0 1 mode is more complex and the stability and connectivity indicators of the network are larger this shows that moderate economic development may not cause the ecological environment to deteriorate and there is a specific space for economic development in arid regions the coverage of the fg ecological network can be expanded in reasonably to properly develop the economy while protecting the ecology however with the increase of economic development the structure of the fg ecological network has been destroyed more and more seriously this indicates that the study area may have room for economic development but the space is not large in the arid regions the economy should be developed according to local conditions and desertification caused by ecological deterioration should be avoided it should be noted that this conclusion only applies to the study area selected in this paper and further research in other fields needs to be conducted however some key issues related to ecological security patterns are still difficult to answer for example how many percents of the ecosystem s important grade should be used to determine the ecological source how large should it be in proportion to the total research area most of the ecological corridors extracted by this method are potential ecological corridors how to evaluate the rest except a few that can be verified how to verify the reliability of this method and whether the normalized index area index and shape index can accurately measure the state of ecological sources and what other indicators should be considered there are some doubts about the gravitational constant whether its size is as mentioned in the references the gravitational constant is 1 how to evaluate its reliability and what method should be used to determine the gravitational constant in addition the distribution of resistance values and the assessment of the ecological source status are still worthy of further research to obtain more scientific and accurate results the distribution of resistance values depends on expert experience but there is some subjectivity it is difficult to assess what will happen if these values are incorrectly assigned bendoricchio and palmeri 2005 argued that benefit cost and supply demand balance could be used to measure ecosystem status this provides a good idea for improving the assessment of ecological source status in this study hence much more researches considering multiple case studies across different scales are needed to resolve all of these scientific questions 5 summary and conclusion this paper selected denko county of bayannaoer city inner mongolia which is located in the desert oasis area as the study area this study provided a new approach to the construction of an ecological network based on interaction force theory additionally a variety of development strategies have been set up to explore the impact of the proportion of ecological protection and economic development on the evolution of ecological networks on development strategies moreover the topology and statistical characteristics of the fg ecological network are analyzed based on the complex network theory the specific conclusions are as follows 1 the results show that the fg ecological network is unevenly distributed the number of ecological corridors between ecological resources in the northern part of the study area is greater and the ecological network is more complex while the eco network in the south shows the opposite characteristics from the 1 0 0 mode to the 0 1 mode with the increasing proportion of economic development and the decreasing proportion of ecological protection the fg eco network is gradually destroyed in the 0 1 0 model the structure of the fg eco network is greatly destroyed and the connectivity stability coreness and pagerank etc of fg ecological network reach the lowest level this indicates that large scale economic development in arid areas under the present natural conditions will cause tremendous damage to the fg eco network 2 in the northern part of the study area a sample circle was selected to study the changes in the evolution of the fg eco network from 1 0 0 to 0 1 0 the study found that the fg eco network of the 0 9 0 1 mode is more complex and the stability and connectivity indicators of the network are larger however with the increase of economic development the structure of the fg ecological network has been destroyed more and more seriously this indicates that the study area may have room for economic development but the space is not large acknowledgments this work is supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities no blx201806 study on ecological network structure and its crash threshold at the

24960,many areas on the earth are facing the threat of ecological degradation and unreasonable economic development has further exacerbated environmental problems constructing ecological security patterns based on an ecological network is such an integrated approach to protecting regional ecological sustainability this paper selected denko county of bayannaoer city inner mongolia which is located in the desert oasis area as the study area ecological sources were identified through ecosystem importance assessment and interaction force theory was used to model ecosystem processes in heterogeneous landscapes via comparing the minimum cumulative ecological resistance and the maximum ecological gravity between ecological sources and thus to identify ecological corridors and to constructing forest grass ecological network fg eco network of the study area this paper also set 11 development scenarios to study the impact of different development strategies on the fg ecological network moreover the complex network theory was used to analyze the topology and statistical characteristics of the fg eco network in 11 development scenarios the results show that the ecological network in the study area has been gradually destroyed with the increase of the proportion of economic development in the development scenario the connection between some ecological patches has changed and the connectivity and coreness pagerank etc have gradually decreased the study found that the network density increases slightly in the 0 9 0 1 mode while it gradually decreases in other scenarios with the increase of the proportion of economic development moreover in the 0 9 0 1 mode although the destruction occurred at the edge of the desert the fg eco network within the sample circle expanded this represents that economic development does not necessarily lead to the deterioration of the ecological environment in this area under the existing natural conditions the study area still has room for economic development but space is limited based on the interaction force theory this study provides a new approach to identifying the ecological network also the development scenarios set up in this study can provide a reference for sustainable development keywords multi scene simulation ecological resistance fg eco network desert oasis area ecological gravity 1 introduction the ecosystem is the material basis for human survival and development it is also the life support system of human beings hooper et al 2005 the survival and development of human beings depend on the stability and health of the ecosystem however over the past century the scale and intensity of land use and exploitation have increased dramatically particularly in arid regions this increased exploitation eventually led to serious damage to the structure and function of ecosystems resulting in a series of ecological problems such as a sharp decline in biodiversity myers et al 2000 soil degradation zika et al 2017 and desertification in arid regions as the transition zones between water deficient deserts and water rich farmland systems desert oasis ecotones play a key role in ensuring regional ecological security and maintaining regional internal stabilization however they are also fragile systems and can be modified easily by development strategy changes sawut et al 2013 for a long time the ecological security and sustainable development of desert oasis ecotone have been the focus of scientific research the ecological security pattern in arid areas is of great significance for maintaining regional ecological security and sustainable development as a key component of regional ecological security pattern the ecological network connects isolated landscape patches through ecological corridors from the perspective of the ecological network the process of land desertification is the process of destroying ecological nodes and ecological corridors in ecological networks zhang et al 2009 in this process the integrity and ecological functions of the network structure are continuously declining and the channels of material and energy transmission in the network are gradually blocked ishiyama et al 2018 the ecological network connects the isolated ecological patches in the desert oasis ecotone through linear corridors which constitute a spatial ecological security pattern that combines point line and surface enhancing the ability of landscape self regulation maintaining the stability of the regional ecological environment and resisting the risk of desertification niu 2009 at present the construction of an ecological network has formed one research paradigm including the identification of the ecological source and ecological corridor it mainly identifies the ecological source by assessing ecological suitability ecological importance or ecological connectivity su et al 2016 teng et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 among these methods ecological importance evaluation is the most common li et al 2010 liang et al 2018 lin et al 2016 the method of identifying ecological corridor through constructing the resistance surface mcrae 2006 which is commonly based on the value assignment of land cover keeley et al 2016 additionally the least cost path analysis is often used to extract ecological corridors adriaensen et al 2003 doetzer rosot et al 2018 although these studies considered the hindrance of landscape heterogeneity to ecological flow they neglected the attraction between ecological sources and did not consider the interaction between ecological sources the application of gravitational model in spatial interaction provides a way of thinking for studying the interaction between ecological sources in this paper the gravitational model was first applied to the study of spatial structure between cities cao et al 2018 and was later widely used to study regional economy meng and lu 2011 urban group interaction chen 2009 and inter city trade studies gordillo et al 2010 at present gravity models have been widely used in the study of regional economic linkages or spatial interactions based on the interaction force theory the improved mcr model and gravity model are used to extract the fg ecological network of the study area by comparing the minimum cumulative ecological resistance and the maximum ecological gravity between ecological sources however the ecological network is dynamic it is a fragile system which is affected by both natural conditions and economic activities fath et al 2017 different development strategies will have different impacts on the ecological environment whether economic priority or ecological priority policymakers need to use scientific and evidence based scenario models to study regional characteristics and fully assess the impact of different development strategies whether they focus on economic growth or environmental protection sustainable development can be achieved by formulating development strategies adapted to local conditions in arid areas the contradiction between economic development and ecological development is dualistic and difficult to coordinate christina et al 2012 economic activities are the primary obstacles to ecological development therefore based on the current state of the natural environment by adjusting the proportion of economic development and ecological protection in the development strategy namely increase the proportion of the economy reduce the proportion of ecological protection to explore the impact of different development strategies on ecological networks and the possibility of economic development in the study area therefore it is of great significance to simulate the ecological network of the study area in multiple scenarios this paper set up a variety of development scenarios to simulate and analyze the evolution characteristics of the current ecological network it is not only helpful to explore the development strategies suitable for arid areas but also helpful for policy makers to adjust the relevant planning and social development strategies in the region to promote regional sustainable development however the evolution of the ecological network is different from the evolution of land use it is not only affected by the ecological matrix but also by the interaction between ecological patches therefore a quantitative description of the interaction between ecological patches is very important for the evolution simulation of the ecological network the ecological network is complex analysis of the ecological network using the complex theory is one of the frontier directions in this field hoctor et al 2000 therefore this paper took the typical desert oasis ecotone in northwestern china as the study area using the gravity model and minimum cumulative resistance mcr model to extract the forest grass ecological network fg ecological network in the study area ecological sources which were identified through ecosystem importance assessment the minimum cumulative ecological resistance between ecological sources was calculated by using the improved ecological resistance model and the improved ecological gravitation model was used to calculate the ecological gravitation between ecological sources based on the interaction force theory the ecological corridor is identified by comparing the resultant forces among different ecological sources one by one additionally a variety of scenarios of development strategies have been set up by adjusting the proportion of economic and ecological protection in the development strategy the impact of different development strategies on the ecological network and the possibility of economic development in the study area have been explored the topology analysis and spatial structure analysis of the forest and grass ecological networks in the study area were analyzed using complex network analysis methods this paper hopes to provide a new method for the simulation of ecological network and a new perspective for the study of economic development and ecological environment protection in arid areas to provide a reference and guide for arid areas ecological protection policy making and planning and also to provide theoretical support for sustainable development in arid areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area 106 7 107 23 e 39 56 40 56 n in this paper is located on the northeastern margin of the ulanbuh desert with an area of 5923 9 km2 the majority of

which is an important grain producing area in china the west side of the study area is the wolf mountain and its southwest is the hinterland of the ulanbuh desert according to the meteorological data for 1983 2016 from the denko desert ecological station which belongs to the national forestry and grassland bureau of china the annual average precipitation in the region is 144 5 mm while the average annual evaporation is 2398 mm the location of the study area is shown in fig 1 2 2 data and processing the remote sensing image of sentinel 2 was used in this paper with a resolution of 20 m the

nmgdk gov cn the spatial distribution data of groundwater depth were derived from the research results of ma huan which are the preliminary research results of this study ma et al 2017 2 3 method 2 3 1 identifying ecological network the essence of identifying ecological network is to construct a pattern that contains an integrated network of ecological sources corridors which can well guarantee regional ecosystem services and ecological processes three steps are included in identifying the ecological network in this study the first was to identify ecological sources based on the assessment of the importance of the ecosystem the second was to extract ecological corridors based on interaction force theory the third was to simulate the ecological network the specific framework was shown in fig 2 2 3 1 1 extracting ecological sources the ecological source is high quality and quantity of key ecological patch that provides a variety of ecosystem services maintains the stability of the ecosystem and plays an important role in preventing ecosystem degradation martin et al 2005 therefore ecological sources can be identified by evaluating the importance of the ecosystem this study selected three kinds of landscape types of forest land grassland and water which have important ecological significance to the study area the ecological source was identified by the size of the patch the ndvi means the mndwi means and the shape index patch area was calculated by using arcgis software esri inc redlands ca usa ndvi average and ndwi average were calculated by using zonal statics tools and patch shape index was calculated by using fragstats computer software program produced by the authors at the university of massachusetts amherst available at the following web site http www umass edu landeco research fragstats fragstats html the weights of the patch area ndvi average mndwi average and shape index were determined by entropy method and the ecosystem importance of each landscape patch was evaluated comprehensively then according to the statistical distribution characteristics of the degree of importance of patch ecosystem the top 60 of the patches were selected as the ecological sources 2 3 1 2 interaction between ecological sources a ecological resistance the minimum cumulative resistance model mcr was proposed by the dutch ecologist knappen knaapen et al 1992 li et al 2015 this model was first applied to the diffusion process of species and it can describe the difficulty of species crossing different habitat patches and study the horizontal resistance of species to ecological processes it has since been widely used in landscape pattern analysis to study the effects of landscape heterogeneity on ecological flow albanese and haukos 2017 beier et al 2008 spear et al 2010 the model can be used to measure the magnitude of ecological resistance quantitatively marrotte et al 2014 the formula is 1 v m c r f m i n i 1 j 1 i m j n d i j r i where v m c r represents the value of the minimum cumulative resistance surface f m i n represents the function of the minimum resistance value d i j represents the spatial distance from the source to the landscape unit and r i represents the coefficient of resistance in the process of source movement the mcr model only considers the distance between the ecological source and the matrix characteristics when calculating the resistance this paper improved the mcr model based on the characteristics of the study area we believe that different sources have different ecological energies and their ability to radiate and transmit energy is not only related to their area but also the type and shape of the source at present some scholars have conducted research and discussion on this yu et al 2017 the size of the ecological source will have a strong influence on the material exchange or energy flow urban et al 1987 and its edge can also affect the material energy and future species distribution ewers et al 2007 ribeiro et al 2016 therefore this paper uses a shape index l i ndvi defries and townshend 1994 and mndwi liu et al 2016 to describe the characteristics of the ecological source because the study area is located in an arid area the importance level of the blue source river lake should be higher than that of the green source forest grassland moreover we proposed the concept of ecological source quality to quantitatively evaluate the eco source the definition of the quality of the ecological source is that any ecological source has the property of radiating outward transmitting energy or receiving energy and its quality of ecological resources is related to the area shape and attributes of the source 2 l i e i 2 π a i where l i represents the shape index of the ecological source i e i represents the perimeter of the ecological source i and a i represents the area of the ecological source i 3 m i a i l i i i where m i represents the quality of the ecological source i a i represents the area of the ecological source i l i represents the shape index of the ecological source i and i i represents the average of the normalized index of the ecological source i the improved mcr model considers three factors ecological source quality distance and matrix characteristics the improved formula is 4 v m c r f m i n i 1 j 1 i m j n d i j r j m i where v m c r represents the minimum cumulative resistance value of the ecological source expansion and m i represents the ecological quality of the source i b ecological gravity the gravity model is a model that studies the interaction of two objects or spaces which is derived from newton s law of universal gravitation katsikadelis 2018 in the 19th century scholars introduced the gravity model into the study of geospatial space when studying the interaction of urban systems liu et al 2014 later geographers conducted extensive research on the gravity model pekkanen et al 1997 and used it to analyze the interactions between cities or countries bergstrand 1985 yang and wong 2012 zhang 1989 in 2010 keum demonstrated the usability of gravity models in international trade and tourism keum 2010 in this paper we try to introduce the gravity model into the landscape ecology field and calculate the ecological gravity between the ecological sources because of the differences between the research fields and objects we modified the model so that it can be applied to landscape ecology ecological gravitation is inversely proportional to the square of the minimum cumulative cost distance between them and is proportional to the quality of the source the ecological gravitational model is as follows 5 f i j g α i m i α j m j d i j 2 where f i j represents the ecological gravitation between the source i and the source j d i j 2 represents the spatial distance between the source i and the source j α i α j represents the type of the ecological source i j m i m j represents the ecological quality of the source i j and g represents a constant and is generally expressed as 1 grosche et al 2007 jiang et al 2014 2 3 1 3 fg eco network simulation through eco networks a more stable ecological pattern has been established in arid regions and maintained regional ecological security xue et al 2013 in the ecological network an ecological source is a spatial unit or ecosystem that provides various substances and energy and the ecological corridor is an important channel for energy and material flow the interaction between ecological sources will engender ecological gravity but at the same time it will also be subject to resistance from the matrix as shown in fig 3 detailed algorithm steps of the eco network multi scenario simulation model are as follows 1 calculate the maximum ecological gravity and minimum cumulative resistance between ecological sources when the ecological gravity is greater than the ecological resistance an ecological corridor will be formed between the sources and the ecological flow will be transmitted between the sources through the corridor when the ecological gravity is less than the ecological resistance there will be no ecological corridor between the sources when the ecological gravity equals the ecological resistance the ecological corridor between the sources will be very fragile and slight changes in the matrix may lead to ecological corridor fracture 2 the calculation will not stop until the entire fg eco network source traverse as well as the fg eco network spatial distribution grid simulation results are finally obtained then the spatial distribution of the fg ecological network in the next development scenario is simulated until all scenarios are simulated 2 3 2 multi scenario development program most scholars focus on the study of future development scenarios kraxner et al 2013 however few studies have focused on current natural conditions due to the impact of different development strategies on the ecological environment whether to develop economy first or to protect ecology first especially at the turning point of current urbanization population growth economic prosperity and environmental protection hartmann 1998 it is necessary for policymakers to use scientific and evidence based scenario models to guide future social development and to fully assess the impact of different development strategies whether they focus on economic growth or environmental protection koricheva and kulinskaya 2019 the ecological environment of the study area is extremely fragile and is an important area for desertification control moreover the chinese government has promulgated the strictest ecological protection policy imposing strict restrictions on the economic development of the region which mainly focuses on improving and protecting the ecology since the implementation of the policy is uniform it is often not tailored to local conditions cheng et al 2000 based on the current natural environment situation this study explored the impact of different development strategies on the ecological network and the possibility of economic development in the study area by adjusting the proportion of economic and ecological protection in the development strategy i e increasing the proportion of the economy and reducing the proportion of ecological protection these scenarios not only help to explore development strategies suitable for arid areas but also help policy makers adjust relevant planning and social development strategies in arid areas two basic scenarios were set up 1 current development mode 2 pure economic development mode the development of the research area has both ecological protection and economic development however the ecological environment in this area is extremely fragile and the government restricts economic development by implementing strict ecological protection policies therefore the current development model of the study area can be regarded as a development model based on ecological protection the development strategy of each development scenario is defined as 1 the proportion of ecological protection is expressed in m while n represents the proportion of economic development so that m n 1 when m 1 0 and n 0 1 0 0 represents the current development mode that is the development strategy of the research area with the priority of ecological protection when m 0 and n 1 0 0 1 0 represents a purely economic development mode that is the study area prioritizes the development of the economy by changing the weights of n and m 11 developmental scenarios were obtained 1 0 0 0 9 0 1 0 8 0 2 0 7 0 3 0 6 0 4 0 5 0 5 0 4 0 6 0 3 0 7 0 2 0 8 0 1 0 9 0 1 0 2 3 3 eco network performance analysis in this paper six graph theory indicators for measuring network topology and node importance in complex network analysis were used to reveal the connection characteristics of fg ecological networks of various development strategies which could provide an important reference for the optimization of fg ecological networks the performance of an ecological network is analyzed from network integrity and importance of nodes the characteristics of the network are evaluated by four indicators connectivity c g shanahan and wildie 2012 coreness k g li 2013 density d g lancichinetti and fortunato 2012 average number of nodes connected a g betweenness b i and pagerank p i evaluate the importance of nodes liu et al 2017 1 c g c g represents the connectivity of a complex network including point connectivity and edge connectivity generally speaking the higher the connectivity of a network the better its stability this paper focuses on the point connectivity of eco network and its definition is given below 6 c g min s v s ω g s 2 o r g s i s t r i v i a l g r a p h where v represents the node set of the network g s represents the proper subset of v ω g s represents the number of connected branches in the sub network g s after deleting the point set s from the network g and g s represents the dataset after deleting all nodes in s and all edges associated with it in network g it can be seen that the node connectivity in the network will be the minimum number of nodes deleted if g is not connected or becomes a trivial graph namely a graph with only one node and no edges if c g 0 g can be considered as a disconnected network or a trivial graph when g indicates a complete graph with n nodes c g n 1 2 k g k g represents the maximum coreness of a complex network the coreness of a complex network represents a subset of the remaining network after the nodes with a degree less than k have been removed coreness is a parameter to measure the characteristics of complex networks for example the connectivity the larger the coreness of a network the stronger its connectivity and the robustness of its random faults become the maximum coreness of all nodes in the network is the coreness of the network 3 d g d g represents the tightness of connections between nodes in complex networks the density of the complex network g is defined as 7 d g 2 m n n 1 where m represents the actual number of connections in the network and n represents the number of nodes in the network 4 a g a g represents the average number of nodes connected the number of nodes connected with other nodes in aggregation also known as the average path length the larger the average number of nodes connected the more paths through the network the more complex the network connection 4 b i betweenness can reflect the role and influence of nodes in the whole network this paper focuses on the point betweenness of eco network the betweenness of the node i is defined as 8 b i 1 j l n j i l n j l i n j l where n j l

and ndvi mndwi of each patch were normalized the weights of each index were calculated by the entropy method in the matlab the weights of each index were 0 5878 0 2539 and 0 1583 respectively the weighted summation calculation was performed by using the calculation results of each index and its weight and the importance degree evaluation result of each patch was obtained as shown in fig 4 a according to the statistical distribution characteristics of the importance degree of each plaque the first 60 of the plaques in the importance ranking were selected as the ecological source and finally 481 ecological sources were obtained the finely divided and isolated plaques were largely removed during the screening process and the core plaques in the landscape unit were retained the extraction results are shown in fig 4b 3 1 2 ecological resistance and ecological gravity simulation a construction of the resistance model the resistance value is not only related to the distance of ecological flow but also is associated with land cover and human disturbance consequently most researches were based on expert experiences to assign resistance values corresponding to land use types keeley et al 2016 in this study an evaluation system of ecological resistance was established from 16 factors including topographic slope vegetation cover hydrological distribution soil land cover government planning distance factor and density factor the factor affecting the resistance value of the matrix consists of two parts on the one hand they are influenced by current natural conditions for example the smaller the ndvi value of the ecological flow the smaller the resistance and otherwise the greater the resistance the closer the distance to the water the easier it is for the ecological source to replenish water and the more favorable it is for the development of the ecological source on the contrary the more unfavorable the development of the ecological source on the other hand economic development as the main cause of interference affecting ecological development will affect the resistance value of some factors and ultimately affect the distribution of the resistance of the matrix in the study area for example the spatial planning of ecological living production land is a mandatory measure implemented by the chinese government to regulate the scope of production and living activities currently this plan has been launched nationwide in the development strategy of priority ecological protection ecological sources and other ecological spaces will be well protected and developed and ecological development is limited to natural conditions while in the development strategy of priority economic development the ecological protection policy that constrains economic development will not play a role and areas with better water conditions and vegetation conditions such as ecological conservation redline eco redline will be used immediately to develop the economy at this time the ecology will be destroyed the resistance of ecological development will suddenly increase and the resistance value of the original town is relatively small the resistance values of each factor are set according to the evaluation system shown in table 1 the impact factors were divided into five levels and their resistance levels were expressed by 1 3 5 7 and 9 respectively the results of each single factor evaluation were made by arcgis software and the comprehensive evaluation results of the ecological resistance surface of the current development model and the pure economic development model were obtained by overlapped grid calculation as shown in fig 5 the ecological resistance surfaces of the current development model 1 0 0 and pure economic development model 0 1 0 are shown in fig 5 the value at each raster location represents the cost per unit distance for moving through the raster in 1 0 0 mode the ecological resistance of the matrix is 17 34 which gradually increases from northeast to southwest the areas with a lower resistance value are mainly located in the northeast because of the abundant water resources near the yellow river while the areas with a higher resistance value are located in the ulanbuh desert near the wolf mountains and on the east bank of the yellow river which is the western margin of the kubuqi desert in this development model the economic development is strictly restricted and the development strategy of ecological protection is given priority so that water resources and forestry and grassland are better protected the ecological sources of the study area and the surrounding areas have lower ecological resistance values in the 0 1 0 model the ecological resistance of the matrix is 22 2 34 water resources are mainly used for agricultural production and industrial manufacturing and are rarely used for ecological construction and protection which causes higher matrix resistance values in the northeast region in areas like the ulanbuh desert in the central part and the frontal alluvial fan of the wolf mountain the matrix resistance is relatively lower the above situation shows that a vigorous development of the economy given the present situation will seriously hinder the flow of ecological flow between sources and affect the development of ecology tables 2 and 3 the minimum cumulative ecological resistance is the minimum cumulative cost of the ecological flow from one ecological source to another to overcome the ecological resistance surface the ecological resistance surface as the resistance coefficient of each landscape unit of the ecological flow in the study area can only represent the resistance value of the ecological flow through a single grid hence based on the improved minimum cumulative resistance surface model the cost distance model was used to calculate the ecological cumulative resistance between different ecological sources the cost distance raster identifies for each cell the minimum cumulative ecological resistance over a cost surface to the identified ecological source locations the minimum cumulative ecological resistance surfaces of the current development model 1 0 0 and pure economic development model 0 1 0 are shown in fig 6 as can be seen from fig 6 a in the 0 1 0 development scenario the maximum cumulative resistance value is 382 673 and the minimum value is 28 459 the areas with large cumulative resistance values are mainly located in the southern ulanbuh desert on the one hand because the ecological and environmental conditions in the region are relatively harsh the resistance values of groundwater depth water density ndvi and other factors are higher on the other hand the ecological landscape of the region is less plaque and farther away from other ecological sources which makes the cumulative value of ecological resistance larger in the northern part of the study area there is also a region with a large cumulative resistance value while the ecological conditions are good at this location the area has cultivated the land which is an ecological barrier with a large resistance value moreover water resources are widely used in agricultural production including groundwater and surface water resulting in lower water supply from ecological sources which also leads to a larger ecological cumulative resistance value of the matrix in the 0 1 0 development model as can be seen from fig 6 b in the 0 1 0 development scenario the maximum cumulative ecological resistance value is 349 835 and the minimum value is 17 467 the area with a higher cumulative resistance value is also mainly located in the southern ulanbuh desert due to poor ecological conditions unlike the 0 1 0 model the area with a smaller ecological resistance value increased significantly in this model b ecological gravity model by inputting the quality of the ecological sources and minimum cumulative resistance distance between them into the ecological gravity model the ecological gravitational force between any ecological sources could be calculated while ecological sources are hindered by the matrix they may still form links through ecological corridors the greater the ecological gravitation the closer the relationship between ecological sources and the more frequent the ecological flow between them transferring energy and matter is moreover when ecological gravity is large enough the ecological source will expand its scale by continuously absorbing and merging external resources however if the ecological gravity is very small it is unlikely that the likelihood of forming an ecological corridor between ecological sources will be high and there will be no connection between them unless the matrix changes taking ecological source 1 as an example the table shows the ecological gravitation between source 1 and other sources because the ecological gravitation ranks first between source 1 and source 342 and source 233 the possibility of forming an ecological corridor between them is the highest in comparison it is very difficult to form an ecological corridor between source 1 and source 35 or source 66 because they have the least ecological gravitation between them 3 1 3 fg eco network simulation by simulating the minimum cumulative resistance surface of the matrix in different development scenarios comparing the ecological resistance and gravity between ecological sources to determine whether they can form an ecological corridor the fg ecological network of the research area is constructed the python scripting language was used to simulate the interaction between the ecological gravitation and resistance in ecological sources and construct the fg eco network the simulation results are as follows in fig 7 the fg ecological network is unevenly distributed for example the number of ecological corridors between ecological resources in the north is greater and the ecological network is more complex while the fg eco network in the south shows the opposite characteristics it is obvious that the fg eco network of the 1 0 0 mode is more complex than that of the 0 1 0 mode and the connections between the ecological sources in the 1 0 0 mode are more closely connected in the transition from the 1 0 0 mode to the 0 1 0 mode the proportion of economic development in the development strategy increases and the ecological resistance in some regions gradually increases the minimum cumulative ecological resistance between the ecological sources is greater than the ecological gravitation between them which causes the ecological corridor to break and leads to the destruction of the fg eco network for example the fg eco network in the sample circle of the study area has changed significantly 3 2 multi scenario simulation the ecological gravitation is determined by the nature of ecological sources and gravitational radii between them and does not fluctuate with changes in the matrix in comparison the minimum cumulative ecological resistance between the sources is closely related to the matrix this study set up 11 development scenarios 1 0 0 0 9 0 1 0 8 0 2 0 7 0 3 0 6 0 4 0 5 0 5 0 4 0 6 0 3 0 7 0 2 0 8 0 1 0 9 0 1 0 among them the current development model 1 0 0 and pure economic development model 0 1 0 had been obtained based on the 1 0 0 status development model 0 1 0 pure economic development model using the raster calculator module of arcgis software the minimum cumulative ecological resistance surface of the other nine modes was obtained by changing the weight values of n m as shown in fig 8 the ranges of cumulative resistance in the 9 modes is 27 360 379 389 26 261 376 105 25 161 372 821 24 062 369 538 22 963 366 254 21 864 362 970 20 765 359 686 19 665 356 403 and 18 566 353 119 it can be seen that the areas with large cumulative resistance values are located in the ulanbuh desert in the south and the agricultural development areas near the hetao plain in the north as the weight of economic development increases the weight of ecological protection gradually decreases and the gray areas that represent less ecological accumulation resistance are gradually decreasing which will make the possibility of energy and material exchange between ecological resources smaller 3 3 eco network performance analysis matlab was used to calculate the connectivity number of cores and density of the fg eco networks of different scenarios the 1 0 0 mode is the current development model of the research area which has the largest network connectivity 329 accounting for 68 24 of the total number of ecological sources in the network the results show that the removal of 329 ecological sources can transform the fg eco network of the 1 0 0 model into a trivial graph and then the ecological function of the network will be completely lost as the weight of economic development increases and the weight of ecological protection decreases in the development strategy the connectivity of the fg eco networks will gradually decrease and the stability of the fg eco networks will deteriorate with the decrease of connectivity in the pure economic development 0 1 0 model the fg eco network has the lowest connectivity only 265 ecological resources need to be removed to transform the fg eco network of the 0 1 0 mode into a trivial graph the changing coreness trend is the same as that of the connectivity as the proportion of economic development gradually increases the number of cores in the fg eco network decreases and the connectivity and robustness of the network are gradually weakened in terms of network density the density is the highest in the 0 9 0 1 mode and it decreases rapidly during the evolution from the 1 0 0 to the 0 1 0 mode 3 4 eco network sample circle analysis according to the results when the proportion of economic development is 0 1 and the proportion of ecological protection is 0 9 although the connectivity of the 0 1 0 9 mode is slightly less than that of the 0 1 0 mode the 0 1 0 9 mode and 1 0 0 mode have the same coreness and the network density of the 0 1 0 9 mode is greater than that of the 0 1 0 mode which indicates that economic development does not necessarily lead to the deterioration of the fg eco network to more accurately analyze the changes in the fg ecological network from the evolution of 1 0 0 to 0 1 0 the periphery area of the jinshataohai sample circle which was seriously damaged in the northern part of the study area was selected for detailed study fig 9 it can be seen from the above figures that in the 0 9 0 1 mode the resistance value in the middle of the sample circle increased the corridors between ecological sources appeared to break and some corridors disappeared but new connections were created between the eastern ecological sources in the 0 8 0 2 mode the resistance value in the middle of the sample circle continued to increase the corridor continued to break the connection between the ecological sources on both sides of the sample circle was weakened and the degree of damage to the network also increased in the 0 7 0 3 mode the resistance value of the sample circle in the west increased significantly the corridor disappeared more seriously and the complexity of the network structure decreased in the 0 6 0 4 mode the value of the cumulative ecological resistance increased in the middle of the sample circle which further weakened the connection between the eastern and western ecological sources in the 0 5 0 5 mode the eastern fg eco network differentiation was further enhanced with the increase of the resistance value in the eastern part of the sample circle some ecological corridors near the nalintaohai farm disappeared and corridor reorganization between ecological sources which led to changes in the network structure took place in the 0 4 0 6 mode the cumulative resistance value of the sample center is higher than the ecological gravity resulting in an inability to form an ecological corridor connecting the fg eco networks on both sides in the 0 3 0 7 mode the fg eco network grid near the sun temple farm in the north of the sample circle gradually disappeared and the ecological corridors in the east and south were broken in the 0 2 0 8 mode the eastern and southern fg eco networks of the sample circle became more fragmented and the corridor disappeared in the 0 1 0 9 mode the eastern ecological corridor of the sample circle disappeared and the ecological source became an isolated island which could not form any connection with other ecological resources in the 0 1 0 mode the ecological corridor disappeared in large quantities the ecological source was isolated and an ecological corridor only formed between large ecological sources through the ditch with the decrease of the proportion of ecological protection in the development strategy the minimum ecological cumulative resistance value of the matrix in the study area gradually increases which leads to the collapse of the ecological corridor and damage to the fg eco network according to research a significant increase in the proportion of economic development will cause irreparable damage to the fg eco network in the study area while in the 0 9 0 1 mode there is a new connection between the ecological sources within the sample circle which makes the fg eco network expand slightly however the fg ecological network in the subsequent development model showed a state of continuous destruction this indicates that the study area may have room for further economic development but the space is not large 4 discussion in the past 40 years while developing the economy and realizing modernization china s ecological environment has been under tremendous pressure resulting in different levels of ecological imbalance gao 2004 northwest china is located in the hinterland of the mainland with water shortages and fragile ecology unreasonable economic development activities in the western region have led to land degradation and rapid desert expansion wei et al 2018 the desert oasis ecotone in arid areas is the priority area of desertification which responds quickly to ecological changes if the ecology improves the desert will gradually become an oasis and if the ecology degenerates the oasis will gradually become a desert which is the process of desertification wang et al 2007 therefore achieving the ecological stability and healthy development of the desert oasis ecotone is of great significance for maintaining regional ecological security controlling desert expansion and improving the ecological environment identifying and protecting ecological networks that are important to regional ecological security can provide a win win solution for economic development and ecological protection an ecological network formed by the ecological corridor connecting the isolated ecological patches in the desert oasis interlaced area can enhance the self regulation ability of ecological patches control desert expansion and maintain ecological stability however there are many ways to establish an ecological network noss proposed three main steps including the identification of special areas feature analysis and network extraction noss 1983 ashley et al 2004 believe that the construction of an ecological network should generally include the following steps first assess the land use status of the study area evaluate the habitat status and landscape suitability extract the key nodes in the landscape and evaluate the landscape connectivity and finally extract the ecological network hu et al 2018 identified the ecological source and ecological nodes using the cumulative cost resistance model and established an ecological network these methods point out the basic steps involved in establishing an ecological network identify the source node extract a corridor and establish a network these studies only consider the hindrance of the matrix but ignore the ecological gravity within the network which is crucial in landscape expansion in this paper an improved gravitational model is used to quantify the ecological forces based on the land use data the ecological source is screened according to the ecological importance of the ecological land considering a variety of factors including topographic factors vegetation cover factors hydrological factors government planning and density factors ecological resistance surfaces in the study area can be constructed the minimum cumulative resistance model was used to calculate the cumulative ecological resistance of the matrix and the improved gravity model was used to calculate the ecological gravity between the sources by comparing the minimum ecological cumulative resistance and the ecological gravity between the ecological sources to judge whether the conditions of the corridor are satisfied the fg ecological network of the study area can be established this paper also used the theory of complex networks to analyze the topology of ecological networks there has been controversy concerning economic development and ecological protection warford 2010 for example murphy and gouldson 2010 established an economic industrial structure optimization model based on the water environment in the recommended industrial structure the economy can be guaranteed to develop at the speed of planning and it can also achieve the goal of controlling water pollution protecting the water environment and achieving the coordinated development of the water environment and economy however other researchers believe that economic development leads to ecological changes and different policy systems will cause different economic states leading to the ecological state having different characteristics gowdy 1994 li 2003 these scholars all believe that ecological problems appear in the process of economic development but they do not describe how the proportion of economic development and ecological protection in development strategies should be coordinated and only put forward development proposals additionally existing research usually only focuses on the future development trend and predicts the future development scenario kareiva 2001 few scholars have studied the impact of different development strategies on ecology based on current natural conditions however it is necessary for policy makers to use scientific evidence based simulation models to assess the impact of different development strategies behague et al 2009 despite this the chinese government has strictly restricted economic development in ecologically fragile areas and implemented the strictest ecological protection policy ever with a view to protecting and improving the ecological environment however the policy is standardized and lacks pertinence it may make some areas limited by environmental protection policies and unable to properly develop the economy in order to improve people s living conditions and reduce the number of poor people this study based on the current natural environment situation this study explored the impact of different development strategies on the ecological network and the possibility of economic development in the study area by adjusting the proportion of economic and ecological protection in the development strategy i e increasing the proportion of economy and reducing the proportion of ecological protection to explore how economic development affects ecology about development strategies we use the scenario simulation method and set up 11 development strategies for research the results show that with the increase in the proportion of economic development the complexity robustness and stability of the fg ecological network decrease however the study found that in the study area when the proportion of ecological protection is 0 9 and the economic development is 0 1 new ecological corridors were created between the ecological sources inside the sample circle the fg ecological network of the 0 9 0 1 mode is more complex and the stability and connectivity indicators of the network are larger this shows that moderate economic development may not cause the ecological environment to deteriorate and there is a specific space for economic development in arid regions the coverage of the fg ecological network can be expanded in reasonably to properly develop the economy while protecting the ecology however with the increase of economic development the structure of the fg ecological network has been destroyed more and more seriously this indicates that the study area may have room for economic development but the space is not large in the arid regions the economy should be developed according to local conditions and desertification caused by ecological deterioration should be avoided it should be noted that this conclusion only applies to the study area selected in this paper and further research in other fields needs to be conducted however some key issues related to ecological security patterns are still difficult to answer for example how many percents of the ecosystem s important grade should be used to determine the ecological source how large should it be in proportion to the total research area most of the ecological corridors extracted by this method are potential ecological corridors how to evaluate the rest except a few that can be verified how to verify the reliability of this method and whether the normalized index area index and shape index can accurately measure the state of ecological sources and what other indicators should be considered there are some doubts about the gravitational constant whether its size is as mentioned in the references the gravitational constant is 1 how to evaluate its reliability and what method should be used to determine the gravitational constant in addition the distribution of resistance values and the assessment of the ecological source status are still worthy of further research to obtain more scientific and accurate results the distribution of resistance values depends on expert experience but there is some subjectivity it is difficult to assess what will happen if these values are incorrectly assigned bendoricchio and palmeri 2005 argued that benefit cost and supply demand balance could be used to measure ecosystem status this provides a good idea for improving the assessment of ecological source status in this study hence much more researches considering multiple case studies across different scales are needed to resolve all of these scientific questions 5 summary and conclusion this paper selected denko county of bayannaoer city inner mongolia which is located in the desert oasis area as the study area this study provided a new approach to the construction of an ecological network based on interaction force theory additionally a variety of development strategies have been set up to explore the impact of the proportion of ecological protection and economic development on the evolution of ecological networks on development strategies moreover the topology and statistical characteristics of the fg ecological network are analyzed based on the complex network theory the specific conclusions are as follows 1 the results show that the fg ecological network is unevenly distributed the number of ecological corridors between ecological resources in the northern part of the study area is greater and the ecological network is more complex while the eco network in the south shows the opposite characteristics from the 1 0 0 mode to the 0 1 mode with the increasing proportion of economic development and the decreasing proportion of ecological protection the fg eco network is gradually destroyed in the 0 1 0 model the structure of the fg eco network is greatly destroyed and the connectivity stability coreness and pagerank etc of fg ecological network reach the lowest level this indicates that large scale economic development in arid areas under the present natural conditions will cause tremendous damage to the fg eco network 2 in the northern part of the study area a sample circle was selected to study the changes in the evolution of the fg eco network from 1 0 0 to 0 1 0 the study found that the fg eco network of the 0 9 0 1 mode is more complex and the stability and connectivity indicators of the network are larger however with the increase of economic development the structure of the fg ecological network has been destroyed more and more seriously this indicates that the study area may have room for economic development but the space is not large acknowledgments this work is supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities no blx201806 study on ecological network structure and its crash threshold at the

24961,ecological models often strive to inform conservation and management decisions occurrence based distribution models may aid regional management strategies though many management decisions require information beyond the likely presence of a species provided by such models process based distribution models predict geographic distributions using environmental relationships with biological processes providing more detailed predictions and a key opportunity for data driven management here we develop and characterize a novel demography based regional distribution model and illustrate its use by comparing four management strategies for glossy buckthorn frangula alnus a bird dispersed shrub invasive throughout the northeastern united states on a gridded landscape in southern new hampshire and maine this population level simulation includes fruiting seed dispersal seed bank dynamics germination and establishment and annual survival with land cover as the dominant environmental driver we parameterize the model with field and lab studies supplementing with published data expert knowledge and pattern oriented parameterization with historical records in a comprehensive sensitivity analysis we found that the age at which individuals are capable of reproduction and the frequency of long distance dispersal had the strongest influence on the distribution in our management simulations we found that immigration prevents total eradication within any property regardless of management frequency or coordination though management impacts are detectable in nearby un managed cells via reduced seed deposition the flexible model structure combines multiple disparate data sources similar to those available for many species into a synthetic framework of local and regional biological processes allows the incorporation of specific management actions targeting particular processes and life stages into the regional context of a process based species distribution model and provides a robust method for evaluating potential management strategies keywords cellular automata grid based distribution spatially explicit population model 1 introduction ecological models are often constructed with a goal of informing conservation and management decisions buckley et al 2004 elith and leathwick 2009 mcmahon et al 2010 guisan et al 2013 and encompass a wide range of approaches models may help guide the prioritization of efforts by predicting future distributions of many species allen and bradley 2016 or may identify policy effects on critical life stages for a species of concern crowder et al 1994 morris and doak 2003 in particular simulation based approaches naturally incorporate the stochasticity uncertainty and complexity of ecologically detailed models morris and doak 2003 merow et al 2011 mcgowan et al 2017 accounting for inherent variability as well as data and process uncertainty can lead to more informed decisions based on the range of plausible outcomes and can highlight key data limitations further management actions though often implemented locally occur within an interconnected regional landscape that can affect resulting ecological dynamics merow et al 2011 species distribution models sdms predict species geographic distributions based on relationships with the environment and have been used in a variety of conservation applications the majority of sdms are occurrence based relying on correlations between observed presences and environmental covariates elith et al 2010 evans et al 2016 occurrence based sdms have many uses such as predicting current or future distributions and informing conservation priorities by generating maps of potential invasive species risk elith and leathwick 2009 guisan et al 2013 allen and bradley 2016 and are particularly appealing because of the availability of geolocated presence data in online repositories the predictions of occurrence based sdms can be improved by incorporating spatial dynamics including meta population and connectivity processes mestre et al 2017 alternatively process based sdms predict distributions by building relationships between biological processes and environmental covariates an approach more directly tied to the biology of the species kearney and porter 2009 buckley et al 2010 dormann et al 2012 cuddington et al 2013 evans et al 2016 options for process based sdms are varied for example the predictions can be temporally dynamic or static incorporate dispersal and utilize either individual level or population level relationships jongejans et al 2008 merow et al 2011 2017 aiello lammens 2014 compared to occurrence based sdms process based sdms require additional data to parameterize hindering their widespread adoption models for evaluating management strategies are often non spatial or involve only a small extent rees and payntert 1997 buckley et al 2004 davis et al 2006 ramula and buckley 2010 mirroring the local spatial scope of many management actions as applied models the structure is typically tailored to the biology and life history of the focal species the inclusion of particular biological processes allows for the comparison of management actions with differing effects such as biocontrol agents cover crops or manual removal of individuals rees and payntert 1997 buckley et al 2004 with sufficient data to inform impacts on life stages the predicted population level effects can be quantified to identify the method most likely to succeed in affecting the species long term abundance davis et al 2006 however past work has often made the simplifying assumption that populations occur in isolation without regional dynamics driven by dispersal of individuals within local neighborhoods and rarer long distance dispersal events as spatially explicit models that typically encompass broad geographic areas sdms hold great potential for informing the management of rare or invasive species occurrence based sdms have been constructed to identify locations vulnerable to future invasion jiménez valverde et al 2011 o donnell et al 2012 allen and bradley 2016 or particularly valuable critical habitats heinrichs et al 2010 while such products are highly valuable for agencies focused on regional planning many management decisions occur at finer spatial resolutions than sdms or must consider information beyond a species likely presence or absence as predicted by many sdms for instance managers often must assess the abundance and impact of the focal species while also balancing logistical constraints matzek et al 2015 further management options are diverse possible actions for an invasive species may include manual removal application of herbicide planting of a cover crop or introduction of a biocontrol agent each of which affects the population differently rees and payntert 1997 buckley et al 2004 davis et al 2006 the evaluation of management decisions could be greatly aided by models incorporating these differing effects within a broader landscape here we develop an approach to construct process based sdms to simulate local management actions with the expanded realism of regional population dynamics we link previously disparate models of demographically driven species abundance dispersal dynamics and management actions on specific life stages into a single cohesive modeling framework that is flexible and adaptable to many species we illustrate with glossy buckthorn frangula alnus a bird dispersed shrub native to eurasia and invasive throughout the northeastern united states on a gridded landscape the model includes mechanistic dispersal and seed bank dynamics in addition to spatially varying flowering probability fruit production survival and seedling establishment we demonstrate the effect of propagule pressure when managing glossy buckthorn in a regional landscape with heterogeneous management strategies and show the level of spatial coordination needed to achieve local control targets given the species biology the flexible structure of the model accommodates modification according to the biology of the focal species as well as incorporation of biologically realistic effects of management actions spatially explicit process based models such as this provide a key opportunity to ground management decisions in the species biology and the best available data 2 methods 2 1 model structure the model simulates the mechanistic growth and spread of a species across a gridded landscape based on spatially varying biological processes fig 1 and table 1 the model structure reflects the life history of a bird dispersed perennial shrub yet is adaptable to other life histories and dispersal agents within each occupied cell population and life history dynamics are driven by vital rates and demographic parameters which can be global fig 1 light purple or dependent on the local environment fig 1 dark blue populations are connected through the movement of seeds via mechanistic short distance dispersal and random long distance dispersal we define long distance dispersal as any dispersal event beyond the range of the short distance dispersal neighborhood including rare natural disperser movements in addition to intentional and unintentional human mediated dispersal density dependence is implemented by directly limiting the abundance within each cell merow et al 2011 because of the biological detail simulated management actions can target particular processes or life stages such as by reducing seedling establishment through planted cover crops or by reducing abundances through manual removal or herbicide application fig 1 2 1 1 fecundity at the start of each time step t individuals flower and produce fruits the total number of fruits f produced in cell i in year t is calculated as 1 f it n it f i μ i where n it is the number of adults in cell i in year t f i is the probability that an adult in cell i flowers and μ i is the mean number of fruits produced by a flowering adult in cell i both f and μ are dependent on the cell environment as indicated by the subscript i 2 1 2 dispersal the fruits produced f it are consumed by animal dispersers or drop from the plant to remain in the local population the seeds in consumed fruits are transported and deposited in the local cell i or in the short distance dispersal neighborhood of cell i we assume a single primary natural dispersal vector though additional dispersal vectors could be readily added the number of seeds s in cell i in

the vector of habitat preferences η the exponential kernel with decay rate r represents the distribution of distances a dispersal agent is likely to travel between consuming a fruit and defecating to deposit the seeds however dispersers will preferentially travel to cells with an abundance of their preferred habitat accordingly the probability for each cell is multiplied by the dot product of the land cover composition and the preference for each land cover type thus for a given distance dispersal probabilities are higher for cells with a high proportion of disperser preferred habitat for each short distance dispersal neighborhood i e the j cells surrounding i the probabilities δ 1 j i are standardized to sum to 1 representing the dispersal probability conditional on first emigrating from the source cell the calculation of each δ ji therefore incorporates the distance between i and j as well as the movement patterns digestion times and habitat preferences of the dispersers long distance dispersal is stochastic and inherently difficult to predict but can be critical to the range expansion of invasive species trakhtenbrot et al 2005 merow et al 2011 in addition to rare long distance movements by birds merow et al 2011 which could be considered as rare occurrences following the same mechanism as short distance dispersal we also include human mediated dispersal in our definition of long distance dispersal to incorporate unintentional transportation of fruits or seeds and intentional planting of individuals reichard and white 2001 lehan et al 2013 we therefore include long distance dispersal as a separate component in the model which also reduces computational requirements by limiting the size of short distance dispersal neighborhoods thus in each year one successfully established seedling is placed in each of n ldd random cells on the landscape regardless of whether the cells are already occupied 2 1 3 seed dynamics the s it seeds deposited in cell i

system description we illustrate the model using glossy buckthorn frangula alnus a shrub native to eurasia that was introduced in north america by 1879 and has since become invasive in much of the northeastern united states catling and porebski 1994 johnson et al 2006 webster et al 2006 aiello lammens 2014 glossy buckthorn persists in forest understories but forms dense thickets in open canopy burnham and lee 2010 in addition to reducing recreational value glossy buckthorn causes particular damage to forestry operations after trees have been harvested buckthorn densities increase dramatically in canopy gaps out competing commercial timber species such as eastern white pine frappier et al 2003 lanzer et al 2017 lee et al 2017 glossy buckthorn produces fleshy fruits throughout the summer that are consumed and dispersed by a variety of bird species craves 2015 in the northeastern united states the most likely dispersers include european starlings american robins and cedar waxwings mccay et al 2009 we focus on southern new hampshire and maine in the northeastern united states an area where glossy buckthorn is abundant and eastern white pine forests are reasonably common fig 2 black outline in inset within this regional extent we assume that land cover type is the dominant factor affecting glossy buckthorn biological rates pearson and dawson 2003 the landscape consists of 240 656 grid cells 4 813 120 acres 19 478 km2 with a resolution of 20 acres 8 1 ha 285 285 m we specify biological rates for glossy buckthorn in six land cover classes open deciduous forest mixed forest white pine forest other evergreen forest and other where possible using the land cover composition in each cell to calculate aggregate expected rates across the landscape we used a land cover map of the predicted proportion of each land cover class in each 20 acre cell appendix a the map was created to represent glossy buckthorn habitat affinities via a modeled synthesis of two land cover datasets the 2001 national land cover database homer et al 2007 and the more detailed new hampshire land cover map justice et al 2002 we used environmental anthropogenic and topographic data to predict discrepancies between the land cover datasets and to align categorization differences to produce a single compositional land cover map across the study extent at the desired resolution szewczyk et al in review 2 2 2 parameterization and sensitivity analyses to parameterize the model we used a combination of field and lab experiments supplemented by published data from the literature expert knowledge and pattern matching table 1 and appendix a when data for glossy buckthorn were unavailable we used ecologically similar species namely the woody shrub lindera benzoin and the fleshy fruit producing invasive vine celastrus orbiculatus see appendix a for extensive parameter specific details and additional information regarding data sources the earliest record of glossy buckthorn within the study area fig 2 black outline in inset is in southern new hampshire in 1922 aiello lammens 2014 this record served as the initial introduction site for the sensitivity analysis and population initialization we used historical records to identify the dispersal parameters that best captured the observed spread aiello lammens 2014 eddmap 2016 then we ran 1000 iterations for 96 years 1922 2018 each using the average abundances in each cell to represent the predicted abundance of glossy buckthorn in the study region from initial introduction to the year 2018 this final distribution served as the initial year in simulations comparing management strategies such that the management actions occur in the present environment as predicted by the model we performed a global sensitivity analysis to explore the plausible parameter space and understand model behavior prowse et al 2016 aiello lammens and akçakaya 2017 rather than performing sensitivity analyses for each parameter in isolation a global sensitivity analysis simultaneously selects values for all parameters this approach effectively marginalizes across any interactions between parameters to provide a holistic estimation of the effect of each parameter on the model predictions we set plausible parameter ranges based on field studies lab studies the literature and expert opinion table a 1 we drew random values from uniform distributions within these ranges to generate 25 000 parameter sets running one iteration of the model for each parameter set prowse et al 2016 despite the stochastic dispersal in the model a single iteration allows for a more efficient exploration of the parameter space compared to multiple iterations per draw with a more limited number of draws prowse et al 2016 for each draw we simulated the population for 50 years from the initial introduction and then calculated the proportion of cells occupied by adults the proportion of cells with a seed bank the proportion of occupied cells that had reached carrying capacity the mean and median abundance in occupied cells and the variance in abundance among occupied cells to evaluate each parameter s effect on each response metric we used boosted regression trees brts with all parameters included as predictors elith et al 2008 prowse et al 2016 brts use the machine learning technique of boosting to create an ensemble model of regression trees to optimize predictive performance using the weights of the regression trees included in the ensemble model the relative influence of each parameter can then be calculated elith et al 2008 we compared tree complexities of 1 3 and 5 to ensure that the parameter space was adequately explored each brt was fit with bootstrapped subsets of varying size with cross validation deviance and stability of the relative influence estimates calculated across subsets prowse et al 2016 for parameters that varied by land cover type we included the value for each of the six land cover types as predictors to fit the brt and summed the relative influence for example we fit each brt with f open f other included as separate predictors then summed the relative influence to calculate an overall relative influence for f see additional detail in appendix b we used pattern oriented parameterization to identify the best estimates for dispersal grimm et al 2005 merow et al 2011 grimm and railsback 2005 we compiled geo located presences of glossy buckthorn by combining herbarium records aiello lammens 2014 and occurrences from the eddmaps database eddmap 2016 for each cell with an observation we calculated the earliest observation we varied the mean short distance dispersal distance 1 r the maximum short distance dispersal distance sdd max and the number of annual long distance dispersal events n ldd in the same manner as the main global sensitivity analysis with all other parameters set to best estimates taking 5000 samples each iteration was initialized as above and run for 96 years representing the predicted spread through 2018 then we selected the median values for each parameter from the parameter draws that correctly predicted at least 90 of the historical spread 2 2 3 management simulations the university of new hampshire manages woodland properties throughout the state of new hampshire these properties vary in size from 11 to 334 acres and are centrally managed with goals aimed toward a variety of purposes including recreation wildlife habitat and academic uses the abundance of glossy buckthorn and other invasive plants is variable among properties and stated management strategies range from monitoring to regular treatment to no action https colsa unh edu woodlands managed properties in practice the realized management actions on each property depend on a combination of logistical constraints and broader goals we simulated possible strategies for managing glossy buckthorn on 12 of the woodland properties in southeastern new hampshire fig 2 and table 2 to initialize the landscape we ran 1000 simulations for 96 years each 1922 2018 using best estimates for each parameter table a 1 and calculating the mean abundance across simulations of the seed bank and of each age category within each land cover type in each cell for computational efficiency the landscape and initial distribution were then truncated to the bounding box enclosing 2 sdd max around the focal properties fig 2 red outline then we evaluated four sets of management plans no management the stated management plan the actual management actions and an aggressive plan table 2 each strategy was implemented for 1000 simulations of 20 years each to assess the effect of management actions on glossy buckthorn populations within and around each property 3 results our model predicts not only the probability of occurrence in each cell of the landscape but also the abundance of each life stage and the spatial distribution of biological processes and rates in our illustration with glossy buckthorn the predicted abundance of adults was highest in cells with more open habitat and less forest fig 3 a reflecting the affinity of glossy buckthorn for higher light levels cunard and lee 2009 burnham and lee 2010 in contrast seedling establishment rates show less geographic variation despite varying among land cover types fig 3b the total propagule pressure i e the total seeds deposited in a cell is high only near the abundance hotspots fig 3c individuals produce more fruit under open canopies and the pattern of per capita seed production thus mirrors that of adult abundance and propagule pressure fig 3d based on the total propagule pressure and the number of seeds immigrating to each cell fig 3e the relative abundance of local and immigrant seeds can be calculated fig 3f thus process based sdms allow the examination of the spatial variation in each biological rate or process providing information valuable for management decisions the relative influence of parameters was stable for all metrics across sample sizes greater than 20 000 fig b 2 and we base our analysis on 25 000 samples of the parameter space the parameters with greatest influence varied with the metric of interest fig 4 the number of annual long distance dispersal events n ldd and the age of adulthood m primarily drove the proportion of cells occupied both for adults and for seeds with smaller effects of the short distance dispersal rate r and juvenile survival s m the proportion of occupied cells reaching carrying capacity and the mean and median abundance were most strongly affected by the age of adulthood with secondary effects of the juvenile survival rate and for mean abundance carrying capacity k in contrast the variance of abundance in occupied cells was driven by carrying capacity the number of annual long distance dispersal events had a large impact on the ability to accurately predict the historic spread of glossy buckthorn reaffirming the results of the global sensitivity analysis the short distance dispersal rate had a moderate influence while the maximum short distance dispersal distance had little effect the accurate prediction of the distribution required abundant long distance dispersal n ldd 19 annual events with a short distance dispersal rate of 0 0378 and a maximum distance of 27 cells 7 7 km in the management simulations glossy buckthorn density on each property approached or reached carrying capacity in the absence of management actions fig c 16 the stated plan actual actions and aggressive strategy all decreased buckthorn adult and seed density relative to no action on properties that implemented management fig 5 however even the aggressive strategy failed to fully eliminate glossy buckthorn fig 5 right column despite repeated cutting spraying and planting of cover crops minimum density per property 1 4 101 adults 20 acre the seed bank was reduced but maintained at a lower equilibrium by the remaining adults as well as immigration from nearby cells fig 5 bottom row consequently the abundance of glossy buckthorn adults quickly rebounded in the intervening years between treatments due to the surviving juveniles and the persistent propagule pressure from surrounding cells 4 discussion the process based sdm presented here incorporates several biological processes in the context of a bird dispersed shrub the flexible structure makes this framework suitable for a wide array of species and life histories the added complexity confers several key benefits including insight into the geographic variation in vital rates and the ability to simulate specific targeted effects of management actions with local decisions implemented in the broader regional context we illustrated such a use by evaluating management strategies for the invasive shrub glossy buckthorn on 12 centrally managed properties in southeastern new hampshire showing persistent spillover effects from nearby un managed cells process based sdms provide much more detailed predictions than occurrence based sdms merow et al 2011 2017 by incorporating biological rates and processes that vary across environmental gradients they allow for spatial predictions of processes such as germination or flowering rates merow et al 2017 exploration of these predictions may highlight management methods or locations that are likely to be most fruitful whether for reducing the abundance of an invasive species or conversely increasing the abundance of a threatened species for example a regional strategy for managing glossy buckthorn may involve targeting populations that produce a large number of emigrant seeds to efficiently reduce the propagule pressure of the surrounding area fig c 12 incorporating mechanistic dispersal in a simulation framework extends the possibilities further temporally dynamic simulations may identify dispersal corridors for species highlighting areas to protect or monitor compared to sdms with simple population growth merow et al 2011 the model presented here includes age structured populations and reproductive processes aggregating and collecting data to inform these processes across an adequate environmental gradient may be more logistically feasible than estimating intrinsic growth rates across a similar gradient further a model built directly on biological processes may produce more accurate predictions in the face of a changing climate particularly if parameterized with warming or transplant experiments jiménez valverde et al 2011 evans et al 2016 in the global sensitivity analysis we constrained the range of each parameter according to available data the relative influence therefore reflects a combination of the inherent sensitivity of the output to that parameter and the breadth of the plausible range in contrast using the full allowable range for each parameter e g 0 1 for a probability reveals solely the sensitivity that is structural in the model incorporating data driven constraints on the ranges highlights parameters for which additional data would be most valuable and lead to the greatest improvements in predictions if a distinction between the influence of structural sensitivity and data uncertainty is required one could compare a sensitivity analysis performed with data driven ranges to one performed with full possible ranges our results show that the number of annual long distance dispersal events the age of maturity and the juvenile survival rate are influential across several grid wide metrics while long distance dispersal is inherently difficult to predict higgins and richardson 1999 buchan and padilla 1999 future models of glossy buckthorn would most benefit from additional data clarifying juvenile mortality and the age at which individuals are capable of producing fruit across a range of environments we identified best estimates for each dispersal parameter using a pattern oriented approach with historical records of glossy buckthorn compared to celastrus orbiculatus a bird dispersed invasive vine in new england our model of glossy buckthorn required broader short distance dispersal and more annual long distance dispersal events merow et al 2011 we propose three hypotheses for this difference relative to previous work first our definition of long distance dispersal is broader including not only rare long distance bird dispersal but also unintentional and intentional human mediated events like many invasive plants glossy buckthorn was planted in gardens as an ornamental shrub particularly early in its introduction history catling and porebski 1994 reichard and white 2001 aiello lammens 2014 and so a high number of dispersal events reflects this history second we modeled a relatively modest regional extent and glossy buckthorn occurs beyond our study borders catling and porebski 1994 aiello lammens 2014 craves 2015 increased long distance dispersal could reflect dispersal from beyond our landscape boundaries a phenomenon likely to be less influential in the model of c orbiculatus across the entirety of the northeastern united states third we used a high resolution grid to evaluate management scenarios and consequently dispersing seeds must cross more grid cells per unit distance because dispersal probability exponentially decreases with distance from the source cell dispersal requires more steps on a high resolution grid than on a coarser grid which is compensated for by a flatter exponential distribution for short distance dispersal process based sdms which construct distributions based on biological processes are often assumed to be superior to occurrence based sdms which construct distributions by relating occurrence data to environmental variables jiménez valverde et al 2011 evans et al 2016 merow et al 2017 however the application of grid based simulations with simple population growth and mechanistic dispersal for predicting species distributions has been minimal merow et al 2011 more complex integral projection models incorporate individual level data into vital rate regressions and can be used to predict population growth rates across a region merow et al 2014 2017 the data that are available or feasibly collected constrain the plausible choices for process based sdms estimating intrinsic population growth rates typically requires population estimates across several years and the accuracy is quite sensitive to inter annual stochastic variation morris and doak 2003 mccain et al 2016 loehle and weatherford 2017 similarly integral projection models require multi year labor intensive studies to measure and track individuals across a sufficiently broad environmental gradient aiello lammens 2014 merow et al 2014 2017 the model presented here represents an alternative that uses data that may be more readily available in the literature or more quickly collected in the field with intermediate model complexity often sdms are built at fairly coarse resolutions with pixels on the order of multiple square kilometers elith and leathwick 2009 ibánez et al 2009 merow et al 2011 bellard et al 2013 allen and bradley 2016 at these scales regional variables such as climate tend to be most influential huston 1999 pearson and dawson 2003 keil et al 2012 fraterrigo et al 2014 and the models are agnostic regarding sub pixel variation in the species occurrence or abundance stakeholders deciding how to monitor and manage individual properties require more detailed predictions than coarse scale models can provide these managers would benefit most from high resolution models predicting the probable abundance or risk within each property matzek et al 2015 hyper local plant distributions are often determined by variables such as light availability soil type or canopy species guisan and thuiller 2005 elith and leathwick 2009 burnham and lee 2010 as well as the stochastic placement of individuals grimm et al 2005 while a model can be parameterized using these local variables predictions may then be limited to hypothetical good or bad local habitats since the local variables are unknown at a regional extent merow et al 2017 thus there is a critical scale mismatch between the models ecologists are often able to build and the models that would be most useful for applied management decisions matzek et al 2015 process based regional models such as the model presented here are a step toward rectifying this mismatch and could be combined with statistical downscaling to predict local distributions on particular properties wu and david 2002 keil et al 2013 barwell et al 2014 the specific model presented here describes a bird dispersed woody shrub however the structure is easily modified for different life histories or dispersal methods for example a biennial plant could be modeled by setting the age at maturity to 2 and adult survival to 0 to model a wind dispersed species short distance dispersal neighborhoods could be increased in size and modified by wind patterns if data are available nathan et al 2011 importantly additional variables such as climate topography or even the distribution of competitor species can be included rather than solely land cover such that parameters are calculated in each cell based on regressions merow et al 2017 carlo et al 2018 fern et al 2019 in the absence of available data to inform these regressions sensitivity analyses could identify the impact of data based uncertainty further simulations could incorporate parameter uncertainty by selecting values from a specified distribution in each iteration essentially adopting a bayesian approach to produce a more robust assessment of the likely distribution morris and doak 2003 clark 2005 szewczyk and mccain 2019 rather than assuming simplistic dynamics among habitat types density dependent habitat selection could be included depending on the species life history menezes and kotler 2019 this model employs average population values assuming that individual variation is negligible to the metrics of interest a similar grid based structure could be combined with regression models of individual based traits and the environmental conditions within each cell to account for individual differences as in integral projection models merow et al 2014 2017 however a key benefit of a population level model is the lower data requirement compared to an individual level model where tagged individuals must be monitored and measured across years dynamic sdms with mechanistic dispersal and biologically realistic processes hold great potential for management planning while we focused on an established invasive a newly introduced species could be projected into the future to identify unoccupied areas highly vulnerable to invasion and the local and regional success of management options weighed alternatively policies for increasing the abundance or distribution of rare species could be evaluated for example populations of grassland birds such as the bobolink and eastern meadowlark have seen dramatic declines in the northeastern united states resulting from changes in land use bollinger et al 1990 foster 2002 foster et al 2002 state agencies and non governmental organizations are currently attempting to increase their abundance by preserving or creating suitable grassland habitat foster and motzkin 2003 hill et al 2014 with the modelling framework presented here managers could compare the effects of improving habitat in different locations to maximize the impact of their efforts further conservation organizations advocate for several strategies to align agricultural practices with nesting habits including delaying hay harvests to lower juvenile mortality and reducing grazing to minimize nest destruction bollinger et al 1990 hill et al 2014 the relative effectiveness of these options could be compared incorporating regional heterogeneity in their effects thus this model structure provides the ability to identify the most sensitive life stages and processes as well as the most critical localities the interconnected regional context in our management simulations includes cells beyond the purview of the focal manager and we assumed that glossy buckthorn was not controlled in any non focal cells future work could predict management within each cell of the landscape for example integration with decision models could allow each simulated land owner to decide how to manage the species epanchin niell and wilen 2014 alternatively coordinated regional strategies could be evaluated representing cooperation among land owners or a large agency such as the u s forest service centrally managing the majority of the study region sims et al 2010 further we evaluated just four pre determined management strategies management actions could instead be optimized across a broad range of possibilities using machine learning techniques adelman and mersereau 2008 boutilier and lu 2016 lastly we defined our set of possible management actions by those that have been evaluated for glossy buckthorn fig 1 however the demographic structure of the model provides the valuable opportunity to assess any actions relevant to the species of interest such as the introduction of a biocontrol agent that reduces seed production or the strategic application of fire buckley et al 2004 davis et al 2006 grid based population models hold great potential for applications in conservation and management by incorporating both local and regional biological processes simulated management actions can target particular life stages within a limited spatial extent while the resultant effects occur within the context of the full landscape these models can help to clarify not only which management actions are likely to be most effective but also the locations that are most likely to lead to success the flexible nature of process based sdms allows for their application across a wide variety of taxa and management goals process based regional models are an opportunity to provide managers with data

24961,ecological models often strive to inform conservation and management decisions occurrence based distribution models may aid regional management strategies though many management decisions require information beyond the likely presence of a species provided by such models process based distribution models predict geographic distributions using environmental relationships with biological processes providing more detailed predictions and a key opportunity for data driven management here we develop and characterize a novel demography based regional distribution model and illustrate its use by comparing four management strategies for glossy buckthorn frangula alnus a bird dispersed shrub invasive throughout the northeastern united states on a gridded landscape in southern new hampshire and maine this population level simulation includes fruiting seed dispersal seed bank dynamics germination and establishment and annual survival with land cover as the dominant environmental driver we parameterize the model with field and lab studies supplementing with published data expert knowledge and pattern oriented parameterization with historical records in a comprehensive sensitivity analysis we found that the age at which individuals are capable of reproduction and the frequency of long distance dispersal had the strongest influence on the distribution in our management simulations we found that immigration prevents total eradication within any property regardless of management frequency or coordination though management impacts are detectable in nearby un managed cells via reduced seed deposition the flexible model structure combines multiple disparate data sources similar to those available for many species into a synthetic framework of local and regional biological processes allows the incorporation of specific management actions targeting particular processes and life stages into the regional context of a process based species distribution model and provides a robust method for evaluating potential management strategies keywords cellular automata grid based distribution spatially explicit population model 1 introduction ecological models are often constructed with a goal of informing conservation and management decisions buckley et al 2004 elith and leathwick 2009 mcmahon et al 2010 guisan et al 2013 and encompass a wide range of approaches models may help guide the prioritization of efforts by predicting future distributions of many species allen and bradley 2016 or may identify policy effects on critical life stages for a species of concern crowder et al 1994 morris and doak 2003 in particular simulation based approaches naturally incorporate the stochasticity uncertainty and complexity of ecologically detailed models morris and doak 2003 merow et al 2011 mcgowan et al 2017 accounting for inherent variability as well as data and process uncertainty can lead to more informed decisions based on the range of plausible outcomes and can highlight key data limitations further management actions though often implemented locally occur within an interconnected regional landscape that can affect resulting ecological dynamics merow et al 2011 species distribution models sdms predict species geographic distributions based on relationships with the environment and have been used in a variety of conservation applications the majority of sdms are occurrence based relying on correlations between observed presences and environmental covariates elith et al 2010 evans et al 2016 occurrence based sdms have many uses such as predicting current or future distributions and informing conservation priorities by generating maps of potential invasive species risk elith and leathwick 2009 guisan et al 2013 allen and bradley 2016 and are particularly appealing because of the availability of geolocated presence data in online repositories the predictions of occurrence based sdms can be improved by incorporating spatial dynamics including meta population and connectivity processes mestre et al 2017 alternatively process based sdms predict distributions by building relationships between biological processes and environmental covariates an approach more directly tied to the biology of the species kearney and porter 2009 buckley et al 2010 dormann et al 2012 cuddington et al 2013 evans et al 2016 options for process based sdms are varied for example the predictions can be temporally dynamic or static incorporate dispersal and utilize either individual level or population level relationships jongejans et al 2008 merow et al 2011 2017 aiello lammens 2014 compared to occurrence based sdms process based sdms require additional data to parameterize hindering their widespread adoption models for evaluating management strategies are often non spatial or involve only a small extent rees and payntert 1997 buckley et al 2004 davis et al 2006 ramula and buckley 2010 mirroring the local spatial scope of many management actions as applied models the structure is typically tailored to the biology and life history of the focal species the inclusion of particular biological processes allows for the comparison of management actions with differing effects such as biocontrol agents cover crops or manual removal of individuals rees and payntert 1997 buckley et al 2004 with sufficient data to inform impacts on life stages the predicted population level effects can be quantified to identify the method most likely to succeed in affecting the species long term abundance davis et al 2006 however past work has often made the simplifying assumption that populations occur in isolation without regional dynamics driven by dispersal of individuals within local neighborhoods and rarer long distance dispersal events as spatially explicit models that typically encompass broad geographic areas sdms hold great potential for informing the management of rare or invasive species occurrence based sdms have been constructed to identify locations vulnerable to future invasion jiménez valverde et al 2011 o donnell et al 2012 allen and bradley 2016 or particularly valuable critical habitats heinrichs et al 2010 while such products are highly valuable for agencies focused on regional planning many management decisions occur at finer spatial resolutions than sdms or must consider information beyond a species likely presence or absence as predicted by many sdms for instance managers often must assess the abundance and impact of the focal species while also balancing logistical constraints matzek et al 2015 further management options are diverse possible actions for an invasive species may include manual removal application of herbicide planting of a cover crop or introduction of a biocontrol agent each of which affects the population differently rees and payntert 1997 buckley et al 2004 davis et al 2006 the evaluation of management decisions could be greatly aided by models incorporating these differing effects within a broader landscape here we develop an approach to construct process based sdms to simulate local management actions with the expanded realism of regional population dynamics we link previously disparate models of demographically driven species abundance dispersal dynamics and management actions on specific life stages into a single cohesive modeling framework that is flexible and adaptable to many species we illustrate with glossy buckthorn frangula alnus a bird dispersed shrub native to eurasia and invasive throughout the northeastern united states on a gridded landscape the model includes mechanistic dispersal and seed bank dynamics in addition to spatially varying flowering probability fruit production survival and seedling establishment we demonstrate the effect of propagule pressure when managing glossy buckthorn in a regional landscape with heterogeneous management strategies and show the level of spatial coordination needed to achieve local control targets given the species biology the flexible structure of the model accommodates modification according to the biology of the focal species as well as incorporation of biologically realistic effects of management actions spatially explicit process based models such as this provide a key opportunity to ground management decisions in the species biology and the best available data 2 methods 2 1 model structure the model simulates the mechanistic growth and spread of a species across a gridded landscape based on spatially varying biological processes fig 1 and table 1 the model structure reflects the life history of a bird dispersed perennial shrub yet is adaptable to other life histories and dispersal agents within each occupied cell population and life history dynamics are driven by vital rates and demographic parameters which can be global fig 1 light purple or dependent on the local environment fig 1 dark blue populations are connected through the movement of seeds via mechanistic short distance dispersal and random long distance dispersal we define long distance dispersal as any dispersal event beyond the range of the short distance dispersal neighborhood including rare natural disperser movements in addition to intentional and unintentional human mediated dispersal density dependence is implemented by directly limiting the abundance within each cell merow et al 2011 because of the biological detail simulated management actions can target particular processes or life stages such as by reducing seedling establishment through planted cover crops or by reducing abundances through manual removal or herbicide application fig 1 2 1 1 fecundity at the start of each time step t individuals flower and produce fruits the total number of fruits f produced in cell i in year t is calculated as 1 f it n it f i μ i where n it is the number of adults in cell i in year t f i is the probability that an adult in cell i flowers and μ i is the mean number of fruits produced by a flowering adult in cell i both f and μ are dependent on the cell environment as indicated by the subscript i 2 1 2 dispersal the fruits produced f it are consumed by animal dispersers or drop from the plant to remain in the local population the seeds in consumed fruits are transported and deposited in the local cell i or in the short distance dispersal neighborhood of cell i we assume a single primary natural dispersal vector though additional dispersal vectors could be readily added the number of seeds s in cell i in year t is therefore 2 s it f it 1 c i γ not consumed dropped f it c i γ s c e 0 5 r consumed deposited in i j 1 j i f jt c j γ s c 1 e 0 5 r δ ji immigrants to i from j where s it is the number of seeds deposited in cell i c i is the probability that a fruit in cell i is consumed by a disperser γ is the mean number of seeds per fruit s c is the probability that a consumed seed remains viable e 0 5r is the probability that a consumed seed remains in cell i based on an exponential distribution with rate r merow et al 2011 δ ji is the probability that an immigrant seed from cell j lands in cell i and j i is the number of cells within the maximum short distance dispersal radius sdd max consequently each seed produced in cell i has four possible fates a seed may 1 drop in cell i without being consumed 2 be consumed and deposited in cell i 3 be consumed and deposited in a nearby cell or 4 perish the probability of a seed originating in cell i dispersing to cell j δ ji is described by an exponential kernel modified by the expected habitat preferences of the dispersal agents 3 δ ji e x j x i r l j η where x j x i is the distance between the centroids of cells i and j and the j cells in the dispersal neighborhood for i are weighted by the expected habitat use of the dispersers merow et al 2011 calculated as the dot product of the land cover composition in the target cell l j and the vector of habitat preferences η the exponential kernel with decay rate r represents the distribution of distances a dispersal agent is likely to travel between consuming a fruit and defecating to deposit the seeds however dispersers will preferentially travel to cells with an abundance of their preferred habitat accordingly the probability for each cell is multiplied by the dot product of the land cover composition and the preference for each land cover type thus for a given distance dispersal probabilities are higher for cells with a high proportion of disperser preferred habitat for each short distance dispersal neighborhood i e the j cells surrounding i the probabilities δ 1 j i are standardized to sum to 1 representing the dispersal probability conditional on first emigrating from the source cell the calculation of each δ ji therefore incorporates the distance between i and j as well as the movement patterns digestion times and habitat preferences of the dispersers long distance dispersal is stochastic and inherently difficult to predict but can be critical to the range expansion of invasive species trakhtenbrot et al 2005 merow et al 2011 in addition to rare long distance movements by birds merow et al 2011 which could be considered as rare occurrences following the same mechanism as short distance dispersal we also include human mediated dispersal in our definition of long distance dispersal to incorporate unintentional transportation of fruits or seeds and intentional planting of individuals reichard and white 2001 lehan et al 2013 we therefore include long distance dispersal as a separate component in the model which also reduces computational requirements by limiting the size of short distance dispersal neighborhoods thus in each year one successfully established seedling is placed in each of n ldd random cells on the landscape regardless of whether the cells are already occupied 2 1 3 seed dynamics the s it seeds deposited in cell i

system description we illustrate the model using glossy buckthorn frangula alnus a shrub native to eurasia that was introduced in north america by 1879 and has since become invasive in much of the northeastern united states catling and porebski 1994 johnson et al 2006 webster et al 2006 aiello lammens 2014 glossy buckthorn persists in forest understories but forms dense thickets in open canopy burnham and lee 2010 in addition to reducing recreational value glossy buckthorn causes particular damage to forestry operations after trees have been harvested buckthorn densities increase dramatically in canopy gaps out competing commercial timber species such as eastern white pine frappier et al 2003 lanzer et al 2017 lee et al 2017 glossy buckthorn produces fleshy fruits throughout the summer that are consumed and dispersed by a variety of bird species craves 2015 in the northeastern united states the most likely dispersers include european starlings american robins and cedar waxwings mccay et al 2009 we focus on southern new hampshire and maine in the northeastern united states an area where glossy buckthorn is abundant and eastern white pine forests are reasonably common fig 2 black outline in inset within this regional extent we assume that land cover type is the dominant factor affecting glossy buckthorn biological rates pearson and dawson 2003 the landscape consists of 240 656 grid cells 4 813 120 acres 19 478 km2 with a resolution of 20 acres 8 1 ha 285 285 m we specify biological rates for glossy buckthorn in six land cover classes open deciduous forest mixed forest white pine forest other evergreen forest and other where possible using the land cover composition in each cell to calculate aggregate expected rates across the landscape we used a land cover map of the predicted proportion of each land cover class in each 20 acre cell appendix a the map was created to represent glossy buckthorn habitat affinities via a modeled synthesis of two land cover datasets the 2001 national land cover database homer et al 2007 and the more detailed new hampshire land cover map justice et al 2002 we used environmental anthropogenic and topographic data to predict discrepancies between the land cover datasets and to align categorization differences to produce a single compositional land cover map across the study extent at the desired resolution szewczyk et al in review 2 2 2 parameterization and sensitivity analyses to parameterize the model we used a combination of field and lab experiments supplemented by published data from the literature expert knowledge and pattern matching table 1 and appendix a when data for glossy buckthorn were unavailable we used ecologically similar species namely the woody shrub lindera benzoin and the fleshy fruit producing invasive vine celastrus orbiculatus see appendix a for extensive parameter specific details and additional information regarding data sources the earliest record of glossy buckthorn within the study area fig 2 black outline in inset is in southern new hampshire in 1922 aiello lammens 2014 this record served as the initial introduction site for the sensitivity analysis and population initialization we used historical records to identify the dispersal parameters that best captured the observed spread aiello lammens 2014 eddmap 2016 then we ran 1000 iterations for 96 years 1922 2018 each using the average abundances in each cell to represent the predicted abundance of glossy buckthorn in the study region from initial introduction to the year 2018 this final distribution served as the initial year in simulations comparing management strategies such that the management actions occur in the present environment as predicted by the model we performed a global sensitivity analysis to explore the plausible parameter space and understand model behavior prowse et al 2016 aiello lammens and akçakaya 2017 rather than performing sensitivity analyses for each parameter in isolation a global sensitivity analysis simultaneously selects values for all parameters this approach effectively marginalizes across any interactions between parameters to provide a holistic estimation of the effect of each parameter on the model predictions we set plausible parameter ranges based on field studies lab studies the literature and expert opinion table a 1 we drew random values from uniform distributions within these ranges to generate 25 000 parameter sets running one iteration of the model for each parameter set prowse et al 2016 despite the stochastic dispersal in the model a single iteration allows for a more efficient exploration of the parameter space compared to multiple iterations per draw with a more limited number of draws prowse et al 2016 for each draw we simulated the population for 50 years from the initial introduction and then calculated the proportion of cells occupied by adults the proportion of cells with a seed bank the proportion of occupied cells that had reached carrying capacity the mean and median abundance in occupied cells and the variance in abundance among occupied cells to evaluate each parameter s effect on each response metric we used boosted regression trees brts with all parameters included as predictors elith et al 2008 prowse et al 2016 brts use the machine learning technique of boosting to create an ensemble model of regression trees to optimize predictive performance using the weights of the regression trees included in the ensemble model the relative influence of each parameter can then be calculated elith et al 2008 we compared tree complexities of 1 3 and 5 to ensure that the parameter space was adequately explored each brt was fit with bootstrapped subsets of varying size with cross validation deviance and stability of the relative influence estimates calculated across subsets prowse et al 2016 for parameters that varied by land cover type we included the value for each of the six land cover types as predictors to fit the brt and summed the relative influence for example we fit each brt with f open f other included as separate predictors then summed the relative influence to calculate an overall relative influence for f see additional detail in appendix b we used pattern oriented parameterization to identify the best estimates for dispersal grimm et al 2005 merow et al 2011 grimm and railsback 2005 we compiled geo located presences of glossy buckthorn by combining herbarium records aiello lammens 2014 and occurrences from the eddmaps database eddmap 2016 for each cell with an observation we calculated the earliest observation we varied the mean short distance dispersal distance 1 r the maximum short distance dispersal distance sdd max and the number of annual long distance dispersal events n ldd in the same manner as the main global sensitivity analysis with all other parameters set to best estimates taking 5000 samples each iteration was initialized as above and run for 96 years representing the predicted spread through 2018 then we selected the median values for each parameter from the parameter draws that correctly predicted at least 90 of the historical spread 2 2 3 management simulations the university of new hampshire manages woodland properties throughout the state of new hampshire these properties vary in size from 11 to 334 acres and are centrally managed with goals aimed toward a variety of purposes including recreation wildlife habitat and academic uses the abundance of glossy buckthorn and other invasive plants is variable among properties and stated management strategies range from monitoring to regular treatment to no action https colsa unh edu woodlands managed properties in practice the realized management actions on each property depend on a combination of logistical constraints and broader goals we simulated possible strategies for managing glossy buckthorn on 12 of the woodland properties in southeastern new hampshire fig 2 and table 2 to initialize the landscape we ran 1000 simulations for 96 years each 1922 2018 using best estimates for each parameter table a 1 and calculating the mean abundance across simulations of the seed bank and of each age category within each land cover type in each cell for computational efficiency the landscape and initial distribution were then truncated to the bounding box enclosing 2 sdd max around the focal properties fig 2 red outline then we evaluated four sets of management plans no management the stated management plan the actual management actions and an aggressive plan table 2 each strategy was implemented for 1000 simulations of 20 years each to assess the effect of management actions on glossy buckthorn populations within and around each property 3 results our model predicts not only the probability of occurrence in each cell of the landscape but also the abundance of each life stage and the spatial distribution of biological processes and rates in our illustration with glossy buckthorn the predicted abundance of adults was highest in cells with more open habitat and less forest fig 3 a reflecting the affinity of glossy buckthorn for higher light levels cunard and lee 2009 burnham and lee 2010 in contrast seedling establishment rates show less geographic variation despite varying among land cover types fig 3b the total propagule pressure i e the total seeds deposited in a cell is high only near the abundance hotspots fig 3c individuals produce more fruit under open canopies and the pattern of per capita seed production thus mirrors that of adult abundance and propagule pressure fig 3d based on the total propagule pressure and the number of seeds immigrating to each cell fig 3e the relative abundance of local and immigrant seeds can be calculated fig 3f thus process based sdms allow the examination of the spatial variation in each biological rate or process providing information valuable for management decisions the relative influence of parameters was stable for all metrics across sample sizes greater than 20 000 fig b 2 and we base our analysis on 25 000 samples of the parameter space the parameters with greatest influence varied with the metric of interest fig 4 the number of annual long distance dispersal events n ldd and the age of adulthood m primarily drove the proportion of cells occupied both for adults and for seeds with smaller effects of the short distance dispersal rate r and juvenile survival s m the proportion of occupied cells reaching carrying capacity and the mean and median abundance were most strongly affected by the age of adulthood with secondary effects of the juvenile survival rate and for mean abundance carrying capacity k in contrast the variance of abundance in occupied cells was driven by carrying capacity the number of annual long distance dispersal events had a large impact on the ability to accurately predict the historic spread of glossy buckthorn reaffirming the results of the global sensitivity analysis the short distance dispersal rate had a moderate influence while the maximum short distance dispersal distance had little effect the accurate prediction of the distribution required abundant long distance dispersal n ldd 19 annual events with a short distance dispersal rate of 0 0378 and a maximum distance of 27 cells 7 7 km in the management simulations glossy buckthorn density on each property approached or reached carrying capacity in the absence of management actions fig c 16 the stated plan actual actions and aggressive strategy all decreased buckthorn adult and seed density relative to no action on properties that implemented management fig 5 however even the aggressive strategy failed to fully eliminate glossy buckthorn fig 5 right column despite repeated cutting spraying and planting of cover crops minimum density per property 1 4 101 adults 20 acre the seed bank was reduced but maintained at a lower equilibrium by the remaining adults as well as immigration from nearby cells fig 5 bottom row consequently the abundance of glossy buckthorn adults quickly rebounded in the intervening years between treatments due to the surviving juveniles and the persistent propagule pressure from surrounding cells 4 discussion the process based sdm presented here incorporates several biological processes in the context of a bird dispersed shrub the flexible structure makes this framework suitable for a wide array of species and life histories the added complexity confers several key benefits including insight into the geographic variation in vital rates and the ability to simulate specific targeted effects of management actions with local decisions implemented in the broader regional context we illustrated such a use by evaluating management strategies for the invasive shrub glossy buckthorn on 12 centrally managed properties in southeastern new hampshire showing persistent spillover effects from nearby un managed cells process based sdms provide much more detailed predictions than occurrence based sdms merow et al 2011 2017 by incorporating biological rates and processes that vary across environmental gradients they allow for spatial predictions of processes such as germination or flowering rates merow et al 2017 exploration of these predictions may highlight management methods or locations that are likely to be most fruitful whether for reducing the abundance of an invasive species or conversely increasing the abundance of a threatened species for example a regional strategy for managing glossy buckthorn may involve targeting populations that produce a large number of emigrant seeds to efficiently reduce the propagule pressure of the surrounding area fig c 12 incorporating mechanistic dispersal in a simulation framework extends the possibilities further temporally dynamic simulations may identify dispersal corridors for species highlighting areas to protect or monitor compared to sdms with simple population growth merow et al 2011 the model presented here includes age structured populations and reproductive processes aggregating and collecting data to inform these processes across an adequate environmental gradient may be more logistically feasible than estimating intrinsic growth rates across a similar gradient further a model built directly on biological processes may produce more accurate predictions in the face of a changing climate particularly if parameterized with warming or transplant experiments jiménez valverde et al 2011 evans et al 2016 in the global sensitivity analysis we constrained the range of each parameter according to available data the relative influence therefore reflects a combination of the inherent sensitivity of the output to that parameter and the breadth of the plausible range in contrast using the full allowable range for each parameter e g 0 1 for a probability reveals solely the sensitivity that is structural in the model incorporating data driven constraints on the ranges highlights parameters for which additional data would be most valuable and lead to the greatest improvements in predictions if a distinction between the influence of structural sensitivity and data uncertainty is required one could compare a sensitivity analysis performed with data driven ranges to one performed with full possible ranges our results show that the number of annual long distance dispersal events the age of maturity and the juvenile survival rate are influential across several grid wide metrics while long distance dispersal is inherently difficult to predict higgins and richardson 1999 buchan and padilla 1999 future models of glossy buckthorn would most benefit from additional data clarifying juvenile mortality and the age at which individuals are capable of producing fruit across a range of environments we identified best estimates for each dispersal parameter using a pattern oriented approach with historical records of glossy buckthorn compared to celastrus orbiculatus a bird dispersed invasive vine in new england our model of glossy buckthorn required broader short distance dispersal and more annual long distance dispersal events merow et al 2011 we propose three hypotheses for this difference relative to previous work first our definition of long distance dispersal is broader including not only rare long distance bird dispersal but also unintentional and intentional human mediated events like many invasive plants glossy buckthorn was planted in gardens as an ornamental shrub particularly early in its introduction history catling and porebski 1994 reichard and white 2001 aiello lammens 2014 and so a high number of dispersal events reflects this history second we modeled a relatively modest regional extent and glossy buckthorn occurs beyond our study borders catling and porebski 1994 aiello lammens 2014 craves 2015 increased long distance dispersal could reflect dispersal from beyond our landscape boundaries a phenomenon likely to be less influential in the model of c orbiculatus across the entirety of the northeastern united states third we used a high resolution grid to evaluate management scenarios and consequently dispersing seeds must cross more grid cells per unit distance because dispersal probability exponentially decreases with distance from the source cell dispersal requires more steps on a high resolution grid than on a coarser grid which is compensated for by a flatter exponential distribution for short distance dispersal process based sdms which construct distributions based on biological processes are often assumed to be superior to occurrence based sdms which construct distributions by relating occurrence data to environmental variables jiménez valverde et al 2011 evans et al 2016 merow et al 2017 however the application of grid based simulations with simple population growth and mechanistic dispersal for predicting species distributions has been minimal merow et al 2011 more complex integral projection models incorporate individual level data into vital rate regressions and can be used to predict population growth rates across a region merow et al 2014 2017 the data that are available or feasibly collected constrain the plausible choices for process based sdms estimating intrinsic population growth rates typically requires population estimates across several years and the accuracy is quite sensitive to inter annual stochastic variation morris and doak 2003 mccain et al 2016 loehle and weatherford 2017 similarly integral projection models require multi year labor intensive studies to measure and track individuals across a sufficiently broad environmental gradient aiello lammens 2014 merow et al 2014 2017 the model presented here represents an alternative that uses data that may be more readily available in the literature or more quickly collected in the field with intermediate model complexity often sdms are built at fairly coarse resolutions with pixels on the order of multiple square kilometers elith and leathwick 2009 ibánez et al 2009 merow et al 2011 bellard et al 2013 allen and bradley 2016 at these scales regional variables such as climate tend to be most influential huston 1999 pearson and dawson 2003 keil et al 2012 fraterrigo et al 2014 and the models are agnostic regarding sub pixel variation in the species occurrence or abundance stakeholders deciding how to monitor and manage individual properties require more detailed predictions than coarse scale models can provide these managers would benefit most from high resolution models predicting the probable abundance or risk within each property matzek et al 2015 hyper local plant distributions are often determined by variables such as light availability soil type or canopy species guisan and thuiller 2005 elith and leathwick 2009 burnham and lee 2010 as well as the stochastic placement of individuals grimm et al 2005 while a model can be parameterized using these local variables predictions may then be limited to hypothetical good or bad local habitats since the local variables are unknown at a regional extent merow et al 2017 thus there is a critical scale mismatch between the models ecologists are often able to build and the models that would be most useful for applied management decisions matzek et al 2015 process based regional models such as the model presented here are a step toward rectifying this mismatch and could be combined with statistical downscaling to predict local distributions on particular properties wu and david 2002 keil et al 2013 barwell et al 2014 the specific model presented here describes a bird dispersed woody shrub however the structure is easily modified for different life histories or dispersal methods for example a biennial plant could be modeled by setting the age at maturity to 2 and adult survival to 0 to model a wind dispersed species short distance dispersal neighborhoods could be increased in size and modified by wind patterns if data are available nathan et al 2011 importantly additional variables such as climate topography or even the distribution of competitor species can be included rather than solely land cover such that parameters are calculated in each cell based on regressions merow et al 2017 carlo et al 2018 fern et al 2019 in the absence of available data to inform these regressions sensitivity analyses could identify the impact of data based uncertainty further simulations could incorporate parameter uncertainty by selecting values from a specified distribution in each iteration essentially adopting a bayesian approach to produce a more robust assessment of the likely distribution morris and doak 2003 clark 2005 szewczyk and mccain 2019 rather than assuming simplistic dynamics among habitat types density dependent habitat selection could be included depending on the species life history menezes and kotler 2019 this model employs average population values assuming that individual variation is negligible to the metrics of interest a similar grid based structure could be combined with regression models of individual based traits and the environmental conditions within each cell to account for individual differences as in integral projection models merow et al 2014 2017 however a key benefit of a population level model is the lower data requirement compared to an individual level model where tagged individuals must be monitored and measured across years dynamic sdms with mechanistic dispersal and biologically realistic processes hold great potential for management planning while we focused on an established invasive a newly introduced species could be projected into the future to identify unoccupied areas highly vulnerable to invasion and the local and regional success of management options weighed alternatively policies for increasing the abundance or distribution of rare species could be evaluated for example populations of grassland birds such as the bobolink and eastern meadowlark have seen dramatic declines in the northeastern united states resulting from changes in land use bollinger et al 1990 foster 2002 foster et al 2002 state agencies and non governmental organizations are currently attempting to increase their abundance by preserving or creating suitable grassland habitat foster and motzkin 2003 hill et al 2014 with the modelling framework presented here managers could compare the effects of improving habitat in different locations to maximize the impact of their efforts further conservation organizations advocate for several strategies to align agricultural practices with nesting habits including delaying hay harvests to lower juvenile mortality and reducing grazing to minimize nest destruction bollinger et al 1990 hill et al 2014 the relative effectiveness of these options could be compared incorporating regional heterogeneity in their effects thus this model structure provides the ability to identify the most sensitive life stages and processes as well as the most critical localities the interconnected regional context in our management simulations includes cells beyond the purview of the focal manager and we assumed that glossy buckthorn was not controlled in any non focal cells future work could predict management within each cell of the landscape for example integration with decision models could allow each simulated land owner to decide how to manage the species epanchin niell and wilen 2014 alternatively coordinated regional strategies could be evaluated representing cooperation among land owners or a large agency such as the u s forest service centrally managing the majority of the study region sims et al 2010 further we evaluated just four pre determined management strategies management actions could instead be optimized across a broad range of possibilities using machine learning techniques adelman and mersereau 2008 boutilier and lu 2016 lastly we defined our set of possible management actions by those that have been evaluated for glossy buckthorn fig 1 however the demographic structure of the model provides the valuable opportunity to assess any actions relevant to the species of interest such as the introduction of a biocontrol agent that reduces seed production or the strategic application of fire buckley et al 2004 davis et al 2006 grid based population models hold great potential for applications in conservation and management by incorporating both local and regional biological processes simulated management actions can target particular life stages within a limited spatial extent while the resultant effects occur within the context of the full landscape these models can help to clarify not only which management actions are likely to be most effective but also the locations that are most likely to lead to success the flexible nature of process based sdms allows for their application across a wide variety of taxa and management goals process based regional models are an opportunity to provide managers with data driven science based actionable information to maximize the success of conservation decisions authors contribution tim m szewczyk conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation

24962,nitrogen runoff in certain southeastern australian grasslands promotes the invasion of exotic grassland species at the expense of native species mitigation programs can reduce runoff and thus support native species but their success may require the awareness and support of local populations this situation represents a coupled socio ecological system since nitrogen runoff caused by local populations can enable the invasion of exotic grassland species which can in turn stimulate a social response to restore the native species our objective is to use a mathematical model to identify potential socio ecological mechanisms for the persistence of native grassland species and the parameter regimes for which these mechanisms operate we couple a model of southeastern australian grassland dynamics with a model of human social dynamics concerning runoff mitigation nitrogen runoff can enter the ecosystem either through local sources under control of a human population or through global sources not under their control humans learn mitigating behaviour socially and respond to the prevalence of native and exotic grassland species we find that socio ecological dynamics introduce broad parameter regimes that are not present in the ecological system in isolation from the human system we identify two mechanisms for native grassland persistence one is associated with significant reductions in runoff rates and or cost of runoff mitigation programs resulting in a stable state where the native grassland species exists or dominates with or without the support of socio ecological feedback a second mechanism associated with higher rates of nitrogen input supports persistence of the native species through oscillations in species abundance and mitigation behaviour in the human population however this state is less favourable to the native species because the oscillations may become extreme in amplitude finally we find that increasing the cost of mitigation programs not only reduces mitigating behaviour in the population but also more surprisingly increases the tendency for the system to destabilize into a regime of oscillations in native species biomass we conclude that multiple socio ecological mechanisms could potentially support native species in grassland ecosystems under stress from nitrogen runoff and invasive species further research can refine such models to inform policy in the face of nonlinear socio ecological responses keywords grassland dynamics coupled human environment system game theory replicator dynamics nitrogen runoff mitigation socio ecological dynamics 1 introduction numerous ecosystems around the world are negatively impacted by deposition processes that input excessive nutrients pollu tants or sediments into the ecosystem through processes such as runoff hazbavi et al 2018 for instance lake ecosystems are adapted to natural background rates of nitrogen input but excessive nitrogen loading due to runoff from industrial or agricultural sources can cause lakes to flip from a clear oligographic state to a eutrophic state where the lake is overgrown by algae causing fish populations to suffer smith et al 1999 scheffer 1997 similarly excessive sedimentation impedes the growth and function of coral reefs rogers 1990 detrimental effects may lead to catastrophic shifts in ecosystem state such as forest collapse due to acidification or lake eutrophication qin et al 2013 hoegberg et al 2006 rehabilitating these degraded systems and restoring the ecological balance requires significant effort over long periods of time depending on the severity of the degradation daily 1995 a further example of these effects has been observed in grasslands subject to excessive levels of nitrogen deposition for instance exotic grassland species primarily originating from africa and europe are capable of invading native southeastern australian grasslands at sufficiently high rates of nitrogen deposition williams et al 2005 chisholm et al 2015 exotic grasses and plants are often better competitors for sunlight and with sufficient soil nitration can out compete native grassland species this alters the biodiversity in these ecosystems and also causes a decline in grassland productivity brodie and mitchell 2005 isbell et al 2013 while also affecting neighbouring ecosystems williams et al 2005 some of these exotic species are more flammable than native species d antonio and vitousek 1992 causing fire to encroach on nonflammable regions and or increasing the intensity of fires in other cases invasion can cause other changes to the local ecology where once open water systems are subsequently colonized by the exotic grass species creating wetlands in their place d antonio and vitousek 1992 although exotic grassland species are not without benefits such as providing grazing d antonio and vitousek 1992 the touristic agroeconomic and cultural benefits of native grassland species are considerable and wide ranging williams et al 2005 williams and cary 2001 henderson et al 2016a cordero et al 2018 as such many stakeholders wish to maintain and preserve grassland ecosystems based on native grassland species programs such as australia s environmental stewardship program utilize incentive based payments and promote a sense of stewardship to persuade landowners to protect and rehabilitate native ecosystems these programs have shown successes in protecting australian grasslands through landowner participation burns et al 2016 the development of this and other environmental protection programs in other countries are generally stimulated by the degradation of natural ecosystems and require public support for environment protection expressed either through grass roots efforts or through pressure for government interventions hence many natural ecological systems and human systems can be conceptualized as a coupled socio ecological system equivalently human environment system or coupled human and natural system human activities impact an ecological system and the resulting changes in the ecological system in turn influence human opinion and behaviour often to the point of altering the trajectory of these ecosystems toward restoration of their natural state liu et al 2007 innes et al 2013 kramer et al 2017 this human response to human caused changes in natural systems is widespread and has implications for ecological modeling henderson et al 2016b davis et al 2001 bauch et al 2016 mather and fairbairn 2000 cinner et al 2009 thampi et al 2018 bennett and mcginnis 2008 howe et al 2013 models of coupled socio ecological systems capture how human system dynamics influence natural system dynamics and vice versa liu et al 2007 innes et al 2013 kramer et al 2017 coupled socio ecological models typically consist of an ecological model coupled with a human model derived from economic social or psychological assumptions these socio ecological models can be used to study how nonlinear ecological and social feedbacks modify the effectiveness of policy interventions among other phenomena some examples of systems for which socio ecological models have been developed include forest harvesting satake et al 2007 forest pests barlow et al 2014 forest grassland mosaics henderson et al 2016a b common pool resource problems lade et al 2013 richter and dakos 2015 water sharing nhim et al 2018 vaccination preferences oraby et al 2014 and coral reef ecosystems thampi et al 2018 these models can be used to gain insights into socio ecological dynamics identify conditions for extinction or persistence of natural system states and determine policies that are most likely to support persistence of natural states in the face of socio ecological feedbacks many of the natural systems subject to damage from deposition processes including those that could be characterized as coupled socio ecological systems exhibit alternative stable states where the ecosystem can persist in one state or in a dramatically different state depending on initial system conditions scheffer 1997 an implication of alternative stable states is that gradually changing environmental conditions may push the ecosystem past a threshold beyond which the state of the system flips abruptly to a new and contrasting state beisner et al 2003 these sudden regime shifts have been observed in the cases of lake eutrophication smith et al 1999 scheffer 1997 and invasion of exotic grassland species in australia chisholm et al 2015 for example as a result of these nontrivial dynamics alternative stable states in ecological systems is a frequent subject of ecological modelling efforts scheffer 1997 chisholm et al 2015 beisner et al 2003 staver et al 2011 however socio ecological models have identified conditions under which socio ecological feedbacks can remove naturally occurring alternative stable states innes et al 2013 thampi et al 2018 a coupled socio ecological model of native and exotic grasses subject to human caused nitrogen deposition has not been explored in the literature to our knowledge therefore the impact of socio ecological feedback on species composition and alternative stable states in those ecosystems is an open question here we extend an existing ecological model that captures the effects of excessive nitrogen deposition on southeastern australian grasslands chisholm et al 2015 the model predicts that these grasslands can exhibit bistability with grasslands being dominated either by the native grassland species or an alternative state dominated by the exotic grassland species due to higher nitrogen input nitrogen pollution in such systems may be broken down into contributions from global sources not under the control of local populations such as atmospheric deposition from distant industrial sources versus contributions from local sources that can be controlled by local populations such as runoff from local fertilizer usage in agricultural lands or local industries vitousek et al 1997 stevens et al 2004 hence we create a socio ecological model of this system by coupling a model of a human social subsystem that can control the contribution of local but not global nitrogen sources with the existing grassland model chisholm et al 2015 the prevalence of mitigating behaviour in the human population depends on mitigation costs social learning social norms and the current ecosystem state unlike most previous socio ecological models this allows us to model a human population where only a certain proportion of environmental impact can be controlled by the local population we formulate the model using known features of the southeastern australian grasslands socio ecological system and other similar systems vaccination dynamics ecosystem dynamics etc thampi et al 2018 oraby et al 2014 we analyze it numerically to identify asymptotic dynamical states and their dependence on model parameters our objective is to identify potential socio ecological mechanisms for the persistence of native grassland species and the parameter regimes for which these mechanisms operate this allows us to understand what are the impacts of changing the cost of nitrogen runoff mitigation and what kind of dynamical regimes are observed in the socio ecological model that would not be observed in an ecological model assuming a fixed human influence our approach is to explore the model s parameter space in order to gain qualitative insights into possible dynamical regimes and their dependence on parameter trends rather than fitting the model toempirical data in order to obtain quantitative predictions for a specific population and time 2 methods 2 1 model overview the socio ecological model divides the human population into a proportion x who support conservation of natural grasslands by reducing nitrogen runoff mitigators and a proportion 1 x who do not non mitigators support may be through individual actions to reduce runoff or through supporting the implementation of local mitigation programs or bylaws individ uals switch between these two strategies according to a social learning process determined by the cost of conserving native grasslands the prevalence of native grasslands and social norms grassland dynamics are determined by an existing model chisholm et al 2015 wherein native and exotic species of grass compete and nitrogen input may cause a critical transition from native dominated to exotic dominated grassland states in our socio ecological model the input rate of nitrogen from local sources is reduced according to the current proportion of mitigators in the population additional details about the model structure and assumptions appear in model construction where we first explain the existing grassland model and then build on this first model by introducing the coupled socio ecological model following that we explain our parameterization and approach to model analysis 2 2 model construction a previous model chisholm et al 2015 was extended to a coupled socio ecological system we built on this model because it is relatively simple exhibits alternative stable states according to nitrogen runoff rates and was developed for the southeastern australian grassland ecosystem the previous model is represented by the system of differential equations 1 d b n d t b n ω n v n a μ n m n f n b n b e 2 d b e d t b e ω e v e a μ e m e f e b n b e 3 d a d t i k a b n v n a μ n m n f n b n b e 1 δ n ω n b e v e a μ e m e f e b n b e 1 δ e ω e here bn and be represent the biomass of native and exotic species respectively and a represents the environmental nitrogen level the model assumes a fixed nitrogen input rate i in addition the model assumes interspecific light competition between the native and exotic species governed by the functions fn bn be and fe bn be see ref chisholm et al 2015 for details the environmental nitrogen level is determined by the nutrient deposition constant i parameters are defined along with their baseline values in table 1 this model represents human impact through a fixed parameter i representing the rate of nitrogen input however social behaviour is dynamic and varies based on perceptions of ecological conditions hence we write down a dynamic equation for x the proportion of the population that supports nitrogen runoff mitigation to preserve native grasslands mitigators conversely the remaining proportion 1 x are assumed to adopt a non mitigator strategy we use utility functions to quantify the incentive to adopt mitigator or non mitigator strategies we let um unm represent the utility for mitigators non mitigators utility functions are used in game theory to quantify the motivation whether economic psychological social or otherwise to adopt a strategy innes et al 2013 rabin 1993 bauch 2005 um is given by 4 u m z η b e b n b e ϕ x where z represents the cost to protect native grassland species by reducing personal contributions to nitrogen runoff or personal efforts to support bylaws and mitigation programs that reduce runoff η is a proportionality constant that controls the sensitivity of the mitigator utility to the amount of native grassland cover and φ controls the strength of social norms thampi et al 2018 barlow et al 2014 oraby et al 2014 this utility function captures how the utility for mitigation increases as the native grassland cover bn becomes rare similarly unm is given by 5 u n m w ϕ 1 x where w is the cost associated with producing nitrogen runoff such as fines paid for bylaw violations when um unm 0 the preservation of native grassland species becomes a more valuable strategy whereas when unm um 0 the population starts to abandon conservation we assume that each individual samples other individuals at rate k0 social learning and that upon encountering someone with a different strategy the individual switches strategies with a probability proportional to the difference in utility with proportionality constant p0 hence after re scaling the differential equation governing x is given by 6 d x d t k x 1 x w b e b n b e ε 2 x 1 where k k 0 p 0 η is the rescaled rate of social learning w z w η is the rescaled net cost of mitigation and ε ϕ η is the effect of social norms despite this rescaling changes in rescaled parameters have a clear interpretation in terms of the original parameter definitions for instance an increase in w without a change in other parameters corresponds to an increase in the cost of mitigation hence we will continue to refer to this as the rescaled net mitigation cost similar interpretations apply to κ and ε although changes in η correspond to simultaneous changes in w κ and ε we note that these equations are identical to the replicator dynamics used in evolutionary game theory hofbauer and sigmund 1998 cressman and tao 2014 further examples and full derivation of this differential equation can be found elsewhere innes et al 2013 henderson et al 2016b bauch 2005 helbing 2010 only a proportion of nitrogen runoff is under the control of local human populations such as municipalities while the remainder can be due to upstream sources or atmospheric deposition hence we assume that total nitrogen is flowing into the grasslands comes from global sources that are not under the control of the local population at a rate j as well as from local sources at a rate ρ that is reduced by a factor 1 x in proportion to the prevalence of mitigators x the socio ecological model for the southeastern australian grasslands is therefore 7 d b n d t b n ω n v n a μ n m n f n b n b e 8 d b e d t b e ω e v e a μ e m e f e b n b e 9 d a d t j ρ 1 x k a b n v n a μ n m n f n b n b e 1 δ n ω

appears in fig 1 in eq 3 nitrogen input occurs at a fixed rate i whereas in eq 9 nitrogen input is the sum of a fixed input rate j and a local nitrogen input term ρ 1 x that depends upon x we note that this model assumes the effects of the human population on nitrogen runoff to unfold continuously in time through the ρ 1 x term hence this approach could capture situations where existing bylaws recommendations or guidelines can wax or wane smoothly depending on factors such as individual participation in programs and public support for enforcement of existing bylaws or based on the current state or level of economic development however it would not capture discrete events such as a sudden drop in nitrogen runoff after introducing a new bylaw we note that the cases x 0 and x 1 reduce the model to that of chisholm et al chisholm et al 2015 where nitrogen input is fixed 2 3 parameterization model parameters concerning the grassland subsystem were taken from the previous grassland model chisholm et al 2015 the additional model parameters govern human social dynamics and the coupling between the human and grassland subsystems these additional parameters were calibrated to satisfy two conditions that met our objective of obtaining qualitative insights into dynamics firstly we required that application of human effort to curb nitrogen input should cause a decline in exotic grassland species and an increase in the native species and vice versa in order for the model to be consistent with experience from australia s environmental stewardship program secondly we chose a region of parameter space in which native and exotic species could co exist and the proportion of mitigators and non mitigators were nonzero these two conditions ensured that parameter variation away from the baseline values produced a meaningful change in model dynamics that could be explored through time series and parameter planes the resulting baseline parameter values appear in table 1 2 4 baseline simulation the model was numerically simulated in matlab using the ode23 solver a time series of the model simulation at the baseline parameter values provides insight into how the model assumptions translate into the observed dyanamics and especially the interactions between natural and human variables fig 2 the time series shows damped oscillations leading to an interior equilibrium where native and exotic grass co exist with the native species being most prevalent mitigators constitute 10 of the population and nitrogen input is nonzero as the proportion of mitigators increases and decreases nitrogen input evolves accordingly which in turn forces changes in the grassland composition a sufficient increase in the native grassland species increases causes the proportion of mitigators to decrease which in turn eventually causes a resurgence of the exotic species however the overall free nutrient availability is relatively constant through these cycles since free nitrogen is rapidly assimilated into plants and thus cycles in nitrogen input are translated directly into cycles in species abundance 2 5 time series and parameter planes simulations of parameter regimes away from the baseline parameter values indicate the potential for a wide range of outcomes with respect to both natural and human dynamics we illustrate these regimes through time series and parameter planes for time series we note that the scale of the left vertical axis pertains to simulated trajectories of native and exotic biomasses whereas the scale of the right vertical axis pertains to plant available n pool and the proportion of mitigators parameter planes describing the model s dynamical regimes as a function of two model parameters were also generated in order to understand how model dynamics depend on parameter values the parameter planes illustrate the impact of changes in parameter values on asymptotic states of the model we generated parameter planes for j ρ w and κ we studied the effects of j and ρ because the contrast between nitrogen inputs under local versus global control is one the main distinguishing features of this socio ecological system as discussed in the introduction we also studied the effects of w and κ because both the rate of social uptake of a mitigation program and the cost for individuals to adopt it can be strongly influential in program success and can be influenced through program subsidies or information campaigns for instance to construct the parameter planes two parameters were selected to be varied around baseline values while all other parameters were held constant at baseline values initial conditions for bn be a and x far from equilibrium values were randomly chosen and the model was run long enough for transient dynamics to disappear allowing the system to converge to its asymptotic state this burn in period of 3000 years was not used in model analysis exploring a large number of random initial conditions allowed us to detect alternative stables states and thereby completely characterize the asymptotic states of the model at any given set of parameter values approximately 30 000 time series were thereby generated over 256 different initial conditions and the asymptotic state s of the system at each parameter pair on the plane were determined from the numerical results these results were then compiled into an 11 11 grid to form the parameter plane all figures were generated using matlab 2016 3 results we organize the results into subsections according to the most important findings emerging from the model results appear as time series figs 3 5 and parameter planes fig 6 a detailed legend describing the numbered regions in the parameter planes appears in table 2 the results show that nonlinear interactions between social and natural dynamics exemplify a broad range of parameter values a sufficiently small cost of mitigation w not only promotes persistence of the native species but can also stabilize socio ecological dynamics we also observe that even when nitrogen runoff from local sources is very high a decline in biomass of the native species can stimulate a mitigation response in humans and thus prevent eradication of the native species resulting in oscillatory coexistence of native and exotic species finally oscillations are pervasive suggesting that stale equilibrium persistence of the native species is only possible for very favourable environmental and social conditions we discuss these findings in more detail in the following subsections 3 1 socio ecological dynamics emerge as global nitrogen input becomes small in the parameter plane for j global nitrogen input and w cost of mitigation program we observe that high values of j favour dominance of the exotic species and low values of j favour dominance of the native species as expected but there is also an intermediate regime in j where the two species coexist either in an equilibrium state or through oscillations fig 6a these dynamics are illustrated in timeseries that contrast the coexistence equilibria fig 5 and coexistence through extreme oscillations fig 4a in this parameter regime a coexistence equilibrium can occur either with fig 5a or without fig 5b assistance from the human population the case of extreme oscillations can be considered as nominal coexistence since the species abundance is extremely small in the trough of the oscillations and stochastic effects can easily cause species extinction in this regime dynamics for dominance of the native sufficiently low j and exotic species sufficiently high j observed in the parameter plane fig 6a are also exemplified in time series fig 3 in the time series for native dominance fig 3a the proportion of mitigators is initially high but eventually declines to zero during a time period when the native grassland species are still recovering despite the collapse in support for the native species the native grasses are still able to recover and establish dominance in this case the net cost of mitigation make it unattractive to the population but the native species can re invade anyway because j is sufficiently low in contrast higher j values allow dominance of the exotic species fig 3b illustrates a case where the exotic species invades rapidly in the first few years stimulating a rapid shift to an equilibrium proportion of 50 mitigators this surge of interest in mitigation is inadequate to allow the native species to re invade however and the population eventually converges to an equilibrium where the exotic species is dominant the dynamics are generally less variable along changes in w in the parameter plane fig 6a when j is very large the exotic species dominates regardless of w in this regime global nitrogen input overwhelms any attempts to restrict local input however when j is small reducing the cost of runoff mitigation programs sufficiently w 0 05 replaces three regimes oscillatory coexistence equilibrium coexistence and unassisted native dominance equilibrium with the assisted native dominance equilibrium fig 3 3 2 socio ecological dynamics can protect the native species even for high rates of local nitrogen input in the parameter plane for ρ local nitrogen runoff rate and κ social learning rate fig 6b we observe that a low value of ρ supports dominance of the native species yielding a stable native species equilibrium that excludes the exotic species however unlike the case for larger values of the global nitrogen input j larger values of ρ continue to permit the existence of the native species through coexistence regimes of both equilibria and oscillations between native and exotic species abundance due to mediation by the human response hence even at very high values for local nitrogen input to the grasslands feedback from the human social system is sufficiently strong to prevent eradication of the native species although it is also not strong enough to eradicate the exotic species in comparison changing the social learning rate κ has relatively little impact on dynamics except when κ is very low and ρ is relatively large where increasing the social learning rate can shift the system from a regime of exotic species dominance to coexistence this occurs because if κ is too small and the initial proportion of mitigators is also very small mitigating behaviour does not spread fast enough whereas for higher κ individuals are more likely to adopt new strategies converting non mitigators into mitigators and thereby supporting the native species we also note in this parameter plane a small regime corresponding to coexistence through moderate oscillations fig 6 these oscillations are a cycling between the abundance of native and exotic grassland species and reflect the same underlying dynamic as observed in the damped oscillations of the baseline scenario fig 2b coexistence oscillations where support for mitigation becomes widespread in time periods when the exotic species is dominant which eventually causes a return of the native species and in turn a decline in support for mitigation this regime also appears in fig 6c 3 3 social learning can support coexistence but increasing mitigation costs destabilize the ecosystem the parameter plane for the social learning rate κ and the cost of supporting mitigation w illustrates the pervasiveness of extreme oscillations in the system at these parameter values fig 6c the effect of increasing w is immediately apparent unless κ is extremely low in which case mitigator behaviour cannot spread an increase in w shifts the system from a dynamical regime where the native species dominates with the assistance of humans to a regime of oscillatory behaviour where both exotic and native species are present hence increasing the mitigation cost not only allows the exotic species to establish but also destabilizes the ecosystem through large amplitude oscillations increasing w still further thus making mitigation too expensive predicts native species eradication and convergence to a regime dominated by the exotic species increasing the social learning rate has little effect on qualitative dynamics except when κ is very low in which case an increase in κ will allow mitigating behaviour to spread oscillations dominate the dynamics for almost all of the κ w parameter combinations hence the model predicts that an important mechanism for persistence of the native grassland species is a social dynamic that responds to the prevalence of native versus exotic species in the ecosystem and adjusts local nitrogen input accordingly we note that extreme oscillations are driven by the high social learning rate which has also been observed to destabilize equilibria in other socio ecological models innes et al 2013 henderson et al 2016b bauch 2005 3 4 high rates of local nitrogen input generate heterogeneous human populations the parameter plane for ρ local nitrogen input and w cost of mitigation program yields similar insights to the other parameter planes higher values of ρ stimulate oscillations except when w is very small or very large in which case the population is characterized by an equilibrium of native or exotic species dominance fig 6d as before coexistence is possible in broad intermediate parameter regime often through oscillations when ρ is small dynamics are at equilibrium and may be characterized by presence or absence of assistance from humans of note is the fact that here as in other parameter planes ρ influences social dynamics very strongly in particular when ρ is small which we can conceptualize as representing human populations with low industrial capacity the mitigation cost w determines whether a population is characterized by complete dominance by mitigators or complete dominance by non mitigators moreover the boundary between these two regions is sharp on one side of the boundary exists a homogeneous population of mitigators and on the other side is a homogeneous population of non mitigators but when ρ is larger such as in industrialized populations the strategy composition swings back and forth in conjunction with grassland dynamics and populations always consist of a heterogeneous mix of mitigators and non mitigators 4 discussion a model of southeastern australian grassland dynamics was coupled with a model of human behaviour to explore potential dynamics that could arise in the resulting socio ecological system in particular we wished to explore conditions that supported the persistence of the native grassland species in the face of an invasive grassland species assisted by nitrogen deposition the model predicted two mechanisms corresponding to native species persistence the first mechanism was an equilibrium of native species dominance achieved by a combination of reducing the cost of nitrogen runoff mitigation programs thus making uptake of the program more desirable to the population and decreasing global sources of nitrogen pollution and or the maximal capacity for local sources of pollution these conditions created an environmental regime that supports convergence to an asymptotic regime dominated by native grasslands species either with or without human assistance we note that the case of achieving native species persistence in the absence of human assistance recovers one scenario of the uncoupled model in ref chisholm et al 2015 in the second mechanism for somewhat less favourable environmental conditions where nitrogen input is higher persistence of the native species was still possible but it occurred through oscillations in the biomass of the native species exotic species and mitigation support in the human population these oscillations were driven by our assumption that the prevalence of mitigating behaviour in the population depended on the current state of the grasslands mitigation behaviour is reinforced when the native species is rare but are relaxed when the native species is common under the second mechanism for support of the native grassland species persistence of the native species is gained at the cost of admitting dynamics where the prevalence of both native and exotic species oscillate the danger of such oscillations is the possibility of extinction of other native species plant or animal that depend on the native grasslands at times when native grassland biomass is at a low point in the cycle although some parameter regimes corresponded to coexistence oscillations through relatively gentle oscillations most of the dynamics we observed in the parameter planes corresponded to extreme oscillations where the native species are almost eradicated in the troughs of the cycles fig 4a versus fig 4b earn et al 1998 we also found that decreasing the cost of a runoff mitigation program not only increases the prevalence of mitigators in the population as expected but more surprisingly is also predicted to stabilize both social dynamics and grassland dynamics hence the benefits of subsidizing runoff mitigation programs could be twofold these results are relevant to concepts of ecological holling 1973 and socio ecological resilience folke 2006 the traditional conception of resilience in ecology is the ability of an ecosystem to return to its original pre disturbed state holling 1973 grimm and wissel 1997 berkes 2007 mathematically this is connected to the asymptotic stability of a model s steady state solution holling 1973 however subsequent conceptual development has emphasized that dynamical systems can exhibit a wide variety of attractors besides steady states such as complicated cycles or chaotic dynamics suggesting a need to nuance definitions of socio ecological resilience folke 2006 folke et al 2010 other research has noted how instability in real socio ecological systems such as elk human interactions in yellowstone national park could manifest as oscillations but may also appear as other irregular patterns bennett and mcginnis 2008 accordingly our model could be argued to manifest two forms of resilience the oscillations generated by socio ecological feedback in our model represent resilience in a looser sense since they allow persistence of the native grassland species however on account of generating oscillations with sometimes dramatic swings in species abundances this resilience is arguably less desirable than the conventional resilience associated with a stable high cover of native grasses that occurs in favourable environmental conditions in a different parameter regime real populations may not exhibit such smooth oscillations on account of stochasticity population structure and other heterogeneities but the precise form of instability is secondary to the prediction that a socio ecological equilibrium will destabilize into a less resilient dynamical regime our model assumed that incentives can increase the proportion of the population engaging in mitigating behaviour that reduces local sources of nitrogen runoff this pattern appears to be consistent with field data from australia s environmental stewardship program burns et al 2016 in particular native plant species richness is significantly higher in grasslands under the environmental stewardship program while exotic plants species richness does not differ significantly between site although it does vary regionally lindenmayer et al 2012 this regime corresponds to a region of coexistence where native species are supported by mitigation efforts as exemplified in fig 5 for instance other model assumptions were simplifying assumptions that could be relaxed in future research for instance we note that introducing institutions might dampen the observed oscillations laws and bylaws have the effect of institutionalizing behaviours and norms and thus can make behaviours conform to a norm of mitigation thereby removing the possibility of oscillations or at least dampening them these effects could be particularly significant in dampening the extreme oscillations observed at many parameter values we assumed that all mitigators in the population mitigate runoff to the same degree however efforts to mitigate can vary between individuals in real populations in experimental settings this has led to the observation of a trade off whereby some interventions can increase individual effort to mitigate at the expense of decreasing population participation in mitigation programs schilizzi and latacz lohmann 2016 a worthwhile approach for future research would be to allow mitigation effort to vary between individuals in the model a previous ecological model of southeastern australian grassland dynamics illustrated the effect of pulsing the system with significantly higher rates of nutrient input for a specific period of time causing dominance of the exotic species chisholm et al 2015 nutrient spikes such as these in lake systems are associated with a regime shift to an undesirable state of eutrophication nixon 1995 although in grasslands these nutrient spikes can play a beneficial role in abandoned lands salifu et al 2009 we did not explore the effect of exogenous nutrient spikes in our model although extreme oscillations in the proportion of mitigators in the local population has a similar effect future research could explore the impact of spikes in the globally sourced nitrogen deposition model parameter j we expect this extension to have nontrivial effects given the tendency of equilibria in our socio ecological model to destabilize into oscillations the timing of spikes could interact with the oscillations to produce very different outcomes depending on the timing of the spike e g very long transient dynamics hastings 2004 other simplifying assumptions that we used to facilitate gaining insights include the assumption of a constant global source of nitrogen availability in fact it can vary over time and this can influence dynamics if authorities implement policies to penalize excessive nitrogen runoff from industrial sources this can cause a decline in global nitrogen deposition over time an extended model with multiple populations representing both local and global sources of nitrogen could be developed to explore this scenario we also note that we restrict our attention to a limited portion of a high dimensional parameter space and rely upon analyzing two dimensional cross sections of that parameter space hence there might be other relevant dynamical regimes that our analysis does not reveal however finding more dynamical regimes that correspond to persistence of the native species would not qualitatively alter our conclusion although it could expand our findings in summary there exist many opportunities to pursue research in the mathematical modelling of socio ecological dynamics in this case the incorporation of human social dynamics into the model has revealed more than one mechanism to support persistence of a native grassland species although the mechanisms relying upon socio ecological oscillations result in non equilibrium dynamics in native species biomass reducing the cost of mitigation not only increases the proportion of individuals who participate in mitigation but can also stabilize socio ecological dynamics further research on coupled socio ecological systems could provide a deeper understanding of socio ecological mechanisms for reducing nitrogen pollution and restoring human affected grassland

24962,nitrogen runoff in certain southeastern australian grasslands promotes the invasion of exotic grassland species at the expense of native species mitigation programs can reduce runoff and thus support native species but their success may require the awareness and support of local populations this situation represents a coupled socio ecological system since nitrogen runoff caused by local populations can enable the invasion of exotic grassland species which can in turn stimulate a social response to restore the native species our objective is to use a mathematical model to identify potential socio ecological mechanisms for the persistence of native grassland species and the parameter regimes for which these mechanisms operate we couple a model of southeastern australian grassland dynamics with a model of human social dynamics concerning runoff mitigation nitrogen runoff can enter the ecosystem either through local sources under control of a human population or through global sources not under their control humans learn mitigating behaviour socially and respond to the prevalence of native and exotic grassland species we find that socio ecological dynamics introduce broad parameter regimes that are not present in the ecological system in isolation from the human system we identify two mechanisms for native grassland persistence one is associated with significant reductions in runoff rates and or cost of runoff mitigation programs resulting in a stable state where the native grassland species exists or dominates with or without the support of socio ecological feedback a second mechanism associated with higher rates of nitrogen input supports persistence of the native species through oscillations in species abundance and mitigation behaviour in the human population however this state is less favourable to the native species because the oscillations may become extreme in amplitude finally we find that increasing the cost of mitigation programs not only reduces mitigating behaviour in the population but also more surprisingly increases the tendency for the system to destabilize into a regime of oscillations in native species biomass we conclude that multiple socio ecological mechanisms could potentially support native species in grassland ecosystems under stress from nitrogen runoff and invasive species further research can refine such models to inform policy in the face of nonlinear socio ecological responses keywords grassland dynamics coupled human environment system game theory replicator dynamics nitrogen runoff mitigation socio ecological dynamics 1 introduction numerous ecosystems around the world are negatively impacted by deposition processes that input excessive nutrients pollu tants or sediments into the ecosystem through processes such as runoff hazbavi et al 2018 for instance lake ecosystems are adapted to natural background rates of nitrogen input but excessive nitrogen loading due to runoff from industrial or agricultural sources can cause lakes to flip from a clear oligographic state to a eutrophic state where the lake is overgrown by algae causing fish populations to suffer smith et al 1999 scheffer 1997 similarly excessive sedimentation impedes the growth and function of coral reefs rogers 1990 detrimental effects may lead to catastrophic shifts in ecosystem state such as forest collapse due to acidification or lake eutrophication qin et al 2013 hoegberg et al 2006 rehabilitating these degraded systems and restoring the ecological balance requires significant effort over long periods of time depending on the severity of the degradation daily 1995 a further example of these effects has been observed in grasslands subject to excessive levels of nitrogen deposition for instance exotic grassland species primarily originating from africa and europe are capable of invading native southeastern australian grasslands at sufficiently high rates of nitrogen deposition williams et al 2005 chisholm et al 2015 exotic grasses and plants are often better competitors for sunlight and with sufficient soil nitration can out compete native grassland species this alters the biodiversity in these ecosystems and also causes a decline in grassland productivity brodie and mitchell 2005 isbell et al 2013 while also affecting neighbouring ecosystems williams et al 2005 some of these exotic species are more flammable than native species d antonio and vitousek 1992 causing fire to encroach on nonflammable regions and or increasing the intensity of fires in other cases invasion can cause other changes to the local ecology where once open water systems are subsequently colonized by the exotic grass species creating wetlands in their place d antonio and vitousek 1992 although exotic grassland species are not without benefits such as providing grazing d antonio and vitousek 1992 the touristic agroeconomic and cultural benefits of native grassland species are considerable and wide ranging williams et al 2005 williams and cary 2001 henderson et al 2016a cordero et al 2018 as such many stakeholders wish to maintain and preserve grassland ecosystems based on native grassland species programs such as australia s environmental stewardship program utilize incentive based payments and promote a sense of stewardship to persuade landowners to protect and rehabilitate native ecosystems these programs have shown successes in protecting australian grasslands through landowner participation burns et al 2016 the development of this and other environmental protection programs in other countries are generally stimulated by the degradation of natural ecosystems and require public support for environment protection expressed either through grass roots efforts or through pressure for government interventions hence many natural ecological systems and human systems can be conceptualized as a coupled socio ecological system equivalently human environment system or coupled human and natural system human activities impact an ecological system and the resulting changes in the ecological system in turn influence human opinion and behaviour often to the point of altering the trajectory of these ecosystems toward restoration of their natural state liu et al 2007 innes et al 2013 kramer et al 2017 this human response to human caused changes in natural systems is widespread and has implications for ecological modeling henderson et al 2016b davis et al 2001 bauch et al 2016 mather and fairbairn 2000 cinner et al 2009 thampi et al

2013 kramer et al 2017 coupled socio ecological models typically consist of an ecological model coupled with a human model derived from economic social or psychological assumptions these socio ecological models can be used to study how nonlinear ecological and social feedbacks modify the effectiveness of policy interventions among other phenomena some examples of systems for which socio ecological models have been developed include forest harvesting satake et al 2007 forest pests barlow et al 2014 forest grassland mosaics henderson et al 2016a b common pool resource problems lade et al 2013 richter and dakos 2015 water sharing nhim et al 2018 vaccination preferences oraby et al 2014 and coral reef ecosystems thampi et al 2018 these models can be used to gain insights into socio ecological dynamics identify conditions for extinction or persistence of natural system states and determine policies that are most likely to support persistence of natural states in the face of socio ecological feedbacks many of the natural systems subject to damage from deposition processes including those that could be characterized as coupled socio ecological systems exhibit alternative stable states where the ecosystem can persist in one state or in a dramatically different state depending on initial system conditions scheffer 1997 an implication of alternative stable states is that gradually changing environmental conditions may push the ecosystem past a threshold beyond which the state of the system flips abruptly to a new and contrasting state beisner et al 2003 these sudden regime shifts have been observed in the cases of lake eutrophication smith et al 1999 scheffer 1997 and invasion of exotic grassland species in australia chisholm et al 2015 for example as a result of these nontrivial dynamics alternative stable states in ecological systems is a frequent subject of ecological modelling efforts scheffer 1997 chisholm et al 2015 beisner et al 2003 staver et al 2011 however socio ecological models have identified conditions under which socio ecological feedbacks can remove naturally occurring alternative stable states innes et al 2013 thampi et al 2018 a coupled socio ecological model of native and exotic grasses subject to human caused nitrogen deposition has not been explored in the literature to our knowledge therefore the impact of socio ecological feedback on species composition and alternative stable states in those ecosystems is an open question here we extend an existing ecological model that captures the effects of excessive nitrogen deposition on southeastern australian grasslands chisholm et al 2015 the model predicts that these grasslands can exhibit bistability with grasslands being dominated either by the native grassland species or an alternative state dominated by the exotic grassland species due to higher nitrogen input nitrogen pollution in such systems may be broken down into contributions from global sources not under the control of local populations such as atmospheric deposition from distant industrial sources versus contributions from local sources that can be controlled by local populations such as runoff from local fertilizer usage in agricultural lands or local industries vitousek et al 1997 stevens et al 2004 hence we create a socio ecological model of this system by coupling a model of a human social subsystem that can control the contribution of local but not global nitrogen sources with the existing grassland model chisholm et al 2015 the prevalence of mitigating behaviour in the human population depends on mitigation costs social learning social norms and the current ecosystem state unlike most previous socio ecological models this allows us to model a human population where only a certain proportion of environmental impact can be controlled by the local population we formulate the model using known features of the southeastern australian grasslands socio ecological system and other similar systems vaccination dynamics ecosystem dynamics etc thampi et al 2018 oraby et al 2014 we analyze it numerically to identify asymptotic dynamical states and their dependence on model parameters our objective is to identify potential socio ecological mechanisms for the persistence of native grassland species and the parameter regimes for which these mechanisms operate this allows us to understand what are the impacts of changing the cost of nitrogen runoff mitigation and what kind of dynamical regimes are observed in the socio ecological model that would not be observed in an ecological model assuming a fixed human influence our approach is to explore the model s parameter space in order to gain qualitative insights into possible dynamical regimes and their dependence on parameter trends rather than fitting the model toempirical data in order to obtain quantitative predictions for a specific population and time 2 methods 2 1 model overview the socio ecological model divides the human population into a proportion x who support conservation of natural grasslands by reducing nitrogen runoff mitigators and a proportion 1 x who do not non mitigators support may be through individual actions to reduce runoff or through supporting the implementation of local mitigation programs or bylaws individ uals switch between these two strategies according to a social learning process determined by the cost of conserving native grasslands the prevalence of native grasslands and social norms grassland dynamics are determined by an existing model chisholm et al 2015 wherein native and exotic species of grass compete and nitrogen input may cause a critical transition from native dominated to exotic dominated grassland states in our socio ecological model the input rate of nitrogen from local sources is reduced according to the current proportion of mitigators in the population additional details about the model structure and assumptions appear in model construction where we first explain the existing grassland model and then build on this first model by introducing the coupled socio ecological model following that we explain our parameterization and approach to model analysis 2 2 model construction a previous model chisholm et al 2015 was extended to a coupled socio ecological system we built on this model because it is relatively simple exhibits alternative stable states according to nitrogen runoff rates and was developed for the southeastern australian grassland ecosystem the previous model is represented by the system of differential equations 1 d b n d t b n ω n v n a μ n m n f n b n b e 2 d b e d t b e ω e v e a μ e m e f e b n b e 3 d a d t i k a b n v n a μ n m n f n b n b e 1 δ n ω n b e v e a μ e m e f e b n b e 1 δ e ω e here bn and be represent the biomass of native and exotic species respectively and a represents the environmental nitrogen level the model assumes a fixed nitrogen input rate i in addition the model assumes interspecific light competition between the native and exotic species governed by the functions fn bn be and fe bn be see ref chisholm et al 2015 for details the environmental nitrogen level is determined by the nutrient deposition constant i parameters are defined along with their baseline values in table 1 this model represents human impact through a fixed parameter i representing the rate of nitrogen input however social behaviour is dynamic and varies based on perceptions of ecological conditions hence we write down a dynamic equation for x the proportion of the population that supports nitrogen runoff mitigation to preserve native grasslands mitigators conversely the remaining proportion 1 x are assumed to adopt a non mitigator strategy we use utility functions to quantify the incentive to adopt mitigator or non mitigator strategies we let um unm represent the utility for mitigators non mitigators utility functions are used in game theory to quantify the motivation whether economic psychological social or otherwise to adopt a strategy innes et al 2013 rabin 1993 bauch 2005 um is given by 4 u m z η b e b n b e ϕ x where z represents the cost to protect native grassland species by reducing personal contributions to nitrogen runoff or personal efforts to support bylaws and mitigation programs that reduce runoff η is a proportionality constant that controls the sensitivity of the mitigator utility to the amount of native grassland cover and φ controls the strength of social norms thampi et al 2018 barlow et al 2014 oraby et al 2014 this utility function captures how the utility for mitigation increases as the native grassland cover bn becomes rare similarly unm is given by 5 u n m w ϕ 1 x where w is the cost associated with producing nitrogen runoff such as fines paid for bylaw violations when um unm 0 the preservation of native grassland species becomes a more valuable strategy whereas when unm um 0 the population starts to abandon conservation we assume that each individual samples other individuals at rate k0 social learning and that upon encountering someone with a different strategy the individual switches strategies with a probability proportional to the difference in utility with proportionality constant p0 hence after re scaling the differential equation governing x is given by 6 d x d t k x 1 x w b e b n b e ε 2 x 1 where k k 0 p 0 η is the rescaled rate of social learning w z w η is the rescaled net cost of mitigation and ε ϕ η is the effect of social norms despite this rescaling changes in rescaled parameters have a clear interpretation in terms of the original parameter definitions for instance an increase in w without a change in other parameters corresponds to an increase in the cost of mitigation hence we will continue to refer to this as the rescaled net mitigation cost similar interpretations apply to κ and ε although changes in η correspond to simultaneous changes in w κ and ε we note that these equations are identical to the replicator dynamics used in evolutionary game theory hofbauer and sigmund 1998 cressman and tao 2014 further examples and full derivation of this differential equation can be found elsewhere innes et al 2013 henderson et al 2016b bauch 2005 helbing 2010 only a proportion of nitrogen runoff is under the control of local human populations such as municipalities while the remainder can be due to upstream sources or atmospheric deposition hence we assume that total nitrogen is flowing into the grasslands comes from global sources that are not under the control of the local population at a rate j as well as from local sources at a rate ρ that is reduced by a factor 1 x in proportion to the prevalence of mitigators x the socio ecological model for the southeastern australian grasslands is therefore 7 d b n d t b n ω n v n a μ n m n f n b n b e 8 d b e d t b e ω e v e a μ e m e f e b n b e 9 d a d t j ρ 1 x k a b n v n a μ n m n f n b n b e 1 δ n ω n b e v e a μ e m e f e b n b e 1 δ e ω e 10 d x d t κ x 1 x w b e b n b e ε 2 x 1 where all parameters and variables are as defined previously in this subsection and in table 1 a model diagram appears in fig 1 in eq 3 nitrogen input occurs at a fixed rate i whereas in eq 9 nitrogen input is the sum of a fixed input rate j and a local nitrogen input term ρ 1 x that depends upon x we note that this model assumes the effects of the human population on nitrogen runoff to unfold continuously in time through the ρ 1 x term hence this approach could capture situations where existing bylaws recommendations or guidelines can wax or wane smoothly depending on factors such as individual participation in programs and public support for enforcement of existing bylaws or based on the current state or level of economic development however it would not capture discrete events such as a sudden drop in nitrogen runoff after introducing a new bylaw we note that the cases x 0 and x 1 reduce the model to that of chisholm et al chisholm et al 2015 where nitrogen input is fixed 2 3 parameterization model parameters concerning the grassland subsystem were taken from the previous grassland model chisholm et al 2015 the additional model parameters govern human social dynamics and the coupling between the human and grassland subsystems these additional parameters were calibrated to satisfy two conditions that met our objective of obtaining qualitative insights into dynamics firstly we required that application of human effort to curb nitrogen input should cause a decline in exotic grassland species and an increase in the native species and vice versa in order for the model to be consistent with experience from australia s environmental stewardship program secondly we chose a region of parameter space in which native and exotic species could co exist and the proportion of mitigators and non mitigators were nonzero these two conditions ensured that parameter variation away from the baseline values produced a meaningful change in model dynamics that could be explored through time series and parameter planes the resulting baseline parameter values appear in table 1 2 4 baseline simulation the model was numerically simulated in matlab using the ode23 solver a time series of the model simulation at the baseline parameter values provides insight into how the model assumptions translate into the observed dyanamics and especially the interactions between natural and human variables fig 2 the time series shows damped oscillations leading to an interior equilibrium where native and exotic grass co exist with the native species being most prevalent mitigators constitute 10 of the population and nitrogen input is nonzero as the proportion of mitigators increases and decreases nitrogen input evolves accordingly which in turn forces changes in the grassland composition a sufficient increase in the native grassland species increases causes the proportion of mitigators to decrease which in turn eventually causes a resurgence of the exotic species however the overall free nutrient availability is relatively constant through these cycles since free nitrogen is rapidly assimilated into plants and thus cycles in nitrogen input are translated directly into cycles in species abundance 2 5 time series and parameter planes simulations of parameter regimes away from the baseline parameter values indicate the potential for a wide range of outcomes with respect to both natural and human dynamics we illustrate these regimes through time series and parameter planes for time series we note that the scale of the left vertical axis pertains to simulated trajectories of native and exotic biomasses whereas the scale of the right vertical axis pertains to plant available n pool and the proportion of mitigators parameter planes describing the model s dynamical regimes as a function of two model parameters were also generated in order to understand how model dynamics depend on parameter values the parameter planes illustrate the impact of changes in parameter values on asymptotic states of the model we generated parameter planes for j ρ w and κ we studied the effects of j and ρ because the contrast between nitrogen inputs under local versus global control is one the main distinguishing features of this socio ecological system as discussed in the introduction we also studied the effects of w and κ because both the rate of social uptake of a mitigation program and the cost for individuals to adopt it can be strongly influential in program success and can be influenced through program subsidies or information campaigns for instance to construct the parameter planes two parameters were selected to be varied around baseline values while all other parameters were held constant at baseline values initial conditions for bn be a and x far from equilibrium values were randomly chosen and the model was run long enough for transient dynamics to disappear allowing the system to converge to its asymptotic state this burn in period of 3000 years was not used in model analysis exploring a large number of random initial conditions allowed us to detect alternative stables states and thereby completely characterize the asymptotic states of the model at any given set of parameter values approximately 30 000 time series were thereby generated over 256 different initial conditions and the asymptotic state s of the system at each parameter pair on the plane were determined from the numerical results these results were then compiled into an 11 11 grid to form the parameter plane all figures were generated using matlab 2016 3 results we organize the results into subsections according to the most important findings emerging from the model results appear as time series figs 3 5 and parameter planes fig 6 a detailed legend describing the numbered regions in the parameter planes appears in table 2 the results show that nonlinear interactions between social and natural dynamics exemplify a broad range of parameter values a sufficiently small cost of mitigation w not only promotes persistence of the native species but can also stabilize socio ecological dynamics we also observe that even when nitrogen runoff from local sources is very high a decline in biomass of the native species can stimulate a mitigation response in humans and thus prevent eradication of the native species resulting in oscillatory coexistence of native and exotic species finally oscillations are pervasive suggesting that stale equilibrium persistence of the native species is only possible for very favourable environmental and social conditions we discuss these findings in more detail in the following subsections 3 1 socio ecological dynamics emerge as global nitrogen input becomes small in the parameter plane for j global nitrogen input and w cost of mitigation program we observe that high values of j favour dominance of the exotic species and low values of j favour dominance of the native species as expected but there is also an intermediate regime in j where the two species coexist either in an equilibrium state or through oscillations fig 6a these dynamics are illustrated in timeseries that contrast the coexistence equilibria fig 5 and coexistence through extreme oscillations fig 4a in this parameter regime a coexistence equilibrium can occur either with fig 5a or without fig 5b assistance from the human population the case of extreme oscillations can be considered as nominal coexistence since the species abundance is extremely small in the trough of the oscillations and stochastic effects can easily cause species extinction in this regime dynamics for dominance of the native sufficiently low j and exotic species sufficiently high j observed in the parameter plane fig 6a are also exemplified in time series fig 3 in the time series for native dominance fig 3a the proportion of mitigators is initially high but eventually declines to zero during a time period when the native grassland species are still recovering despite the collapse in support for the native species the native grasses are still able to recover and establish dominance in this case the net cost of mitigation make it unattractive to the population but the native species can re invade anyway because j is sufficiently low in contrast higher j values allow dominance of the exotic species fig 3b illustrates a case where the exotic species invades rapidly in the first few years stimulating a rapid shift to an equilibrium proportion of 50 mitigators this surge of interest in mitigation is inadequate to allow the native species to re invade however and the population eventually converges to an equilibrium where the exotic species is dominant the dynamics are generally less variable along changes in w in the parameter plane fig 6a when j is very large the exotic species dominates regardless of w in this regime global nitrogen input overwhelms any attempts to restrict local input however when j is small reducing the cost of runoff mitigation programs sufficiently w 0 05 replaces three regimes oscillatory coexistence equilibrium coexistence and unassisted native dominance equilibrium with the assisted native dominance equilibrium fig 3 3 2 socio ecological dynamics can protect the native species even for high rates of local nitrogen input in the parameter plane for ρ local nitrogen runoff rate and κ social learning rate fig 6b we observe that a low value of ρ supports dominance of the native species yielding a stable native species equilibrium that excludes the exotic species however unlike the case for larger values of the global nitrogen input j larger values of ρ continue to permit the existence of the native species through coexistence regimes of both equilibria and oscillations between native and exotic species abundance due to mediation by the human response hence even at very high values for local nitrogen input to the grasslands feedback from the human social system is sufficiently strong to prevent eradication of the native species although it is also not strong enough to eradicate the exotic species in comparison changing the social learning rate κ has relatively little impact on dynamics except when κ is very low and ρ is relatively large where increasing the social learning rate can shift the system from a regime of exotic species dominance to coexistence this occurs because if κ is too small and the initial proportion of mitigators is also very small mitigating behaviour does not spread fast enough whereas for higher κ individuals are more likely to adopt new strategies converting non mitigators into mitigators and thereby supporting the native species we also note in this parameter plane a small regime corresponding to coexistence through moderate oscillations fig 6 these oscillations are a cycling between the abundance of native and exotic grassland species and reflect the same underlying dynamic as observed in the damped oscillations of the baseline scenario fig 2b coexistence oscillations where support for mitigation becomes widespread in time periods when the exotic species is dominant which eventually causes a return of the native species and in turn a decline in support for mitigation this regime also appears in fig 6c 3 3 social learning can support coexistence but increasing mitigation costs destabilize the ecosystem the parameter plane for the social learning rate κ and the cost of supporting mitigation w illustrates the pervasiveness of extreme oscillations in the system at these parameter values fig 6c the effect of increasing w is immediately apparent unless κ is extremely low in which case mitigator behaviour cannot spread an increase in w shifts the system from a dynamical regime where the native species dominates with the assistance of humans to a regime of oscillatory behaviour where both exotic and native species are present hence increasing the mitigation cost not only allows the exotic species to establish but also destabilizes the ecosystem through large amplitude oscillations increasing w still further thus making mitigation too expensive predicts native species eradication and convergence to a regime dominated by the exotic species increasing the social learning rate has little effect on qualitative dynamics except when κ is very low in which case an increase in κ will allow mitigating behaviour to spread oscillations dominate the dynamics for almost all of the κ w parameter combinations hence the model predicts that an important mechanism for persistence of the native grassland species is a social dynamic that responds to the prevalence of native versus exotic species in the ecosystem and adjusts local nitrogen input accordingly we note that extreme oscillations are driven by the high social learning rate which has also been observed to destabilize equilibria in other socio ecological models innes et al 2013 henderson et al 2016b bauch 2005 3 4 high rates of local nitrogen input generate heterogeneous human populations the parameter plane for ρ local nitrogen input and w cost of mitigation program yields similar insights to the other parameter planes higher values of ρ stimulate oscillations except when w is very small or very large in which case the population is characterized by an equilibrium of native or exotic species dominance fig 6d as before coexistence is possible in broad intermediate parameter regime often through oscillations when ρ is small dynamics are at equilibrium and may be characterized by presence or absence of assistance from humans of note is the fact that here as in other parameter planes ρ influences social dynamics very strongly in particular when ρ is small which we can conceptualize as representing human populations with low industrial capacity the mitigation cost w determines whether a population is characterized by complete dominance by mitigators or complete dominance by non mitigators moreover the boundary between these two regions is sharp on one side of the boundary exists a homogeneous population of mitigators and on the other side is a homogeneous population of non mitigators but when ρ is larger such as in industrialized populations the strategy composition swings back and forth in conjunction with grassland dynamics and populations always consist of a heterogeneous mix of mitigators and non mitigators 4 discussion a model of southeastern australian grassland dynamics was coupled with a model of human behaviour to explore potential dynamics that could arise in the resulting socio ecological system in particular we wished to explore conditions that supported the persistence of the native grassland species in the face of an invasive grassland species assisted by nitrogen deposition the model predicted two mechanisms corresponding to native species persistence the first mechanism was an equilibrium of native species dominance achieved by a combination of reducing the cost of nitrogen runoff mitigation programs thus making uptake of the program more desirable to the population and decreasing global sources of nitrogen pollution and or the maximal capacity for local sources of pollution these conditions created an environmental regime that supports convergence to an asymptotic regime dominated by native grasslands species either with or without human assistance we note that the case of achieving native species persistence in the absence of human assistance recovers one scenario of the uncoupled model in ref chisholm et al 2015 in the second mechanism for somewhat less favourable environmental conditions where nitrogen input is higher persistence of the native species was still possible but it occurred through oscillations in the biomass of the native species exotic species and mitigation support in the human population these oscillations were driven by our assumption that the prevalence of mitigating behaviour in the population depended on the current state of the grasslands mitigation behaviour is reinforced when the native species is rare but are relaxed when the native species is common under the second mechanism for support of the native grassland species persistence of the native species is gained at the cost of admitting dynamics where the prevalence of both native and exotic species oscillate the danger of such oscillations is the possibility of extinction of other native species plant or animal that depend on the native grasslands at times when native grassland biomass is at a low point in the cycle although some parameter regimes corresponded to coexistence oscillations through relatively gentle oscillations most of the dynamics we observed in the parameter planes corresponded to extreme oscillations where the native species are almost eradicated in the troughs of the cycles fig 4a versus fig 4b earn et al 1998 we also found that decreasing the cost of a runoff mitigation program not only increases the prevalence of mitigators in the population as expected but more surprisingly is also predicted to stabilize both social dynamics and grassland dynamics hence the benefits of subsidizing runoff mitigation programs could be twofold these results are relevant to concepts of ecological holling 1973 and socio ecological resilience folke 2006 the traditional conception of resilience in ecology is the ability of an ecosystem to return to its original pre disturbed state holling 1973 grimm and wissel 1997 berkes 2007 mathematically this is connected to the asymptotic stability of a model s steady state solution holling 1973 however subsequent conceptual development has emphasized that dynamical systems can exhibit a wide variety of attractors besides steady states such as complicated cycles or chaotic dynamics suggesting a need to nuance definitions of socio ecological resilience folke 2006 folke et al 2010 other research has noted how instability in real socio ecological systems such as elk human interactions in yellowstone national park could manifest as oscillations but may also appear as other irregular patterns bennett and mcginnis 2008 accordingly our model could be argued to manifest two forms of resilience the oscillations generated by socio ecological feedback in our model represent resilience in a looser sense since they allow persistence of the native grassland species however on account of generating oscillations with sometimes dramatic swings in species abundances this resilience is arguably less desirable than the conventional resilience associated with a stable high cover of native grasses that occurs in favourable environmental conditions in a different parameter regime real populations may not exhibit such smooth oscillations on account of stochasticity population structure and other heterogeneities but the precise form of instability is secondary to the prediction that a socio ecological equilibrium will destabilize into a less resilient dynamical regime our model assumed that incentives can increase the proportion of the population engaging in mitigating behaviour that reduces local sources of nitrogen runoff this pattern appears to be consistent with field data from australia s environmental stewardship program burns et al 2016 in particular native plant species richness is significantly higher in grasslands under the environmental stewardship program while exotic plants species richness does not differ significantly between site although it does vary regionally lindenmayer et al 2012 this regime corresponds to a region of coexistence where native species are supported by mitigation efforts as exemplified in fig 5 for instance other model assumptions were simplifying assumptions that could be relaxed in future research for instance we note that introducing institutions might dampen the observed oscillations laws and bylaws have the effect of institutionalizing behaviours and norms and thus can make behaviours conform to a norm of mitigation thereby removing the possibility of oscillations or at least dampening them these effects could be particularly significant in dampening the extreme oscillations observed at many parameter values we assumed that all mitigators in the population mitigate runoff to the same degree however efforts to mitigate can vary between individuals in real populations in experimental settings this has led to the observation of a trade off whereby some interventions can increase individual effort to mitigate at the expense of decreasing population participation in mitigation programs schilizzi and latacz lohmann 2016 a worthwhile approach for future research would be to allow mitigation effort to vary between individuals in the model a previous ecological model of southeastern australian grassland dynamics illustrated the effect of pulsing the system with significantly higher rates of nutrient input for a specific period of time causing dominance of the exotic species chisholm et al 2015 nutrient spikes such as these in lake systems are associated with a regime shift to an undesirable state of eutrophication nixon 1995 although in grasslands these nutrient spikes can play a beneficial role in abandoned lands salifu et al 2009 we did not explore the effect of exogenous nutrient spikes in our model although extreme oscillations in the proportion of mitigators in the local population has a similar effect future research could explore the impact of spikes in the globally sourced nitrogen deposition model parameter j we expect this extension to have nontrivial effects given the tendency of equilibria in our socio ecological model to destabilize into oscillations the timing of spikes could interact with the oscillations to produce very different outcomes depending on the timing of the spike e g very long transient dynamics hastings 2004 other simplifying assumptions that we used to facilitate gaining insights include the assumption of a constant global source of nitrogen availability in fact it can vary over time and this can influence dynamics if authorities implement policies to penalize excessive nitrogen runoff from industrial sources this can cause a decline in global nitrogen deposition over time an extended model with multiple populations representing both local and global sources of nitrogen could be developed to explore this scenario we also note that we restrict our attention to a limited portion of a high dimensional parameter space and rely upon analyzing two dimensional cross sections of that parameter space hence there might be other relevant dynamical regimes that our analysis does not reveal however finding more dynamical regimes that correspond to persistence of the native species would not qualitatively alter our conclusion although it could expand our findings in summary there exist many opportunities to pursue research in the mathematical modelling of socio ecological dynamics in this case the incorporation of human social dynamics into the model has revealed more than one mechanism to support persistence of a native grassland species although the mechanisms relying upon socio ecological oscillations result in non equilibrium dynamics in native species biomass reducing the cost of mitigation not only increases the proportion of individuals who participate in mitigation but can also stabilize socio ecological dynamics further research on coupled socio ecological systems could provide a deeper understanding of socio ecological mechanisms for reducing nitrogen pollution and restoring human affected grassland

24963,marine aquaculture production has lately experienced high economic growth but also concerns related to production and environmental contamination for the atlantic salmon aquaculture industry the ectoparasitic crustacean salmon louse lepeophtheirus salmonis has become a major problem a common method to control populations of salmon lice within farm cages is treatment by various pharmaceuticals one of the pesticides used in medicated feed for salmon is diflubenzuron dfb which acts as a chitin synthesis inhibitor and thereby interferes with the moulting stages during the development of this crustacean however dfb from fish feed may also affect non target crustaceans such as the northern shrimp pandalus borealis which is an economically and ecologically important species nevertheless the actual risk posed by this chemical to shrimp populations in nature is largely unknown laboratory experiments have demonstrated that both larval and adult shrimp exposed to dfb through medicated fish feed have reduced survival compared to control moreover the effects of dfb exposure are more severe under conditions of higher temperature and reduced ph ocean acidification which can be expected in a future environment the aim of this study is to make the individual level information from laboratory studies more relevant for risk assessment at the population level we have developed a density dependent age structured population model representing a northern shrimp population located in a hypothetical norwegian fjord containing a fish farm under both ambient and future environments our model is based on thorough documentation of shrimp biology and toxicological effects from the laboratory experiments nevertheless extrapolating the reported individual level effects of dfb to the population level poses several challenges relevant information on shrimp populations in norwegian fjords is sparse such as abundances survival and reproductive rates and density dependent processes the degree of exposure to dfb at different distances from aquaculture farms is also uncertain we have therefore developed a set of model scenarios representing different dfb application schemes and different degrees of exposure for the shrimp populations the model predicts effects of dfb exposure on population level endpoints such as long term abundance age structure and the probability of population decline below threshold abundances these model predictions demonstrate how the risk of dfb to shrimp populations can be enhanced by factors such as the timing season of dfb applications the percentage of the population affected future environmental conditions and environmental stochasticity abbreviations csi chitin synthesis inhibitor dfb diflubenzuron keywords population model northern shrimp aquaculture salmon lice medicine density dependence stochasticity 1 introduction marine aquaculture production has lately experienced high economic growth but also concerns related to production and environmental contamination for the atlantic salmon aquaculture industry the ectoparasitic salmon louse lepeophtheirus salmonis has become a major problem the increasing use of antiparasitic drugs against this crustacean parasite has raised concerns regarding potential impacts on non target crustaceans langford et al 2014 macken et al 2015 a commonly used pesticide against salmon lice is diflubenzuron dfb which acts as a chitin synthesis inhibitor csi and thereby interferes with the moulting process of crustaceans during their development elevated levels of csi have been detected in tissues of non target crustaceans in areas where medicated feed is used langford et al 2014 samuelsen 2016 there is concern that csi from fish feed may also affect non target crustaceans such as the northern shrimp pandalus borealis which is an economically and ecologically important species in colder parts of the atlantic bergström 2000 in norway local fishermen question why they catch less shrimp in fjords with salmon aquaculture and the competent authorities have requested information on the influence of antiparasitic drugs on non target crustaceans gaulin and skarland 2015 laboratory experiments have demonstrated that shrimp exposed to dfb through fish feed have reduced survival as adults bechmann et al 2017 as well as during the larval life stage bechmann et al 2018 waste from fish farms provides food for local shrimp populations olsen et al 2012 shrimp may therefore accumulate dfb through consumption of both medicated feed and salmon faeces as well as from contaminated fauna langford et al 2014 grefsrud et al 2018 provide some information on the spatial distribution and persistence of dfb in fjords flubenzurones have been found in sediment up to 1 km from farms and the half time is estimated to be 110 170 days however there is little information on the degree of exposure to shrimp habitats therefore the risks associated with dfb to shrimp populations and other non target species is largely unknown grefsrud et al 2018 in their natural environment shrimp populations may also be affected by environmental stressors that can be expected to increase in the future due to co2 emission such as ocean acidification and warming a downscaling ocean biogeochemical model projected that bottom waters along the norwegian coast will reach average temperatures of 9 7 c from currently 8 0 c and ph down to 7 7 from currently 8 0 during winters in the decade 2090 2099 wallhead et al 2017 these additional stressors should also be accounted for when assessing the population level effects of dfb on shrimp in the long term future the aim of this study was to assess the potential effects of dfb exposure from salmon aquaculture on local shrimp populations based on information on effects on individual shrimp the hypothetical location represents a shrimp field in a fjord in south western norway where there is a high density of both salmon aquaculture sites and shrimp fields along the coast fig 1 fjord shrimp populations tend to be genetically different from open sea populations knutsen et al 2015 and even populations from spatially proximate fjords may respond differently to environmental stress hall 2017 although the fjord populations are of less economic value than open sea populations local stocks may prove important to uphold genetic variability and biocomplexity in a changing environment knutsen et al 2015 most existing population models for shrimp are developed for stock assessment based on commercial landings and effort data from shrimp populations in open sea the pandalus borealis stock of skagerrak and the norwegian deep was assessed annually by the international council for the exploration of the sea ices by qualitative non model based interpretation of various stock indices until 2012 from 2012 onwards a bayesian surplus production model based on yearly estimates of the total biomass formed the basis for the stock assessment and for deriving catch advice hvingel and kingsley 2006 more recently a length based model implemented in stock synthesis ss3 with a fixed natural mortality rate has been applied to better represent the demography of the shrimp population ices 2016 the model has a quarterly 3 month time step to better capture the rapid growth of the shrimp a population model for our purpose needed more detailed specification of processes such as stage or age specific survival than the mentioned ss3 stock assessment model one reason is that the adult and larval stages have shown different sensitivity to dfb exposure bechmann et al 2017 2018 an age structured population model might also show different effects of dfb treatment in different seasons since the larval stage only lasts for a few months in spring we constructed an age structured population model with a seasonal 3 month time step and age specific survival and reproductive rates this model structure could capture stage and sex specific sensitivity to the toxicant to seasonal changes in the environment and to dfb application in different seasons the shrimp population model contains stochastic components in survival rates representing both environmental and demographic stochasticity the modelled effects of dfb exposure and environment change are derived from experimental data bechmann et al 2017 2018 the model was run for scenarios representing different timing of dfb application and different degrees of dfb exposure to the shrimp populations as well as different levels of environmental fluctuation the purpose of the model was to investigate 1 how the effects of dfb exposure documented for larval and adult shrimp individuals transfer to the population level and 2 how the population level effects of dfb are affected by future environmental conditions such a population model can be used to assess the risk of shrimp population decline below a threshold abundance under different scenarios of stressors and environmental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 model structure 2 1 1 life cycle the structure and parameters of our population model for pandalus borealis are largely based on information from rasmussen 1953 and shumway et al 1985 their fig 6 northern shrimp are protandric hermaphrodites i e born as males and later develop into females and breed more than once as females shumway et al 1985 the longevity of shrimp in the north sea is typically 3 5 years bergström 2000 the population model fig 2 corresponds to a leslie matrix with density dependent functions in the adult survival rates the time step is 3 months starting with spring march may the abundance of shrimp in this model is modelled as density the number of individuals per 100 m2 since very little information is available on the abundance of shrimp populations in norwegian fjords our results are best interpreted as relative abundance e g the abundance of populations in a given scenario relative to the control population for simplicity all individuals were assumed to have the same developmental rate so that the stage structure corresponds to the age structure this means that for each time step an individual can either move to the next developmental stage or die but it cannot stay in the same developmental stage the simplified life cycle assumed for our model is represented in table 1 together with the age specific demographic rates eggs are fertilised during autumn and carried by females during winter until they hatch and are released as larvae next spring year 1 of the model the larval developmental stage is commonly divided into six distinct substages shumway et al 1985 in our model for simplicity we let age class 1 correspond to the whole larval stage the larvae develop into juveniles and settle to the bottom during the summer of year 1 juveniles develop into mature males hereafter called males during summer of year 2 and further develop into females during spring of year 3 females can live until they are 5 years old and release new larvae up to 3 times during spring of year 3 4 and 5 after the last reproduction all females are assumed to die the model does not consider meta population dynamics such as migration between local shrimp populations in nearby fields or from the open sea 2 1 2 demographic rates the parameter values of the leslie matrix are given in table 1 the values given in the column ambcon ambient environment control treatment will be referred to as baseline parameters 2 1 2 1 survival the baseline survival was the proportion of individuals surviving from one 3 month time step to the next before accounting for density dependent processes in the control populations ambcon we have not found precise survival rates for each stage from the literature previously published population models are generally based on whole populations without parameters for stage specific survival e g hvingel and kingsley 2006 the stage specific survival rates in our model were therefore based on literature information and expert knowledge and tuned to generate a stable control population shrimp larvae in laboratory cultures can obtain high survival but in nature larvae will be sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature and food availability bergström 2000 the survival of adult shrimp seems to be regulated by fish predation particularly by cod berenboim et al 2008 fu et al 2001 wieland et al 2007 the baseline survival rate was assumed to be 0 05 for larvae maximum 0 95 for juveniles and males and 0 90 for females table 1 survival was assumed to be lower for age classes where individuals either develop into a new stage or reproduce the assumptions are as follows larvae have low survival as newly hatched in spring age class 1 baseline survival 0 05 juveniles have lowest survival during settlement at the bottom in summer age class 2 baseline survival 0 75 and during development to males in spring age class 5 baseline survival 0 75 males have lowest survival during development to transitionals in winter age class 8 baseline survival 0 75 which also have low survival during development to immature females in spring age class 9 baseline survival 0 75 females have lowest survival in autumn when they have produced eggs age classes 11 15 and 19 baseline survival 0 70 as well as during spring due to moulting age classes 13 and 17 baseline survival 0 70 the stochastic version of the model had a range of values for survival rates based on these baseline rates to represent variation in fishing and predation pressure see section 2 1 4 2 1 2 2 reproduction the mean reproductive output number of live larvae per female per season was based on information from previous experiments at iris international research institute of stavanger 1000 2000 live larvae per female the numbers were consistent with the range of fecundities reported for similar environments e g 600 5000 offspring per female shumway et al 1985 500 3000 eggs per female rasmussen 1953 1000 3000 eggs per female bøhle 1976 fecundity of female northern shrimp tends to increase with size and therefor with age shumway et al 1985 we assumed the age specific average fecundity to increase from age 3 years 1000 offspring per female to age 4 1500 and further to age 5 2000 the total number of larvae n 1 produced in spring was modelled as the sum of larvae produced by the three female age classes eq 1 1 n 1 t 1 f 1 n 12 t f 2 n 16 t f 3 n 20 t where f 1 f 3 are the age specific fecundities of females in age classes 12 16 and 20 respectively table 1 2 1 3 density dependence a difficult and unsolved question in fisheries biology is how and to what extent can populations of marine fish compensate for additional negative impacts imposed upon them nisbet et al 1996 for shrimp populations likewise it might be expected that density dependent processes result in some compensation of negative effects by external stressors although the importance of such processes for natural shrimp populations are uncertain bergström 2000 in stock assessment models for shrimp density dependence in yearly recruitment is often modelled by a beverton holt function representing fishing mortality fu et al 2001 ices 2016 oh et al 1999 punt et al 2013 the population dynamics in our model was governed by density dependent survival of adult shrimp which does not distinguish between predation and harvest the process is modelled by a density dependent function after maynard smith and slatkin 1973 eq 2 2 n k 1 t 1 s k n a t 1 a n a t b w h e r e k 6 where nk t is the number of individuals in age class k na is the total number of adults sk is the survival rate of individuals in age class k a is the strength of the density dependence and b is the degree of compensation this density dependent function is recommended for populations with undercompensatory density dependence bellows 1981 when b 1 this is identical to the original beverton holt model beverton and holt 1957 on which many fisheries models are based in the deterministic version our model see section 2 1 3 parameter value a 0 0003 corresponds to a carrying capacity of approximately 1000 adult individuals per 100 m2 i e 10 individuals per m2 we considered this a realistic maximum density compared to the high density range 0 5 3 individuals per m2 estimated for greenland wieland 2004 the parameter value b 0 5 represents partly compensating density dependence in our case this type of density dependence can be considered as top down regulation a higher density of shrimp will result in a higher number of shrimp removed by predation and or harvest we assumed that the adults of all age classes had density dependent survival and that the density dependence within each age class k was based on the total adult density the ss3 model used by ices has a beverton holt function in the yearly recruitment rate methot 2015 but the parametrization of this function cannot be directly transferred to the adult survival function in our age structured model we have not found other similar density dependent models for shrimp in the literature and therefore no relevant information for these parameters the parameters were therefore set to give a reasonable carrying capacity and stable population dynamics for the control population 2 1 4 stochasticity three main versions of the model can be defined 1 the deterministic version as described above 2 a version with environmental stochasticity temporal variation in larval survival and 3 a version with both environmental and demographic stochasticity variation in survival among replicate populations the two types of stochasticity are implemented as follows 2 1 4 1 environmental stochasticity temporal variation in larval survival the year class strength variability of pandalids is mainly determined during the pelagic larval phase by bottom up processes and variability in the timing of zooplankton production anderson 2000 pedersen and storm 2002 therefore it is likely that a match between the hatching of northern shrimp larvae and the development and timing of the plankton production cycle in spring is important for the success of a cohort ouellet et al 2011 we assumed the survival rate of newly hatched larvae to be affected by temporal fluctuation in environmental conditions representing the availability of zooplankton as food at the time of hatching see section 2 3 model scenarios each year of the model run would have a 25 probability of adverse environmental conditions which reduced the survival of age class 1 larvae by 50 i e from the baseline survival s 01 0 05 to 0 025 all replicate populations were affected equally by these adverse years 2 1 4 2 demographic stochasticity among population variation in survival the model was run for 100 replicate populations with different survival rates a range of survival rates was generated based on the assumed baseline survival rate table 1 for each replicate population the survival rate of all stages sk where k 1 19 was modified by a stochastic component vs representing an arbitrary amount of variation in survival eq 3 the exponent vs was generated from a normal distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation 0 1 and applied to all age classes and all time steps for the given population 3 n k 1 t 1 s k v s n k t the range of survival rates can represent different levels of predation harvest and or other environmental conditions 2 2 effects of dfb and environment on demographic rates information on the effects of dfb and environment treatments were obtained from experiments performed at iris described in full detail by bechmann et al 2017 2018 experiments were carried out separately for shrimp larvae bechmann et al 2018 experiment 1 and for adult females bechmann et al 2017 experiment 1 treatment dfbhigh in brief the experimental set up was a 2 2 treatment with two levels of dfb treatment control and dfb exposure and two levels of environmental conditions representing ambient and future environment the ambient environment treatment had water temperature 7 0 c and ph 8 0 while the future environment treatment had water temperature 9 5 c and ph 7 6 the future environment treatment called oaw ocean acidification and warming represented conditions of higher water temperature due to global warming and lower ph due to ocean acidification caused by increased atmospheric co2 concentration both experiments had six replicate aquaria for each treatment combination the larval experiment had on average 187 larvae per replicate while the adult experiment had on average 17 ovigerous females per replicate both larvae and adult females were exposed to dfb through medicated feed for two weeks which is the maximal allowed treatment period with dfb medicated feed for salmon farms the concentration of dfb in the food pellets was 0 7 g kg in addition the shrimp were exposed to a low concentration of suspended sediment particles containing medicated fish feed in the larval experiment the mean total concentration of dfb in the water dissolved and bound to particles was 1 5 μg l while the tissue concentration of exposed larvae was 180 ng g in the adult experiment with dfb treatment the mean concentration of dfb in the sediment was 568 ng g dry weight while the tissue concentration of exposed adults was 77 ng g the effects of the dfb and environment treatments on survival of larvae and adults are displayed in table 2 in summary the survival of both stages was strongly reduced by the dfb treatment and to a less degree by the future environment treatment larvae were slightly more sensitive to the dfb treatment than adults and considerably more sensitive to the future environment treatment than adults 2 3 model scenarios a set of 60 scenarios have been defined for the model the scenarios were a combination of the following five dimensions explained in more detail below 1 dfb exposure 2 levels control or dfb corresponding to the experimental treatments 2 environment 2 levels ambient or future warming and ocean acidification corresponding to the experimental treatments 3 timing of dfb application 3 levels spring autumn or spring autumn 4 percentage of the population exposed to dfb 3 levels low medium or high corresponding to respectively 5 25 or 50 of individuals of a population being exposed 5 environmental stochasticity 3 levels number of years where larval survival was reduced due to adverse environmental conditions never once or frequently see section 2 1 4 1 the dfb treatment levels were combined with all levels of the next four scenario dimensions resulting in 2 3 3 3 54 scenarios the six remaining scenarios were the ambient and future environment scenarios without dfb treatment corresponding to ambcon and futcon each with the three levels of environmental stochasticity the scenario of ambient environment without dfb treatment or stochasticity is referred to as the baseline scenario no 28 in table a1 2 3 1 dfb exposure 2 3 1 1 survival the effect of the different treatments on survival of larvae and adults was obtained from the percentage survival at the termination of the experiments described in section 2 2 see table 2 in the population model we modified the larval survival rate s 01 in scenarios with ambient environment and dfb treatment by multiplying the baseline survival function of the control population sk ambcon by the corresponding survival ratio from table 2 eq 4 4 s01 ambdfb 0 378 s01 ambcon for all subsequent age classes k 2 likewise the age specific survival sk see eq 2 in ambient dfb scenarios were calculated as eq 5 5 sk ambdfb 0 411 sk ambcon the effect of dfb and environment treatments reported for adult females bechmann et al 2017 was assumed to apply also for the juvenile male and transitional stages which had not been tested the modelled exposure to dfb was assigned to spring and or autumn when dfb is most likely to be applied in fish farms therefore only spring and or autumn survival was assumed to be affected by the dfb treatment any additional effects of the dfb treatment on survival in other seasons due to the long half life of this chemical are ignored by the model larvae were assumed to be affected by dfb treatment in spring only since the larval stage lasts only for the months march may the juvenile and adult shrimp could be exposed during both spring and autumn when they feed on organic matter containing dfb at the bottom the resulting survival rates for each treatment are listed in table a2 2 3 1 2 fecundity the reproductive rates were assumed not to be affected by the toxicant exposure because we have currently no relevant information from the experiments or from literature however dfb concentration of 0 075 ug l was reported to reduce reproduction in the mysid shrimp mysidopsis bahia fischer and hall 1992 if fecundity of p borealis would actually be reduced by dfb under the conditions represented by our model then our results will be more conservative in this respect i e predict weaker population level effects than experienced by real populations 2 3 1 3 development in the experiment with larvae bechmann et al 2018 future environment treatment resulted in a quicker development the intermoult period between the larval substages was approximately 9 and 6 days in ambcon and futcon treatments respectively conversely dfb exposure in the experiments resulted in slower development for the surviving larvae especially in the future environment treatments for example at the end of the experiment 19 days post hatching 70 of the larvae in the futcon treatment had reached larval stage iv while 77 of the surviving larvae in the futdfb treatment were still in stage ii fig 3 in bechmann et al 2018 the larvae that had not reached stage iv at this time would most likely not develop further and therefore not survive although these effects on development rates would be relevant for the population dynamics it is not possible to include it in the current model where each stage has a fixed duration this effect might be included later in a more advanced model with variable developmental rates 2 3 2 future environment the effect of future environment higher water temperature and reduced ph on survival in the model was based on the experiments in the same way as the effect of dfb exposure table 2 the experimental environment treatment had a strong negative effect on survival for both larvae and adults for both stages the effect of the environment treatment was weaker than the effect of dfb exposure the combined effect of the two treatments was additive i e there was no significant interaction between the two factors bechmann et al 2017 2018 it is reasonable to assume that the sensitivity of organisms to future environment can vary within a population due to variation in tolerance and processes such as acclimatisation and natural selection moreover it is likely that the effects of future environment will vary during the year the bottom water reaches the highest temperatures during winter and spring wallhead et al 2017 we chose to implement the effect of future environment on survival observed in the experiment for only for two age classes larvae developing into juveniles age class 1 and adults in the transition from male to female age class 9 our reasoning was that individuals that survived this developmental transition in a future environment would be adapted to those environmental conditions and therefore have normal baseline survival in the subsequent stages the survival rates of age classes 1 and 9 of the future environment population see table 1 were based on the effects on survival reported in table 2 and calculated as follows eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 s 01 futcon 0 722 s 01 ambcon 7 s 09 futcon 0 842 s 09 ambcon likewise the survival rates of these age classes in the future environment with dfb treatment were calculated as follows eqs 8 and 9 8 s 01 futdfb 0 089 s 01 ambcon 9 s 09 futdfb 0 284 s 09 ambcon we did not model any effects of future environment on fecundity since we had no information on such effects from the experiments 2 3 3 timing of dfb application the recommended frequency of treatment with flubenzurones is maximum every six months mattilsynet 2016 the application of dfb is most common in spring but can also occur in autumn we wanted to investigate the effects of dfb exposure in spring and autumn both separately and in combination since dfb exposure may affect the developmental stages differently and a population s stage structure vary during the year the timing of dfb exposure was implemented by selecting age specific survival rates from the respective columns in table 1 for example for the scenario ambient environment with dfb application in spring survival parameters were selected from the column ambdfb table 1 for all age classes in spring 1 5 9 13 and 17 and from column ambcon for all other age classes 2 3 4 degree of dfb exposure percentage of the population affected in the experimental dfb treatment populations 100 of the individuals were exposed to dfb in a natural shrimp population in a fjord however the percentage of individuals exposed to dfb is likely to be lower adults and juveniles which feed on the sea bottom may be more exposed to dfb through fish feed and debris than the pelagic larvae in the absence of information on the actual percentage of exposed individuals in a field population we have used the following hypothetical scenarios low medium and degree of exposure affects respectively 5 25 and 50 of the population by reducing these individuals probability of survival to the next age class by the same factor as reported in table 2 3 calculation 3 1 model running the model was run for 400 time steps of 3 months which corresponded to the four seasons spring summer autumn winter starting with spring the first 120 time steps were considered as a burn in period for obtaining a stable population structure after which the application of dfb was implemented the following 80 time steps were considered as a burn in period for the effect of dfb treatment and discarded from further analysis so that only the final 200 time steps were used in the data analyses the model was run for 100 replicate populations which differed due to the demographic stochasticity components in survival the initial abundance was 60 000 individuals per 100 m2 distributed across the respective age classes 1 5 9 13 and 17 in these proportions 96 667 3 0 3 0 03 and 0 003 this corresponds to an initial spring abundance of ca 200 adults per 100 m2 followed by a summer abundance of ca 1200 adults per 100 m2 which is slightly above the carrying capacity of ca 1000 adults per 100 m2 the assumed age class distribution was loosely based on information from age specific catch data shumway et al 1985 table 6 yanez 2000 tables 1 and 2 the youngest age classes are usually missing from catch data instead we assumed a high proportion for the first age class based on the reproductive rates and the final age structure of preliminary model versions 3 2 calculation and analysis of population level endpoints three types of population level endpoints were calculated from the simulated abundances from the end of the burn in period to the end of the simulation period long term abundances for each age class were calculated as the mean abundance over the given period only summer abundances were reported as results figs 3 and 4 table a1 realised demographic rates realised survival rates were calculated from the abundances of each age class divided by the abundance of the previous age class in the previous age step and averaged for the given period realised reproductive rate was calculated as the number of newly hatched larvae n 1 divided by the number of ovigerous females in the previous time step age classes 12 16 and 20 combined table a2 the risk of quasi extinction akçakaya 2000 was calculated as the percentage of replicate populations with long term summer abundance of adults falling below a given threshold abundance within the given period fig 5 the population level endpoints were analysed across three dimensions 1 the timing of the dfb application 2 the proportion of individuals exposed to dfb and 3 future vs ambient environment all statistical analyses were performed in the programming environment r version 3 5 0 r core team 2018 differences in long term abundances between scenarios were analysed by anova firstly the combined effects of dfb exposure and environment change were analysed within each scenario of dfb application season and exposure level table 3 secondly the long term abundance was analysed by one way anova across all scenarios of dfb application and exposure within the ambient and future environment scenarios respectively fig 4 scenarios resulting in significantly different abundance were identified by tukey s significantly honest difference r package multcompview graves et al 2015 3 3 sensitivity analysis for density independent matrix population models sensitivity or elasticity analysis of the population growth rate is commonly performed e g by analysis of eigen values caswell 2009 or by simulated perturbations åberg et al 2009 however density independent elasticities of the intrinsic population growth rate are a poor indicator of the effects of changes in demographic parameters on population size grant and benton 2003 in our study we analysed the sensitivity of the population dynamics to stage specific stressor impacts by perturbing four key demographic parameters and inspecting the effects on long term stage specific abundances figs a1 and 6 the deterministic model version without environmental fluctuation or demographic stochasticity was used for the sensitivity analysis the following parameters were perturbed larval survival s 01 juvenile survival s 05 male survival s 08 female survival s 12 and reproduction f 1 f 2 f 3 each parameter was perturbed by a gradient of 16 values ranging of 35 115 of the reference value column ambcon in table 1 the lower end of the perturbation 35 of the reference value was set to exceed the most severe effect imposed by the experimental dfb exposure under ambient environment table 2 survival in treatment ambdfb relative to survival in ambcon 37 8 for larvae 41 1 for adults 4 results and discussion 4 1 behaviour of the population model the simulated dynamics of the adult stage of one of the populations in the baseline scenario ambient environment no dfb stable environment is illustrated in fig 3 a blue curve the damped oscillations during the initial years 0 20 result from density dependent compensations in combination with discrete time steps four per year the average final adult abundance of all replicate populations in the deterministic model with the baseline scenario was 1024 individuals per 100 m2 table a1 scenario no 28 corresponding to the assumed carrying capacity of approximately 1000 adults with 58 coefficient of variation the variation among the replicate populations was due to the stochastic component of the survival rates which were intended to represent a range in predation and fishing pressures adverse environmental conditions were modelled by reducing the survival of the larvae by 50 when adverse conditions occurred only once fig 3b blue curve the population would recover and obtain approximately the same long term abundance as for the stable environment table a1 scenario 29 the recovery was due to density dependent compensation the cohort that experienced high larval mortality obtained lower density when they became adults and therefore had lower loss of adults due to density dependent mortality predation and fishing the single reduction in larval survival resulted in damped oscillations in abundance lasting for 20 30 years corresponding to the oscillations in the initial years these oscillations are not meant to represent the actual population dynamics and are not expected to influence the analysed population level endpoints when adverse environmental conditions occurred frequently fig 3c blue curve the population was not able to fully recover between each adverse year and the resulting long term abundance was reduced by 12 7 compared to the baseline table a1 scenario 28 to 894 adults per 100 m2 scenario 30 the long term average larval survival was decreased e g from 0 0506 table a2 scenario 28 to 0 0456 scenario 30 however this reduction in larval survival was to some degree compensated by an increase in survival of the subsequent stages e g from 0 143 to 0 155 for males the slightly lower long term abundance in scenarios with fluctuating conditions corresponds to lower carrying capacity due to insufficient food for the larvae in some of the years thus the population dynamics of this model were regulated by both bottom up food limitation and top down processes predation and fishing the temporal variation in abundance coefficient of variation in the baseline scenario with environmental fluctuation scenario 30 was 30 for juveniles 26 for adults and 21 for the total population the long term stage structure not shown was consistent across different scenarios all further results are therefore described for the adult stage only 4 2 predicted effects of dfb on shrimp populations under ambient and future environment the dynamics of the populations subject to dfb treatment stabilised at lower abundances than the baseline population fig 3 blue vs other curves this implies that the loss of individuals due to dfb related mortality was only partly compensated by a reduction in density dependent mortality the effect of dfb treatment on the abundance of adult shrimp depended on the degree of exposure as well as the season of application table 3 the negative effect of dfb treatments on abundance was statistically significant when the exposure level was medium or high i e affecting 25 50 of the population fig 4 the future environment scenario which represent bottom water conditions altered by ocean acidification and warming towards the end of this century also reduced the population abundances figs 3 and 4 lower vs upper panel the long term adult abundance of populations in all the future scenarios table a1 no 31 60 was on average only 52 of the corresponding ambient environment scenarios in combination with dfb treatment however the future environment effect was statistically significant only in scenarios where dfb had the lowest effect i e treatment in autumn only table 3 the future environment treatment had a positive interaction with the dfb treatments table 3 the positive interaction implies the reduction in abundance caused by dfb is lower under future environment than ambient environment e g the slope from the midpoint of the blue box to the yellow box in fig 4 f is less steep than the corresponding slope in fig 4c such a positive interaction mainly reflects the fact that the simulated populations under future environment start at a lower density and therefore cannot obtain as steep reduction slope due to dfb treatment as the ambient environment populations the interaction between these two factors will therefore not be further discussed instead the combined effects of dfb application season and exposure level were inspected in more detail by one way anova within each environment scenario with each group corresponding to one bar in fig 4 the combined effects of dfb application season and exposure level showed the same pattern within both environment scenarios i e the upper and lower panel of fig 4 mostly have the same set of letters above the bars across all scenarios of season the medium and high exposure levels resulted in significantly lower adult abundance than the control and the low exposure level moreover the effect of the high exposure was significantly stronger than the medium exposure except for in fig 4f effects of dfb treatment with low exposure did not differ from the control dfb treatment in spring fig 4b resulted in lower abundance than autumn treatment fig 4a when the exposure was high a likely explanation is that treatment in spring also exposed the larval stage which was more strongly affected by the dfb treatment than adults table 2 the effects of spring treatment with low exposure overlapped with the effects of autumn treatment with medium exposure similarly the effects of spring treatment with medium exposure overlapped with the effects of autumn treatment with high exposure dfb treatment in both seasons fig 4c resulted in lower abundance than dfb treatment in autumn only when the exposure was medium or high however the effects of dfb treatment in both seasons were not significantly different from the treatment in spring only the risk of population decline below a given threshold quasi extinction cf akçakaya 2000 is illustrated in fig 5 the risk curves are extracted from the long term average abundances of all replicate populations cf moe et al 2008 this way the variation in survival among the replicates representing unknown harvest and predation rates is summarised as percentages which can be interpreted as probability for example in the ambient control scenario blue curves the probability that abundance drops from ca 1000 to below 500 adult shrimp per 100 m2 x axis is only 18 considering dfb treatment with medium exposure level under ambient environment arrows in fig 5 there is a 58 probability of decline below 500 adults if dfb is applied in spring only fig 5b and 78 probability if dfb is applied in both seasons fig 5c for the same dfb treatment in future environment conditions the corresponding probabilities of population decline are 89 if dfb is applied in spring fig 5e and 96 if dfb is applied in both seasons fig 5f 4 3 model assessment the purpose of this population model was to investigate the long term population level responses under different scenarios of dfb treatment and environmental conditions since most parameters were unknown we also accounted for variation in environmental conditions and ecological processes larval survival rates were unknown but can be expected to be variable over time this was accounted for by environmental fluctuation adverse conditions with irregular intervals adult survival is likely to be affected by predation and fishing but the extent is unknown and probably variable this was accounted for by among population variation in survival rates eq 3 table a2 our model assumes an intrinsic yearly survival rate of 0 397 for females e g s 13 s 14 s 15 s 16 table 1 for the baseline scenario no 28 the realised survival rate for these age classes are lower in all scenarios 0 118 0 215 table a2 due to the assumed density dependent processes of fishing and predation the realised survival rates are comparable to the estimated yearly survival rates of 0 225 0 350 for spawning females of p borealis in skagerrak and the norwegian deep for the period 1998 2014 these estimates are based on fishing mortality assessments found in table 5 2 3 column f 1 3 years of ices 2016 and include both yearly natural mortality m 0 75 and yearly fishing mortality f 0 483 calculated as exp f m for reproduction reliable and relevant estimates for egg production by individual females eq 1 were available from the authors r k bechmann unpublished and corresponded well with fecundities reported previously e g shumway et al 1985 there are no monitoring data on abundance of shrimp populations in norwegian fjords available for comparison with our model predictions however the temporal variation in abundances predicted by our model with environmental fluctuation coefficient of variation 26 for adults 22 for the whole population corresponds well with the temporal variation in estimated biomass for shrimp in skagerrak and the norwegian deep for the period 1988 2014 ices 2016 table 5 2 3 31 for spawning stock biomass 26 for total biomass this correspondence indicates that a reasonable amount of environmental fluctuation has been assumed for our population model potential effects of dfb on fecundity were not accounted for in our model since it was not tested in the experiment with adult shrimp bechmann et al 2017 in this respect our model can be considered conservative i e it predicts a lower population level risk of dfb than what real populations might experience the developmental rate was reported to increase under future environment but decrease with dfb treatment bechmann et al 2018 neither of these changes was not accounted for in our model with fixed stage structure the larvae that developed more slowly after dfb exposure were likely not able to complete their development at all and therefore contributed to higher mortality than reported by the end of the experiments table 2 this implies that the cumulative including delayed effects of dfb on survival may be higher than those assumed in the population model table 1 faster development of shrimp embryos in warmer water has also been reported by others brillon et al 2005 and might in principle benefit the population growth however changes in the development time may also imply a higher risk of temporal mismatch with the food sources corresponding to more frequent or stronger adverse conditions in our model since climate change is associated with many indirect effects and high uncertainty we did not investigate this possibility further density dependence is normally required in population models to obtain stable abundances in the long run a density independent model was developed for projecting population level effects of toxicants on the shrimp americamysis bahia this model predicted exponential population growth and would become more realistic with density dependence kuhn et al 2001 2000 in other shrimp population models without density dependence parameters have been adjusted to avoid population extinction or explosion labat 1991 raimondo and mckenney 2006 in our model the assumed density dependence in adult survival eq 2 strongly affected the simulated population dynamics and thus the modelled effects of dfb on long term abundance if a natural shrimp population has weaker density dependence than assumed in our model it would have lower capacity of compensation for dfb related mortality this implies that population level effects of dfb would be stronger therefore our model with relatively strong density dependence can be considered conservative also in this respect further development of this model can include scenarios with alternative types and strengths of density dependence following the example of a modelling study of consequences for adult fish stocks of human induced mortality on immatures nisbet et al 1996 it should be noted that complete extinction of a population is prevented by the density dependence in our model even when abundance falls below one individual it would be possible to modify the model to allow for extinction in such cases on the other hand we have not taken into account processes preventing local extinction such as migration among shrimp fields therefore the probability of extinction is not the most relevant population level endpoint for our study the sensitivity analysis illustrates how each of the stage specific abundances responded to a range of perturbation in different demographic rates in the deterministic version of the model figs a1 and 6 the population was most sensitive to the survival of males in transition to females fig 6 c h m this perturbation reduced the recruitment to the first female age group which had the highest density of females and therefore the highest contribution to the total offspring production the population was least sensitive to reduced female survival i e survival of 3 year old females after their first reproduction fig 6d i n the likely explanation is that the older females contributed relatively little to the total abundance of females and therefore also to the total offspring production reduced larval survival strongly reduced the abundance of juveniles and males fig 6a f the subsequent reduction in abundance of females was lower fig 6k since this loss was partly compensated by density dependence in the adult stage corresponding to reduced competition or predation rate reduced reproduction had a very similar effect as reduced larval survival fig 6e j o reduced juvenile survival strongly reduced the abundance of the next stage males fig 6g while the subsequent reduction in abundance of females fig 6h was partly compensated by density dependence the larval stage was more sensitive to dfb than the adult stage in the laboratory experiments table 2 which is in accordance with studies of dfb impacts on other shrimp species wilson and costlow 1987 in contrast the modelled shrimp populations were more sensitive to reduction in adult male survival than to reduction in larval survival the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that a population level risk assessment needs to account for stage specific impacts on the population as well as stage specific sensitivity to the stressor 4 4 implications for ecological risk assessment of dfb to fjord shrimp populations the harmful effects of dfb to survival of both adult and larval shrimp have been clearly demonstrated by recent laboratory experiments bechmann et al 2017 2018 extrapolation of these results to the population level and to the natural environment by population modelling will make these findings more applicable for ecological risk assessment however the many assumptions underlying the population model must be considered when interpreting the predicted risks to shrimp populations our population model may be considered conservative i e predicting weaker effects than in reality in some respects i the density dependence in adult survival provided some capacity for compensation to external mortality factors ii dfb exposure affected only a proportion of the population iii future environmental conditions affected the population for only a part of the year and iv adverse conditions for larval survival may happen more frequently than one out of four years nafo ices 2017 on the other hand the high levels of stochasticity affecting survival of both larvae and adults increased the risk of quasi extinction by chance given these uncertainties the most reasonable use of our results is by focusing on the comparison of effects of the different scenarios rather than on the predicted values of abundances our results demonstrate that the number of dfb treatments per year affect the risk to shrimp populations dfb application in both seasons with high degree of exposure resulted in significantly lower abundance than application in either autumn or spring table 3 fig 4 a stronger population level effect might be expected by dfb application in spring than in autumn the spring treatment affected also larval survival which was more strongly reduced than adult survival table 2 our results indicated a stronger effect of dfb application in spring table 3 when a medium or high proportion of the population was affected fig 4 this finding suggests that shifting the timing of dfb application from spring to autumn might be beneficial for shrimp populations since our results are not conclusive the effects of such a change should be further investigated the degree of dfb exposure to the population i e the proportion of the population experiencing the same effect as in the experiments strongly affected the population level risk of dfb having fish farms in a certain distance from shrimp fields as recommended by mattilsynet 2016 can limit the proportion of the shrimp population exposed for a specific shrimp field local conditions such as bathymetry mud thickness currents and resuspension will be important to predict the exposure to the shrimp populations an investigation of the dispersal of particulate organic matter from salmon farms in central norway broch et al 2017 showed that the distribution of organic matter in the bottom layer was non homogeneous with significant temporal variation and transport and settling of matter up to 0 5 km away from a farm dispersal model simulations indicated that transport as far as 2 km from the fish farms may be significant broch et al 2017 moreover a real fjord population can be exposed to dfb from several fish farms located in the same fjord see fig 1 each of which can apply dfb twice per year shrimp may also move towards fish farms too feed on residual feed and faeces obtaining realistic estimates of dfb exposure for real shrimp will therefore be a challenge the assumed future environment conditions in this study temperature 9 5 c ph 7 6 resulted in significantly lower population abundance than the ambient environment table 3 although the effects on survival observed in experiments were implemented only for limited periods in the model age classes 1 and 9 this level of ocean warming can be expected in bottom waters in south western norway by the end of this century simulated average winter temperature for 2090 2099 9 70 c while the level of acidification can be expected in the following decades simulated average winter ph for 2090 2099 7 69 wallhead et al 2017 it can be argued that shrimp populations will adapt to changed environmental conditions such as warming and ocean acidification in the long term so that long term effects of environmental change should be weaker than observed in lab experiments on the other hand climate change will also have several indirect effects on shrimp populations via ecological interactions for example earlier development of zooplankton durant et al 2007 might result in adverse conditions less food availability for shrimp larvae occurring more often the timing of larval food availability is crucial for the survival of the shrimp recruits nafo ices 2017 moreover higher temperature will cause higher metabolism of the shrimp larvae which will increase their energy requirement arnberg et al 2013 and potentially reduce their growth rate franco et al 2006 either way to give accurate predictions on responses to future climate and environmental change is beyond the scope of our study instead we have demonstrated how individual level effects of a plausible environment scenario in combination with a toxicant stressor can be manifested on the population level according to our model the interaction between the dfb and environmental stressors at the population level was antagonistic table 3 meaning that the combined negative effect of the two stressor types was less than additive the compensatory capacity of the population due to density dependent adult survival is again a likely explanation in real populations individual variation in sensitivity which was not modelled here could also contribute to a less than additive combined effect moe et al 2013 if the most dfb sensitive individuals are also the most sensitive to environmental stress then the individuals surviving the dfb exposure will be more resistant to environmental stress than the population average regardless of the strength and direction of the stressor interaction we can conclude that in a future environment with warmer and more acidic water shrimp populations are likely to be more sensitive to chemical stressors such as dfb our calculation of risk of the adult population decline below given threshold values fig 5 corresponds to ices estimated risk of shrimp spawning stock biomass ssb below reference points such as blim the lowest observed ssb and msy btrigger the 5th percentile of the expected range of variation in ssb when fishing at maximum sustainable yield ices 2016 the overarching principle of ices is that fishing pressure should result in no more than 5 probability of ssb being below blim in our model the calculation of probability of population decline below a threshold was based on the inter population difference in abundance which resulted from the modelled variation in survival rate eq 3 in the current version of the population model the range in survival rate for replicate populations mainly represents our uncertainty if more information becomes available on adult survival rates in real shrimp populations in our study area then this range can be adjusted to better represent real inter population variation for now the risk curves fig 5 can serve as a demonstration of how population model predictions can be applied in risk assessment for shrimp under scenarios of stressor combinations more reliable ecological risk estimates for northern shrimp populations in fjords will require data on abundances as well as more knowledge on ecological factors affecting the population dynamics of these populations shrimp populations in northern norwegian fjords have been monitored since 2017 but the data are not yet available pers comm g søvik imr such data can later be used to assess and adjust our population model further development of this population model would particularly benefit from more information on i effects of environmental fluctuations on larval survival ii effects of predation and fishing on adult abundance and iii the strength of density dependent mechanisms that compensate the losses due to toxicant exposures and other environmental stressors furthermore more realistic scenarios on dfb exposure to shrimp populations in fjords could be obtained from more field data and modelling of the spread and fate of waste from aquaculture sites olsen et al 2012 exposure modelling for another commonly used salmon lice treatment hydrogen peroxide refseth et al 2016 has demonstrated the importance of several environmental factors for the risk of chemical to different non target species a combination of exposure effect and population modelling would more strongly support the risk assessment of such stressors 4 5 conclusions the population model developed for northern shrimp populations in fjords with salmon farms can be used to assess how the risk from exposure to salmon lice medicine diflubenzuron is affected by factors such as the frequency and timing of dfb applications the proportion of the population affected by exposure future environmental conditions ocean warming and acidification and environmental fluctuations in food availability for larvae more reliable estimates of risks to shrimp populations in fjords could be obtained with monitoring data on shrimp population abundances in such fjords and more knowledge on the fate and distribution of dfb in these environments credit authorship contribution statement s jannicke moe

24963,marine aquaculture production has lately experienced high economic growth but also concerns related to production and environmental contamination for the atlantic salmon aquaculture industry the ectoparasitic crustacean salmon louse lepeophtheirus salmonis has become a major problem a common method to control populations of salmon lice within farm cages is treatment by various pharmaceuticals one of the pesticides used in medicated feed for salmon is diflubenzuron dfb which acts as a chitin synthesis inhibitor and thereby interferes with the moulting stages during the development of this crustacean however dfb from fish feed may also affect non target crustaceans such as the northern shrimp pandalus borealis which is an economically and ecologically important species nevertheless the actual risk posed by this chemical to shrimp populations in nature is largely unknown laboratory experiments have demonstrated that both larval and adult shrimp exposed to dfb through medicated fish feed have reduced survival compared to control moreover the effects of dfb exposure are more severe under conditions of higher temperature and reduced ph ocean acidification which can be expected in a future environment the aim of this study is to make the individual level information from laboratory studies more relevant for risk assessment at the population level we have developed a density dependent age structured population model representing a northern shrimp population located in a hypothetical norwegian fjord containing a fish farm under both ambient and future environments our model is based on thorough documentation of shrimp biology and toxicological effects from the laboratory experiments nevertheless extrapolating the reported individual level effects of dfb to the population level poses several challenges relevant information on shrimp populations in norwegian fjords is sparse such as abundances survival and reproductive rates and density dependent processes the degree of exposure to dfb at different distances from aquaculture farms is also uncertain we have therefore developed a set of model scenarios representing different dfb application schemes and different degrees of exposure for the shrimp populations the model predicts effects of dfb exposure on population level endpoints such as long term abundance age structure and the probability of population decline below threshold abundances these model predictions demonstrate how the risk of dfb to shrimp populations can be enhanced by factors such as the timing season of dfb applications the percentage of the population affected future environmental conditions and environmental stochasticity abbreviations csi chitin synthesis inhibitor dfb diflubenzuron keywords population model northern shrimp aquaculture salmon lice medicine density dependence stochasticity 1 introduction marine aquaculture production has lately experienced high economic growth but also concerns related to production and environmental contamination for the atlantic salmon aquaculture industry the ectoparasitic salmon louse lepeophtheirus salmonis has become a major problem the increasing use of antiparasitic drugs against this crustacean parasite has raised concerns regarding potential impacts on non target crustaceans langford et al 2014 macken et al 2015 a commonly used pesticide against salmon lice is diflubenzuron dfb which acts as a chitin synthesis inhibitor csi and thereby interferes with the moulting process of crustaceans during their development elevated levels of csi have been detected in tissues of non target crustaceans in areas where medicated feed is used langford et al 2014 samuelsen 2016 there is concern that csi from fish feed may also affect non target crustaceans such as the northern shrimp pandalus borealis which is an economically and ecologically important species in colder parts of the atlantic bergström 2000 in norway local fishermen question why they catch less shrimp in fjords with salmon aquaculture and the competent authorities have requested information on the influence of antiparasitic drugs on non target crustaceans gaulin and skarland 2015 laboratory experiments have demonstrated that shrimp exposed to dfb through fish feed have reduced survival as adults bechmann et al 2017 as well as during the larval life stage bechmann et al 2018 waste from fish farms provides food for local shrimp populations olsen et al 2012 shrimp may therefore accumulate dfb through consumption of both medicated feed and salmon faeces as well as from contaminated fauna langford et al 2014 grefsrud et al 2018 provide some information on the spatial distribution and persistence of dfb in fjords flubenzurones have been found in sediment up to 1 km from farms and the half time is estimated to be 110 170 days however there is little information on the degree of exposure to shrimp habitats therefore the risks associated with dfb to shrimp populations and other non target species is largely unknown grefsrud et al 2018 in their natural environment shrimp populations may also be affected by environmental stressors that can be expected to increase in the future due to co2 emission such as ocean acidification and warming a downscaling ocean biogeochemical model projected that bottom waters along the norwegian coast will reach average temperatures of 9 7 c from currently 8 0 c and ph down to 7 7 from currently 8 0 during winters in the decade 2090 2099 wallhead et al 2017 these additional stressors should also be accounted for when assessing the population level effects of dfb on shrimp in the long term future the aim of this study was to assess the potential effects of dfb exposure from salmon aquaculture on local shrimp populations based on information on effects on individual shrimp the hypothetical location represents a shrimp field in a fjord in south western norway where there is a high density of both salmon aquaculture sites and shrimp fields along the coast fig 1 fjord shrimp populations tend to be genetically different from open sea populations knutsen et al 2015 and even populations from spatially proximate fjords may respond differently to environmental stress hall 2017 although the fjord populations are of less economic value than open sea populations local stocks may prove important to uphold genetic variability and biocomplexity in a changing environment knutsen et al 2015 most existing population models for shrimp are developed for stock assessment based on commercial landings and effort data from shrimp populations in open sea the pandalus borealis stock of skagerrak and the norwegian deep was assessed annually by the international council for the exploration of the sea ices by qualitative non model based interpretation of various stock indices until 2012 from 2012 onwards a bayesian surplus production model based on yearly estimates of the total biomass formed the basis for the stock assessment and for deriving catch advice hvingel and kingsley 2006 more recently a length based model implemented in stock synthesis ss3 with a fixed natural mortality rate has been applied to better represent the demography of the shrimp population ices 2016 the model has a quarterly 3 month time step to better capture the rapid growth of the shrimp a population model for our purpose needed more detailed specification of processes such as stage or age specific survival than the mentioned ss3 stock assessment model one reason is that the adult and larval stages have shown different sensitivity to dfb exposure bechmann et al 2017 2018 an age structured population model might also show different effects of dfb treatment in different seasons since the larval stage only lasts for a few months in spring we constructed an age structured population model with a seasonal 3 month time step and age specific survival and reproductive rates this model structure could capture stage and sex specific sensitivity to the toxicant to seasonal changes in the environment and to dfb application in different seasons the shrimp population model contains stochastic components in survival rates representing both environmental and demographic stochasticity the modelled effects of dfb exposure and environment change are derived from experimental data bechmann et al 2017 2018 the model was run for scenarios representing different timing of dfb application and different degrees of dfb exposure to the shrimp populations as well as different levels of environmental fluctuation the purpose of the model was to investigate 1 how the effects of dfb exposure documented for larval and adult shrimp individuals transfer to the population level and 2 how the population level effects of dfb are affected by future environmental conditions such a population model can be used to assess the risk of shrimp population decline below a threshold abundance under different scenarios of stressors and environmental conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 model structure 2 1 1 life cycle the structure and parameters of our population model for pandalus borealis are largely based on information from rasmussen 1953 and shumway et al 1985 their fig 6 northern shrimp are protandric hermaphrodites i e born as males and later develop into females and breed more than once as females shumway et al 1985 the longevity of shrimp in the north sea is typically 3 5 years bergström 2000 the population model fig 2 corresponds to a leslie matrix with density dependent functions in the adult survival rates the time step is 3 months starting with spring march may the abundance of shrimp in this model is modelled as density the number of individuals per 100 m2 since very little information is available on the abundance of shrimp populations in norwegian fjords our results are best interpreted as relative abundance e g the abundance of populations in a given scenario relative to the control population for simplicity all individuals were assumed to have the same developmental rate so that the stage structure corresponds to the age structure this means that for each time step an individual can either move to the next developmental stage or die but it cannot stay in the same developmental stage the simplified life cycle assumed for our model is represented in table 1 together with the age specific demographic rates eggs are fertilised during autumn and carried by females during winter until they hatch and are released as larvae next spring year 1 of the model the larval developmental stage is commonly divided into six distinct substages shumway et al 1985 in our model for simplicity we let age class 1 correspond to the whole larval stage the larvae develop into juveniles and settle to the bottom during the summer of year 1 juveniles develop into mature males hereafter called males during summer of year 2 and further develop into females during spring of year 3 females can live until they are 5 years old and release new larvae up to 3 times during spring of year 3 4 and 5 after the last reproduction all females are assumed to die the model does not consider meta population dynamics such as migration between local shrimp populations in nearby fields or from the open sea 2 1 2 demographic rates the parameter values of the leslie matrix are given in table 1 the values given in the column ambcon ambient environment control treatment will be referred to as baseline parameters 2 1 2 1 survival the baseline survival was the proportion of individuals surviving from one 3 month time step to the next before accounting for density dependent processes in the control populations ambcon we have not found precise survival rates for each stage from the literature previously published population models are generally based on whole populations without parameters for stage specific survival e g hvingel and kingsley 2006 the stage specific survival rates in our model were therefore based on literature information and expert knowledge and tuned to generate a stable control population shrimp larvae in laboratory cultures can obtain high survival but in nature larvae will be sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature and food availability bergström 2000 the survival of adult shrimp seems to be regulated by fish predation particularly by cod berenboim et al 2008 fu et al 2001 wieland et al 2007 the baseline survival rate was assumed to be 0 05 for larvae maximum 0 95 for juveniles and males and 0 90 for females table 1 survival was assumed to be lower for age classes where individuals either develop into a new stage or reproduce the assumptions are as follows larvae have low survival as newly hatched in spring age class 1 baseline survival 0 05 juveniles have lowest survival during settlement at the bottom in summer age class 2 baseline survival 0 75 and during development to males in spring age class 5 baseline survival 0 75 males have lowest survival during development to transitionals in winter age class 8 baseline survival 0 75 which also have low survival during development to immature females in spring age class 9 baseline survival 0 75 females have lowest survival in autumn when they have produced eggs age classes 11 15 and 19 baseline survival 0 70 as well as during spring due to moulting age classes 13 and 17 baseline survival 0 70 the stochastic version of the model had a range of values for survival rates based on these baseline rates to represent variation in fishing and predation pressure see section 2 1 4 2 1 2 2 reproduction the mean reproductive output number of live larvae per female per season was based on information from previous experiments at iris international research institute of stavanger 1000 2000 live larvae per female the numbers were consistent with the range of fecundities reported for similar environments e g 600 5000 offspring per female shumway et al 1985 500 3000 eggs per female rasmussen 1953 1000 3000 eggs per female bøhle 1976 fecundity of female northern shrimp tends to increase with size and therefor with age shumway et al 1985 we assumed the age specific average fecundity to increase from age 3 years 1000 offspring per female to age 4 1500 and further to age 5 2000 the total number of larvae n 1 produced in spring was modelled as the sum of larvae produced by the three female age classes eq 1 1 n 1 t 1 f 1 n 12 t f 2 n 16 t f 3 n 20 t where f 1 f 3 are the age specific fecundities of females in age classes 12 16 and 20 respectively table 1 2 1 3 density dependence a difficult and unsolved question in fisheries biology is how and to what extent can populations of marine fish compensate for additional negative impacts imposed upon them nisbet et al 1996 for shrimp populations likewise it might be expected that density dependent processes result in some compensation of negative effects by external stressors although the importance of such processes for natural shrimp populations are uncertain bergström 2000 in stock assessment models for shrimp density dependence in yearly recruitment is often modelled by a beverton holt function representing fishing mortality fu et al 2001 ices 2016 oh et al 1999 punt et al 2013 the population dynamics in our model was governed by density dependent survival of adult shrimp which does not distinguish between predation and harvest the process is modelled by a density dependent function after maynard smith and slatkin 1973 eq 2 2 n k 1 t 1 s k n a t 1 a n a t b w h e r e k 6 where nk t is the number of individuals in age class k na is the total number of adults sk is the survival rate of individuals in age class k a is the strength of the density dependence and b is the degree of compensation this density dependent function is recommended for populations with undercompensatory density dependence bellows 1981 when b 1 this is identical to the original beverton holt model beverton and holt 1957 on which many fisheries models are based in the deterministic version our model see section 2 1 3 parameter value a 0 0003 corresponds to a carrying capacity of approximately 1000 adult individuals per 100 m2 i e 10 individuals per m2 we considered this a realistic maximum density compared to the high density range 0 5 3 individuals per m2 estimated for greenland wieland 2004 the parameter value b 0 5 represents partly compensating density dependence in our case this type of density dependence can be considered as top down regulation a higher density of shrimp will result in a higher number of shrimp removed by predation and or harvest we assumed that the adults of all age classes had density dependent survival and that the density dependence within each age class k was based on the total adult density the ss3 model used by ices has a beverton holt function in the yearly recruitment rate methot 2015 but the parametrization of this function cannot be directly transferred to the adult survival function in our age structured model we have not found other similar density dependent models for shrimp in the literature and therefore no relevant information for these parameters the parameters were therefore set to give a reasonable carrying capacity and stable population dynamics for the control population 2 1 4 stochasticity three main versions of the model can be defined 1 the deterministic version as described above 2 a version with environmental stochasticity temporal variation in larval survival and 3 a version with both environmental and demographic stochasticity variation in survival among replicate populations the two types of stochasticity are implemented as follows 2 1 4 1 environmental stochasticity temporal variation in larval survival the year class strength variability of pandalids is mainly determined during the pelagic larval phase by bottom up processes and variability in the timing of zooplankton production anderson 2000 pedersen and storm 2002 therefore it is likely that a match between the hatching of northern shrimp larvae and the development and timing of the plankton production cycle in spring is important for the success of a cohort ouellet et al 2011 we assumed the survival rate of newly hatched larvae to be affected by temporal fluctuation in environmental conditions representing the availability of zooplankton as food at the time of hatching see section 2 3 model scenarios each year of the model run would have a 25 probability of adverse environmental conditions which reduced the survival of age class 1 larvae by 50 i e from the baseline survival s 01 0 05 to 0 025 all replicate populations were affected equally by these adverse years 2 1 4 2 demographic stochasticity among population variation in survival the model was run for 100 replicate populations with different survival rates a range of survival rates was generated based on the assumed baseline survival rate table 1 for each replicate population the survival rate of all stages sk where k 1 19 was modified by a stochastic component vs representing an arbitrary amount of variation in survival eq 3 the exponent vs was generated from a normal distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation 0 1 and applied to all age classes and all time steps for the given population 3 n k 1 t 1 s k v s n k t the range of survival rates can represent different levels of predation harvest and or other environmental conditions 2 2 effects of dfb and environment on demographic rates information on the effects of dfb and environment treatments were obtained from experiments performed at iris described in full detail by bechmann et al 2017 2018 experiments were carried out separately for shrimp larvae bechmann et al 2018 experiment 1 and for adult females bechmann et al 2017 experiment 1 treatment dfbhigh in brief the experimental set up was a 2 2 treatment with two levels of dfb treatment control and dfb exposure and two levels of environmental conditions representing ambient and future environment the ambient environment treatment had water temperature 7 0 c and ph 8 0 while the future environment treatment had water temperature 9 5 c and ph 7 6 the future environment treatment called oaw ocean acidification and warming represented conditions of higher water temperature due to global warming and lower ph due to ocean acidification caused by increased atmospheric co2 concentration both experiments had six replicate aquaria for each treatment combination the larval experiment had on average 187 larvae per replicate while the adult experiment had on average 17 ovigerous females per replicate both larvae and adult females were exposed to dfb through medicated feed for two weeks which is the maximal allowed treatment period with dfb medicated feed for salmon farms the concentration of dfb in the food pellets was 0 7 g kg in addition the shrimp were exposed to a low concentration of suspended sediment particles containing medicated fish feed in the larval experiment the mean total concentration of dfb in the water dissolved and bound to particles was 1 5 μg l while the tissue concentration of exposed larvae was 180 ng g in the adult experiment with dfb treatment the mean concentration of dfb in the sediment was 568 ng g dry weight while the tissue concentration of exposed adults was 77 ng g the effects of the dfb and environment treatments on survival of larvae and adults are displayed in table 2 in summary the survival of both stages was strongly reduced by the dfb treatment and to a less degree by the future environment treatment larvae were slightly more sensitive to the dfb treatment than adults and considerably more sensitive to the future environment treatment than adults 2 3 model scenarios a set of 60 scenarios have been defined for the model the scenarios were a combination of the following five dimensions explained in more detail below 1 dfb exposure 2 levels control or dfb corresponding to the experimental treatments 2 environment 2 levels ambient or future warming and ocean acidification corresponding to the experimental treatments 3 timing of dfb application 3 levels spring autumn or spring autumn 4 percentage of the population exposed to dfb 3 levels low medium or high corresponding to respectively 5 25 or 50 of individuals of a population being exposed 5 environmental stochasticity 3 levels number of years where larval survival was reduced due to adverse environmental conditions never once or frequently see section 2 1 4 1 the dfb treatment levels were combined with all levels of the next four scenario dimensions resulting in 2 3 3 3 54 scenarios the six remaining scenarios were the ambient and future environment scenarios without dfb treatment corresponding to ambcon and futcon each with the three levels of environmental stochasticity the scenario of ambient environment without dfb treatment or stochasticity is referred to as the baseline scenario no 28 in table a1 2 3 1 dfb exposure 2 3 1 1 survival the effect of the different treatments on survival of larvae and adults was obtained from the percentage survival at the termination of the experiments described in section 2 2 see table 2 in the population model we modified the larval survival rate s 01 in scenarios with ambient environment and dfb treatment by multiplying the baseline survival function of the control population sk ambcon by the corresponding survival ratio from table 2 eq 4 4 s01 ambdfb 0 378 s01 ambcon for all subsequent age classes k 2 likewise the age specific survival sk see eq 2 in ambient dfb scenarios were calculated as eq 5 5 sk ambdfb 0 411 sk ambcon the effect of dfb and environment treatments reported for adult females bechmann et al 2017 was assumed to apply also for the juvenile male and transitional stages which had not been tested the modelled exposure to dfb was assigned to spring and or autumn when dfb is most likely to be applied in fish farms therefore only spring and or autumn survival was assumed to be affected by the dfb treatment any additional effects of the dfb treatment on survival in other seasons due to the long half life of this chemical are ignored by the model larvae were assumed to be affected by dfb treatment in spring only since the larval stage lasts only for the months march may the juvenile and adult shrimp could be exposed during both spring and autumn when they feed on organic matter containing dfb at the bottom the resulting survival rates for each treatment are listed in table a2 2 3 1 2 fecundity the reproductive rates were assumed not to be affected by the toxicant exposure because we have currently no relevant information from the experiments or from literature however dfb concentration of 0 075 ug l was reported to reduce reproduction in the mysid shrimp mysidopsis bahia fischer and hall 1992 if fecundity of p borealis would actually be reduced by dfb under the conditions represented by our model then our results will be more conservative in this respect i e predict weaker population level effects than experienced by real populations 2 3 1 3 development in the experiment with larvae bechmann et al 2018 future environment treatment resulted in a quicker development the intermoult period between the larval substages was approximately 9 and 6 days in ambcon and futcon treatments respectively conversely dfb exposure in the experiments resulted in slower development for the surviving larvae especially in the future environment treatments for example at the end of the experiment 19 days post hatching 70 of the larvae in the futcon treatment had reached larval stage iv while 77 of the surviving larvae in the futdfb treatment were still in stage ii fig 3 in bechmann et al 2018 the larvae that had not reached stage iv at this time would most likely not develop further and therefore not survive although these effects on development rates would be relevant for the population dynamics it is not possible to include it in the current model where each stage has a fixed duration this effect might be included later in a more advanced model with variable developmental rates 2 3 2 future environment the effect of future environment higher water temperature and reduced ph on survival in the model was based on the experiments in the same way as the effect of dfb exposure table 2 the experimental environment treatment had a strong negative effect on survival for both larvae and adults for both stages the effect of the environment treatment was weaker than the effect of dfb exposure the combined effect of the two treatments was additive i e there was no significant interaction between the two factors bechmann et al 2017 2018 it is reasonable to assume that the sensitivity of organisms to future environment can vary within a population due to variation in tolerance and processes such as acclimatisation and natural selection moreover it is likely that the effects of future environment will vary during the year the bottom water reaches the highest temperatures during winter and spring wallhead et al 2017 we chose to implement the effect of future environment on survival observed in the experiment for only for two age classes larvae developing into juveniles age class 1 and adults in the transition from male to female age class 9 our reasoning was that individuals that survived this developmental transition in a future environment would be adapted to those environmental conditions and therefore have normal baseline survival in the subsequent stages the survival rates of age classes 1 and 9 of the future environment population see table 1 were based on the effects on survival reported in table 2 and calculated as follows eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 s 01 futcon 0 722 s 01 ambcon 7 s 09 futcon 0 842 s 09 ambcon likewise the survival rates of these age classes in the future environment with dfb treatment were calculated as follows eqs 8 and 9 8 s 01 futdfb 0 089 s 01 ambcon 9 s 09 futdfb 0 284 s 09 ambcon we did not model any effects of future environment on fecundity since we had no information on such effects from the experiments 2 3 3 timing of dfb application the recommended frequency of treatment with flubenzurones is maximum every six months mattilsynet 2016 the application of dfb is most common in spring but can also occur in autumn we wanted to investigate the effects of dfb exposure in spring and autumn both separately and in combination since dfb exposure may affect the developmental stages differently and a population s stage structure vary during the year the timing of dfb exposure was implemented by selecting age specific survival rates from the respective columns in table 1 for example for the scenario ambient environment with dfb application in spring survival parameters were selected from the column ambdfb table 1 for all age classes in spring 1 5 9 13 and 17 and from column ambcon for all other age classes 2 3 4 degree of dfb exposure percentage of the population affected in the experimental dfb treatment populations 100 of the individuals were exposed to dfb in a natural shrimp population in a fjord however the percentage of individuals exposed to dfb is likely to be lower adults and juveniles which feed on the sea bottom may be more exposed to dfb through fish feed and debris than the pelagic larvae in the absence of information on the actual percentage of exposed individuals in a field population we have used the following hypothetical scenarios low medium and degree of exposure affects respectively 5 25 and 50 of the population by reducing these individuals probability of survival to the next age class by the same factor as reported in table 2 3 calculation 3 1 model running the model was run for 400 time steps of 3 months which corresponded to the four seasons spring summer autumn winter starting with spring the first 120 time steps were considered as a burn in period for obtaining a stable population structure after which the application of dfb was implemented the following 80 time steps were considered as a burn in period for the effect of dfb treatment and discarded from further analysis so that only the final 200 time steps were used in the data analyses the model was run for 100 replicate populations which differed due to the demographic stochasticity components in survival the initial abundance was 60 000 individuals per 100 m2 distributed across the respective age classes 1 5 9 13 and 17 in these proportions 96 667 3 0 3 0 03 and 0 003 this corresponds to an initial spring abundance of ca 200 adults per 100 m2 followed by a summer abundance of ca 1200 adults per 100 m2 which is slightly above the carrying capacity of ca 1000 adults per 100 m2 the assumed age class distribution was loosely based on information from age specific catch data shumway et al 1985 table 6 yanez 2000 tables 1 and 2 the youngest age classes are usually missing from catch data instead we assumed a high proportion for the first age class based on the reproductive rates and the final age structure of preliminary model versions 3 2 calculation and analysis of population level endpoints three types of population level endpoints were calculated from the simulated abundances from the end of the burn in period to the end of the simulation period long term abundances for each age class were calculated as the mean abundance over the given period only summer abundances were reported as results figs 3 and 4 table a1 realised demographic rates realised survival rates were calculated from the abundances of each age class divided by the abundance of the previous age class in the previous age step and averaged for the given period realised reproductive rate was calculated as the number of newly hatched larvae n 1 divided by the number of ovigerous females in the previous time step age classes 12 16 and 20 combined table a2 the risk of quasi extinction akçakaya 2000 was calculated as the percentage of replicate populations with long term summer abundance of adults falling below a given threshold abundance within the given period fig 5 the population level endpoints were analysed across three dimensions 1 the timing of the dfb application 2 the proportion of individuals exposed to dfb and 3 future vs ambient environment all statistical analyses were performed in the programming environment r version 3 5 0 r core team 2018 differences in long term abundances between scenarios were analysed by anova firstly the combined effects of dfb exposure and environment change were analysed within each scenario of dfb application season and exposure level table 3 secondly the long term abundance was analysed by one way anova across all scenarios of dfb application and exposure within the ambient and future environment scenarios respectively fig 4 scenarios resulting in significantly different abundance were identified by tukey s significantly honest difference r package multcompview graves et al 2015 3 3 sensitivity analysis for density independent matrix population models sensitivity or elasticity analysis of the population growth rate is commonly performed e g by analysis of eigen values caswell 2009 or by simulated perturbations åberg et al 2009 however density independent elasticities of the intrinsic population growth rate are a poor indicator of the effects of changes in demographic parameters on population size grant and benton 2003 in our study we analysed the sensitivity of the population dynamics to stage specific stressor impacts by perturbing four key demographic parameters and inspecting the effects on long term stage specific abundances figs a1 and 6 the deterministic model version without environmental fluctuation or demographic stochasticity was used for the sensitivity analysis the following parameters were perturbed larval survival s 01 juvenile survival s 05 male survival s 08 female survival s 12 and reproduction f 1 f 2 f 3 each parameter was perturbed by a gradient of 16 values ranging of 35 115 of the reference value column ambcon in table 1 the lower end of the perturbation 35 of the reference value was set to exceed the most severe effect imposed by the experimental dfb exposure under ambient environment table 2 survival in treatment ambdfb relative to survival in ambcon 37 8 for larvae 41 1 for adults 4 results and discussion 4 1 behaviour of the population model the simulated dynamics of the adult stage of one of the populations in the baseline scenario ambient environment no dfb stable environment is illustrated in fig 3 a blue curve the damped oscillations during the initial years 0 20 result from density dependent compensations in combination with discrete time steps four per year the average final adult abundance of all replicate populations in the deterministic model with the baseline scenario was 1024 individuals per 100 m2 table a1 scenario no 28 corresponding to the assumed carrying capacity of approximately 1000 adults with 58 coefficient of variation the variation among the replicate populations was due to the stochastic component of the survival rates which were intended to represent a range in predation and fishing pressures adverse environmental conditions were modelled by reducing the survival of the larvae by 50 when adverse conditions occurred only once fig 3b blue curve the population would recover and obtain approximately the same long term abundance as for the stable environment table a1 scenario 29 the recovery was due to density dependent compensation the cohort that experienced high larval mortality obtained lower density when they became adults and therefore had lower loss of adults due to density dependent mortality predation and fishing the single reduction in larval survival resulted in damped oscillations in abundance lasting for 20 30 years corresponding to the oscillations in the initial years these oscillations are not meant to represent the actual population dynamics and are not expected to influence the analysed population level endpoints when adverse environmental conditions occurred frequently fig 3c blue curve the population was not able to fully recover between each adverse year and the resulting long term abundance was reduced by 12 7 compared to the baseline table a1 scenario 28 to 894 adults per 100 m2 scenario 30 the long term average larval survival was decreased e g from 0 0506 table a2 scenario 28 to 0 0456 scenario 30 however this reduction in larval survival was to some degree compensated by an increase in survival of the subsequent stages e g from 0 143 to 0 155 for males the slightly lower long term abundance in scenarios with fluctuating conditions corresponds to lower carrying capacity due to insufficient food for the larvae in some of the years thus the population dynamics of this model were regulated by both bottom up food limitation and top down processes predation and fishing the temporal variation in abundance coefficient of variation in the baseline scenario with environmental fluctuation scenario 30 was 30 for juveniles 26 for adults and 21 for the total population the long term stage structure not shown was consistent across different scenarios all further results are therefore described for the adult stage only 4 2 predicted effects of dfb on shrimp populations under ambient and future environment the dynamics of the populations subject to dfb treatment stabilised at lower abundances than the baseline population fig 3 blue vs other curves this implies that the loss of individuals due to dfb related mortality was only partly compensated by a reduction in density dependent mortality the effect of dfb treatment on the abundance of adult shrimp depended on the degree of exposure as well as the season of application table 3 the negative effect of dfb treatments on abundance was statistically significant when the exposure level was medium or high i e affecting 25 50 of the population fig 4 the future environment scenario which represent bottom water conditions altered by ocean acidification and warming towards the end of this century also reduced the population abundances figs 3 and 4 lower vs upper panel the long term adult abundance of populations in all the future scenarios table a1 no 31 60 was on average only 52 of the corresponding ambient environment scenarios in combination with dfb treatment however the future environment effect was statistically significant only in scenarios where dfb had the lowest effect i e treatment in autumn only table 3 the future environment treatment had a positive interaction with the dfb treatments table 3 the positive interaction implies the reduction in abundance caused by dfb is lower under future environment than ambient environment e g the slope from the midpoint of the blue box to the yellow box in fig 4 f is less steep than the corresponding slope in fig 4c such a positive interaction mainly reflects the fact that the simulated populations under future environment start at a lower density and therefore cannot obtain as steep reduction slope due to dfb treatment as the ambient environment populations the interaction between these two factors will therefore not be further discussed instead the combined effects of dfb application season and exposure level were inspected in more detail by one way anova within each environment scenario with each group corresponding to one bar in fig 4 the combined effects of dfb application season and exposure level showed the same pattern within both environment scenarios i e the upper and lower panel of fig 4 mostly have the same set of letters above the bars across all scenarios of season the medium and high exposure levels resulted in significantly lower adult abundance than the control and the low exposure level moreover the effect of the high exposure was significantly stronger than the medium exposure except for in fig 4f effects of dfb treatment with low exposure did not differ from the control dfb treatment in spring fig 4b resulted in lower abundance than autumn treatment fig 4a when the exposure was high a likely explanation is that treatment in spring also exposed the larval stage which was more strongly affected by the dfb treatment than adults table 2 the effects of spring treatment with low exposure overlapped with the effects of autumn treatment with medium exposure similarly the effects of spring treatment with medium exposure overlapped with the effects of autumn treatment with high exposure dfb treatment in both seasons fig 4c resulted in lower abundance than dfb treatment in autumn only when the exposure was medium or high however the effects of dfb treatment in both seasons were not significantly different from the treatment in spring only the risk of population decline below a given threshold quasi extinction cf akçakaya 2000 is illustrated in fig 5 the risk curves are extracted from the long term average abundances of all replicate populations cf moe et al 2008 this way the variation in survival among the replicates representing unknown harvest and predation rates is summarised as percentages which can be interpreted as probability for example in the ambient control scenario blue curves the probability that abundance drops from ca 1000 to below 500 adult shrimp per 100 m2 x axis is only 18 considering dfb treatment with medium exposure level under ambient environment arrows in fig 5 there is a 58 probability of decline below 500 adults if dfb is applied in spring only fig 5b and 78 probability if dfb is applied in both seasons fig 5c for the same dfb treatment in future environment conditions the corresponding probabilities of population decline are 89 if dfb is applied in spring fig 5e and 96 if dfb is applied in both seasons fig 5f 4 3 model assessment the purpose of this population model was to investigate the long term population level responses under different scenarios of dfb treatment and environmental conditions since most parameters were unknown we also accounted for variation in environmental conditions and ecological processes larval survival rates were unknown but can be expected to be variable over time this was accounted for by environmental fluctuation adverse conditions with irregular intervals adult survival is likely to be affected by predation and fishing but the extent is unknown and probably variable this was accounted for by among population variation in survival rates eq 3 table a2 our model assumes an intrinsic yearly survival rate of 0 397 for females e g s 13 s 14 s 15 s 16 table 1 for the baseline scenario no 28 the realised survival rate for these age classes are lower in all scenarios 0 118 0 215 table a2 due to the assumed density dependent processes of fishing and predation the realised survival rates are comparable to the estimated yearly survival rates of 0 225 0 350 for spawning females of p borealis in skagerrak and the norwegian deep for the period 1998 2014 these estimates are based on fishing mortality assessments found in table 5 2 3 column f 1 3 years of ices 2016 and include both yearly natural mortality m 0 75 and yearly fishing mortality f 0 483 calculated as exp f m for reproduction reliable and relevant estimates for egg production by individual females eq 1 were available from the authors r k bechmann unpublished and corresponded well with fecundities reported previously e g shumway et al 1985 there are no monitoring data on abundance of shrimp populations in norwegian fjords available for comparison with our model predictions however the temporal variation in abundances predicted by our model with environmental fluctuation coefficient of variation 26 for adults 22 for the whole population corresponds well with the temporal variation in estimated biomass for shrimp in skagerrak and the norwegian deep for the period 1988 2014 ices 2016 table 5 2 3 31 for spawning stock biomass 26 for total biomass this correspondence indicates that a reasonable amount of environmental fluctuation has been assumed for our population model potential effects of dfb on fecundity were not accounted for in our model since it was not tested in the experiment with adult shrimp bechmann et al 2017 in this respect our model can be considered conservative i e it predicts a lower population level risk of dfb than what real populations might experience the developmental rate was reported to increase under future environment but decrease with dfb treatment bechmann et al 2018 neither of these changes was not accounted for in our model with fixed stage structure the larvae that developed more slowly after dfb exposure were likely not able to complete their development at all and therefore contributed to higher mortality than reported by the end of the experiments table 2 this implies that the cumulative including delayed effects of dfb on survival may be higher than those assumed in the population model table 1 faster development of shrimp embryos in warmer water has also been reported by others brillon et al 2005 and might in principle benefit the population growth however changes in the development time may also imply a higher risk of temporal mismatch with the food sources corresponding to more frequent or stronger adverse conditions in our model since climate change is associated with many indirect effects and high uncertainty we did not investigate this possibility further density dependence is normally required in population models to obtain stable abundances in the long run a density independent model was developed for projecting population level effects of toxicants on the shrimp americamysis bahia this model predicted exponential population growth and would become more realistic with density dependence kuhn et al 2001 2000 in other shrimp population models without density dependence parameters have been adjusted to avoid population extinction or explosion labat 1991 raimondo and mckenney 2006 in our model the assumed density dependence in adult survival eq 2 strongly affected the simulated population dynamics and thus the modelled effects of dfb on long term abundance if a natural shrimp population has weaker density dependence than assumed in our model it would have lower capacity of compensation for dfb related mortality this implies that population level effects of dfb would be stronger therefore our model with relatively strong density dependence can be considered conservative also in this respect further development of this model can include scenarios with alternative types and strengths of density dependence following the example of a modelling study of consequences for adult fish stocks of human induced mortality on immatures nisbet et al 1996 it should be noted that complete extinction of a population is prevented by the density dependence in our model even when abundance falls below one individual it would be possible to modify the model to allow for extinction in such cases on the other hand we have not taken into account processes preventing local extinction such as migration among shrimp fields therefore the probability of extinction is not the most relevant population level endpoint for our study the sensitivity analysis illustrates how each of the stage specific abundances responded to a range of perturbation in different demographic rates in the deterministic version of the model figs a1 and 6 the population was most sensitive to the survival of males in transition to females fig 6 c h m this perturbation reduced the recruitment to the first female age group which had the highest density of females and therefore the highest contribution to the total offspring production the population was least sensitive to reduced female survival i e survival of 3 year old females after their first reproduction fig 6d i n the likely explanation is that the older females contributed relatively little to the total abundance of females and therefore also to the total offspring production reduced larval survival strongly reduced the abundance of juveniles and males fig 6a f the subsequent reduction in abundance of females was lower fig 6k since this loss was partly compensated by density dependence in the adult stage corresponding to reduced competition or predation rate reduced reproduction had a very similar effect as reduced larval survival fig 6e j o reduced juvenile survival strongly reduced the abundance of the next stage males fig 6g while the subsequent reduction in abundance of females fig 6h was partly compensated by density dependence the larval stage was more sensitive to dfb than the adult stage in the laboratory experiments table 2 which is in accordance with studies of dfb impacts on other shrimp species wilson and costlow 1987 in contrast the modelled shrimp populations were more sensitive to reduction in adult male survival than to reduction in larval survival the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that a population level risk assessment needs to account for stage specific impacts on the population as well as stage specific sensitivity to the stressor 4 4 implications for ecological risk assessment of dfb to fjord shrimp populations the harmful effects of dfb to survival of both adult and larval shrimp have been clearly demonstrated by recent laboratory experiments bechmann et al 2017 2018 extrapolation of these results to the population level and to the natural environment by population modelling will make these findings more applicable for ecological risk assessment however the many assumptions underlying the population model must be considered when interpreting the predicted risks to shrimp populations our population model may be considered conservative i e predicting weaker effects than in reality in some respects i the density dependence in adult survival provided some capacity for compensation to external mortality factors ii dfb exposure affected only a proportion of the population iii future environmental conditions affected the population for only a part of the year and iv adverse conditions for larval survival may happen more frequently than one out of four years nafo ices 2017 on the other hand the high levels of stochasticity affecting survival of both larvae and adults increased the risk of quasi extinction by chance given these uncertainties the most reasonable use of our results is by focusing on the comparison of effects of the different scenarios rather than on the predicted values of abundances our results demonstrate that the number of dfb treatments per year affect the risk to shrimp populations dfb application in both seasons with high degree of exposure resulted in significantly lower abundance than application in either autumn or spring table 3 fig 4 a stronger population level effect might be expected by dfb application in spring than in autumn the spring treatment affected also larval survival which was more strongly reduced than adult survival table 2 our results indicated a stronger effect of dfb application in spring table 3 when a medium or high proportion of the population was affected fig 4 this finding suggests that shifting the timing of dfb application from spring to autumn might be beneficial for shrimp populations since our results are not conclusive the effects of such a change should be further investigated the degree of dfb exposure to the population i e the proportion of the population experiencing the same effect as in the experiments strongly affected the population level risk of dfb having fish farms in a certain distance from shrimp fields as recommended by mattilsynet 2016 can limit the proportion of the shrimp population exposed for a specific shrimp field local conditions such as bathymetry mud thickness currents and resuspension will be important to predict the exposure to the shrimp populations an investigation of the dispersal of particulate organic matter from salmon farms in central norway broch et al 2017 showed that the distribution of organic matter in the bottom layer was non homogeneous with significant temporal variation and transport and settling of matter up to 0 5 km away from a farm dispersal model simulations indicated that transport as far as 2 km from the fish farms may be significant broch et al 2017 moreover a real fjord population can be exposed to dfb from several fish farms located in the same fjord see fig 1 each of which can apply dfb twice per year shrimp may also move towards fish farms too feed on residual feed and faeces obtaining realistic estimates of dfb exposure for real shrimp will therefore be a challenge the assumed future environment conditions in this study temperature 9 5 c ph 7 6 resulted in significantly lower population abundance than the ambient environment table 3 although the effects on survival observed in experiments were implemented only for limited periods in the model age classes 1 and 9 this level of ocean warming can be expected in bottom waters in south western norway by the end of this century simulated average winter temperature for 2090 2099 9 70 c while the level of acidification can be expected in the following decades simulated average winter ph for 2090 2099 7 69 wallhead et al 2017 it can be argued that shrimp populations will adapt to changed environmental conditions such as warming and ocean acidification in the long term so that long term effects of environmental change should be weaker than observed in lab experiments on the other hand climate change will also have several indirect effects on shrimp populations via ecological interactions for example earlier development of zooplankton durant et al 2007 might result in adverse conditions less food availability for shrimp larvae occurring more often the timing of larval food availability is crucial for the survival of the shrimp recruits nafo ices 2017 moreover higher temperature will cause higher metabolism of the shrimp larvae which will increase their energy requirement arnberg et al 2013 and potentially reduce their growth rate franco et al 2006 either way to give accurate predictions on responses to future climate and environmental change is beyond the scope of our study instead we have demonstrated how individual level effects of a plausible environment scenario in combination with a toxicant stressor can be manifested on the population level according to our model the interaction between the dfb and environmental stressors at the population level was antagonistic table 3 meaning that the combined negative effect of the two stressor types was less than additive the compensatory capacity of the population due to density dependent adult survival is again a likely explanation in real populations individual variation in sensitivity which was not modelled here could also contribute to a less than additive combined effect moe et al 2013 if the most dfb sensitive individuals are also the most sensitive to environmental stress then the individuals surviving the dfb exposure will be more resistant to environmental stress than the population average regardless of the strength and direction of the stressor interaction we can conclude that in a future environment with warmer and more acidic water shrimp populations are likely to be more sensitive to chemical stressors such as dfb our calculation of risk of the adult population decline below given threshold values fig 5 corresponds to ices estimated risk of shrimp spawning stock biomass ssb below reference points such as blim the lowest observed ssb and msy btrigger the 5th percentile of the expected range of variation in ssb when fishing at maximum sustainable yield ices 2016 the overarching principle of ices is that fishing pressure should result in no more than 5 probability of ssb being below blim in our model the calculation of probability of population decline below a threshold was based on the inter population difference in abundance which resulted from the modelled variation in survival rate eq 3 in the current version of the population model the range in survival rate for replicate populations mainly represents our uncertainty if more information becomes available on adult survival rates in real shrimp populations in our study area then this range can be adjusted to better represent real inter population variation for now the risk curves fig 5 can serve as a demonstration of how population model predictions can be applied in risk assessment for shrimp under scenarios of stressor combinations more reliable ecological risk estimates for northern shrimp populations in fjords will require data on abundances as well as more knowledge on ecological factors affecting the population dynamics of these populations shrimp populations in northern norwegian fjords have been monitored since 2017 but the data are not yet available pers comm g søvik imr such data can later be used to assess and adjust our population model further development of this population model would particularly benefit from more information on i effects of environmental fluctuations on larval survival ii effects of predation and fishing on adult abundance and iii the strength of density dependent mechanisms that compensate the losses due to toxicant exposures and other environmental stressors furthermore more realistic scenarios on dfb exposure to shrimp populations in fjords could be obtained from more field data and modelling of the spread and fate of waste from aquaculture sites olsen et al 2012 exposure modelling for another commonly used salmon lice treatment hydrogen peroxide refseth et al 2016 has demonstrated the importance of several environmental factors for the risk of chemical to different non target species a combination of exposure effect and population modelling would more strongly support the risk assessment of such stressors 4 5 conclusions the population model developed for northern shrimp populations in fjords with salmon farms can be used to assess how the risk from exposure to salmon lice medicine diflubenzuron is affected by factors such as the frequency and timing of dfb applications the proportion of the population affected by exposure future environmental conditions ocean warming and acidification and environmental fluctuations in food availability for larvae more reliable estimates of risks to shrimp populations in fjords could be obtained with monitoring data on shrimp population abundances in such fjords and more knowledge on the fate and distribution of dfb in these environments credit authorship contribution statement s jannicke moe

24964,nutrient availability is a major limitation of the production of west african mixed farming systems the fertility of these systems was traditionally sustained by fallowing and nutrient transfers by livestock from savanna to croplands however demographic growth and socio economic constraints require the agro ecological intensification of these systems to understand how agricultural practices and landscape management affect crop production we built a meta ecosystem model of nitrogen stocks and fluxes and we examined different scenarios of fallow management with or without livestock our results suggest that crop production is highly dependent on the source sink dynamics of nitrogen without livestock maximum crop production is obtained for an intermediate duration of fallowing highlighting a trade off between space devoted to production cropland and space devoted to fertility restoration fallow in presence of livestock crop production is maximum for a shorter duration of fallowing it is markedly higher with than without livestock this result highlights the positive roles of livestock and fallows as pumps vectors of nitrogen from savanna rangeland to cropland and from fallow land to cropland respectively however it also highlights the negative relationship between livestock presence and fallowing suggesting that the optimal configuration of livestock and fallow management is highly context dependent overall we argue that the meta ecosystem approach is particularly relevant for the study of agro ecosystems characterized by high spatial heterogeneity this work can be seen as a first step toward an alternative approach integrating tools from theoretical ecology for the study of agro ecosystems which functioning strongly depends on spatial organisation keywords african mixed farming system meta ecosystem model fallow nitrogen livestock crop production 1 introduction in dry to sub humid west africa most farms are traditional mixed systems combining crop and livestock production for a long time west african mixed farming systems wamfs were relatively well adapted to the population needs in the context of subsistence agriculture garrity et al 2012 jalloh et al 2012 sebastian 2014 however wamfs are currently facing important demographic social economic and environmental changes jalloh et al 2013 over the last century the increase in agricultural production has been achieved mainly by cropland expansion this led to a gradual disappearance of fallowing and not cultivated areas a key component of traditional mixed farming systems this degradation of the natural vegetation and landscape particularly pregnant in more semi arid and arid regions tends to expand to more humid climate area the new breadbasket of west africa countries these changes are threatening biomass production and soil fertility mainly through a decrease of carbon and mineral nutrient stocks in soils schlecht et al 2006 unep 2008 in turn this decrease compromises the sustainability of the whole farming system with potentially dramatic social and economic consequences these perspectives have fostered research on fertility management aimed at defining innovative practices that ensure sustainable farming in sub saharan africa rufino et al 2007 increasing exogenous inputs of mineral nutrients and organic matter to soils may seem to be the best response to the decrease of soil fertility however applying fertilizers is often prohibitive and risky for local farmers moreover the use of exogenous fertilizers is increasingly recognized as a non sustainable option mainly because fertilizer production itself is not sustainable in the long run tilman et al 2002 many soils of wamfs are lixisols iuss working group wrb world reference base for soil resouces 2006 these nutrient poor highly erodible soils are subject to the formation of slaking crusts and to important losses of nutrients through leaching smaling et al 1999 therefore crop production in these systems is likely to be particularly sensitive to nutrient loss at the landscape level the soil capacity to prevent nutrient loss also referred to as nutrient retention capacity depends on the efficiency of nutrient recycling which is driven by soil and ecosystem functioning barot et al 2007 boudsocq et al 2009 within the spatial components of the landscape and on nutrient transfers between these components since crop production in wamfs is frequently limited by nutrient availability we argue that a better understanding of the cycling and transfers of nutrients across agricultural landscapes may help determine spatial organizations maximizing crop production the key role of nutrient cycling at both ecosystem aerts and chapin 1999 and meta ecosystem levels loreau et al 2003 for primary production has been highlighted in theoretical ecology for example primary production in a given ecosystem may widely depend on processes that maintain fertility in the other ecosystems connected to it through source sink dynamics loreau et al 2013 as agro ecosystems are mosaics of subsystems forming networks of patches connected by fluxes of nutrients agro ecosystems are meta ecosystems loreau et al 2003 in these landscapes the productivity of crop fields depends on 1 local nutrient cycling within a subsystem 2 transfers of nutrients between the connected subsystems and therefore on 3 nutrient balance within each connected subsystem therefore a better spatial organization of the mosaic of landscape subsystems and a better management of nutrient fluxes between subsystems may help increase crop production and its sustainability we tackle these issues using a modelling approach focusing on wamfs of the guineo sudanian biome le houérou 2009 at the beginning of intensification processes when the surface of savanna is still large enough to provide non limiting rangeland for livestock wamfs are highly spatially structured landscapes with two distinct cultivated subsystems surrounding the dwellings namely the compound ring intensive crop fields and the bush ring extensive crop fields and two non cultivated subsystems namely fallows in the bush ring and savanna fig 1 a fluxes of nutrient between these subsystems and the subsequent connectivity are well documented diarisso et al 2015 manlay et al 2004b prudencio 1993 these fluxes mainly rely on livestock movements crop harvest and on active spreading by farmers of household wastes close to dwellings moreover these factors all vary across the seasons therefore livestock and land use management e g the proportion of non cultivated versus cultivated areas represent the main driving forces to optimize nutrient retention and nutrient transfers between subsystems hence crop production at the landscape scale to assess how livestock and land use management can qualitatively affect the optimization of crop production we developed and analysed a minimal sensu mooij et al 2010 mathematical model of nutrient stocks and fluxes in a wamfs more specifically we examined how three driving forces namely the extent of fallow in space and time the presence absence of livestock and the compound ring bush ring surface ratio affect crop production at the landscape level we used the model to identify the optimal spatial organization for crop production and the mechanisms by which these three driving forces individually or in combination affect crop production 2 model in this section we describe the mathematical model that we built for our study we focus on the well documented case study in guineo sudanian west africa le houérou 2009 the village of sare yero bana in the high casamance region of senegal n 12 81917 w 14 89024 manlay et al 2002 all the parameters used in the

cycle and the multi year duration of the cropland fallow rotation cycle 2 1 1 spatial structure as for many agro ecosystems of west africa the landscape at sare yero bana is structured in subsystems that are spatially organized in concentric rings around the dwellings manlay et al 2004b the compound ring fig 1a is the closest to the dwellings and is permanently cropped with staple crops such as cereals pearl millet pennisetum glaucum l maize zea mays l sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench the compound ring benefits from organo mineral inputs as household wastes and livestock manure surrounding the compound ring is the bush ring which is managed more extensively and alternates cropping for cash e g groundnut arachis hypogea a legume manlay et al 2002 and fallow which consists in a succession of plants dominated by combretaceae and including nitrogen fixing species manlay et al 2002 the compound and bush rings are surrounded by permanently uncultivated savanna and used as rangeland for livestock there is thus an intensification of cropping practices from the savanna to the dwellings since we focus on crop production the nutrient dynamics is explicitly represented in the bush and compound rings only in the model the compound and the bush rings are considered as subsystems which areas are denoted by α c and α b respectively the dwellings and the savanna are simply considered as nutrient sources or sinks we define sources and sinks accordingly to loreau et al 2013 where a source respectively a sink subsystem is an exporter respectively an importer of nutrient within the whole agro ecosystem the savanna is assumed to be a non limiting source of nutrient section 4 4 discusses this assumption the compound and bush subsystems are connected to each other and to the other spatial entities by different fluxes that gives the model of the agro ecosystem the form of a meta ecosystem model 2 1 2 annual cycle agricultural practices change over the seasons over one year a short wet season 4 5 months corresponding to the growing period for plants alternates with a long dry season 7 8 months the wet season is characterized by erratic rains amounting annually to circa 1100 mm ardoin bardin 2004 in our model a year starts at the beginning of the wet season in the sequel t denotes the number of days in a year τ the number of days in a wet season and n represents the number of years considered since year 0 the wet season of year n starts at day nt 1 with sowing and ends at day n t τ with the harvest which initiates the transition between the two seasons the dry season lasts from day n t τ to day n 1 t 2 1 3 crop fallow cycle the crop fallow rotation is an agricultural practice that runs at the time scale of several years it affects the spatial and temporal organizations of the agro ecosystem and generates a particular set of nutrient fluxes the rotation is defined as the succession of one cropping period followed by one fallow period if l denotes the duration in years of the rotation and l c the duration of the cropland period then l f l l c is the duration of the fallow period the bush subsystem includes multiple crop fields and fallow lands to account for this heterogeneity and to ensure that the cultivated part of the bush ring is constant over time the bush subsystem is split into l subunits of the same area that will alternatively be in a state of cropland or fallow at each instant among the l subunits l c and l f subunits are in states of cropland and fallow respectively with this mathematical trick l respectively l c and l f represents both the duration in years of a rotation respectively a cropping period and a fallow period and the total number of subunits respectively the number of subunits that are in a state of cropland and the number of subunits that are in a state of fallow thus the proportions of cropland l c l and fallow l f l are considered constant over a simulation for instance a rotation duration of l 20 years and a cropland period duration of l c 15 years implies a fallow period duration of l f 5 years in that case the bush subsystem is split into 20 subunits with at any time during the rotation 15 subunits in a state of cropland and 5 in a state of fallow the proportion of subunits in a state of cropland is constant and equal to 15 20 2 2 compound and bush subsystems the same generic model is used to represent the compound and bush subsystems fig 1b this model focuses on the cycle of nitrogen n which is usually considered as the main limiting nutrient for crop production in guineo sudanian west africa pieri 1992 rufino et al 2006 smaling et al 1999 though some processes that are specific to n such as the biological n fixation are taken into account in the model adapting the model to phosphorus which is the other main nutrient limiting primary productivity in these agro ecosystems brouwer and powell 1998 would be easy the subsystem model considered is a n stocks and fluxes model composed of several interconnected n compartments fluxes of n between compartments within the subsystem and between the different subsystems depend on the subsystem and on the season table 1 the different compartments and fluxes of one subsystem are presented in the following paragraphs n stocks and fluxes are expressed respectively in kgn per hectare kgn ha 1 and in kgn per hectare of the subsystem they belong to and per day kgn ha 1 day 1 2 2 1 nitrogen compartments each subsystem is composed of three compartments the plant p the soil organic fraction o and the soil inorganic fraction i to which a fourth compartment the dead roots of woody plants r is added in the case of the bush ring fig 1b the p compartment represents the quantity of nitrogen contained in the plant both the aboveground and underground parts per surface unit kgn ha 1 each subsystem is assumed to contain one type of plant in fallow possible changes in digestibility and palatability of plants over time are not considered for simplicity we assume that in the compound subsystem and the cropland subunits of the bush subsystem the plant compartment p contains live crop biomass during the wet season and crop residues straw litter dead roots during the dry season the o and i compartments represent the quantities of nitrogen under organic and inorganic forms contained in the first 30 cm of soil per surface unit kgn ha 1 respectively the r compartment represents the quantity of nitrogen contained in the belowground part of the woodyplants growing in the bush subsystem during fallow periods for a subunit j with 1 j l of the bush subsystem the compartments p o i and r are denoted p j o j i j and r j respectively and are expressed in kgn per hectare of the subunit j kgn ha of bush subunit j 1 within the bush subsystem the mean biomass of fallow plants in kgn per hectare of fallow is denoted p bf and the mean biomass of crop plants in kgn per hectare of bush crop p bc see equations 10 and 11 in appendix 1 for details within the compound subsystem the compartments p o and i are simply denoted p c o c and i c they are expressed in kgn per hectare of compound ring kgn ha of compound 1 2 2 2 intra subsystem fluxes the model includes five intra subsystem fluxes fig 1b that connect the different nitrogen compartments to each other the growth of the plant compartment p through the uptake of inorganic nitrogen coming from i growth function g and the biological fixation of atmospheric n in the case of legumes growth function f during the wet season the decay of the plant compartment p into soil organic matter o at rate c during the dry season this process is considered negligible during the wet season the transfer of nitrogen located in roots from the plant compartment p only for woody plants to the dead root compartment r parameter δ which only occurs in the bush subsystem during the shift from fallow to cropland after clearing cf 2 3 3 we indeed assume that roots die only when the fallow is cleared at the end of the fallow the decay of the dead root compartment r which decomposes into soil organic matter o at rate r which only occurs in the bush subsystem since r compartment is specific to it and the mineralization of organic matter o into inorganic nitrogen i at rate m intra subsystem fluxes are all linear and proportional to the amount stored in the compartment they originate from except for plant growth function g 1 g is a modified logistic function with a carrying capacity k and a growth rate u proportional to the stock of inorganic nitrogen i 1 g p i u i k p k p in the fallow subsystem the carrying capacity is the plant biomass at equilibrium in absence of herbivore may and mclean 2007 in cultivated subsystems the carrying capacity represents the maximum stand biomass at the end of the wet season in addition to the assimilation of soil inorganic nitrogen i through the plant growth function g 1 atmospheric n is assimilated by legumes through symbiotic fixation groundnut in cropland subunits of the bush subsystem and by wild species as piliostigma indigofera spp in fallow subunits we assume that the function f 2 describing the atmospheric n fixation is logistic with a carrying capacity similar to that of g and with a biological fixation rate i p 2 f p i p k p k p to account for the variations of fertility in cultivated subunits of the bush subsystem the carrying capacity k is reset every year in each cultivated subunit j of the bush subsystem the carrying capacity k j 3 is assumed proportional to the value of the compartment i at the beginning of the wet season 3 k j min ω i j nt k max ω being a constant parameter and k max the maximum carrying capacity in absence of limitation by soil inorganic nitrogen in the fallow subunit j of the bush subsystem k j k bf 2 2 3 inputs and outputs of nitrogen from and to the outside in addition to the intra subsystem fluxes there are also some inputs and outputs of nitrogen entering or exiting the agro ecosystem we have represented the inputs of nitrogen through dry and wet atmospheric depositions of mineral parameter i n and organic parameter i o nitrogen sowing is considered as an additional punctual input of nitrogen that occurs at the beginning of the wet season at this instant the stock in the p compartment of the compound and bush subsystems is initialized at a value σ in kgn ha 1 except for the fallow subunits of the bush ring that were already fallow the year before σ is the quantity of nitrogen contained in seeds sown per hectare when shifting from cropland to fallow the nitrogen stock in the seed bank from which fallow vegetation develops is spontaneously present in the environment losses of nitrogen from the compartments o and i passively occur through erosion leaching volatilization and denitrification in the model the parameters e o and e n account for the overall loss rates of organic and mineral nitrogen respectively 2 3 inter subsystems fluxes the compound and bush subsystems are finally connected to each other through inter subsystems fluxes two types of nitrogen fluxes connect the subsystems namely the spreading of household wastes from dwellings and the excretion of nitrogen by livestock household wastes are spread in the compound subsystem they mainly originate from crops harvested in both the compound and the bush subsystem and therefore generate an indirect flux of nitrogen from the bush to the compound subsystem livestock generates fluxes of nitrogen between subsystems and between the savanna and the subsystems by ingesting nitrogen through grazing during the day and by excreting nitrogen during day and during night corralling through urine and faeces each of these fluxes is detailed in the following paragraphs 2 3 1 harvest and recycling fluxes crops from the compound subsystem fulfil most staple food needs of villagers the rest coming from a small part of crops produced by the bush subsystem vigan 2013 the rest of the crops produced by the bush subsystem is exported outside the village therefore there is no exportation of nitrogen through the crop produced in the compound subsystem whereas most of the nitrogen of the crop produced in the bush subsystem is exported from the agro ecosystem the parameter γ represents the share of harvested plant and the parameter ϵ represents the share of harvested cash crop that is exported from the agro ecosystem the quantity of crop v n brought to the dwellings after the harvest for a year n is therefore 4 v n α c γ c p c n t τ from compound subsystem l c l α b γ b c 1 ϵ p b c n t τ from bush subsystem cropland subunits where nt τ is the time just before nt τ at the end of the wet season before the harvest a share λ v of v n is recycled in the agro ecosystem and spread during the year in the compound subsystem as organic amendment we assume that the spreading is constant over the year and that the entire quantity v n for year n is consumed within the following year thus the daily quantity of nitrogen spread in the compound subsystem from day nt τ 1 to day n 1 t τ is given by λ v v n t 2 3 2 livestock driven fluxes we assume that livestock grazing follows a monod function characterized by the half saturation constant for feed ingestion κ κ in kgn ha 1 and a maximal grazing rate g max in day 1 a herd of κ tlu tlu stands for tropical livestock unit corresponding to an average animal of 250 kg of live weight that graze on a field containing p kgn ha 1 of palatable plant will ingest g max p κ κ p κ ψ kgn per day where ψ is the quantity of nitrogen in kgn per tlu that we assume constant the quantity of nitrogen ingested by livestock per day in each subsystem will finally depend on the season the subsystem the area of the subsystem the available plant biomass the palatability coefficient of the plants the time spent in the subsystem the half saturation monod constant κ κ for feed ingestion and the maximal grazing rate g max during the wet season the livestock is kept away from crops graze in fallows and in the savanna and is corralled at night in fallows the quantity of nitrogen ingested by the livestock per day in the fallow is therefore given by ζ wet g max b bf p bf κ κ b bf p bf κ ψ in kgn day 1 where ζ wet is the percentage of time spend by the livestock in fallows the other part of the day being spent in savanna or corresponding to the night and b bf is the palatability coefficient of the fallow plants in this quantity the part coming from the fallow subunit j of the bush ring is given by 5 ϕ wet j ζ wet g max b bf 1 l f p j κ κ b bf p bf κ ψ kgn day 1 during the dry season the livestock grazes all over the landscape and is corralled in the compound subsystem at night the concentration of nitrogen contained in the palatable plants in the bush and compound rings that we denote p tot is given by 6 p tot l f l α b b bf p bf l c l α b b bc p bc α c b c p c α b α c kgn h a o f b u s h c o m p o u n d 1 where b bc and b bf are the palatability coefficients of the plants in the cropland part of the bush ring and in the compound ring respectively the quantity of nitrogen ingested by the livestock per day in the bush and compound rings is therefore given by ζ dry g max p tot κ κ p tot κ ψ in kgn day 1 where ζ dry is the percentage of time spend by the livestock on the bush and compound rings the other part being spend in savanna or corresponding to the night in this quantity the part coming from the compound subsystem is 7 ϕ dry c ζ dry g max α c b c p c α b α c κ κ p tot κ ψ kgn day 1 and the part coming from the subunit j cropland or fallow of the bush subsystem is 8 ϕ dry j ζ dry g max 1 l α b b j p j α b α c κ κ p tot κ ψ kgn day 1 with b j b bc for a cropland subunit j of the bush subsystem and b j b bf for a fallow subunit j of the bush subsystem we assume that feed requirements of livestock is always met and remain constant over time hence a fixed per capita quantity ρ of nitrogen has to be ingested daily in kgn tlu 1 day 1 which amounts to a total quantity κρ in kgn day 1 the savanna is a feed reservoir exploited only when cultivated areas cannot fulfil livestock requirements in this case the complement of feed provided by the savanna is given by κ ρ j 1 l 1 θ j ϕ wet j in kgn day 1 during the wet season and by κ ρ ϕ dry c j 1 l ϕ dry j in kgn day 1 during the dry season where θ j 1 when the subunit j is under cropping and θ j 0 when the subunit j is under fallowing the presence of livestock in the agro ecosystem induces additional losses due to metabolic constraints a percentage λ κ of the feed ingested is excreted the rest being used for growth and reproduction we assume that livestock biomass is kept constant and that n allocated to growth and reproduction is exported outside the agro ecosystem for instance through the sale of meat a proportion ν of the excreted nitrogen returns to the soil as urine compartment i the remaining part 1 ν returns to the soil as organic nitrogen compartment o through the deposition of faeces overall livestock transfers nitrogen from savanna to the bush subsystem during the wet season and to the compound subsystem during the dry season animals feed exclusively during the day but excrete almost equally during day and night manlay et al 2004c thus night corralling generates a net transfer from feeding grounds to the corral the parameter h represents the proportion of excretion that occurs during the day when livestock is grazing and 1 h is the proportion of excretion that occurs during the night when livestock is corralled consequently the quantity of nitrogen excreted during one day in a subsystem or subunit j of a subsystem only depends on the quantity ϕ of nitrogen ingested during this day in this subsystem or subunit j of a subsystem it equals hλ κ ϕ in kgn day 1 during the night the quantity of nitrogen excreted in the corral fallow during the wet season and compound during the dry season is constant and equals 1 h λ κ κρ in kgn day 1 see fig 2 for a schematic representation of livestock induced nitrogen fluxes 2 3 3 fallow cropland shifts fallow cropland shifts occur at the beginning of the wet season at time nt these shifts do not lead to spatial transfers of nutrients but they change the distribution of nitrogen among the compartments of the bush subsystem when shifting from fallow to cropland the compartment r of the concerned bush subunit is updated at the beginning of the wet season to account for the transfer of the roots of senescent fallow biomass to soil organic matter plant stems are cleared and exported outside the agro ecosystem before the sowing and the woody part of the roots percentage δ of fallow biomass is transferred to the dead roots compartment r 9 r j nt r j nt δ p j nt where nt is the time just before nt at the end of the dry season before the sowing and the fallow clearing we assume that r decays exponentially manlay et al 2004c at rate r and fuels the soil organic matter compartment o during the years following the shift according to manlay et al 2004c more than 95 of dead woody roots are degraded after two years 2 4 validation of the model the comparison to sare yero bana data is described in appendix 4 the effect of each parameter of the model on the bush the compound and the total crop productions was examined through a sensivity analysis described in appendix 5 3 simulations crop production depends on available nitrogen according to the meta ecosystem theory gravel et al 2010 loreau et al 2003 crop production should depend on net inputs of nitrogen into the agro ecosystem and on how these inputs are transferred to the subsystems that produce crop thus to identify strategies optimizing crop production we first need to understand what governs the intensity of the nitrogen inputs into the agro ecosystem and then how these fluxes to cropland subunits and to the compound subsystem are implemented 3 1 the fallow pump and the livestock pump as the two main sources of nitrogen two ecological pumps resulting from source sink dynamics within the agro ecosystem should have a major influence on the input of nitrogen to the agro ecosystem namely the fallow pump and the livestock pump fig 3 these terminologies are used by reference to the whale pump that brings nutrients from deep to shallower waters in the oceans roman and mccarthy 2010 fallow land is a source of nitrogen for the bush subsystem because it hosts n2 fixing legumes in addition fallow efficiently retains soil inorganic nitrogen because leaching is lower than in other subsystems due to a higher soil cover by plant biomass pieri 1992 serpantié and ouattara 2001 therefore fallow subunits accumulate nitrogen which is then transferred to cropland subunits when fallow subunits are cleared and cultivated this net input of nitrogen to the agro ecosystem is referred to as the fallow pump on the other hand livestock transfers nitrogen from grazed savanna to the bush and compound subsystems where it is corralled overnight this overall input of nitrogen to the agro ecosystem is referred to as the livestock pump fallow and livestock management drive how these two pumps influence the overall input conservation of nitrogen in the agro ecosystem fig 3 in addition within the agro ecosystem livestock management influences how nitrogen is transferred to subsystems producing crop indeed through grazing and night corralling animals generate source sink dynamics between fallow subunits and crop fields subunits within the bush subsystem and between the bush subsystem and the compound subsystem these source sink dynamics vary across seasons we first studied the system in absence of livestock to understand how to optimize crop production with the fallow pump alone then we studied the system in presence of livestock to understand the effect of the livestock pump the effect of the source sink dynamics due to livestock and the interaction between the fallow and the livestock pumps 3 2 test of the effect of the pumps we performed two distinct studies for all the simulations we assumed that the total area of the agro ecosystem was constant and equal to 200 ha which is roughly the size of the agro ecosystem of sare yero bana this surface does not include the surrounding savanna which is assumed to be infinite we performed simulations with and without κ 0 tlu livestock simulations with livestock were run with κ 410 tlu which is consistent with the herbivory pressure observed in sare yero bana vigan 2013 the first study we performed focuses on the impact of the fallow extent on the biomass of crop harvested at the end of the wet season in the bush and the compound subsystems more precisely we tried to assess the consequences of 1 an increase in the duration of rotation l 10 20 50 and 100 years and of 2 an increase in the cropland ratio 0 l c l 1 for this first study we assumed a constant ratio α c α b of 1 3 50 ha of compound and 150 ha of bush as observed recently in sare yero bana by vigan 2013 in a second study we examined how the fraction of the agro ecosystem occupied by the compound subsystem α c α c α b hereafter named the compound ratio influences the biomass of crop harvested at the end of the wet season in the bush and the compound subsystems fallow extent being fixed there is no variation in spatial organization and practices within one simulation simulations were performed with r r core team 2016 by using the runge kutta method of the r package desolve soetaert et al 2010 that enables to numerically integrate systems of ordinary differential equations each simulation one simulation per set of parameters tested was performed over 300 years which was enough to reach the periodic equilibrium of the system the r package containing all the necessary functions to simulate the model is available on github https github com annebisson ewocr 2 git 4 results and discussion 4 1 managing the fallow pump to maximize crop production the effect of cropland ratio and rotation duration fig 4 a depicts the impact of the cropland ratio l c l and the rotation duration l the colour of the line varies from light to dark as the rotation duration l increases on crop production in the bush subsystem i e the sum of crop production in all the cropland subunits of the bush subsystem in absence of livestock both affect the fallow pump and its effect on crop production in the bush subsystem with consequences for crop production in the compound subsystem regardless of the rotation duration when the cropland ratio increases from 0 to 1 crop production in the bush subsystem increases from 0 to a maximum π max then decreases and finally slightly re increases when the cropland ratio reaches 1 the humpback shape of the curves is consistent with previous results obtained with a simpler mathematical model by robertson 1994 and mobbs and cannell 1995 in their study of a generic sorghum bicolor acacia senegal agro system in our model as in the model of the latter this humpback curve results from a trade off between the increase in crop production due to the increase in the cultivated area and the decrease of the restoration of soil fertility by fallow indeed as the cropland ratio increases the cultivated area increases entailing an increase in crop production however the decrease of fallow leads to a loss of fertility that translates into lower yields which finally leads to a decrease of crop production at the subsystem level in our model the cropland ratio that leads to π max varies with the rotation duration with the overall maximal production 3233 kgn yr 1 reached for a rotation duration of 50 years and a cropland ratio of 0 67 the observation of a crop production without fallow higher than with few years of fallow suggests that short fallow time does not restore soil fertility enough in terms of nitrogen stock to compensate for the cropping area reduction it demands this trend is consistent with other studies aweto 1981 brand and pfund 1998 roder et al 1997 it is even an assumption in some fallow models aweto 2012 in the first years of fallow soil fertility decline is usually thought to result from an inadequate vegetation cover during the early succession of natural vegetation recovery but the model suggests an alternative explanation in simulations the inflection results from slow restoration of the soil organic nitrogen stock during the very first years of fallowing and to a much lower growth rate of fallow than cropped plants 0 005 and 0 01 ha kgn 1 y 1 respectively as a result the net balance of nitrogen after a short fallow time is negative the impact of the fallow pump is thus negative according to our simulations the number of years of fallow 4 years beyond which fallow has a positive impact on productivity is independent of the rotation duration fig 4a on the other hand if the fallow period is long enough dead roots r and soil organic matter o accumulations reach a maximum once this maximum is reached from a biogeochemical point of view it is no more profitable to maintain fallowing the comparison between curves of fig 4a shows that the cropland ratio leading to the maximal crop production π max increases with the rotation duration among the different rotation duration scenarios the highest crop production is reached for an intermediate rotation duration π max 50 this is because crop production is driven by the combination of two mechanisms first for short rotation durations fallow duration is too short to restore soil fertility second for long rotation durations large accretion in soil organic and mineral nitrogen during prolonged fallowing does not balance declining yields at the end of longer cropping periods for a given cropland ratio indeed a longer rotation duration translates into longer cropping duration and not just longer fallow duration fig 4b c shows that the increase in crop production in the compound subsystem and in the agro ecosystem as the whole is correlated to the increase in crop production in the bush subsystem indeed the redistribution of fertilizing household wastes to the compound subsystem generates a source sink dynamics from the bush to the compound subsystem because part of these wastes comes from crop production in the bush subsystem as a consequence of this simple source sink dynamics the trends observed in the compound subsystem fig 4b and in the whole agro ecosystem fig 4c are similar to the trends observed in the bush subsystem fig 4a fig 5 represents the balance of n fluxes in kgn ha 1 y 1 of the compound subsystem and the bush subsystem crops and fallow over the last year of a 300 years simulation without 0 tlu and with 410 tlu livestock for three cases of the simulations represented in fig 4 corresponding to a cropland ratio l c l 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 respectively without livestock biological fixation represents the main source of nitrogen for the agro ecosystem looking at the three detailed cases n fixation decreases in cropland subunits as the cropland ratio increases on the other hand n fixation in fallows is maximal for an intermediate value of cropland ratio l c l 0 5 4 2 managing the livestock pump to maximize crop production fig 4d f depicts the impact of increasing the cropland ratio l c l and the rotation duration l on crop production in the bush subsystem in the compound subsystem and in the whole agro ecosystem respectively in the presence of livestock the activation of the livestock pump strongly modifies the functioning of the agro ecosystem strikingly crop production of the whole agro ecosystem increases sharply fig 4f mainly driven by the increase in crop production in the compound subsystem fig 4e this gain of production highlights the livestock pump as the main importer of nitrogen to the agro ecosystem through a source sink dynamics from the savanna to the compound ring in addition within the agro ecosystem livestock generates source sink dynamics between the subunits of the bush subsystem and between the bush and the compound subsystems these dynamics strongly affect the way the gain in nitrogen from the livestock pump is transferred to crop production in the compound subsystem during the wet season livestock mainly grazes in the savanna and is corralled at night in the fallow subunits where it does not graze and where it excretes some of the nitrogen ingested during the day hence the livestock pump fuels the fallow subunits only the gain of nitrogen adds up to the fallow pump and is transferred to the cropland subunits and crop production when fallow subunits are cleared and cultivated during the dry season the situation drastically changes livestock grazes both in the savanna and in the agro ecosystem and is corralled at night in the compound subsystem where it excretes nitrogen hence the livestock pump fuels the compound subsystem the variation of range in n balance fig 5 in the compound ring shows how the inputs of n by livestock leads to significant losses of n the livestock pump has a positive effect on crop production in the compound subsystem fig 4e however it may or may not have a positive effect on crop production in the bush subsystem depending on the management of the fallow pump fig 4d in the case of short rotation durations 20 years see appendix 4 the livestock pump has a positive effect on the stock of nitrogen in the fallow subunits regardless of the cropland ratio l c l through fallow to cropland conversion this fertility is transferred to the cropland subunits and increases crop production in the bush subsystem on the other hand for longer rotation durations the livestock pump has a positive effect on crop production of bush subsystem only for high cropland ratios e g l c l 0 8 for l 100 years as depicted in fig 4 the reason is that for lower cropland ratios the quantity of feed provided by fallow covers a large part of the requirement of livestock during the dry season therefore livestock mostly grazes in the bush subsystem and transfers the ingested nitrogen to the compound subsystem during night corralling this mechanism has two main effects 1 it weakens the livestock pump since there is less transfer from savanna to the agro ecosystem during the dry season and 2 it increases the source sink dynamics from the bush to the compound subsystem as a result crop production in the bush subsystem is lower in the presence than in the absence of livestock with livestock the maximum crop production is always reached for l c l 1 which corresponds to the shortest possible fallow ratio fallows must at least exist in its minimum form to allow livestock corralling and the functioning of the livestock pump as a result the negative effect of too short fallow without livestock is no longer observed because in addition to the weak effect of restoring fertility livestock corralling in fallows during the wet season concentrates nutrient in fallows finally fallows tend to annihilate the livestock pump since the agro ecosystem is less dependent on nutrients from the savanna 4 3 managing spatial organization to maximize crop production the connectivity introduced by livestock between the bush and the compound subsystems leads to an interdependency of these two compartments of the landscape given this interdependency crop production of the whole agro ecosystem is expected to depend on the fraction of the whole agro ecosystem occupied by the compound subsystem referred to hereafter as the compound ratio the influence of the compound ratio on crop yield in kgn ha 1 and total crop production in kgn in each subsystem and at the whole agro ecosystem level is examined fig 6 in presence of livestock we assumed a rotation duration of 20 years and a cropland ratio of 0 25 that is 5 years of cropland followed by 15 years of fallow this scenario is similar to the situation in sare yero bana manlay et al 2004b a for this scenario both the yield and the total production follow a humpback curve when the compound ratio increases the optimal total production is obtained for a compound ratio of 0 3 whereas the optimal yield is obtained for a compound ratio of 0 25 this mismatch results from the fact that sub optimality of the yield when the ratio increases is overbalanced by the increase in total cropland area which increases the production at the agro ecosystem level in fact increasing the compound ratio has both a positive and negative effect on the total production the positive effect arises from the increase in the area devoted to crop production the negative impact results from the dilution of the source sink effect when the compound ratio increases the source the bush subsystem decreases and the sink the cropland subsystem increases in size therefore the flux of nitrogen imported by livestock from bush to cropland decreases and is diluted over an increasing area of cropland 4 4 the hidden gain from savanna in the model a fraction of the nitrogen ingested by livestock exits the agro ecosystem through meat exportation over a year livestock intakes 14 9 tn the quantity of nitrogen ingested by 410 tlu that is ρκt and excretes 11 9 tn trough urine and faeces λ κ ρκt a fraction of the consumed nitrogen comes from the fallow subunits of the bush subsystem where livestock grazes during the dry season the rest coming from the savanna the proportion of time spent feeding in the fallow versus the savanna determines the respective contribution of these two sources our model assumes that livestock always fulfils its nitrogen requirement it first consumes what is available in the agro ecosystem then satisfies its nitrogen requirements with nitrogen from the savanna thus if the cropland ratio increases within the bush subsystem and or if the compound ratio increases the area of land occupied by fallow decreases entailing a higher contribution of savanna as a source of nitrogen assuming a herd of 410 tlu for a cropland ratio of 0 25 and a rotation duration of 20 years the savanna provides 50 of the nitrogen ingested by livestock 7045 kgn that represents about 1300 ha of savanna considering numbers given by powell et al 1996 for sahelian areas or by abbadie et al 2006 for lamto savanna with the same rotation duration and a cropland ratio of 0 75 the savanna represents more than 70 of the nitrogen ingested by livestock becoming the main source of nitrogen for the agro ecosystem this dependency on savanna raises the question of the sustainability of crop production in the agro ecosystems of west africa where agriculture is encroaching on savanna in this context savanna area may become a limiting resource constraining the size of livestock herds and thus the net input of nitrogen to the agro ecosystem vayssières et al 2015 in addition to this decrease of the livestock pump the agriculture evolution in a demographic growth context generally comes together with a shortening of the rotation duration and an increase in the cropland ratio which reduces the n source provided by legumes in fallows and thus decreases the fallow pump the reduction of n source could be offset by an increase of legume cereal crop rotation or intercropping as it is the case in the groundnut basin there is an other limit according to liebig s law the availability of p which can only be increased by the application of mineral fertilizers or by the possible but not yet certain increase of p by the deep root systems of the trees need for agroforestry some farmers facing such a reduction of accessible savanna manage to maintain large herds of livestock by feeding animals with exogenous supplementation audouin et al 2015 doing so they maintain the livestock pump but they replace economical and ecological costless nitrogen provided by savanna by economical and ecological costly nitrogen to take into account this cost our modelling work calls for an explicit representation of the savanna as a finite source of nitrogen and an explicit representation of the dynamics of nitrogen in livestock such improvement would allow 1 assessing whether the nutrient provisioning by savanna is sustainable or not 2 measuring the livestock production and its possible limitations due to nutrient availability and 3 exploring the potential of other sources of nitrogen such as mineral fertilizers to improve the agro ecosystem production unlike for traditional agro ecosystems where savanna is not limiting we hypothesize that in agro ecosystems with increasingly limited land in the future jayne et al 2014 new tensions and new trade offs occur between crop production in the bush versus compound subsystems and between meat and crop productions such situations are likely to occur more often as local human population densities increase with a subsequent increasing need for croplands 5 conclusion crop production in wamfs depends on complex dynamics of nitrogen through the different compartments of the agricultural landscape despite this complexity our model with its meta ecosystem approach shows that the optimization of crop production relies mainly on a good management of the fallow pump and the livestock pump that represent the main inputs of nitrogen into the agro ecosystem management must take into account the interaction between these two ecological pumps to optimize the global input of nitrogen as well as the role of the livestock as a driving force to optimize the transfer of this nitrogen flux to the agro ecosystem s subsystems that produce crop more precisely our results suggest that the livestock pump represents a higher input of nitrogen to the agro ecosystem than the fallow pump and that the fallow pump tends to interact negatively with the livestock pump thus crop production is optimal when agricultural practices and spatial organizations are such that the agro ecosystem contains livestock and has a relatively low area devoted to fallow in addition our results stress the fact that livestock reinforces the source sink dynamics between the bush and compound subsystems that is between the extensive and intensive part of the agro ecosystem this source sink dynamics is required to transfer the benefit of the fallow pump to the productive compound subsystem a corollary to these results is that crop production by wamfs is highly dependent on the livestock pump and therefore on the savanna as an external source of nitrogen the optimal practices suggested by our model hold as long as savanna extension is enough not to be a limiting source of nitrogen to livestock this assumption was likely relevant in traditional wamfs but it should be reconsidered in the context of agriculture extensification where cropland is encroaching on savanna in this new context our model could be regarded as a null model this null model could serve as a corner stone to help understand how fertility transfers will evolve according to new management strategies and spatial organization and to help propose new management practices that will ease the transition towards a more sustainable agriculture acknowledgements the authors are

fluxes in kgn ha 1 y 1 at the scale of the compound subsystem and the bush subsystem crops and fallow over the last year of a 300 years simulation without and with livestock for a duration of a rotation of 20 years the model is designed to be simple enough to provide a mechanistic understanding of the way agricultural practices influence crop production therefore it is set up to be qualitatively rather than quantitatively predictive yet the comparison of the main outputs to data from sare yero bana shows a rather good fit case 1 of table 5 presented in appendix 4 more precisely n fluxes related to livestock and harvest are close to field data from manlay et al 2004a b in both the cropland subunits of the bush subsystem and the compound subsystem on the other hand n fluxes related to livestock in the fallow subunits of the bush subsystem are of the same order of magnitude but they are largely higher this overestimation may be mainly due to simplifying assumptions regarding livestock dynamics and grazing behaviour for instance all the plants present in the fallows were assumed palatable in reality fallows contain unpalatable species ickowicz and mbaye 2001 in particular in late successional states while a share of palatable biomass is left due to tainting by urine and trampling during browsing manlay et al 2004c overestimating the livestock induced fluxes in fallow tends to reduce livestock induced fluxes from savanna which may explain the underestimation of crop production in the compound subsystem the abundance of legumes in fallows is poorly documented some acacia spp and annual legumes are present but there is no precise estimate of the amounts of n they fix however the order of magnitude for biological n fixation fluxes 50 4 kgn ha 1 yr 1 in our model is consistent with cleveland et al 1999 who gave the range of value 16 44 kgn ha 1 yr 1 for tropical savannas a 5 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis was performed using the morris method that is implemented in the package sensitivity pujol et al 2017 the analysis of the morris graph makes it possible to distinguish the parameters whose effects are negligible points close to the origin 0 0 the parameters whose linear effect is important points located to the right of the abscissa axis the parameters whose effects are non linear or include interaction with other factors points located at the top of the y axis from faivre et al 2013 the effect of each parameter of the model on the bush the compound and the total crop productions was examined this sensitivity analysis fig 7 shows that factors such as the surface of the bush subsystem α b and the size of livestock κ are among the most influential factors some other parameters such as the harvest percentages γ and the plant parameter related to the level of atmospheric n biological fixation in crop subunits of the bush subsystem ω are influential too but to a lesser extent this result is not surprising since these parameters are directly linked to the inputs outputs balance of the system the importance of the parameter h which represents the percentage of n excreted by livestock during the day manlay et al 2004b suggests that livestock management is a key driver in the system it calls for the consideration of other types of livestock management in future studies performed with our model for instance in barn livestock systems based on feed imports from outside the ecosystem are practiced when landscape is dominated by crops and when rangelands surfaces are insufficient to feed large livestock herds imported feeds represent new source of n inputs that may compensate the loss of n spatial transfer from rangelands to croplands audouin et al 2015 
24964,nutrient availability is a major limitation of the production of west african mixed farming systems the fertility of these systems was traditionally sustained by fallowing and nutrient transfers by livestock from savanna to croplands however demographic growth and socio economic constraints require the agro ecological intensification of these systems to understand how agricultural practices and landscape management affect crop production we built a meta ecosystem model of nitrogen stocks and fluxes and we examined different scenarios of fallow management with or without livestock our results suggest that crop production is highly dependent on the source sink dynamics of nitrogen without livestock maximum crop production is obtained for an intermediate duration of fallowing highlighting a trade off between space devoted to production cropland and space devoted to fertility restoration fallow in presence of livestock crop production is maximum for a shorter duration of fallowing it is markedly higher with than without livestock this result highlights the positive roles of livestock and fallows as pumps vectors of nitrogen from savanna rangeland to cropland and from fallow land to cropland respectively however it also highlights the negative relationship between livestock presence and fallowing suggesting that the optimal configuration of livestock and fallow management is highly context dependent overall we argue that the meta ecosystem approach is particularly relevant for the study of agro ecosystems characterized by high spatial heterogeneity this work can be seen as a first step toward an alternative approach integrating tools from theoretical ecology for the study of agro ecosystems which functioning strongly depends on spatial organisation keywords african mixed farming system meta ecosystem model fallow nitrogen livestock crop production 1 introduction in dry to sub humid west africa most farms are traditional mixed systems combining crop and livestock production for a long time west african mixed farming systems wamfs were relatively well adapted to the population needs in the context of subsistence agriculture garrity et al 2012 jalloh et al 2012 sebastian 2014 however wamfs are currently facing important demographic social economic and environmental changes jalloh et al 2013 over the last century the increase in agricultural production has been achieved mainly by cropland expansion this led to a gradual disappearance of fallowing and not cultivated areas a key component of traditional mixed farming systems this degradation of the natural vegetation and landscape particularly pregnant in more semi arid and arid regions tends to expand to more humid climate area the new breadbasket of west africa countries these changes are threatening biomass production and soil fertility mainly through a decrease of carbon and mineral nutrient stocks in soils schlecht et al 2006 unep 2008 in turn this decrease compromises the sustainability of the whole farming system with potentially dramatic social and economic consequences these perspectives have fostered research on fertility management aimed at defining innovative practices that ensure sustainable farming in sub saharan africa rufino et al 2007 increasing exogenous inputs of mineral nutrients and organic matter to soils may seem to be the best response to the decrease of soil fertility however applying fertilizers is often prohibitive and risky for local farmers moreover the use of exogenous fertilizers is increasingly recognized as a non sustainable option mainly because fertilizer production itself is not sustainable in the long run tilman et al 2002 many soils of wamfs are lixisols iuss working group wrb world reference base for soil resouces 2006 these nutrient poor highly erodible soils are subject to the formation of slaking crusts and to important losses of nutrients through leaching smaling et al 1999 therefore crop production in these systems is likely to be particularly sensitive to nutrient loss at the landscape level the soil capacity to prevent nutrient loss also referred to as nutrient retention capacity depends on the efficiency of nutrient recycling which is driven by soil and ecosystem functioning barot et al 2007 boudsocq et al 2009 within the spatial components of the landscape and on nutrient transfers between these components since crop production in wamfs is frequently limited by nutrient availability we argue that a better understanding of the cycling and transfers of nutrients across agricultural landscapes may help determine spatial organizations maximizing crop production the key role of nutrient cycling at both ecosystem aerts and chapin 1999 and meta ecosystem levels loreau et al 2003 for primary production has been highlighted in theoretical ecology for example primary production in a given ecosystem may widely depend on processes that maintain fertility in the other ecosystems connected to it through source sink dynamics loreau et al 2013 as agro ecosystems are mosaics of subsystems forming networks of patches connected by fluxes of nutrients agro ecosystems are meta ecosystems loreau et al 2003 in these landscapes the productivity of crop fields depends on 1 local nutrient cycling within a subsystem 2 transfers of nutrients between the connected subsystems and therefore on 3 nutrient balance within each connected subsystem therefore a better spatial organization of the mosaic of landscape subsystems and a better management of nutrient fluxes between subsystems may help increase crop production and its sustainability we tackle these issues using a modelling approach focusing on wamfs of the guineo sudanian biome le houérou 2009 at the beginning of intensification processes when the surface of savanna is still large enough to provide non limiting rangeland for livestock wamfs are highly spatially structured landscapes with two distinct cultivated subsystems surrounding the dwellings namely the compound ring intensive crop fields and the bush ring extensive crop fields and two non cultivated subsystems namely fallows in the bush ring and savanna fig 1 a fluxes of nutrient between these subsystems and the subsequent connectivity are well documented diarisso et al 2015 manlay et al 2004b prudencio 1993 these fluxes mainly rely on livestock movements crop harvest and on active spreading by farmers of household wastes close to dwellings moreover these factors all vary across the seasons therefore livestock and land use management e g the proportion of non cultivated versus cultivated areas represent the main driving forces to optimize nutrient retention and nutrient transfers between subsystems hence crop production at the landscape scale to assess how livestock and land use management can qualitatively affect the optimization of crop production we developed and analysed a minimal sensu mooij et al 2010 mathematical model of nutrient stocks and fluxes in a wamfs more specifically we examined how three driving forces namely the extent of fallow in space and time the presence absence of livestock and the compound ring bush ring surface ratio affect crop production at the landscape level we used the model to identify the optimal spatial organization for crop production and the mechanisms by which these three driving forces individually or in combination affect crop production 2 model in this section we describe the mathematical model that we built for our study we focus on the well documented case study in guineo sudanian west africa le houérou 2009 the village of sare yero bana in the high casamance region of senegal n 12 81917 w 14 89024 manlay et al 2002 all the parameters used in the model their values dimensions and their definitions are referenced in appendix 2 the equations of the subsystems models for each season and transition event during the year are summarized in appendix 3 2 1 spatio temporal structure of the model in the following sections we first present the spatial structure of the model then we detail the two time scales considered in the model the year annual cycle and the multi year duration of the cropland fallow rotation cycle 2 1 1 spatial structure as for many agro ecosystems of west africa the landscape at sare yero bana is structured in subsystems that are spatially organized in concentric rings around the dwellings manlay et al 2004b the compound ring fig 1a is the closest to the dwellings and is permanently cropped with staple crops such as cereals pearl millet pennisetum glaucum l maize zea mays l sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench the compound ring benefits from organo mineral inputs as household wastes and livestock manure surrounding the compound ring is the bush ring which is managed more extensively and alternates cropping for cash e g groundnut arachis hypogea a legume manlay et al 2002 and fallow which consists in a succession of plants dominated by combretaceae and including nitrogen fixing species manlay et al 2002 the compound and bush rings are surrounded by permanently uncultivated savanna and used as rangeland for livestock there is thus an intensification of cropping practices from the savanna to the dwellings since we focus on crop production the nutrient dynamics is explicitly represented in the bush and compound rings only in the model the compound and the bush rings are considered as subsystems which areas are denoted by α c and α b respectively the dwellings and the savanna are simply considered as nutrient sources or sinks we define sources and sinks accordingly to loreau et al 2013 where a source respectively a sink subsystem is an exporter respectively an importer of nutrient within the whole agro ecosystem the savanna is assumed to be a non limiting source of nutrient section 4 4 discusses this assumption the compound and bush subsystems are connected to each other and to the other spatial entities by different fluxes that gives the model of the agro ecosystem the form of a meta ecosystem model 2 1 2 annual cycle agricultural practices change over the seasons over one year a short wet season 4 5 months corresponding to the growing period for plants alternates with a long dry season 7 8 months the wet season is characterized by erratic rains amounting annually to circa 1100 mm ardoin bardin 2004 in our model a year starts at the beginning of the wet season in the sequel t denotes the number of days in a year τ the number of days in a wet season and n represents the number of years considered since year 0 the wet season of year n starts at day nt 1 with sowing and ends at day n t τ with the harvest which initiates the transition between the two seasons the dry season lasts from day n t τ to day n 1 t 2 1 3 crop fallow cycle the crop fallow rotation is an agricultural practice that runs at the time scale of several years it affects the spatial and temporal organizations of the agro ecosystem and generates a particular set of nutrient fluxes the rotation is defined as the succession of one cropping period followed by one fallow period if l denotes the duration in years of the rotation and l c the duration of the cropland period then l f l l c is the duration of the fallow period the bush subsystem includes multiple crop fields and fallow lands to account for this heterogeneity and to ensure that the cultivated part of the bush ring is constant over time the bush subsystem is split into l subunits of the same area that will alternatively be in a state of cropland or fallow at each instant among the l subunits l c and l f subunits are in states of cropland and fallow respectively with this mathematical trick l respectively l c and l f represents both the duration in years of a rotation respectively a cropping period and a fallow period and the total number of subunits respectively the number of subunits that are in a state of cropland and the number of subunits that are in a state of fallow thus the proportions of cropland l c l and fallow l f l are considered constant over a simulation for instance a rotation duration of l 20 years and a cropland period duration of l c 15 years implies a fallow period duration of l f 5 years in that case the bush subsystem is split into 20 subunits with at any time during the rotation 15 subunits in a state of cropland and 5 in a state of fallow the proportion of subunits in a state of cropland is constant and equal to 15 20 2 2 compound and bush subsystems the same generic model is used to represent the compound and bush subsystems fig 1b this model focuses on the cycle of nitrogen n which is usually considered as the main limiting nutrient for crop production in guineo sudanian west africa pieri 1992 rufino et al 2006 smaling et al 1999 though some processes that are specific to n such as the biological n fixation are taken into account in the model adapting the model to phosphorus which is the other main nutrient limiting primary productivity in these agro ecosystems brouwer and powell 1998 would be easy the subsystem model considered is a n stocks and fluxes model composed of several interconnected n compartments fluxes of n between compartments within the subsystem and between the different subsystems depend on the subsystem and on the season table 1 the different compartments and fluxes of one subsystem are presented in the following paragraphs n stocks and fluxes are expressed respectively in kgn per hectare kgn ha 1 and in kgn per hectare of the subsystem they belong to and per day kgn ha 1 day 1 2 2 1 nitrogen compartments each subsystem is composed of three compartments the plant p the soil organic fraction o and the soil inorganic fraction i to which a fourth compartment the dead roots of woody plants r is added in the case of the bush ring fig 1b the p compartment represents the quantity of nitrogen contained in the plant both the aboveground and underground parts per surface unit kgn ha 1 each subsystem is assumed to contain one type of plant in fallow possible changes in digestibility and palatability of plants over time are not considered for simplicity we assume that in the compound subsystem and the cropland subunits of the bush subsystem the plant compartment p contains live crop biomass during the wet season and crop residues straw litter dead roots during the dry season the o and i compartments represent the quantities of nitrogen under organic and inorganic forms contained in the first 30 cm of soil per surface unit kgn ha 1 respectively the r compartment represents the quantity of nitrogen contained in the belowground part of the woodyplants growing in the bush subsystem during fallow periods for a subunit j with 1 j l of the bush subsystem the compartments p o i and r are denoted p j o j i j and r j respectively and are expressed in kgn per hectare of the subunit j kgn ha of bush subunit j 1 within the bush subsystem the mean biomass of fallow plants in kgn per hectare of fallow is denoted p bf and the mean biomass of crop plants in kgn per hectare of bush crop p bc see equations 10 and 11 in appendix 1 for details within the compound subsystem the compartments p o and i are simply denoted p c o c and i c they are expressed in kgn per hectare of compound ring kgn ha of compound 1 2 2 2 intra subsystem fluxes the model includes five intra subsystem fluxes fig 1b that connect the different nitrogen compartments to each other the growth of the plant compartment p through the uptake of inorganic nitrogen coming from i growth function g and the biological fixation of atmospheric n in the case of legumes growth function f during the wet season the decay of the plant compartment p into soil organic matter o at rate c during the dry season this process is considered negligible during the wet season the transfer of nitrogen located in roots from the plant compartment p only for woody plants to the dead root compartment r parameter δ which only occurs in the bush subsystem during the shift from fallow to cropland after clearing cf 2 3 3 we indeed assume that roots die only when the fallow is cleared at the end of the fallow the decay of the dead root compartment r which decomposes into soil organic matter o at rate r which only occurs in the bush subsystem since r compartment is specific to it and the mineralization of organic matter o into inorganic nitrogen i at rate m intra subsystem fluxes are all linear and proportional to the amount stored in the compartment they originate from except for plant growth function g 1 g is a modified logistic function with a carrying capacity k and a growth rate u proportional to the stock of inorganic nitrogen i 1 g p i u i k p k p in the fallow subsystem the carrying capacity is the plant biomass at equilibrium in absence of herbivore may and mclean 2007 in cultivated subsystems the carrying capacity represents the maximum stand biomass at the end of the wet season in addition to the assimilation of soil inorganic nitrogen i through the plant growth function g 1 atmospheric n is assimilated by legumes through symbiotic fixation groundnut in cropland subunits of the bush subsystem and by wild species as piliostigma indigofera spp in fallow subunits we assume that the function f 2 describing the atmospheric n fixation is logistic with a carrying capacity similar to that of g and with a biological fixation rate i p 2 f p i p k p k p to account for the variations of fertility in cultivated subunits of the bush subsystem the carrying capacity k is reset every year in each cultivated subunit j of the bush subsystem the carrying capacity k j 3 is assumed proportional to the value of the compartment i at the beginning of the wet season 3 k j min ω i j nt k max ω being a constant parameter and k max the maximum carrying capacity in absence of limitation by soil inorganic nitrogen in the fallow subunit j of the bush subsystem k j k bf 2 2 3 inputs and outputs of nitrogen from and to the outside in addition to the intra subsystem fluxes there are also some inputs and outputs of nitrogen entering or exiting the agro ecosystem we have represented the inputs of nitrogen through dry and wet atmospheric depositions of mineral parameter i n and organic parameter i o nitrogen sowing is considered as an additional punctual input of nitrogen that occurs at the beginning of the wet season at this instant the stock in the p compartment of the compound and bush subsystems is initialized at a value σ in kgn ha 1 except for the fallow subunits of the bush ring that were already fallow the year before σ is the quantity of nitrogen contained in seeds sown per hectare when shifting from cropland to fallow the nitrogen stock in the seed bank from which fallow vegetation develops is spontaneously present in the environment losses of nitrogen from the compartments o and i passively occur through erosion leaching volatilization and denitrification in the model the parameters e o and e n account for the overall loss rates of organic and mineral nitrogen respectively 2 3 inter subsystems fluxes the compound and bush subsystems are finally connected to each other through inter subsystems fluxes two types of nitrogen fluxes connect the subsystems namely the spreading of household wastes from dwellings and the excretion of nitrogen by livestock household wastes are spread in the compound subsystem they mainly originate from crops harvested in both the compound and the bush subsystem and therefore generate an indirect flux of nitrogen from the bush to the compound subsystem livestock generates fluxes of nitrogen between subsystems and between the savanna and the subsystems by ingesting nitrogen through grazing during the day and by excreting nitrogen during day and during night corralling through urine and faeces each of these fluxes is detailed in the following paragraphs 2 3 1 harvest and recycling fluxes crops from the compound subsystem fulfil most staple food needs of villagers the rest coming from a small part of crops produced by the bush subsystem vigan 2013 the rest of the crops produced by the bush subsystem is exported outside the village therefore there is no exportation of nitrogen through the crop produced in the compound subsystem whereas most of the nitrogen of the crop produced in the bush subsystem is exported from the agro ecosystem the parameter γ represents the share of harvested plant and the parameter ϵ represents the share of harvested cash crop that is exported from the agro ecosystem the quantity of crop v n brought to the dwellings after the harvest for a year n is therefore 4 v n α c γ c p c n t τ from compound subsystem l c l α b γ b c 1 ϵ p b c n t τ from bush subsystem cropland subunits where nt τ is the time just before nt τ at the end of the wet season before the harvest a share λ v of v n is recycled in the agro ecosystem and spread during the year in the compound subsystem as organic amendment we assume that the spreading is constant over the year and that the entire quantity v n for year n is consumed within the following year thus the daily quantity of nitrogen spread in the compound subsystem from day nt τ 1 to day n 1 t τ is given by λ v v n t 2 3 2 livestock driven fluxes we assume that livestock grazing follows a monod function characterized by the half saturation constant for feed ingestion κ κ in kgn ha 1 and a maximal grazing rate g max in day 1 a herd of κ tlu tlu stands for tropical livestock unit corresponding to an average animal of 250 kg of live weight that graze on a field containing p kgn ha 1 of palatable plant will ingest g max p κ κ p κ ψ kgn per day where ψ is the quantity of nitrogen in kgn per tlu that we assume constant the quantity of nitrogen ingested by livestock per day in each subsystem will finally depend on the season the subsystem the area of the subsystem the available plant biomass the palatability coefficient of the plants the time spent in the subsystem the half saturation monod constant κ κ for feed ingestion and the maximal grazing rate g max during the wet season the livestock is kept away from crops graze in fallows and in the savanna and is corralled at night in fallows the quantity of nitrogen ingested by the livestock per day in the fallow is therefore given by ζ wet g max b bf p bf κ κ b bf p bf κ ψ in kgn day 1 where ζ wet is the percentage of time spend by the livestock in fallows the other part of the day being spent in savanna or corresponding to the night and b bf is the palatability coefficient of the fallow plants in this quantity the part coming from the fallow subunit j of the bush ring is given by 5 ϕ wet j ζ wet g max b bf 1 l f p j κ κ b bf p bf κ ψ kgn day 1 during the dry season the livestock grazes all over the landscape and is corralled in the compound subsystem at night the concentration of nitrogen contained in the palatable plants in the bush and compound rings that we denote p tot is given by 6 p tot l f l α b b bf p bf l c l α b b bc p bc α c b c p c α b α c kgn h a o f b u s h c o m p o u n d 1 where b bc and b bf are the palatability coefficients of the plants in the cropland part of the bush ring and in the compound ring respectively the quantity of nitrogen ingested by the livestock per day in the bush and compound rings is therefore given by ζ dry g max p tot κ κ p tot κ ψ in kgn day 1 where ζ dry is the percentage of time spend by the livestock on the bush and compound rings the other part being spend in savanna or corresponding to the night in this quantity the part coming from the compound subsystem is 7 ϕ dry c ζ dry g max α c b c p c α b α c κ κ p tot κ ψ kgn day 1 and the part coming from the subunit j cropland or fallow of the bush subsystem is 8 ϕ dry j ζ dry g max 1 l α b b j p j α b α c κ κ p tot κ ψ kgn day 1 with b j b bc for a cropland subunit j of the bush subsystem and b j b bf for a fallow subunit j of the bush subsystem we assume that feed requirements of livestock is always met and remain constant over time hence a fixed per capita quantity ρ of nitrogen has to be ingested daily in kgn tlu 1 day 1 which amounts to a total quantity κρ in kgn day 1 the savanna is a feed reservoir exploited only when cultivated areas cannot fulfil livestock requirements in this case the complement of feed provided by the savanna is given by κ ρ j 1 l 1 θ j ϕ wet j in kgn day 1 during the wet season and by κ ρ ϕ dry c j 1 l ϕ dry j in kgn day 1 during the dry season where θ j 1 when the subunit j is under cropping and θ j 0 when the subunit j is under fallowing the presence of livestock in the agro ecosystem induces additional losses due to metabolic constraints a percentage λ κ of the feed ingested is excreted the rest being used for growth and reproduction we assume that livestock biomass is kept constant and that n allocated to growth and reproduction is exported outside the agro ecosystem for instance through the sale of meat a proportion ν of the excreted nitrogen returns to the soil as urine compartment i the remaining part 1 ν returns to the soil as organic nitrogen compartment o through the deposition of faeces overall livestock transfers nitrogen from savanna to the bush subsystem during the wet season and to the compound subsystem during the dry season animals feed exclusively during the day but excrete almost equally during day and night manlay et al 2004c thus night corralling generates a net transfer from feeding grounds to the corral the parameter h represents the proportion of excretion that occurs during the day when livestock is grazing and 1 h is the proportion of excretion that occurs during the night when livestock is corralled consequently the quantity of nitrogen excreted during one day in a subsystem or subunit j of a subsystem only depends on the quantity ϕ of nitrogen ingested during this day in this subsystem or subunit j of a subsystem it equals hλ κ ϕ in kgn day 1 during the night the quantity of nitrogen excreted in the corral fallow during the wet season and compound during the dry season is constant and equals 1 h λ κ κρ in kgn day 1 see fig 2 for a schematic representation of livestock induced nitrogen fluxes 2 3 3 fallow cropland shifts fallow cropland shifts occur at the beginning of the wet season at time nt these shifts do not lead to spatial transfers of nutrients but they change the distribution of nitrogen among the compartments of the bush subsystem when shifting from fallow to cropland the compartment r of the concerned bush subunit is updated at the beginning of the wet season to account for the transfer of the roots of senescent fallow biomass to soil organic matter plant stems are cleared and exported outside the agro ecosystem before the sowing and the woody part of the roots percentage δ of fallow biomass is transferred to the dead roots compartment r 9 r j nt r j nt δ p j nt where nt is the time just before nt at the end of the dry season before the sowing and the fallow clearing we assume that r decays exponentially manlay et al 2004c at rate r and fuels the soil organic matter compartment o during the years following the shift according to manlay et al 2004c more than 95 of dead woody roots are degraded after two years 2 4 validation of the model the comparison to sare yero bana data is described in appendix 4 the effect of each parameter of the model on the bush the compound and the total crop productions was examined through a sensivity analysis described in appendix 5 3 simulations crop production depends on available nitrogen according to the meta ecosystem theory gravel et al 2010 loreau et al 2003 crop production should depend on net inputs of nitrogen into the agro ecosystem and on how these inputs are transferred to the subsystems that produce crop thus to identify strategies optimizing crop production we first need to understand what governs the intensity of the nitrogen inputs into the agro ecosystem and then how these fluxes to cropland subunits and to the compound subsystem are implemented 3 1 the fallow pump and the livestock pump as the two main sources of nitrogen two ecological pumps resulting from source sink dynamics within the agro ecosystem should have a major influence on the input of nitrogen to the agro ecosystem namely the fallow pump and the livestock pump fig 3 these terminologies are used by reference to the whale pump that brings nutrients from deep to shallower waters in the oceans roman and mccarthy 2010 fallow land is a source of nitrogen for the bush subsystem because it hosts n2 fixing legumes in addition fallow efficiently retains soil inorganic nitrogen because leaching is lower than in other subsystems due to a higher soil cover by plant biomass pieri 1992 serpantié and ouattara 2001 therefore fallow subunits accumulate nitrogen which is then transferred to cropland subunits when fallow subunits are cleared and cultivated this net input of nitrogen to the agro ecosystem is referred to as the fallow pump on the other hand livestock transfers nitrogen from grazed savanna to the bush and compound subsystems where it is corralled overnight this overall input of nitrogen to the agro ecosystem is referred to as the livestock pump fallow and livestock management drive how these two pumps influence the overall input conservation of nitrogen in the agro ecosystem fig 3 in addition within the agro ecosystem livestock management influences how nitrogen is transferred to subsystems producing crop indeed through grazing and night corralling animals generate source sink dynamics between fallow subunits and crop fields subunits within the bush subsystem and between the bush subsystem and the compound subsystem these source sink dynamics vary across seasons we first studied the system in absence of livestock to understand how to optimize crop production with the fallow pump alone then we studied the system in presence of livestock to understand the effect of the livestock pump the effect of the source sink dynamics due to livestock and the interaction between the fallow and the livestock pumps 3 2 test of the effect of the pumps we performed two distinct studies for all the simulations we assumed that the total area of the agro ecosystem was constant and equal to 200 ha which is roughly the size of the agro ecosystem of sare yero bana this surface does not include the surrounding savanna which is assumed to be infinite we performed simulations with and without κ 0 tlu livestock simulations with livestock were run with κ 410 tlu which is consistent with the herbivory pressure observed in sare yero bana vigan 2013 the first study we performed focuses on the impact of the fallow extent on the biomass of crop harvested at the end of the wet season in the bush and the compound subsystems more precisely we tried to assess the consequences of 1 an increase in the duration of rotation l 10 20 50 and 100 years and of 2 an increase in the cropland ratio 0 l c l 1 for this first study we assumed a constant ratio α c α b of 1 3 50 ha of compound and 150 ha of bush as observed recently in sare yero bana by vigan 2013 in a second study we examined how the fraction of the agro ecosystem occupied by the compound subsystem α c α c α b hereafter named the compound ratio influences the biomass of crop harvested at the end of the wet season in the bush and the compound subsystems fallow extent being fixed there is no variation in spatial organization and practices within one simulation simulations were performed with r r core team 2016 by using the runge kutta method of the r package desolve soetaert et al 2010 that enables to numerically integrate systems of ordinary differential equations each simulation one simulation per set of parameters tested was performed over 300 years which was enough to reach the periodic equilibrium of the system the r package containing all the necessary functions to simulate the model is available on github https github com annebisson ewocr 2 git 4 results and discussion 4 1 managing the fallow pump to maximize crop production the effect of cropland ratio and rotation duration fig 4 a depicts the impact of the cropland ratio l c l and the rotation duration l the colour of the line varies from light to dark as the rotation duration l increases on crop production in the bush subsystem i e the sum of crop production in all the cropland subunits of the bush subsystem in absence of livestock both affect the fallow pump and its effect on crop production in the bush subsystem with consequences for crop production in the compound subsystem regardless of the rotation duration when the cropland ratio increases from 0 to 1 crop production in the bush subsystem increases from 0 to a maximum π max then decreases and finally slightly re increases when the cropland ratio reaches 1 the humpback shape of the curves is consistent with previous results obtained with a simpler mathematical model by robertson 1994 and mobbs and cannell 1995 in their study of a generic sorghum bicolor acacia senegal agro system in our model as in the model of the latter this humpback curve results from a trade off between the increase in crop production due to the increase in the cultivated area and the decrease of the restoration of soil fertility by fallow indeed as the cropland ratio increases the cultivated area increases entailing an increase in crop production however the decrease of fallow leads to a loss of fertility that translates into lower yields which finally leads to a decrease of crop production at the subsystem level in our model the cropland ratio that leads to π max varies with the rotation duration with the overall maximal production 3233 kgn yr 1 reached for a rotation duration of 50 years and a cropland ratio of 0 67 the observation of a crop production without fallow higher than with few years of fallow suggests that short fallow time does not restore soil fertility enough in terms of nitrogen stock to compensate for the cropping area reduction it demands this trend is consistent with other studies aweto 1981 brand and pfund 1998 roder et al 1997 it is even an assumption in some fallow models aweto 2012 in the first years of fallow soil fertility decline is usually thought to result from an inadequate vegetation cover during the early succession of natural vegetation recovery but the model suggests an alternative explanation in simulations the inflection results from slow restoration of the soil organic nitrogen stock during the very first years of fallowing and to a much lower growth rate of fallow than cropped plants 0 005 and 0 01 ha kgn 1 y 1 respectively as a result the net balance of nitrogen after a short fallow time is negative the impact of the fallow pump is thus negative according to our simulations the number of years of fallow 4 years beyond which fallow has a positive impact on productivity is independent of the rotation duration fig 4a on the other hand if the fallow period is long enough dead roots r and soil organic matter o accumulations reach a maximum once this maximum is reached from a biogeochemical point of view it is no more profitable to maintain fallowing the comparison between curves of fig 4a shows that the cropland ratio leading to the maximal crop production π max increases with the rotation duration among the different rotation duration scenarios the highest crop production is reached for an intermediate rotation duration π max 50 this is because crop production is driven by the combination of two mechanisms first for short rotation durations fallow duration is too short to restore soil fertility second for long rotation durations large accretion in soil organic and mineral nitrogen during prolonged fallowing does not balance declining yields at the end of longer cropping periods for a given cropland ratio indeed a longer rotation duration translates into longer cropping duration and not just longer fallow duration fig 4b c shows that the increase in crop production in the compound subsystem and in the agro ecosystem as the whole is correlated to the increase in crop production in the bush subsystem indeed the redistribution of fertilizing household wastes to the compound subsystem generates a source sink dynamics from the bush to the compound subsystem because part of these wastes comes from crop production in the bush subsystem as a consequence of this simple source sink dynamics the trends observed in the compound subsystem fig 4b and in the whole agro ecosystem fig 4c are similar to the trends observed in the bush subsystem fig 4a fig 5 represents the balance of n fluxes in kgn ha 1 y 1 of the compound subsystem and the bush subsystem crops and fallow over the last year of a 300 years simulation without 0 tlu and with 410 tlu livestock for three cases of the simulations represented in fig 4 corresponding to a cropland ratio l c l 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 respectively without livestock biological fixation represents the main source of nitrogen for the agro ecosystem looking at the three detailed cases n fixation decreases in cropland subunits as the cropland ratio increases on the other hand n fixation in fallows is maximal for an intermediate value of cropland ratio l c l 0 5 4 2 managing the livestock pump to maximize crop production fig 4d f depicts the impact of increasing the cropland ratio l c l and the rotation duration l on crop production in the bush subsystem in the compound subsystem and in the whole agro ecosystem respectively in the presence of livestock the activation of the livestock pump strongly modifies the functioning of the agro ecosystem strikingly crop production of the whole agro ecosystem increases sharply fig 4f mainly driven by the increase in crop production in the compound subsystem fig 4e this gain of production highlights the livestock pump as the main importer of nitrogen to the agro ecosystem through a source sink dynamics from the savanna to the compound ring in addition within the agro ecosystem livestock generates source sink dynamics between the subunits of the bush subsystem and between the bush and the compound subsystems these dynamics strongly affect the way the gain in nitrogen from the livestock pump is transferred to crop production in the compound subsystem during the wet season livestock mainly grazes in the savanna and is corralled at night in the fallow subunits where it does not graze and where it excretes some of the nitrogen ingested during the day hence the livestock pump fuels the fallow subunits only the gain of nitrogen adds up to the fallow pump and is transferred to the cropland subunits and crop production when fallow subunits are cleared and cultivated during the dry season the situation drastically changes livestock grazes both in the savanna and in the agro ecosystem and is corralled at night in the compound subsystem where it excretes nitrogen hence the livestock pump fuels the compound subsystem the variation of range in n balance fig 5 in the compound ring shows how the inputs of n by livestock leads to significant losses of n the livestock pump has a positive effect on crop production in the compound subsystem fig 4e however it may or may not have a positive effect on crop production in the bush subsystem depending on the management of the fallow pump fig 4d in the case of short rotation durations 20 years see appendix 4 the livestock pump has a positive effect on the stock of nitrogen in the fallow subunits regardless of the cropland ratio l c l through fallow to cropland conversion this fertility is transferred to the cropland subunits and increases crop production in the bush subsystem on the other hand for longer rotation durations the livestock pump has a positive effect on crop production of bush subsystem only for high cropland ratios e g l c l 0 8 for l 100 years as depicted in fig 4 the reason is that for lower cropland ratios the quantity of feed provided by fallow covers a large part of the requirement of livestock during the dry season therefore livestock mostly grazes in the bush subsystem and transfers the ingested nitrogen to the compound subsystem during night corralling this mechanism has two main effects 1 it weakens the livestock pump since there is less transfer from savanna to the agro ecosystem during the dry season and 2 it increases the source sink dynamics from the bush to the compound subsystem as a result crop production in the bush subsystem is lower in the presence than in the absence of livestock with livestock the maximum crop production is always reached for l c l 1 which corresponds to the shortest possible fallow ratio fallows must at least exist in its minimum form to allow livestock corralling and the functioning of the livestock pump as a result the negative effect of too short fallow without livestock is no longer observed because in addition to the weak effect of restoring fertility livestock corralling in fallows during the wet season concentrates nutrient in fallows finally fallows tend to annihilate the livestock pump since the agro ecosystem is less dependent on nutrients from the savanna 4 3 managing spatial organization to maximize crop production the connectivity introduced by livestock between the bush and the compound subsystems leads to an interdependency of these two compartments of the landscape given this interdependency crop production of the whole agro ecosystem is expected to depend on the fraction of the whole agro ecosystem occupied by the compound subsystem referred to hereafter as the compound ratio the influence of the compound ratio on crop yield in kgn ha 1 and total crop production in kgn in each subsystem and at the whole agro ecosystem level is examined fig 6 in presence of livestock we assumed a rotation duration of 20 years and a cropland ratio of 0 25 that is 5 years of cropland followed by 15 years of fallow this scenario is similar to the situation in sare yero bana manlay et al 2004b a for this scenario both the yield and the total production follow a humpback curve when the compound ratio increases the optimal total production is obtained for a compound ratio of 0 3 whereas the optimal yield is obtained for a compound ratio of 0 25 this mismatch results from the fact that sub optimality of the yield when the ratio increases is overbalanced by the increase in total cropland area which increases the production at the agro ecosystem level in fact increasing the compound ratio has both a positive and negative effect on the total production the positive effect arises from the increase in the area devoted to crop production the negative impact results from the dilution of the source sink effect when the compound ratio increases the source the bush subsystem decreases and the sink the cropland subsystem increases in size therefore the flux of nitrogen imported by livestock from bush to cropland decreases and is diluted over an increasing area of cropland 4 4 the hidden gain from savanna in the model a fraction of the nitrogen ingested by livestock exits the agro ecosystem through meat exportation over a year livestock intakes 14 9 tn the quantity of nitrogen ingested by 410 tlu that is ρκt and excretes 11 9 tn trough urine and faeces λ κ ρκt a fraction of the consumed nitrogen comes from the fallow subunits of the bush subsystem where livestock grazes during the dry season the rest coming from the savanna the proportion of time spent feeding in the fallow versus the savanna determines the respective contribution of these two sources our model assumes that livestock always fulfils its nitrogen requirement it first consumes what is available in the agro ecosystem then satisfies its nitrogen requirements with nitrogen from the savanna thus if the cropland ratio increases within the bush subsystem and or if the compound ratio increases the area of land occupied by fallow decreases entailing a higher contribution of savanna as a source of nitrogen assuming a herd of 410 tlu for a cropland ratio of 0 25 and a rotation duration of 20 years the savanna provides 50 of the nitrogen ingested by livestock 7045 kgn that represents about 1300 ha of savanna considering numbers given by powell et al 1996 for sahelian areas or by abbadie et al 2006 for lamto savanna with the same rotation duration and a cropland ratio of 0 75 the savanna represents more than 70 of the nitrogen ingested by livestock becoming the main source of nitrogen for the agro ecosystem this dependency on savanna raises the question of the sustainability of crop production in the agro ecosystems of west africa where agriculture is encroaching on savanna in this context savanna area may become a limiting resource constraining the size of livestock herds and thus the net input of nitrogen to the agro ecosystem vayssières et al 2015 in addition to this decrease of the livestock pump the agriculture evolution in a demographic growth context generally comes together with a shortening of the rotation duration and an increase in the cropland ratio which reduces the n source provided by legumes in fallows and thus decreases the fallow pump the reduction of n source could be offset by an increase of legume cereal crop rotation or intercropping as it is the case in the groundnut basin there is an other limit according to liebig s law the availability of p which can only be increased by the application of mineral fertilizers or by the possible but not yet certain increase of p by the deep root systems of the trees need for agroforestry some farmers facing such a reduction of accessible savanna manage to maintain large herds of livestock by feeding animals with exogenous supplementation audouin et al 2015 doing so they maintain the livestock pump but they replace economical and ecological costless nitrogen provided by savanna by economical and ecological costly nitrogen to take into account this cost our modelling work calls for an explicit representation of the savanna as a finite source of nitrogen and an explicit representation of the dynamics of nitrogen in livestock such improvement would allow 1 assessing whether the nutrient provisioning by savanna is sustainable or not 2 measuring the livestock production and its possible limitations due to nutrient availability and 3 exploring the potential of other sources of nitrogen such as mineral fertilizers to improve the agro ecosystem production unlike for traditional agro ecosystems where savanna is not limiting we hypothesize that in agro ecosystems with increasingly limited land in the future jayne et al 2014 new tensions and new trade offs occur between crop production in the bush versus compound subsystems and between meat and crop productions such situations are likely to occur more often as local human population densities increase with a subsequent increasing need for croplands 5 conclusion crop production in wamfs depends on complex dynamics of nitrogen through the different compartments of the agricultural landscape despite this complexity our model with its meta ecosystem approach shows that the optimization of crop production relies mainly on a good management of the fallow pump and the livestock pump that represent the main inputs of nitrogen into the agro ecosystem management must take into account the interaction between these two ecological pumps to optimize the global input of nitrogen as well as the role of the livestock as a driving force to optimize the transfer of this nitrogen flux to the agro ecosystem s subsystems that produce crop more precisely our results suggest that the livestock pump represents a higher input of nitrogen to the agro ecosystem than the fallow pump and that the fallow pump tends to interact negatively with the livestock pump thus crop production is optimal when agricultural practices and spatial organizations are such that the agro ecosystem contains livestock and has a relatively low area devoted to fallow in addition our results stress the fact that livestock reinforces the source sink dynamics between the bush and compound subsystems that is between the extensive and intensive part of the agro ecosystem this source sink dynamics is required to transfer the benefit of the fallow pump to the productive compound subsystem a corollary to these results is that crop production by wamfs is highly dependent on the livestock pump and therefore on the savanna as an external source of nitrogen the optimal practices suggested by our model hold as long as savanna extension is enough not to be a limiting source of nitrogen to livestock this assumption was likely relevant in traditional wamfs but it should be reconsidered in the context of agriculture extensification where cropland is encroaching on savanna in this new context our model could be regarded as a null model this null model could serve as a corner stone to help understand how fertility transfers will evolve according to new management strategies and spatial organization and to help propose new management practices that will ease the transition towards a more sustainable agriculture acknowledgements the authors are

fluxes in kgn ha 1 y 1 at the scale of the compound subsystem and the bush subsystem crops and fallow over the last year of a 300 years simulation without and with livestock for a duration of a rotation of 20 years the model is designed to be simple enough to provide a mechanistic understanding of the way agricultural practices influence crop production therefore it is set up to be qualitatively rather than quantitatively predictive yet the comparison of the main outputs to data from sare yero bana shows a rather good fit case 1 of table 5 presented in appendix 4 more precisely n fluxes related to livestock and harvest are close to field data from manlay et al 2004a b in both the cropland subunits of the bush subsystem and the compound subsystem on the other hand n fluxes related to livestock in the fallow subunits of the bush subsystem are of the same order of magnitude but they are largely higher this overestimation may be mainly due to simplifying assumptions regarding livestock dynamics and grazing behaviour for instance all the plants present in the fallows were assumed palatable in reality fallows contain unpalatable species ickowicz and mbaye 2001 in particular in late successional states while a share of palatable biomass is left due to tainting by urine and trampling during browsing manlay et al 2004c overestimating the livestock induced fluxes in fallow tends to reduce livestock induced fluxes from savanna which may explain the underestimation of crop production in the compound subsystem the abundance of legumes in fallows is poorly documented some acacia spp and annual legumes are present but there is no precise estimate of the amounts of n they fix however the order of magnitude for biological n fixation fluxes 50 4 kgn ha 1 yr 1 in our model is consistent with cleveland et al 1999 who gave the range of value 16 44 kgn ha 1 yr 1 for tropical savannas a 5 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis was performed using the morris method that is implemented in the package sensitivity pujol et al 2017 the analysis of the morris graph makes it possible to distinguish the parameters whose effects are negligible points close to the origin 0 0 the parameters whose linear effect is important points located to the right of the abscissa axis the parameters whose effects are non linear or include interaction with other factors points located at the top of the y axis from faivre et al 2013 the effect of each parameter of the model on the bush the compound and the total crop productions was examined this sensitivity analysis fig 7 shows that factors such as the surface of the bush subsystem α b and the size of livestock κ are among the most influential factors some other parameters such as the harvest percentages γ and the plant parameter related to the level of atmospheric n biological fixation in crop subunits of the bush subsystem ω are influential too but to a lesser extent this result is not surprising since these parameters are directly linked to the inputs outputs balance of the system the importance of the parameter h which represents the percentage of n excreted by livestock during the day manlay et al 2004b suggests that livestock management is a key driver in the system it calls for the consideration of other types of livestock management in future studies performed with our model for instance in barn livestock systems based on feed imports from outside the ecosystem are practiced when landscape is dominated by crops and when rangelands surfaces are insufficient to feed large livestock herds imported feeds represent new source of n inputs that may compensate the loss of n spatial transfer from rangelands to croplands audouin et al 2015
