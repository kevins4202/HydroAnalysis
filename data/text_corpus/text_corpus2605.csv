13025,air water micronanobubbles mnbs can be produced by four different methods and be used to improve 1 oxygen transfer in microbiological processes with high consumption rate 2 algae flotation 3 decomposition of organic compounds and 4 fouling mitigation in membranes the macrobubbles and slugs are currently implemented in the industry and mnbs are investigated in the labs the current review maps ways to explore the full potential of mnb flows through basic definitions state of the art analytical techniques bubble generation methods and implementation of engineering principles in water and wastewater treatment processes the future of air water flows is in the intentional integration of mnbs in industrial processes alongside macrobubbles and air slugs the most significant promise held by mnbs is in a conscious minimization of the role water treatment chemicals play in water treatment processes a deliberate generation of oh radicals for inactivation of pathogens and oxidation of micropollutants may start the movement away from chemical inactivation towards more sustainable water resources mitigation of membrane fouling without strong inorganic oxidants will prolong the life of polymer membranes better collision and adhesion of mnbs and higher lift of macrobubbles can significantly increase the efficiency of algae flotation reduce the use of flocculants and adjust the process for the physical removal of micropollutants higher oxygen transfer rates can improve the microbiological treatment and lower the necessity and load of further treatment stages keywords two phase flow gas water mix bubble technology microbubble nanobubble 1 introduction a new paradigm recently promulgated in european union green deal combines preservation of water resources with a reduced co2 footprint during water and wastewater treatment in other words a combination of zero water pollution with an absence of greenhouse net emissions calls for a better more efficient treatment of water of deteriorating quality at a significantly lower energy cost incorporating two phase air water flows is the way to achieve both goals in a single step other ways are the implementation of energy saving technologies the optimization and control over a treatment process and introducing renewable energy here energy saving technologies include energy efficient equipment such as high efficiency motors energy saving blowers energy saving diffusers energy saving sludge thickeners and energy saving sludge dewatering machines the optimization consists of developing control algorithms decision making models indexes for performance control and integrated measurement devices to support the optimization process finally the implementation of renewable energy includes incorporating solar wind and bio energy recently the european union has launched several large cross country projects to maximize energy recovery during wastewater treatment because wastewater contains potentially eight times the power needed to purify it 1 in all the above processes an integration of a bubble flow can reduce the energy demand and improve the efficiency of a treatment process gas liquid two phase flows are implemented in many areas including medicine 2 5 pharmacology 6 7 food and cosmetic manufacturing 8 9 oil transportation 10 steam generation 11 cooling systems 12 fire fighting devices 13 and water and wastewater treatment 14 16 two phase flow is a term in fluid mechanics that describes a flow of two immiscible phases i e gas liquid solid liquid or solid gas in water and wastewater treatment the gas liquid flows are used in flotation 17 ozonation 18 aeration 19 oxidation 20 filtration 21 and groundwater remediation 22 successful applications include air stripping of volatile organic compounds vocs 23 24 oxidation of iron manganese and sulfide 25 algae flotation 26 27 degradation of organic pollutants such as alachlor p nitrophenol rhodamine b 14 decolorization of colored wastewater by ozonation 28 treatment of oil in water emulsions 29 and backwash of rapid sand filters 30 several of the above applications act through the formation of reactive oxygen species thus promising to move away from chemical based oxidants such as chlorine and ozone with their potential carcinogenic by products 31 an additional advantage is a lowered chemical requirement and available technology that can help improving water treatment in both developed and developing countries 32 the abovementioned studies cover many applications and it is the right moment for systematization and evaluation of observed trends a little effort has been made to collect and prepare a well organized comprehensive report on the links between fundamental properties of gas bubbles and the effect of their implementation especially in water and wastewater treatment numerous recent trendy reviews on micro and nano bubbles 14 33 36 in water treatment lack a solid physical background or a clear coherent view on the engineering basics of water and wastewater treatment processes that is why despite a large volume of recent reviews on the topic we decided to update and catalog the available information 2 two phase flow this section provides a brief background to the critical features of water air two phase flow it is not intended to be a comprehensive review of this broad topic and where necessary references are given to the relevant texts on this subject this review describes only flow regimes characteristic flow patterns bubble size and shape in a stationary liquid bubble rising velocity and residence time a phase is a material with uniform chemical and homogeneous physical properties in space the term applies to a physical state solid liquid gas plasma and a presence of a clear border between two materials in the same physical state such as two immiscible liquid phases in fluid mechanics a simultaneous flow of two materials in different physical states or materials with other physical properties in the same state is defined as a two phase flow miscible components are a part of a phase but do not represent a separate phase a geometric distribution or topology of the phases can strongly affect the flow within each phase or component mass momentum and energy rates and processes across the phase interface 37 flow patterns have been initially defined by visual inspection of lab experiments with different volume fluxes volume fractions and fluid properties density viscosity surface tension 38 40 the results were often displayed as regime maps that identify the flow patterns as a function of component flow rates for given fluid properties hewitt 41 described three types of flow patterns dispersed separated and intermittent a dispersed flow contains many tiny fragments of one phase in another phase so the flow can be considered homogeneous in separated flows phases do not mix intermittent flows contain all the patterns between the abovementioned extremes when two phases are not distributed uniformly in bulk four main basic patterns have been identified visually 39 fig 1 shows the patterns that result from a simultaneous intermittent flow of gas and liquid inside a vertical tube annular or mist flow exists at high gas velocity and within the entire range of liquid velocities here superficial volumetric velocities of a gas j g m3 m2 s and a liquid j l m3 m2 s are defined as 1 j g q g s 2 j l q l s where q g and q l are the volumetric flow rates of gas and liquid respectively in m3 s and s is the cross sectional area of a vertical tube in m2 a gas phase is continuous and a liquid phase moves upward partly as a thin film adhered to a tube wall and partly in the form of dispersed droplets in a gas phase 42 a minimal velocity needed to lift the droplets is determined from the balance between the gravity and drag forces acting on the drop 39 churn flow appears at moderate gas velocities and within the entire range of liquid velocities the churn flow is a transitional flow regime with no distinct gas and fluid shapes if the tube size is not large enough for slug flow to develop 39 the turbulence induced by high velocities results in a wide bubble size distribution and a formation of giant bubbles due to coalescence an equilibrium between coalescence and breakup controls the mean bubble size the regime is of particular interest to the industry to enable high production rates and efficient operation slug flow is observed at low gas velocity and within the entire range of liquid velocities large taylor bubbles are formed due to coalescence and span over the whole cross section of the tub taylor bubbles move uniformly upward separated horizontally by liquid slugs that might themselves contain tiny gas bubbles the liquid phase is continuous and bridges opposite tube walls bubble flow is usually characterized by discrete gas bubbles in a continuous liquid phase it is the flow best described by its neighboring flow regimes the bubble flow is different from a dispersed flow in which a dispersed gas phase is distributed as a massive number of tiny bubbles and can be termed a homogeneous multiphase flow the transition from a dispersed to bubble flow is controlled by gas solubility pressure temperature salinity and ph of the solution it is seen when a dissolved gas appears as separate bubbles in the liquid phase the bubble flow is also different from a slug flow which can be viewed as a liquid film with a limited number of giant gas slugs thus the bubble flow contains a large yet limited number of uniformly dispersed distinguishable gas bubbles in a liquid film the regime exists when 0 01 jl 3 m3 m2 s and jg 0 1 m3 m2 s the bubble flow is characterized by uniform bubble size distribution and close to plug flow behavior in the gas phase as the bubbles rise in the column a transition from a bubble to slug churn and annular flow is triggered by progressively increasing gas superficial velocity a higher velocity increases the bubble number density and bubble size continuously expanding bubbles tend to agglomerate into slug bubbles and a continuous gas core towards the annular flow regime a transition from bubble to slug flow was observed in experiments with a gas volume fraction between 0 25 and 0 3 a slug to annular flow transition occurs when the gas volume fraction exceeds 0 75 39 43 44 the gas volume fraction α is defined as 3 α v g v g v l where v g and v l are the volumes of gas and liquid and v g nrt p at the same time the transition depends on many additional factors such as pressure surface tension turbulence presence of dissolved gases or impurities and local surface irregularities that can serve as cavitation sites and therefore are poorly predictable using physical mechanisms and universal dimensionless numbers initially the boundaries between flow regimes were defined experimentally in a two dimensional coordinate system and remained vague since then although a significant research effort was applied throughout the years 38 40 45 46 in some cases the flow is chaotic and its boundaries are hard to define for example a transition from slug to annular flow is accompanied by pressure variations resulting in flow instability and poor separation but an increased liquid velocity breaks large bubbles by turbulent fluctuations of fluid flow a better estimate of flow pattern through superficial velocities would improve the separation of particles with bubble flow and lifting droplets with annular flow 39 a better prediction of the lifting potential can be achieved through a simple estimate of raising velocity 3 characterization of the gas phase bubbles in a bubble flow are characterized by size and size distribution shape nature of their surface rising velocity and residence time all the features are interrelated and hence the characterization often starts from the size as the most basic simple and definitive characteristic the bubble size is also the most biased characteristic that changes depending on flow regime characteristics and design of a bubble column nature of liquid and gas and their velocities macro micro and nano bubbles hold different features to provide an intuitive sense of their possible behavior and intended application for instance large coarse or macro bubbles rapidly rise vertically towards the gas liquid interface and collapse 36 in a sense the macrobubbles are the real meaning behind latin homo bulla est main is a bubble the idea of a metaphor is that a person homo may look excellent and substantial but our life is as fleeting as a bubble bulla insubstantial and completely fragile for example arthur golding ca 1536 1605 says when man seemed to be at his best he is altogether nothing else but a bubble blown together of vanity 47 judging by that behavior the diameter of macrobubbles is between 100 μm and 10 mm bubbles larger than 10 mm usually form slugs and yet that definition is not detrimental in fermenters gas liquid reactors and ore flotation equipment the typical size of macrobubbles is between 2 and 5 mm in bubble columns 1 7 mm 48 in flotation 1 10 mm 27 microbubbles are smaller than macrobubbles and their size is between 1 and 100 μm 34 they spend hours in the reactor until they shrink and dissolve 49 50 for example 30 μm air bubbles stayed in the water for more than 100 h 51 possible reasons for the persistence are low rising velocity highly curved bubble shape large gas liquid interfacial area per unit bulk volume and a surface charge at the gas liquid interface the latter feature blocks bubble coalescence thus resulting in bubble kinetic stability over significant periods 52 53 that behavior was observed in bubbles less than 50 μm in diameter 49 less than 100 μm in diameter 54 55 and bubbles with diameters in the range of 10 60 μm 36 the nanobubbles attracted the scientific community s attention due to anticipated extraordinary properties and controversy between theoretical calculations and experimental evidence nanobubbles were first suggested in 1988 to explain the stronger than predicted attractive capillary forces between neutral hydrophobic surfaces in water 56 57 but then three theories were offered against their very existence according to epstein and plesset s theory of bubble dissolution and growth bubble lifetime depends on size and thus nanobubbles should have a lifetime of less than 0 02 s 58 59 another argument was related to surface tension expressed as a ratio of gibbs free energy to interfacial area differentials at constant temperature and pressure reducing the interfacial area decreases the system energy so the bubbles are driven to burst after rising or coalescing in water 58 finally according to laplace pressure bubble catastrophe theory small nanobubbles experience enormous internal pressure that inevitably leads to their rapid dissolution 53 60 calculated internal pressure in 100 nm air bubbles is 1 4 mpa and in 10 nm air bubbles are 14 mpa 61 and accordingly they should never exist 53 59 at that time and in the absence of experimental proofs the name and size of the nanobubbles vary significantly nano bubbles nano bubbles nanobubbles ultrafine bubbles submicron size bubbles 33 are the names of bubbles smaller than 200 nm 36 smaller than 1 μm 62 smaller than 100 nm 63 larger than 50 nm and smaller than 1 μm 64 early reports on the existence of bulk nanobubbles emerged after speculations on the presence of tiny gas species that serve as a nucleus for the growth of microbubbles during cavitation 65 66 the first experimental evidence on the existence of interfacial nanobubbles as bright stable spheres on a flat solid surface came six years later with the development of atomic force microscopy afm capable of detecting them 57 in 2010 replicas of nanobubbles were imaged with sem and in 2014 their zeta potential was measured for the first time now the international standard organization iso tc 281 defines nanobubbles as ultrafine bubbles with a diameter of less than 1 μm 34 although iso ts 80004 2 2015 assigns the prefix nano to objects with at least one dimension smaller than 100 nm opposite to the theoretical predictions nanobubbles do not dissolve away thus staying permanently in the system probably due to the presence of hard hydrogen bonds on the bubble water interface 64 and the repulsive interactions of electrically charge nanobubbles that prevent coalescence the dispersive interactions result in no or small concentration gradient between the phase interface and the bulk and extend stagnation times that can be as long as 15 days 53 for 150 200 nm bubbles 67 nanobubbles with diameter of less than 13 nm collapse in water in less than 1 min 68 another study reported stable bubbles in a solution for a few months without significant changes in their mean size concentration and surface charge 64 the bubble stability is increased by low rising velocity and dispersive electrostatic repulsion often nanobubbles with microbubbles form a dense cloud defined as micronanobubbles or mnbs 63 the size of mnbs is below 100 μm and they embrace the nano and micro bubbles the uniting base of the mnbs is the large total surface area low rising velocity extended residence time and high gas liquid transfer rate 69 studies of bubble shape were performed experimentally and theoretically in the last 40 years starting from a classical region map provided by bhaga and weber 70 the researchers conducted experiments on the rising of air bubbles in aqueous sugar solutions of different concentrations as a function of the bubble rising velocity u b the bubble diameter d a difference between the phase densities ρl ρg liquid μ l and gas μ g viscosities a surface tension σ l at the air water interface and gravity acceleration g the variables were coupled into non dimensional bond morton reynolds and weber numbers defined respectively as 4 bo g ρ l ρ g d 2 σ 5 mo g ρ l ρ g μ l 4 ρ l 2 σ 3 6 re ρ g u b d μ l 7 we re 2 eo mo here d is a diameter of a spherical bubble g is the acceleration due to the gravity 9 81 m s2 and σ l is the surface tension at the air water interface 72 86 mn m at 20 c the nondimensional numbers characterize the flow regime that influenced the bubble shape according to bhaga and weber 70 bubbles can have spherical ellipsoidal and spherical cap shapes lately the shape list was extended to contain oblate ellipsoid skirt and toroidal bubbles fig 2 depicts typical bubble shapes in bubble flow bubbles are typically spherical unless influenced by constraints such as shear stresses during motion that assumption is not far from the truth due to a natural tendency of immersed bodies to reduce surface tension according to brennen 37 the surface tension acts at a gas liquid interface and tends to hold molecules together to prevent the formation of large bubbles the tension is linearly related to the bubble surface and with a minimal surface of a spherical shape it is easy to link the minimal surface tension to sphericity a bubble is considered spherical when the length of major and minor axes differs by less than 5 71 the major axis is the longest distance between two points of the projected bubble area and the minor axis is the longest distance perpendicular to the major axis it happens when either reynolds or bond numbers are low re 1 or bo 1 with a slight increase in reynolds number re 5 the bubble shape remains spherical for low bo numbers and flat or slightly dimpled for high bond numbers elliptic oblate ellipsoid shapes are observed with 5 re 20 or 0 5 bo 20 a spherical cap bubble is observed at re 100 skirt bubbles are formed at 50 re 200 and 100 bo 200 toroidal bubbles are observed at 100 re 200 and 100 bo 200 72 a bubble diameter d that appears in bo re and we is defined as the spherical equivalent diameter of the rotational volume of the projected bubble area the d is a single diameter in monodisperse flows an average between d 1 and d 2 in bidisperse flows or a number average mean size in polydisperse flows 42 8 d i 1 n d i f i i 1 n f i polydisperse flows are also characterized by sauter mean average diameter d 32 defined as the diameter of a sphere that has the same ratio of a total volume to a total surface area as the bubble of interest 9 d 32 i 1 n d i 3 f i i 1 n d i 2 f i where f i is the absolute frequency of a size represented by d i 42 the above size division into macro micro and nano bubbles can be useful to foresee their rising velocity and residence time a theoretical bubble rising velocity is derived from a balance of gravity f g buoyancy archimedes f f and drag forces f d acting on a single bubble after it starts to rise with a terminal rising velocity a drag force is an expression of fluid resistance to the uprising movement and it acts in the direction opposite to that of the vector of rising motion the first expression of a terminal rising velocity of a spherical bubble u b 73 in m s was developed under an assumption that a bubble diameter is less than 0 1 of a size of a reactor d w 0 1 w is the reactor width so a bubble movement is not influenced by the reactor nor by other bubbles 10 u b sp g ρ l ρ g d 2 6 μ l 1 μ g μ l 2 3 μ g μ l because for most liquid and gases μg μl and ρg ρl eq 10 becomes 11 u b sp g ρ l d 2 12 μ l d 0 1 mm the rising velocity of bubbles with a diameter between 0 1 and 2 5 mm proposed in 45 74 75 is 12 u b sp 0 237 d 3 3 7 d 2 17 7 d 1 3 0 1 mm d 2 5 mm bubbles larger

the rising velocity of spherical and ellipsoid bubbles rises steeply with an increase in bubble size due to a power dependency on bubble cross section area d 2 indicating that tiny bubbles essentially behave as rigid spheres the rising velocity of spheroidal and spherical cap bubbles is proportional to d the rising velocity of a spherical bubble increases with increasing bubble size because buoyancy dominates over increased friction for this shape regime as the bubble shape changes to spheroidal the rising velocity decreases with increasing bubble size because increased friction becomes greater than increased buoyancy due to the flattening effect when a spheroidal bubble becomes too large it changes its shape at around 2 mm into a spherical cap and its rising velocity slightly increases with an increase in bubble size 80 the described behavior is typical for bubbles rising in a laminar flow bubbles rising in a highly turbulent fluid will exhibit a more complex behavior 81 bubbles leave a liquid because of a floating up to the liquid interface if the distance from a bubble to the interface is l the effective time of the bubble floating up is 16 τ b l u b or using a

from a residence time fig 4 compares bubble residence time as a function of size and shape the bubble residence time is a simple concept describing how much time a bubble resides inside the reactor it is the time difference between the time a bubble entered the reactor and floated up to burst at the air water interface however the residence time can often not be calculated from a terminal velocity large bubbles do not rise vertically straight but rather show spiraling zigzagging or rocking motion during their rise in water that has been known as the leonardo paradox after leonardo da vinci first observed it in the 1600s the paradox is the name given to a tendency of an initially asymmetric bubble under certain conditions for an unforeseen reason to adopt a spiral or zigzagging path rather than a straight one 83 gas bubbles will raise rectilinearly only when small and the reynolds number is low according to a later explanation the transition to a non rectilinear path is caused by an instability of the axisymmetric wake which becomes two threaded when the bubble is large enough to deform into a strongly oblate spheroid the two threads have opposite circulation and thus provide a lift force much like the trailing vortices of an airplane 84 a rising bubble may never display a steady terminal velocity even if it does the terminal velocity is not known a priori so bond and morton s numbers are better suited to describe the dynamics of rising bubbles than reynolds and weber s numbers which contain the terminal velocity 4 gas bubble generation bubble generation is considered a static or quasi static process the generated bubbles interact to coalescence and break up in a dynamic process here coalescence is a process of formation of giant bubbles from small ones the break up in the opposite forms tiny bubbles from a big one electrolytic hydrodynamical pressurization and acoustic forcing are the four main methods for generating gas water flows the diameter and uniformity of forming bubbles depend on injection conditions inner pressure the fluid properties surface tension viscosity density and the type of diffuser developed flows differ by four categories of parameters 1 the bubble size the smaller the better 2 the uniformity of bubble size the more uniform the better 3 the flexibility of the generator the capability to make gas bubbles of different sizes with one device the more significant the diapason the better and 4 the bubble flux the number of bubbles produced per unit of generator surface per unit of time the higher the better 4 1 electrolytic gas bubble generation electrolytic air water dispersions are generated by a direct current between two immersed electrodes as early as 1789 soon after discovering electricity deiman and van troostwijk discharged a current through two gold wires placed inside a tube with water 85 in 1800 nicholson and carlisle used a voltaic pile for water electrolysis 86 boost development of electrolysis came 100 years later after two essential discoveries the gases released by electrolysis are hydrogen and oxygen and the gas flux is related to the electrical current 87 more than 400 industrial water electrolysis units for the production of pure hydrogen existed in 1902 and in 1939 the first significant water electrolysis plant produced 10 000 nm3 h2 h 86 the generation of hydrogen to produce ammonia fertilizers and the low cost of hydroelectricity boosted the development of water electrolysis in the first half of the twentieth century a massive transfer to hydrocarbon energy where hydrogen is produced at a much lower cost through coal gasification and natural gas reforming impeded further technological development of water electrolysis 88 two recent advances in water electrolysis compact high pressure water electrolyzers to produce oxygen in autonomic life supporting systems such as nuclear powered submarines and the integration of renewable energies in new concepts such as photovoltaic electrolysis and steam electrolysis have little to do with gas water flows the essentials of a simple water electrolysis unit are depicted in fig 5 the unit consists of an anode and a cathode immersed in water and connected through an external power supply under a direct current applied to the unit positively charged hydrogen ions protons are reduced by electrons at a cathode to give hydrogen 18 2h 2e h 2 hydroxide ions move towards the anode to release electrons and form water and oxygen 19 2oh h 2 o 1 2o 2 2e the process results in small 45 180 μm hydrogen and oxygen bubbles and low gas flux the produced flows can be implemented in small up to 4 5 m3 h water treatment installations to treat colloidal light systems such as emulsified oils ions pigments ink and fibers the advantage of the electrolytic gas mixture is in a high clarity of treated water and the absence of chemicals the disadvantages of electrolytic generation of air water mixtures are low throughput the emission of hydrogen bubbles the cost of electrodes and voluminous sludge production 89 an additional drawback of the method is the periodic cleaning of electrodes due to organic and microbiological fouling 4 2 use of outer flow fields in gas bubble generation in a spiral or rotary 90 liquid flow generator the water is introduced into a vortex device through a side hole to induce tangential flow the gas bubbles are cut from a gas stream on a gas water junction by a centrifugal force imparted by a high speed rotating liquid typical gas liquid inlet flow ratio varies between 0 015 and 0 020 91 92 fig 6 depicts a typical vortex device where water is supplied through a side orifice and under pressure and gas is supplied from the center and at atmospheric pressure the mixture slowly rises in a vortex movement and finally reaches a separate reservoir similar or closely resembled devices can be found in 93 95 this type of generator has been known for a long time and its pros and cons are well known for example a generator of this type m2 lm was used to increase the growth rate of oysters in seawater near japan obtained bubble diameter ranged between 10 and 50 μm but the concentration of microbubbles was low 96 another type of mixture device is a venturi like tube used in two types of installations the first type produces macrobubbles by forwarding a pre saturated water flow through a tubule of a venturi tube 94 drastic changes in dynamic pressure just after the throat result in a collapse of air slugs and the formation of macrobubbles 53 94 97 99 the same device can form microbubbles by fragmentation of macrobubbles using turbulence 100 the only liquid is pressed through a venturi tube in the second type of installation the gas is sucked alongside the tube constriction through several small holes drilled along the pipe where the liquid pressure drops to its minimum 101 a 100 nm bubbles were reported when the air was sucked into oil 102 if the fluid pressure drops below the vapor pressure due to a high velocity inside the flow path the gas is re absorbed into the liquid stream without any additional action required 103 the required velocity can easily be estimated from bernoulli equation 20 p 1 2 ρ l j l 2 const where j l is a water flow velocity p is pressure and ρ l is a liquid density a negative pressure due to the flowing fluid occurs when j l exceeds 2 c ρ several reports suggested that the drop below the saturated vapor pressure results in cavities 104 107 quick recovery of the pressure above the vapor pressure values resulted in cavitation used to produce shock waves shear forces and chemical reactions with free oh radicals 14 4 3 pressurization bubble flow generation pressurization depressurization bubble generators exploit henry s law of partial pressure at constant temperature the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid the bubbles are formed in two stages at the first stage water is saturated with gas at partial pressure significantly higher than atmospheric the difference can be up to 3 4 bars bubbles are formed at the second stage when the partial pressure drops back to atmospheric bubbles are formed through nucleation the homogeneous or de novo nucleation mechanism creates bubbles spontaneously within bulk water at 100 atm partial pressure 108 consequently homogeneous nucleation is not considered an essential mechanism in water and wastewater treatment heterogeneous nucleation considers the presence of pre existing gas pockets on a solid surface the supersaturated gas diffuses into gas pockets and forms bubbles that grow up to an eventual detachment the process can occur at any supersaturation level and is therefore considered the governing mechanism in water and wastewater treatment 109 dynamic non uniform pressure changes result in the formation of micro and nanobubbles simultaneously 67 110 the size and number of generated bubbles depend on the applied pressure difference 94 fig 7 depicts a possible mechanism of heterogeneous nucleation a vacuum dissolution is a variation of pressure dissolution the water is saturated with air at atmospheric pressure at the first step a vacuum that is later applied to a tank that contains the saturated water releases the air as tiny bubbles 30 90 μm although the generation of tiny bubbles with no added chemicals is an advantage of vacuum dissolution three significant drawbacks currently limit its use to the paper industry only vacuum dissolution is 1 a batch process that requires 2 sophisticated equipment to maintain the vacuum and releases 3 a limited number of air bubbles solution replacement requires a substrate and two liquids with different gas solubility when a solution with high gas solubility is replaced with a solution with low gas solubility excess gas forms bubbles on the substrate surface an application of ethanol water 1 12 at 35 c resulted in the generation of 100 200 nm nanobubbles at 4 108 bubbles ml concentration 111 pressure dissolution is currently the most widely used method for generating air water flows the technique is so simple that it has been used in mining engineering in the last 150 years crushed and ground rocks are mixed with water that is aerated with the help of perforated pipes the perforated pipes were changed over the years in coarse bubble diffusers to sprayers slotted tubes or valve orifices the released bulky air slugs rapidly float to the water air interface serving the primary goal of flotation in mine enrichment a fast separation of minerals the separation is achieved by adding surfactants that bond desirable minerals from a pulp to the air bubbles that float to a liquid air interface further refinement and enrichment of the minerals are performed at the interface a similar approach was tried in wastewater aeration in 1910 however a significant difference in density of ore minerals and bacteria along with a large bubble size resulted in the rapid rise of the bulky air slugs to the air water interface with little if any interaction with targeted microorganisms the embedded problem of coarse diffusers is a rule of thumb that the size of generated bubbles is an order of magnitude larger than the diameter of an orifice possible explanations include a force balance and a rapid coalescence of a bubble cloud 112 applying an oscillating flow can reduce the size difference between the pore and the resulting bubble 113 thus typically released bubble sizes are in a range of dozens and even hundreds of mm much larger than 40 180 μm bubbles released in electrolysis and outer flow field hence the bubble rise velocity is high and suitable for ore enrichment but not water wastewater treatment the latter requires much higher contact times due to limitations in the coagulant use the addition of chemicals is undesirable in water processes the formed flow is unstable and highly turbulent often a shift to slug flow fractures just formed fragile coagulant impurity air bubble flocks the oxygen transfer efficiency ote is very low and a search continued for a better more uniform spread of smaller air bubbles the bubble size reduction was achieved by mounting diffusers on top of perforated pipes in the form of discs tubes domes and plates fine bubble diffusers were made of sintered glass ceramic or metal 114 and were mounted or screwed into the diffuser header pipe the diffusers can supply 20 100 μm diameter bubbles using 30 40 less energy than coarse diffusers fine bubbles are much more efficient at transferring oxygen because they create a larger transfer surface area per unit of total volume it is easy to calculate that in the case of identical total air volume the ratio of total surfaces of two spherical bubbles is inversely proportional to their diameters for instance a drop in bubble diameters from 2 5 mm to 0 5 mm increases the total interfacial contact area between air and water by a factor of twenty five 115 as a result a shift from coarse bubbles of 6 13 mm to fine bubbles of 1 2 mm increased the ote from 0 025 per cm of pond depth to 0 065 116 the reason is that a bubble water oxygen exchange rate directly depends on the total bubble surface within a unit of bulk volume small bubbles contain the same air volume as the larger bubbles but their greater number significantly increases the total bubble surface available for oxygen transfer that simple consideration has been a leading push towards introducing fine diffusers that are currently considered state of the art in water wastewater treatment these diffusers are applicable and even desirable in ozonation due to a high gas hold up and high oxygen mass transfer coefficient 94 in aeration and flotation the obtained gain in process efficiency is modest in addition fine diffusers disperse bubbles with a large size distribution bubbles with 0 and 25 mm diameters are released simultaneously 117 an introduction of fine diffusers increased aerobic biodegradation of phenol 49 118 p xylene 119 pentachlorophenol 120 and tce 121 in addition to biodegradation the organics in wastewater are physically removed by flotation with small bubbles up to 75 of micro dispersed decane 95 of dissolved octane and 70 of ethylbenzene and toluene were removed in controlled flotation experiments with 60 100 μm microbubbles at an airflow rate of 3 33 cm3 s 122 a recent attempt to produce microbubbles with relatively narrow bubble size distribution is by gas injection through a membrane into a flowing continuous liquid phase containing a surfactant 123 the most significant advantage of this technique is that the resultant bubble size can be controlled by varying the membrane pore size previous attempts to release the gas into a stagnant liquid resulted in the generation of bubbles up to two orders of magnitude larger than the membrane pore diameter 113 123 124 for example bubbles released from a membrane surface with a 20 μm pore diameter 125 have a size of 500 μm 113 and may even merge before departing the membrane surface 126 the membranes can be made of silicon shirasu porous glass spg made of volcanic ash or metals silicone membranes are cost effective easy to set up and able to produce tiny microspheres close to a nanometre but have low mechanical strength thus making them susceptible to breaking under high pressure used to increase the bubble flow 127 metal membranes have high mechanical strength but large pore sizes usually over 20 μm 128 spg membranes have high mechanical strength and high pore uniformity but are relatively expensive compared to silicone and metal membranes and are easily contaminated by the dispersed flow because of their tortuous pore structure kukizaki and goto 123 produced microbubbles with a mean diameter of 360 720 nm by injecting air into 0 05 0 5 wt sodium dodecyl sulfate sds solution by forcing it through hydrophilic spg membranes with a mean pore diameter of 43 85 nm that typical order of magnitude size difference is due to a pore size distribution within the membrane structure and gas penetration through the largest pores in the membrane structure 112 4 4 acoustic forcing flow generation cavitation is the formation of vapor cavities in water because of a sudden pressure drop hydrodynamic cavitation or due to a passage of ultrasonic waves acoustic cavitation here cavities are any space within the liquid phase unoccupied by liquid molecules either empty or occupied by vapor 129 a momentum balance equation predicts that there is a downstream drop in static pressure when a fluid passes through a constriction tiny bubbles or vapor cavities are formed if the fall is below a critical value usually below the vapor pressure of water at a given temperature in a sort of local decompression pressurization recovery of the pressure results in imploding the cavities and formation of intense shock waves very high local energy density released at the imploding point can result in extremely high pressure and temperature in a range of 10 500 mpa and 1000 10 000 k respectively 130 because the waves are strong enough to damage moving parts cavitation is usually undesirable along with that cavitation can generate a highly reactive local radical wave usable for the treatment of organic impurities oxidation of unwanted organic compounds in wastewater by hydroxyl radicals oh was reported by 49 131 134 a release of free radicals from collapsing microbubbles is due to their charge a natural phenomenon that prescribes a higher concentration of ions near the bubble surface shrinkage of microbubbles results in the re concentration of ions near a narrowing bubble surface and creates a diffusion of ions from a diffusive layer into a water bulk however the diffusion rate is lower than the shrinking range the final bubble collapse results in generating hot spots with hundreds of atmospheres pressure thousands of degrees temperature and a concentrated ionic cloud the hot spot is a minimal area and the source of free radicals 51 which are the main reactive groups in the oxidative treatment of wastewater hydrodynamic cavitation was used to decompose pesticides and dyes 106 107 135 136 at present a lack of sufficient data prevents a more detailed explanation of the exact mechanism of radical generation from collapsing microbubbles 36 thus preventing the further development of that technology in addition microbubbles formed by hydrodynamic cavitation have a broad size distribution in acoustic cavitation the cavities are produced by sound waves passing through water bodies usually in ultrasound at higher than 16 khz frequency the waves are generated inside a bulk liquid with an ultrasonic probe 137 or outside with an external ultrasonic wave generator 138 cavities form when an acoustic wave produces high negative pressure periods that exceed an ambient hydrostatic pressure 139 the cavities grow uniformly in the solution or heterogeneously on hydrophobic surfaces and continuously accumulate sonic energy 140 in homogeneous nucleation the liquid ruptures because of a tensile strength that exceeds the intermolecular cohesion forces the required energy is typically much more significant than applied in practice the heterogeneous nucleation starts from tiny cracks on the surface of reactor walls or sonotrodes used for the cavitation the cracks are filled with gas and commonly termed gas pockets eventually the bubbles detach from the solid surface the detachment mechanism has been unclear so far the formed water vapor bubbles are smaller in diameter and have a narrowed bubble size distribution than air bubbles generated by hydrodynamic cavitation mean diameters of 400 700 nm 141 and 750 800 nm 62 are reported removing the ultrasonic field usually causes the collapse of vapor bubbles the entire process of generation growth and collapse of air bubbles occurs in milliseconds 104 the collapse of the bubbles forms hot spots with high pressure and temperature that promote the decomposition of air bubbles and the generation of highly reactive free radicals the acoustic cavitation was used to purify wastewater in numerous lab experiments 130 142 149 but hardly in full scale installations due to high operational costs and required expertise in chemical engineering material science and acoustics time 150 151 5 experimental determination of bubble properties 5 1 measurements of size and size distribution exact values of oxygen mass transfer coefficient bubble velocity and residence time require the knowledge of precise bubble size and bubble size distribution the latter is influenced by the internal parameters of a gas generator and the chemistry of a gas and a liquid for instance water chemistry temperature and ionic strength affect the bubble size in air water flow measurements of the bubble size can be performed with invasive and non invasive methods the former are based on an introduction of a probe for capillary suction 152 conductivity measurement 153 and light transmission with optical fibers 154 the non invasive methods are divided into optical including scattering photographic and holographic 155 158 electroresistive 159 and acoustic 160 162 among them optical microscopy is the simplest and the most direct method that has been widely used to measure 1 150 μm bubbles the approach suffers from a low automatization thus requiring slowly moving bubbles with no clustering that a human eye can hardly capture better high quality bubble images can be obtained by microphotography that combines a camera with a microscope fig 8 depicts microbubbles of various diameters obtained in a vortex device described in details in levitsky et al 95 as a function of applied air pressure a specific image processing software analyses the images the accuracy of the obtained results highly depends on the quality of the applied digital camera two main limitations of the technique are an obvious need for a transparent wall of a bubble container and a possibility of bubble clustering the camera is placed outside the bubble container and the pictures can only be taken through a transparent wall the possible clustering might change the results or make their interpretation difficult thus requiring photographing of dilute solutions only 155 meaningful results require a large number thousands of micrographs and their thorough time consuming analysis a static laser light scattering can measure bubbles of sizes 0 02 2000 μm a light screened through a bubble water mixture is scattered by the bubbles the intensity of the scattered light is detected by a photomultiplier tube and compared to the initial light intensity the relationship between the intensity and the bubble diameter varies with the size of the bubbles according to rayleigh scattering theory the scattered intensity is proportional to the sixth power of the bubble diameter if the bubble is significantly smaller than the wavelength of light 163 according to mie scattering theory a complex relation between scattered light intensity and bubble diameter exists when the diameter is close to the wavelength of light 164 finally the scattered intensity varies with the square of the bubble diameter when the bubbles are significantly larger than the wavelength of light 165 a dynamic light scattering can be used to determine the bubble diameter by its relative brownian motion bubble diameter is calculated from its translational diffusion coefficient using the stokes einstein equation that links the diameter absolute temperature of the bulk and water viscosity 166 the obtained diameter considers a water shell that forms around a moving bubble the accepted size is called a hydrodynamic diameter a diameter of a perfect sphere that moves in an electrolyte with a velocity like a velocity detected during the measurements usually displayed values are higher than a size of a real bubble one of the main problems in applying light scattering is in the presence of other objects that can scatter the light even in the form of nanodroplets nanoparticles or more significant impurities that can shield the bubbles 167 the electroresistivity method is based on electrophoresis through a separator with tiny pores the electrical resistance increases when a bubble passes through a pore according to tsuge 63 the number of bubbles and their size can be determined by resistivity the method can measure bubbles in a size range between 0 2 and 600 μm and at high concentrations however the results are less accurate and biased by the bubbles relative motion and behavior 159 acoustic methods are inverse methods that rely on the fact that bubbles strongly affect the propagation of acoustic waves the acoustical cross section is three to four orders of magnitude greater than the bubble s geometrical cross section 161 therefore the acoustic wave can be calibrated against the bubble population using either backscattering attenuation or dispersion the measurements can be performed rapidly and continuously even in opaque samples the sensor is placed outside the bubble container and the bubble motion does not bias the measurement acoustic techniques are relatively simple and applicable to much larger liquid samples the main problem in applying acoustic methods is a significant difference in the obtained results for instance the acoustic method overpredicts the bubble concentration by two orders of magnitude at small radii and underpredicts it significantly at large radii 168 an additional study reported an order of magnitude difference between the measurements performed by optical and acoustic methods 169 in general the size and size distribution of the formed bubbles change as a function of time due to collapse or coalescence and the initial detection is necessary but not critical 5 2 zeta potential of gas bubbles one of the essential properties of air bubbles is an electrical charge acquired through preferential adsorption of h or oh ions from water or electrolyte solutions at the water bubble interface the charge of a bubble is neutralized by counterions that form a separate diffusive layer of opposite charges two layers of opposite charges surround a bubble in a construct known as electric double layer edl the presence of edl does not allow the measurement of the surface charge of a bubble still it will enable us to estimate its value at a plane of shear 170 formed using electrophoresis an imposed bubble movement in an external electric field the obtained value known as zeta potential is characteristic of a surface charge of the bubble the ph and the ionic content of the electrolyte that surrounds it the zeta potential is calculated through the smoluchowski equation that links imposed bubble velocity to the strength of the imposing electric field electrophoretic light scattering els and laser doppler velocimetry are the most widely used techniques both methods calculate the zeta potential from the analysis of bubble velocity during electrophoresis table 1 provides the size and zeta potential of air bubbles in water at ph 7 the majority of the reported values are lower than 30 mv set as a threshold of air water mixture stability achieved through a mutual electrostatic repulsion of edls of contacting bubbles 64 negative zeta potential values of 45 mv 37 mv and 40 mv were observed for air nitrogen and oxygen bubbles respectively mixed in stagnant water 175 the reported point of zero charge pzc values are between 2 and 5 31 176 or even between 1 5 and 2 5 171 177 two explanations of the predominant negative charge of the bubbles in stagnant water 178 179 are preferential adsorption of oh ions on an air water interface and spatial orientation of polar water molecules on the shell of air bubbles the former explanation is based on the lower hydration energy of 489 kj mol of oh vs 1127 kj mol for h ion 171 180 the latter model assumes that partially positively charged oxygen atoms in a water molecule are positioned towards the gas phase and partially negatively charged hydrogen atoms turn towards the electrolyte both models are used to explain the prolonged residence time of micro and nanobubbles in an electrolyte through a mutual repulsion of strongly charged air bubbles 52 181 182 three earlier explanations were harvey nuclei bubbles existing in crevices of microscopic contamination particles or other achievable macroscopic surfaces 183 184 continuous formation of gas nuclei by cosmic radiation 185 and finally the concept of an organic skin 66 185 which is similar to the concept of contamination 186 188 according to the theory the bubble surface is completely covered by organic matter or surfactant this organic skin prevents the dissolution from the bubble s interior to the surrounding liquid none of the theories is universal yet each explains some results an additional obstacle to developing a more general profound understanding of the extended stability of air bubbles in liquids is the complexity in the experimental setups and an unconventional interpretation of obtained results 6 application of air bubbles in water and wastewater treatment the air is almost the ultimate component in gas liquid flows used for water and wastewater treatment rare exemptions are pure oxygen and co2 used in setups where their presence is economically and technologically justified the air is abundant and contains precisely the same elements including oxygen treatment processes based on air water mixtures include flotation aeration disinfection filtration and advanced oxidation the addition of air helps to downsize the treatment facility to reduce the operation time to reduce the operational expenses and at the same time increase the treatment efficiency in several applications the introduction of air serves several purposes at once as in the case of conventional activated sludge 6 1 conventional activated sludge typical sewage treatment is performed by a three stage operation that aims at reducing organic and microbiological loads to bearable levels so the effluents can be safely released into the environment or reused the aerobic treatment decreases organic and microbiological loads and the anaerobic treatment reduces nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations the aerobic treatment is accomplished by aerobic bacteria confined in reactors that vary by the air supply configuration popular configurations are aerated lagoons trickling filters constructed wetlands membrane bioreactors mbrs and conventional activated sludge cas the latter are intensified reactors featuring high bacterial loads and relatively short hydraulic residence time the reactor efficiency and decomposition rate depend on an instant supply of dissolved oxygen do constantly consumed by the bacteria as they decompose the organics air is a common source of do mainly due to its abundance and reasonable pumping cost oxygen is poorly soluble in water and typical saturation levels are between 8 at 27 c and 10 at 15 c mg l a massive decay of aerobic bacteria occurs at critically low levels below 2 mg l do concentration drops fast in intensified aerobic processes so a simple mutual exposure of extensive air and water surfaces is not an option available options include surface and subsurface aeration the operation applied to increase or maintain the oxygen concentration in natural and artificial aquatic environments in wastewater treatment the aeration also mixes the entire sludge and lifts the organics the surface aeration implies an operation of a mechanical device such as an impeller an aerator or a fountain however the power required to increase the oxygen supply increases with the impeller rate to the third power and the impeller diameter to the fifth power making the surface aeration prohibitively expensive at a commercial rate 189 the subsurface aeration implies intensive air pumping in bubbles or slugs into the reactor to induce do dissolution and diffusion fig 9 shows a qualitative scheme of a typical wastewater treatment plant with the average energy intensity of different stages typical sewage treatment is a three stage operation with core secondary aerobic and anaerobic stages the primary stage includes wastewater collection and pumping screening grit removal and sedimentation in a primary sedimentation tank except for wastewater pumping primary treatment requires low energy average energy demand is between 0 02 and 0 1 kwh m3 in canada between 0 045 and 0 14 kwh m3 in hungary and between 0 1 and 0 37 kwh m3 in australia 190 192 and even that level can be lowered using compact separation processes such as lamella settler floc blanket settler micro sand ballasted lamella settler 193 the tertiary treatment in the form of chlorination or sand filtration requires an additional 0 2 kwh m3 for the filtration only or up to 0 5 kwh m3 for the entire coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration tray chlorination has a relatively low energy demand between 2 10 5 and 2 10 3 kwh m3 194 the secondary treatment with aeration and sludge pumping is the biggest energy consumer the average demand is 0 46 kwh m3 in australia 0 27 kwh m3 in china 0 47 kwh m3 in us and 0 30 1 89 kwh m3 in japan 195 between 45 and 75 of the plant s total energy demand or between 0 45 and 0 8 kwh per m3 of treated influents 196 197 is spent on aeration 198 and yet cas is not the most energy demanding consumer in mbr for example the aeration consumes between 70 and 80 of the total energy being spent on both a biological degradation of organics and on membrane scouring 194 largely due to the aeration wastewater treatment consumes 1 2 of the united states annual energy demand 31 no wonder the aeration is under constant inspection for better performance and lower energy demand aeration efficiency is tested by standard parameters such as oxygen transfer rate otr and standard aeration efficiency sae here otr kg o2 h is defined as 21 otr k l a do d o sat v l where k l a is the mass transfer coefficient 1 h do is the dissolved oxygen in water kg o2 m3 dosat is the dissolved oxygen in water at saturation kg o2 m3 and v l is the volume m3 of sewage treatment reactor sae kg o2 kwh is 22 sae otr p where p is the power drawn by the aeration system kw the basic demands of aeration systems are high otr and sae i e more oxygen transferred into the mixture at low energy demand thus less air should be supplied to a reactor to ensure the concentration required in the process the oxygen is typically supplied from the air the aeration with high purity oxygen is much less common typical surface aerators shear the liquid into tiny droplets and throw them into the air the droplets increase their oxygen content to at least half saturation during contact with the atmosphere the oxygen diffuses back to the sludge body after the droplets return the mixing is due to the production of droplets low speed aerators have an sae of 1 5 2 1 kg o2 kwh and high speed aerators have an sae of 0 9 1 3 kg o2 kwh the aerators require shallow tanks up to 3 5 m depth and are characterized by the high energy demand of up to 0 7 kwh m3 of raw wastewater additional surface aerators such as fountains and floating devices are used in the aeration of natural water bodies aerated lagoons and basins subsurface aerators release oxygen or air bubbles from the bottom of a reactor the bubbles rise through the reactor to the air water interface exchanging the oxygen on their way and mixing the entire sludge the simplest subsurface aerator is subsurface aquatic plants through the natural process of photosynthesis the plants release oxygen into the water albeit at a low rate a higher rate requires implementing engineering devices such as diffusers that blow compressed air via pipes landed at the bottom of a reactor to the diffusers that release them to the reactor here the efficiency of a subsurface aeration device is evaluated through the oxygen transfer efficiency ote defined as 23 ote o 2 in o 2 out o 2 in where o2 in and o2 out are the mass fluxes of oxygen in and out of a clean water volume ote provides an absolute efficiency of aeration with no blower specifications more conveniently and uniformly a separate specification of ote and blower efficiency simplifies a design of an aeration system a typical measurement is performed in deionized water with no dissolved oxygen at 20 c and 1 atm pressure and reported as standard oxygen transfer efficiency sote a transition from standard to process conditions requires an introduction of an empirical factor α defined as 24 α αsote sote where sote is an oxygen transfer rate at standard conditions and αsote is oxygen transfer efficiency at process conditions with no effect of contamination the sote is influenced by bubble size and its rising velocity that depends on densities ρ l and ρ g dynamic viscosities μ l and μ g and superficial velocities j l and j g of its liquid l and gas g components these parameters are not independent but intrinsically linked and influence each other typical fine bubble diffusers produce 5 10 mm bubbles achieving 30 sote 4 5 m above the diffusers located at the bottom of bioreactors 199 200 the bubbles rapidly rise throughout the reactor and at the same time intensively exchange oxygen with the surrounding liquid still the aeration efficiency is limited by 1 oxygen transfer rate from gas to liquid and 2 uptake rate of microbes 31 but suppose the bubble triple function can be sub divided into mixing and lifting on one side and oxygen mass transfer rate on another in that case introducing micro and nanobubbles can improve the transfer rate for example an introduction of 50 60 μm microbubbles 201 doubled the k l a value and half life t ½ 202 thus either increasing the treatment efficiency or reducing the dimensions of the treatment vessel increased oxygen concentration and mass productivity were the positive effects of microbubble aeration in the fermentation of trichoderma reesei 203 the aeration with microbubbles resulted in two times higher leaf lettuce dry weight than macrobubbles 204 a 125 times higher oxygen mass transfer rate in groundwater with micronanobubbles resulted in 16 times higher dissolved oxygen concentration 205 a higher subsurface concentration of dissolved oxygen can predictably facilitate the aerobic biodegradation of contaminated groundwater an unexpected secondary positive effect of implementing micronanobubbles was found when cholesterol personal care products and endocrine disruptors were transferred to aerosols generated above the surface of conventional aeration basins 206 207 an unexpectedly positive effect of introducing micro and nano bubbles that have no lifting power is in the bridging of the impurities through the bubbles and a branched structure formation 110 a specific density of the construct reduces until it floats if the presence of microbubble and nanobubble can have such a detrimental effect on the efficiency of wastewater treatment fig 10 depicts a potentially new concept of mbr with a fast circulation of influent through a venturi type reactor no large open tanks are needed the bioreactor will be in the form of a pipe and will be supplied with persistent mnbs that will constantly float in bulk large bioreactors mechanical or pneumatic mixture will be exchanged with biofilms grown on carrier media one example of the media is aqwise biomass carrier a highly porous plastic carrier developed by an israeli company aqwise yet despite the consensus regarding the positive effect of micronanobubbles on gas transfer efficiency and potential additional beneficial reactions the long time impact of the suggested approach will only be answered using long pilot tests with natural wastewater of different qualities the majority of the publications use ultrapure water that likely influences bubble size and oxygen mass transfer coefficient k l a 6 2 flotation the earliest attempt to use flotation as a separation technique dates back to a british patent issued in 1860 208 the patented technology was based on the addition of oil to water the specific density of oil is lower than that of water and thus oil droplets that float over a water surface can accumulate and lift impurities attached to oil droplets the essence of flotation has not changed for more than 150 years flotation is the technology that uses the low specific gravity of a lifting substance and its ability to accumulate other impurities on its way up what has changed are the materials being used for the lifting the flotation is now performed with air bubbles that are either dissolved in water as in dissolved air flotation daf dispersed in water as in dispersed air flotation diaf or generated by electro coagulation as in efc in daf a part of the water is supersaturated with air under 400 kpa pressure and reintroduced into the flotation cell 209 the atmospheric pressure in the cell transfers dissolved air into dispersed bubbles of 10 120 μm diameter 27 210 the bubbles collect the impurities and float them to the surface of a tank where they are skimmed off the diaf forces air through shirasu porous glass spg into the water to produce bubbles with a large 75 to 655 μm size range 211 the efc uses water electrolysis to produce h2 and o2 bubbles of 22 50 μm diameter 212 flotation s separation of algae and cyanobacteria from water 213 215 is an excellent example of a well accepted technology that compares favorably against other technologies including coagulation sedimentation centrifugation and granular and membrane filtration the process cost is low the technology is robust and the separation efficiency is between 90 and 99 26 27 despite the low algae density and an order of magnitude size difference between algae and microbubbles typical algae hydrodynamic diameter is between 5 and 7 μm 216 and the reported bubbles have a 100 120 μm diameter 217 at present more than 50 plants based on flotation technology are in operation or under construction in scandinavian countries and the united kingdom alone the flotation efficiency depends on the efficiency of three sub processes of collision adhesion and lift of a stabilized alga bubble floc 218 the general aggregation rate can be expressed as 25 n ab α ab β ab n a n b where n ab is the rate of attachment between algae a and a bubble b α ab is the adhesion efficiency factor β ab is the collision efficiency factor n a is the concentration of algae and n b is the concentration of bubbles the probability of adhesion α ab depends on the electrostatic and hydrophobic characteristics of a bubble and an alga and can obtain values between 0 and 1 the adhesion probability is estimated as a ratio of the rate at which a bubble and algae form a floc to the rate at which a bubble and an alga collide under favorable coagulation conditions α ab values between 0 5 and 1 provide fairly reasonable agreement with the available experimental data 219 when the energy barrier is lower than the energy of motion k b t the adhesion probability equals 1 220 a probability of collision is defined as a ratio of the rate at which an air bubble strikes an alga to the rate at which a bubble flows towards an alga unlike the adhesion probability the collision probability can be calculated based on the separate effects of brownian motion differential flotation and an interception the impact of differential flotation is due to a density difference between air bubbles and particles the bubbles bump into the particles on their way up the interception is due to the action of a moving fluid that brings particles and bubbles into collision as they move along the fluid streamlines fig 11 shows the three mechanisms schematically the collision frequency function due to brownian motion is 26 β ab br 2 3 k b t μ l d a d b 2 d a d b where k b is boltzmann constant t is absolute temperature μ l is a dynamic liquid viscosity and d a and d b are the diameters of an alga and an air bubble the collision frequency due to a differential flotation is 221 27 β ab df π 4 d a d b 2 u b sp u a where u b sp and u a are the rising velocities of a bubble and an alga respectively a collision frequency due to interception mechanical mixing is calculated based on the saffman turner relation 222 28 β ab sh π 4 ε d a d b 3 where ε is a turbulent dissipation rate estimated based on k epsilon model at the inlet to the flotation tank 223 29 ε 0 1642 k l here l 0 07 lc k 3 2 ul and l c is the length of the inlet contact zone a total collision frequency is a superposition of three parallel collision mechanisms 30 β ab tot β ab br β ab df β ab sh fig 12 details the collision frequency function between an alga and a bubble as a function of bubble diameter previous models 221 224 neglected the effect of brownian motion of air bubbles on the collision efficiency claiming that only differential flotation and turbulence are essential according to our calculations the brownian motion is crucial and the single most significant collision mechanism for the bubbles up to 1 10 μm the total collision probability coincides with a probability due to a differential flotation at bubble sizes larger than 1 10 μm the collision due to the interception is less critical a minimal collision probability is for particles of 100 nm size as was previously reported by reay and ratcliff 225 for small impurities the influence of brownian motion is extended towards 10 mm suggesting that the process efficiency heavily relies on bubble size 219 specifically the collision probability between bubbles and impurities due to the interception is more influential when the bubble diameter is the same size as the impurities themselves a large body of experimental evidence confirms that tiny bubbles have a higher collision efficiency than large bubbles 226 227 according to 228 229 an anticipated increase of collision efficiency varies between d a d b and d a d b 2 as a function of reynolds number and bubble contamination level the average hydrodynamic diameter of an alga is between 5 and 7 μm and the possibility of generating air bubbles of the same size range is of paramount importance for process efficiency 216 micro and nanobubbles can disperse in the whole volume of the flotation tank and reach places that cannot be reached by bigger bubbles 230 231 the smaller the bubble diameter the higher the number of bubbles adhering to an impurity the initial adhesion probability is low but can be increased by deliberately changing the bubble charge gas bubbles are typically negatively charged in water but their charge can be reversed by the addition of multivalent cations 177 232 cationic surfactants 62 233 or colloidal gas aprons cgas 234 235 micro and nanobubbles perform better on the collision and adhesion but fail to quickly transfer the algae to the upper edge of the flotation tank for algae removal initially long flotation times of mnbs turn even longer when bubbles capture an alga thus increasing the floc density and reducing the density difference between a floc and surrounding water a lifting force of mnbs becomes critically low to ensure process selectivity opposite to the previous suggestions 34 138 mnbs should not replace the macrobubbles but comprehend them fig 13 depicts an optimized approach to flotation the combination of micro and nanobubbles with macrobubbles will improve froth flotation efficiency the mnbs have a higher charge due to their small size higher hydrophobicity and lower rising velocity all that increases not only the collision but also the adhesion probability an intermediate flock of an impurity surrounded by mnbs can easily promote an aggregation into a larger flock with a macrobubble thus significantly increasing the rising velocity the entrance and entrapment of mnbs in already formed flocs reduce their apparent density and increase rising velocity the presence of multiple contact points between the impurity the mnbs and the macrobubble reduces the probability of bubble detachment 6 3 mitigation of fouling in membrane filtration a membrane is a semi permeable active or passive barrier that permits the passage of one or more components in the initial mix while limiting the passage of others although graham 1848 used a sort of membrane in the development of diffusion law and although the first membranes were synthesized more than a century ago development and implementation of membranes evolved into a scientific discipline during the second half of the 20th century since the 1970s membranes have been the most investigated separation method widely implemented in many industries today with an unstable cost of fossil fuels membranes with modest energy demands and small footprint become even more attractive they are often compared favorably to other separation processes such as distillation adsorption granular filtration extraction or crystallization a membrane can be operated in either constant flux or constant pressure mode in a continuous flux mode the flux through the membrane remains constant but the transmembrane pressure tmp rises as the operation continues the pressure remains constant in a continuous pressure mode but the flux decreases the deterioration of membrane performance is due to the fouling defined as the process resulting in loss of performance of a membrane due to the deposition of suspended or dissolved substances on its external surfaces at its pore openings or within its pores international union for pure and applied chemistry 1997 the deterioration is so severe that the membrane operation is stopped periodically for cleaning fouling and cleaning are two integral parts of the membrane operation that now can be appropriately described as a sequence of four stages normal operation fouling cleaning integrity test the deterioration in membrane performance can be due to two separate phenomena but only one of them is called fouling the other is the pre concentration of solutes near the membrane surface due to a preferential passage of a solvent through the membrane the retained solutes are located near the membrane surface but not attached to the membrane in any way they reduce solvent activity and thereby the flow a concentration polarization is a natural phenomenon that can be mitigated by transmembrane pressure tmp and flux conversely fouling is a phenomenon of attachment of solutes to the membrane that reduces the available membrane surface or blocks membrane pores two other forms of fouling are cake formation and gel formation the cake is formed when fouling layers are built upon each other in that case the leading fouling cause is the solute solute attachment in a matter of extreme concentration polarization specific macromolecules such as proteins can form a gel layer on top of a membrane surface several fouling control techniques including feed pre treatment 236 membrane surface modification 237 flow manipulation turbulence promotion back flushing and pulsing 238 chemical cleaning 239 vibration and crystallization and ultrasonic treatment 240 have been tried with variable degree of success several studies have demonstrated that gas bubbling is one of the most effective ways of controlling membrane fouling mainly in micro and ultrafiltration membranes the beneficial impact of bubbles on the membrane fouling was first reported by imasaka et al 241 in 1989 the authors injected the produced methane into a tubular ceramic membrane and reported a reduction in membrane fouling at a reasonable energy cost then cui and wright 242 reported a 175 enhancement in permeate flux for microfiltration of yeasts and a noticeable permeate flux enhancement for dextran and bsa a relatively low gas sparging rate can increase the permeate flux up to 138 243 while a further increase of the gas sparging rate showed a negative effect on the permeate flux the two phase flow was also used in the filtration of suspensions 244 skimmed milk 245 dextran and proteins 246 247 two phase flows are widely applied in mbrs and submerged membrane systems 21 248 in mbrs aeration supplies oxygen to biomass inside the reactor and reduces membrane fouling by air sparging the introduction of bubbles has been reported to improve the permeate flux by 43 249 and the critical flux by up to 1 7 times 250 the energy cost of the air sparging with coarse air bubbles varies between 35 2 251 and 50 252 of the total energy demand of an mbr leaving the significant potential for optimization according to zhang et al 253 254 and radaei et al 255 the average cost of aeration energy is 2 07 kwh m3 which can be reduced to 1 41 kwh m3 by periodic slug bubbling during mbr operation a recently reported approach of forming air slugs by coalescence of macrobubbles released from four neighbor diffusers can save up to 53 of the energy compared to the traditional commercial mbr 256 the mechanism of fouling minimization depends on the bubble size macrobubbles and air slugs are implemented in mbrs to shake hollow membrane fibers ellipsoidal or spherical capped macrobubbles generate vortex rings and local eddies in the wake region formed as they are ascending through mbr 257 those rings and eddies promote local circulation and resuspension of the fouling layer followed by the back diffusion of foulants to the bulk 242 244 246 247 258 259 the promotion of slug flow in mbrs 259 260 is achieved by intentionally avoiding the sparger type of diffusers instead of using a t or solenoid valve to introduce the gas stream 261 262 every slug must sweep over the membrane surface on its way up and shake the membrane via the leonardo s paradox microbubbles are spherical and persistent in dispersion they spread evenly over the bulk and contact with the foulants to form a bubble foulants flock ahead of the foulant membrane contact these flocks are later removed from the feed side of a membrane during a periodical hydraulic wash nanobubbles form in large numbers per unit air volume and develop a cake layer near the membrane surface the cake is persistent due to the low rising velocity of the nanobubbles and continuously improves filtration efficiency due to adsorption of incoming impurities to the bubbles and to the previously retained molecules such a cake will have a lower density due to the presence of air bubbles and a higher overall volume thus the introduction of nanobubbles substitutes the fouling by cake formation during concentration polarization 212 263 the formed cake is reduced during a periodical backwash fig 14 depicts possible retention mechanisms for micro and nanobubbles in flat membranes some initial indication that tiny bubbles can be equally efficient in fouling mitigation can be obtained in the works of bérubé 264 265 who continuously reported that both large and small pulse bubbles were similarly effective at controlling hydraulically reversible fouling the reason is that at a given sparging rate a larger number of tiny bubbles per the same sparging flow results in a higher number of shear events induced onto the membrane surface unfortunately most studies used full scale setups and reported bubble sizes using a volumetric approximation further research is needed to investigate the effect of micro and nanobubbles having an exact size on fouling mitigation an additional pile of research is required to evaluate the impact of mnbs on oxygen saturation in municipal mbrs the current trend is to use a periodical shaking of immersed fibers with large air slugs the use of slugs can effectively release fouling and reduce the cost of mbr treatment but not saturate the bulk with oxygen a combination of periodic air slugs with a constant supply of mnbs will comprehend the goals of air bubbling in mbrs another way to use micro and nanobubbles to mitigate the membrane fouling is during a chemical cleaning of fouled membranes the cleaning is usually performed by soaking the membrane in concentrated cleaning chemicals 236 239 a more economical and efficient way of delivering chemicals to a fouled membrane is by micro bubbles targeting foulants with a high concentration of cleaning chemicals the approach has been tried on ro membranes and demonstrated that a combination of microbubbles generated in situ with specially formulated chemicals enhanced the performance of a cleaned membrane an averaged 20 improvement in permeate flux and 2 higher salt rejection were reported 266 in addition after a chemical cleaning the membrane can be mechanically scoured by the water air flow in dead end ultrafiltration pilot experiments with an injection of air in the feed flow during a forward flush cleaning show that a combined water air flow can improve the membrane performance 267 a commercial setup called the airflush showed that a forward flush cleaning with an air water flow significantly reduces chemical consumption results in a higher and more stable flux and increases overall system recovery optimal bubble size in the chemical cleaning of fouled membranes is still under dispute the experiments were performed with commercially available diffusers that can produce bubbles in mm sizes experiments with these bubbles provided controversial results some studies suggest that these large bubbles are efficient for membrane scouring purposes but that more bubbles are needed to cover the entire membrane surface others argued that tiny bubbles would completely cover the membrane surface the generation of little bubbles is also a more energy efficient process due to a direct dependence of pump power on air bubble size for example kubota released a new membrane frame sp400 with a diffuser that generates 3 mm bubbles the company claims that the new smaller bubbles are better distributed between membrane panels and scour membranes more efficiently than previously used 6 10 mm bubbles therefore the optimum bubble size is a matter of a compromise between the scouring effect and energy cost the generation of tiny bubbles is a less energy demanding process recently several researchers implemented mnbs to improve the performance of ro systems according to 268 co application of microbubbles and a coagulant can reduce the colloidal fouling potential more efficiently than other options rezvani mahmouee et al 269 reported that adding mnbs to the feed of ro membranes that treat brackish water improved the permeate flux by 14 and salt rejection by 1 6 7 conclusions bubble size bubble velocity oxygen mass transfer rate application of air bubbles in biological wastewater treatment algae flotation impurities oxidation and mitigation of organic fouling in membrane separation were discussed in the review we conclude that 1 micro and nanobubbles mnbs hold the potential to improve several industrial scale processes including biofuel production chemical production and water wastewater treatment 2 the persistence of mnbs along with a high oxygen transfer rate calls for a potential re design of activated sludge treatment instead of large open tanks with significant energy demand the operation can be performed by circulating influents with supported biomass in pipes enriched with mnbs 3 mnbs can be incorporated in mbrs to increase the oxygen saturation when the air slugs are responsible only for fouling mitigation 4 better collision and adhesion of mnbs along with a higher lift of macrobubbles can significantly increase the efficiency of algae flotation and adjust the process for the retention of micropollutants 5 a deliberate generation of oh radicals for inactivation of pathogens and oxidation of micropollutants may start the movement away from chemical oxidants chlorine ozone currently employed to achieve water treatment goals 6 large investments in pilot scale studies are needed to fully

13025,air water micronanobubbles mnbs can be produced by four different methods and be used to improve 1 oxygen transfer in microbiological processes with high consumption rate 2 algae flotation 3 decomposition of organic compounds and 4 fouling mitigation in membranes the macrobubbles and slugs are currently implemented in the industry and mnbs are investigated in the labs the current review maps ways to explore the full potential of mnb flows through basic definitions state of the art analytical techniques bubble generation methods and implementation of engineering principles in water and wastewater treatment processes the future of air water flows is in the intentional integration of mnbs in industrial processes alongside macrobubbles and air slugs the most significant promise held by mnbs is in a conscious minimization of the role water treatment chemicals play in water treatment processes a deliberate generation of oh radicals for inactivation of pathogens and oxidation of micropollutants may start the movement away from chemical inactivation towards more sustainable water resources mitigation of membrane fouling without strong inorganic oxidants will prolong the life of polymer membranes better collision and adhesion of mnbs and higher lift of macrobubbles can significantly increase the efficiency of algae flotation reduce the use of flocculants and adjust the process for the physical removal of micropollutants higher oxygen transfer rates can improve the microbiological treatment and lower the necessity and load of further treatment stages keywords two phase flow gas water mix bubble technology microbubble nanobubble 1 introduction a new paradigm recently promulgated in european union green deal combines preservation of water resources with a reduced co2 footprint during water and wastewater treatment in other words a combination of zero water pollution with an absence of greenhouse net emissions calls for a better more efficient treatment of water of deteriorating quality at a significantly lower energy cost incorporating two phase air water flows is the way to achieve both goals in a single step other ways are the implementation of energy saving technologies the optimization and control over a treatment process and introducing renewable energy here energy saving technologies include energy efficient equipment such as high efficiency motors energy saving blowers energy saving diffusers energy saving sludge thickeners and energy saving sludge dewatering machines the optimization consists of developing control algorithms decision making models indexes for performance control and integrated measurement devices to support the optimization process finally the implementation of renewable energy includes incorporating solar wind and bio energy recently the european union has launched several large cross country projects to maximize energy recovery during wastewater treatment because wastewater contains potentially eight times the power needed to purify it 1 in all the above processes an integration of a bubble flow can reduce the energy demand and improve the efficiency of a treatment process gas liquid two phase flows are implemented in many areas including medicine 2 5 pharmacology 6 7 food and cosmetic manufacturing 8 9 oil transportation 10 steam generation 11 cooling systems 12 fire fighting devices 13 and water and wastewater treatment 14 16 two phase flow is a term in fluid mechanics that describes a flow of two immiscible phases i e gas liquid solid liquid or solid gas in water and wastewater treatment the gas liquid flows are used in flotation 17 ozonation 18 aeration 19 oxidation 20 filtration 21 and groundwater remediation 22 successful applications include air stripping of volatile organic compounds vocs 23 24 oxidation of iron manganese and sulfide 25 algae flotation 26 27 degradation of organic pollutants such as alachlor p nitrophenol rhodamine b 14 decolorization of colored wastewater by ozonation 28 treatment of oil in water emulsions 29 and backwash of rapid sand filters 30 several of the above applications act through the formation of reactive oxygen species thus promising to move away from chemical based oxidants such as chlorine and ozone with their potential carcinogenic by products 31 an additional advantage is a lowered chemical requirement and available technology that can help improving water treatment in both developed and developing countries 32 the abovementioned studies cover many applications and it is the right moment for systematization and evaluation of observed trends a little effort has been made to collect and prepare a well organized comprehensive report on the links between fundamental properties of gas bubbles and the effect of their implementation especially in water and wastewater treatment numerous recent trendy reviews on micro and nano bubbles 14 33 36 in water treatment lack a solid physical background or a clear coherent view on the engineering basics of water and wastewater treatment processes that is why despite a large volume of recent reviews on the topic we decided to update and catalog the available information 2 two phase flow this section provides a brief background to the critical features of water air two phase flow it is not intended to be a comprehensive review of this broad topic and where necessary references are given to the relevant texts on this subject this review describes only flow regimes characteristic flow patterns bubble size and shape in a stationary liquid bubble rising velocity and residence time a phase is a material with uniform chemical and homogeneous physical properties in space the term applies to a physical state solid liquid gas plasma and a presence of a clear border between two materials in the same physical state such as two immiscible liquid phases in fluid mechanics a simultaneous flow of two materials in different physical states or materials with other physical properties in the same state is defined as a two phase flow miscible components are a part of a phase but do not represent a separate phase a geometric distribution or topology of the phases can strongly affect the flow within each phase or component mass momentum and energy rates and processes across the phase interface 37 flow patterns have been initially defined by visual inspection of lab experiments with different volume fluxes volume fractions and fluid properties density viscosity surface tension 38 40 the results were often displayed as regime maps that identify the flow patterns as a function of component flow rates for given fluid properties hewitt 41 described three types of flow patterns dispersed separated and intermittent a dispersed flow contains many tiny fragments of one phase in another phase so the flow can be considered homogeneous in separated flows phases do not mix intermittent flows contain all the patterns between the abovementioned extremes when two phases are not distributed uniformly in bulk four main basic patterns have been identified visually 39 fig 1 shows the patterns that result from a simultaneous intermittent flow of gas and liquid inside a vertical tube annular or mist flow exists at high gas velocity and within the entire range of liquid velocities here superficial volumetric velocities of a gas j g m3 m2 s and a liquid j l m3 m2 s are defined as 1 j g q g s 2 j l q l s where q g and q l are the volumetric flow rates of gas and liquid respectively in m3 s and s is the cross sectional area of a vertical tube in m2 a gas phase is continuous and a liquid phase moves upward partly as a thin film adhered to a tube wall and partly in the form of dispersed droplets in a gas phase 42 a minimal velocity needed to lift the droplets is determined from the balance between the gravity and drag forces acting on the drop 39 churn flow appears at moderate gas velocities and within the entire range of liquid velocities the churn flow is a transitional flow regime with no distinct gas and fluid shapes if the tube size is not large enough for slug flow to develop 39 the turbulence induced by high velocities results in a wide bubble size distribution and a formation of giant bubbles due to coalescence an equilibrium between coalescence and breakup controls the mean bubble size the regime is of particular interest to the industry to enable high production rates and efficient operation slug flow is observed at low gas velocity and within the entire range of liquid velocities large taylor bubbles are formed due to coalescence and span over the whole cross section of the tub taylor bubbles move uniformly upward separated horizontally by liquid slugs that might themselves contain tiny gas bubbles the liquid phase is continuous and bridges opposite tube walls bubble flow is usually characterized by discrete gas bubbles in a continuous liquid phase it is the flow best described by its neighboring flow regimes the bubble flow is different from a dispersed flow in which a dispersed gas phase is distributed as a massive number of tiny bubbles and can be termed a homogeneous multiphase flow the transition from a dispersed to bubble flow is controlled by gas solubility pressure temperature salinity and ph of the solution it is seen when a dissolved gas appears as separate bubbles in the liquid phase the bubble flow is also different from a slug flow which can be viewed as a liquid film with a limited number of giant gas slugs thus the bubble flow contains a large yet limited number of uniformly dispersed distinguishable gas bubbles in a liquid film the regime exists when 0 01 jl 3 m3 m2 s and jg 0 1 m3 m2 s the bubble flow is characterized by uniform bubble size distribution and close to plug flow behavior in the gas phase as the bubbles rise in the column a transition from a bubble to slug churn and annular flow is triggered by progressively increasing gas superficial velocity a higher velocity increases the bubble number density and bubble size continuously expanding bubbles tend to agglomerate into slug bubbles and a continuous gas core towards the annular flow regime a transition from bubble to slug flow was observed in experiments with a gas volume fraction between 0 25 and 0 3 a slug to annular flow transition occurs when the gas volume fraction exceeds 0 75 39 43 44 the gas volume fraction α is defined as 3 α v g v g v l where v g and v l are the volumes of gas and liquid and v g nrt p at the same time the transition depends on many additional factors such as pressure surface tension turbulence presence of dissolved gases or impurities and local surface irregularities that can serve as cavitation sites and therefore are poorly predictable using physical mechanisms and universal dimensionless numbers initially the boundaries between flow regimes were defined experimentally in a two dimensional coordinate system and remained vague since then although a significant research effort was applied throughout the years 38 40 45 46 in some cases the flow is chaotic and its boundaries are hard to define for example a transition from slug to annular flow is accompanied by pressure variations resulting in flow instability and poor separation but an increased liquid velocity breaks large bubbles by turbulent fluctuations of fluid flow a better estimate of flow pattern through superficial velocities would improve the separation of particles with bubble flow and lifting droplets with annular flow 39 a better prediction of the lifting potential can be achieved through a simple estimate of raising velocity 3 characterization of the gas phase bubbles in a bubble flow are characterized by size and size distribution shape nature of their surface rising velocity and residence time all the features are interrelated and hence the characterization often starts from the size as the most basic simple and definitive characteristic the bubble size is also the most biased characteristic that changes depending on flow regime characteristics and design of a bubble column nature of liquid and gas and their velocities macro micro and nano bubbles hold different features to provide an intuitive sense of their possible behavior and intended application for instance large coarse or macro bubbles rapidly rise vertically towards the gas liquid interface and collapse 36 in a sense the macrobubbles are the real meaning behind latin homo bulla est main is a bubble the idea of a metaphor is that a person homo may look excellent and substantial but our life is as fleeting as a bubble bulla insubstantial and completely fragile for example arthur golding ca 1536 1605 says when man seemed to be at his best he is altogether nothing else but a bubble blown together of vanity 47 judging by that behavior the diameter of macrobubbles is between 100 μm and 10 mm bubbles larger than 10 mm usually form slugs and yet that definition is not detrimental in fermenters gas liquid reactors and ore flotation equipment the typical size of macrobubbles is between 2 and 5 mm in bubble columns 1 7 mm 48 in flotation 1 10 mm 27 microbubbles are smaller than macrobubbles and their size is between 1 and 100 μm 34 they spend hours in the reactor until they shrink and dissolve 49 50 for example 30 μm air bubbles stayed in the water for more than 100 h 51 possible reasons for the persistence are low rising velocity highly curved bubble shape large gas liquid interfacial area per unit bulk volume and a surface charge at the gas liquid interface the latter feature blocks bubble coalescence thus resulting in bubble kinetic stability over significant periods 52 53 that behavior was observed in bubbles less than 50 μm in diameter 49 less than 100 μm in diameter 54 55 and bubbles with diameters in the range of 10 60 μm 36 the nanobubbles attracted the scientific community s attention due to anticipated extraordinary properties and controversy between theoretical calculations and experimental evidence nanobubbles were first suggested in 1988 to explain the stronger than predicted attractive capillary forces between neutral hydrophobic surfaces in water 56 57 but then three theories were offered against their very existence according to epstein and plesset s theory of bubble dissolution and growth bubble lifetime depends on size and thus nanobubbles should have a lifetime of less than 0 02 s 58 59 another argument was related to surface tension expressed as a ratio of gibbs free energy to interfacial area differentials at constant temperature and pressure reducing the interfacial area decreases the system energy so the bubbles are driven to burst after rising or coalescing in water 58 finally according to laplace pressure bubble catastrophe theory small nanobubbles experience enormous internal pressure that inevitably leads to their rapid dissolution 53 60 calculated internal pressure in 100 nm air bubbles is 1 4 mpa and in 10 nm air bubbles are 14 mpa 61 and accordingly they should never exist 53 59 at that time and in the absence of experimental proofs the name and size of the nanobubbles vary significantly nano bubbles nano bubbles nanobubbles ultrafine bubbles submicron size bubbles 33 are the names of bubbles smaller than 200 nm 36 smaller than 1 μm 62 smaller than 100 nm 63 larger than 50 nm and smaller than 1 μm 64 early reports on the existence of bulk nanobubbles emerged after speculations on the presence of tiny gas species that serve as a nucleus for the growth of microbubbles during cavitation 65 66 the first experimental evidence on the existence of interfacial nanobubbles as bright stable spheres on a flat solid surface came six years later with the development of atomic force microscopy afm capable of detecting them 57 in 2010 replicas of nanobubbles were imaged with sem and in 2014 their zeta potential was measured for the first time now the international standard organization iso tc 281 defines nanobubbles as ultrafine bubbles with a diameter of less than 1 μm 34 although iso ts 80004 2 2015 assigns the prefix nano to objects with at least one dimension smaller than 100 nm opposite to the theoretical predictions nanobubbles do not dissolve away thus staying permanently in the system probably due to the presence of hard hydrogen bonds on the bubble water interface 64 and the repulsive interactions of electrically charge nanobubbles that prevent coalescence the dispersive interactions result in no or small concentration gradient between the phase interface and the bulk and extend stagnation times that can be as long as 15 days 53 for 150 200 nm bubbles 67 nanobubbles with diameter of less than 13 nm collapse in water in less than 1 min 68 another study reported stable bubbles in a solution for a few months without significant changes in their mean size concentration and surface charge 64 the bubble stability is increased by low rising velocity and dispersive electrostatic repulsion often nanobubbles with microbubbles form a dense cloud defined as micronanobubbles or mnbs 63 the size of mnbs is below 100 μm and they embrace the nano and micro bubbles the uniting base of the mnbs is the large total surface area low rising velocity extended residence time and high gas liquid transfer rate 69 studies of bubble shape were performed experimentally and theoretically in the last 40 years starting from a classical region map provided by bhaga and weber 70 the researchers conducted experiments on the rising of air bubbles in aqueous sugar solutions of different concentrations as a function of the bubble rising velocity u b the bubble diameter d a difference between the phase densities ρl ρg liquid

σ l is the surface tension at the air water interface 72 86 mn m at 20 c the nondimensional numbers characterize the flow regime that influenced the bubble shape according to bhaga and weber 70 bubbles can have spherical ellipsoidal and spherical cap shapes lately the shape list was extended to contain oblate ellipsoid skirt and toroidal bubbles fig 2 depicts typical bubble shapes in bubble flow bubbles are typically spherical unless influenced by constraints such as shear stresses during motion that assumption is not far from the truth due to a natural tendency of immersed bodies to reduce surface tension according to brennen 37 the surface tension acts at a gas liquid interface and tends to hold molecules together to prevent the formation of large bubbles the tension is linearly related to the bubble surface and with a minimal surface of a spherical shape it is easy to link the minimal surface tension to sphericity a bubble is considered spherical when the length of major and minor axes differs by less than 5 71 the major axis is the longest distance between two points of the projected bubble area and the minor axis is the longest distance perpendicular to the major axis it happens when either reynolds or bond numbers are low re 1 or bo 1 with a slight increase in reynolds number re 5 the bubble shape remains spherical for low bo numbers and flat or slightly dimpled for high bond numbers elliptic oblate ellipsoid shapes are observed with 5 re 20 or 0 5 bo 20 a spherical cap bubble is observed at re 100 skirt bubbles are formed at 50 re 200 and 100 bo 200 toroidal bubbles are observed at 100 re 200 and 100 bo 200 72 a bubble diameter d that appears in bo re and we is defined as the spherical equivalent diameter of the rotational volume of the projected bubble area the d is a single diameter in monodisperse flows an average between d 1 and d 2 in bidisperse flows or a number average mean size in polydisperse flows 42 8 d i 1 n d i f i i 1 n f i polydisperse flows are also characterized by sauter mean average diameter d 32 defined as the diameter of a sphere that has the same ratio of a total volume to a total surface area as the bubble of interest 9 d 32 i 1 n d i 3 f i i 1 n d i 2 f i where f i is the absolute frequency of a size represented by d i 42 the above size division into macro micro and nano bubbles can be useful to foresee their rising velocity and residence time a theoretical bubble rising velocity is derived from a balance of gravity f g buoyancy archimedes f f and drag forces f d acting on a single bubble after it starts to rise with a terminal rising velocity a drag force is an expression of fluid resistance to the uprising movement and it acts in the direction opposite to that of the vector of rising motion the first expression of a terminal rising velocity of a spherical bubble u b 73 in m s was developed under an assumption that a bubble diameter is less than 0 1 of a size of a reactor d w 0 1 w is the reactor width so a bubble movement is not influenced by the reactor nor by other bubbles 10 u b sp g ρ l ρ g d 2 6 μ l 1 μ g μ l 2 3 μ g μ l because for most liquid and gases μg μl and ρg ρl eq 10 becomes 11

the rising velocity of spherical and ellipsoid bubbles rises steeply with an increase in bubble size due to a power dependency on bubble cross section area d 2 indicating that tiny bubbles essentially behave as rigid spheres the rising velocity of spheroidal and spherical cap bubbles is proportional to d the rising velocity of a spherical bubble increases with increasing bubble size because buoyancy dominates over increased friction for this shape regime as the bubble shape changes to spheroidal the rising velocity decreases with increasing bubble size because increased friction becomes greater than increased buoyancy due to the flattening effect when a spheroidal bubble becomes too large it changes its shape at around 2 mm into a spherical cap and its rising velocity slightly increases with an increase in bubble size 80 the described behavior is typical for bubbles rising in a laminar flow bubbles rising in a highly turbulent fluid will exhibit a more complex behavior 81 bubbles leave a liquid because of a floating up to the liquid interface if the distance from a bubble to the interface is l the effective time of the bubble floating up is 16 τ b l u b or using a

from a residence time fig 4 compares bubble residence time as a function of size and shape the bubble residence time is a simple concept describing how much time a bubble resides inside the reactor it is the time difference between the time a bubble entered the reactor and floated up to burst at the air water interface however the residence time can often not be calculated from a terminal velocity large bubbles do not rise vertically straight but rather show spiraling zigzagging or rocking motion during their rise in water that has been known as the leonardo paradox after leonardo da vinci first observed it in the 1600s the paradox is the name given to a tendency of an initially asymmetric bubble under certain conditions for an unforeseen reason to adopt a spiral or zigzagging path rather than a straight one 83 gas bubbles will raise rectilinearly only when small and the reynolds number is low according to a later explanation the transition to a non rectilinear path is caused by an instability of the axisymmetric wake which becomes two threaded when the bubble is large enough to deform into a strongly oblate spheroid the two threads have opposite circulation and thus provide a lift force much like the trailing vortices of an airplane 84 a rising bubble may never display a steady terminal velocity even if it does the terminal velocity is not known a priori so bond and morton s numbers are better suited to describe the dynamics of rising bubbles than reynolds and weber s numbers which contain the terminal velocity 4 gas bubble generation bubble generation is considered a static or quasi static process the generated bubbles interact to coalescence and break up in a dynamic process here coalescence is a process of formation of giant bubbles from small ones the break up in the opposite forms tiny bubbles from a big one electrolytic hydrodynamical pressurization and acoustic forcing are the four main methods for generating gas water flows the diameter and uniformity of forming bubbles depend on injection conditions inner pressure the fluid properties surface tension viscosity density and the type of diffuser developed flows differ by four categories of parameters 1 the bubble size the smaller the better 2 the uniformity of bubble size the more uniform the better 3 the flexibility of the generator the capability to make gas bubbles of different sizes with one device the more significant the diapason the better and 4 the bubble flux the number of bubbles produced per unit of generator surface per unit of time the higher the better 4 1 electrolytic gas bubble generation electrolytic air water dispersions are generated by a direct current between two immersed electrodes as early as 1789 soon after discovering electricity deiman and van troostwijk discharged a current through two gold wires placed inside a tube with water 85 in 1800 nicholson and carlisle used a voltaic pile for water electrolysis 86 boost development of electrolysis came 100 years later after two essential discoveries the gases released by electrolysis are hydrogen and oxygen and the gas flux is related to the electrical current 87 more than 400 industrial water electrolysis units for the production of pure hydrogen existed in 1902 and in 1939 the first significant water electrolysis plant produced 10 000 nm3 h2 h 86 the generation of hydrogen to produce ammonia fertilizers and the low cost of hydroelectricity boosted the development of water electrolysis in the first half of the twentieth century a massive transfer to hydrocarbon energy where hydrogen is produced at a much lower cost through coal gasification and natural gas reforming impeded further technological development of water electrolysis 88 two recent advances in water electrolysis compact high pressure water electrolyzers to produce oxygen in autonomic life supporting systems such as nuclear powered submarines and the integration of renewable energies in new concepts such as photovoltaic electrolysis and steam electrolysis have little to do with gas water flows the essentials of a simple water electrolysis unit are depicted in fig 5 the unit consists of an anode and a cathode immersed in water and connected through an external power supply under a direct current applied to the unit positively charged hydrogen ions protons are reduced by electrons at a cathode to give hydrogen 18 2h 2e h 2 hydroxide ions move towards the anode to release electrons and form water and oxygen 19 2oh h 2 o 1 2o 2 2e the process results in small 45 180 μm hydrogen and oxygen bubbles and low gas flux the produced flows can be implemented in small up to 4 5 m3 h water treatment installations to treat colloidal light systems such as emulsified oils ions pigments ink and fibers the advantage of the electrolytic gas mixture is in a high clarity of treated water and the absence of chemicals the disadvantages of electrolytic generation of air water mixtures are low throughput the emission of hydrogen bubbles the cost of electrodes and voluminous sludge production 89 an additional drawback of the method is the periodic cleaning of electrodes due to organic and microbiological fouling 4 2 use of outer flow fields in gas bubble generation in a spiral or rotary 90 liquid flow generator the water is introduced into a vortex device through a side hole to induce tangential flow the gas bubbles are cut from a gas stream on a gas water junction by a centrifugal force imparted by a high speed rotating liquid typical gas liquid inlet flow ratio varies between 0 015 and 0 020 91 92 fig 6 depicts a typical vortex device where water is supplied through a side orifice and under pressure and gas is supplied from the center and at atmospheric pressure the mixture slowly rises in a vortex movement and finally reaches a separate reservoir similar or closely resembled devices can be found in 93 95 this type of generator has been known for a long time and its pros and cons are well known for example a generator of this type m2 lm was used to increase the growth rate of oysters in seawater near japan obtained bubble diameter ranged between 10 and 50 μm but the concentration of microbubbles was low 96 another type of mixture device is a venturi like tube used in two types of installations the first type produces macrobubbles by forwarding a pre saturated water flow through a tubule of a venturi tube 94 drastic changes in dynamic pressure just after the throat result in a collapse of air slugs and the formation of macrobubbles 53 94 97 99 the same device can form microbubbles by fragmentation of macrobubbles using turbulence 100 the only liquid is pressed through a venturi tube in the second type of installation the gas is sucked alongside the tube constriction through several small holes drilled along the pipe where the liquid pressure drops to its minimum 101 a 100 nm bubbles were reported when the air was sucked into oil 102 if the fluid pressure drops below the vapor pressure due to a high velocity inside the flow path the gas is re absorbed into the liquid stream without any additional action required 103 the required velocity can easily be estimated from bernoulli equation 20 p 1 2 ρ l j l 2 const where j l is a water flow velocity p is pressure and ρ l is a liquid density a negative pressure due to the flowing fluid occurs when j l exceeds 2 c ρ several reports suggested that the drop below the saturated vapor pressure results in cavities 104 107 quick recovery of the pressure above the vapor pressure values resulted in cavitation used to produce shock waves shear forces and chemical reactions with free oh radicals 14 4 3 pressurization bubble flow generation pressurization depressurization bubble generators exploit henry s law of partial pressure at constant temperature the solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid the bubbles are formed in two stages at the first stage water is saturated with gas at partial pressure significantly higher than atmospheric the difference can be up to 3 4 bars bubbles are formed at the second stage when the partial pressure drops back to atmospheric bubbles are formed through nucleation the homogeneous or de novo nucleation mechanism creates bubbles spontaneously within bulk water at 100 atm partial pressure 108 consequently homogeneous nucleation is not considered an essential mechanism in water and wastewater treatment heterogeneous nucleation considers the presence of pre existing gas pockets on a solid surface the supersaturated gas diffuses into gas pockets and forms bubbles that grow up to an eventual detachment the process can occur at any supersaturation level and is therefore considered the governing mechanism in water and wastewater treatment 109 dynamic non uniform pressure changes result in the formation of micro and nanobubbles simultaneously 67 110 the size and number of generated bubbles depend on the applied pressure difference 94 fig 7 depicts a possible mechanism of heterogeneous nucleation a vacuum dissolution is a variation of pressure dissolution the water is saturated with air at atmospheric pressure at the first step a vacuum that is later applied to a tank that contains the saturated water releases the air as tiny bubbles 30 90 μm although the generation of tiny bubbles with no added chemicals is an advantage of vacuum dissolution three significant drawbacks currently limit its use to the paper industry only vacuum dissolution is 1 a batch process that requires 2 sophisticated equipment to maintain the vacuum and releases 3 a limited number of air bubbles solution replacement requires a substrate and two liquids with different gas solubility when a solution with high gas solubility is replaced with a solution with low gas solubility excess gas forms bubbles on the substrate surface an application of ethanol water 1 12 at 35 c resulted in the generation of 100 200 nm nanobubbles at 4 108 bubbles ml concentration 111 pressure dissolution is currently the most widely used method for generating air water flows the technique is so simple that it has been used in mining engineering in the last 150 years crushed and ground rocks are mixed with water that is aerated with the help of perforated pipes the perforated pipes were changed over the years in coarse bubble diffusers to sprayers slotted tubes or valve orifices the released bulky air slugs rapidly float to the water air interface serving the primary goal of flotation in mine enrichment a fast separation of minerals the separation is achieved by adding surfactants that bond desirable minerals from a pulp to the air bubbles that float to a liquid air interface further refinement and enrichment of the minerals are performed at the interface a similar approach was tried in wastewater aeration in 1910 however a significant difference in density of ore minerals and bacteria along with a large bubble size resulted in the rapid rise of the bulky air slugs to the air water interface with little if any interaction with targeted microorganisms the embedded problem of coarse diffusers is a rule of thumb that the size of generated bubbles is an order of magnitude larger than the diameter of an orifice possible explanations include a force balance and a rapid coalescence of a bubble cloud 112 applying an oscillating flow can reduce the size difference between the pore and the resulting bubble 113 thus typically released bubble sizes are in a range of dozens and even hundreds of mm much larger than 40 180 μm bubbles released in electrolysis and outer flow field hence the bubble rise velocity is high and suitable for ore enrichment but not water wastewater treatment the latter requires much higher contact times due to limitations in the coagulant use the addition of chemicals is undesirable in water processes the formed flow is unstable and highly turbulent often a shift to slug flow fractures just formed fragile coagulant impurity air bubble flocks the oxygen transfer efficiency ote is very low and a search continued for a better more uniform spread of smaller air bubbles the bubble size reduction was achieved by mounting diffusers on top of perforated pipes in the form of discs tubes domes and plates fine bubble diffusers were made of sintered glass ceramic or metal 114 and were mounted or screwed into the diffuser header pipe the diffusers can supply 20 100 μm diameter bubbles using 30 40 less energy than coarse diffusers fine bubbles are much more efficient at transferring oxygen because they create a larger transfer surface area per unit of total volume it is easy to calculate that in the case of identical total air volume the ratio of total surfaces of two spherical bubbles is inversely proportional to their diameters for instance a drop in bubble diameters from 2 5 mm to 0 5 mm increases the total interfacial contact area between air and water by a factor of twenty five 115 as a result a shift from coarse bubbles of 6 13 mm to fine bubbles of 1 2 mm increased the ote from 0 025 per cm of pond depth to 0 065 116 the reason is that a bubble water oxygen exchange rate directly depends on the total bubble surface within a unit of bulk volume small bubbles contain the same air volume as the larger bubbles but their greater number significantly increases the total bubble surface available for oxygen transfer that simple consideration has been a leading push towards introducing fine diffusers that are currently considered state of the art in water wastewater treatment these diffusers are applicable and even desirable in ozonation due to a high gas hold up and high oxygen mass transfer coefficient 94 in aeration and flotation the obtained gain in process efficiency is modest in addition fine diffusers disperse bubbles with a large size distribution bubbles with 0 and 25 mm diameters are released simultaneously 117 an introduction of fine diffusers increased aerobic biodegradation of phenol 49 118 p xylene 119 pentachlorophenol 120 and tce 121 in addition to biodegradation the organics in wastewater are physically removed by flotation with small bubbles up to 75 of micro dispersed decane 95 of dissolved octane and 70 of ethylbenzene and toluene were removed in controlled flotation experiments with 60 100 μm microbubbles at an airflow rate of 3 33 cm3 s 122 a recent attempt to produce microbubbles with relatively narrow bubble size distribution is by gas injection through a membrane into a flowing continuous liquid phase containing a surfactant 123 the most significant advantage of this technique is that the resultant bubble size can be controlled by varying the membrane pore size previous attempts to release the gas into a stagnant liquid resulted in the generation of bubbles up to two orders of magnitude larger than the membrane pore diameter 113 123 124 for example bubbles released from a membrane surface with a 20 μm pore diameter 125 have a size of 500 μm 113 and may even merge before departing the membrane surface 126 the membranes can be made of silicon shirasu porous glass spg made of volcanic ash or metals silicone membranes are cost effective easy to set up and able to produce tiny microspheres close to a nanometre but have low mechanical strength thus making them susceptible to breaking under high pressure used to increase the bubble flow 127 metal membranes have high mechanical strength but large pore sizes usually over 20 μm 128 spg membranes have high mechanical strength and high pore uniformity but are relatively expensive compared to silicone and metal membranes and are easily contaminated by the dispersed flow because of their tortuous pore structure kukizaki and goto 123 produced microbubbles with a mean diameter of 360 720 nm by injecting air into 0 05 0 5 wt sodium dodecyl sulfate sds solution by forcing it through hydrophilic spg membranes with a mean pore diameter of 43 85 nm that typical order of magnitude size difference is due to a pore size distribution within the membrane structure and gas penetration through the largest pores in the membrane structure 112 4 4 acoustic forcing flow generation cavitation is the formation of vapor cavities in water because of a sudden pressure drop hydrodynamic cavitation or due to a passage of ultrasonic waves acoustic cavitation here cavities are any space within the liquid phase unoccupied by liquid molecules either empty or occupied by vapor 129 a momentum balance equation predicts that there is a downstream drop in static pressure when a fluid passes through a constriction tiny bubbles or vapor cavities are formed if the fall is below a critical value usually below the vapor pressure of water at a given temperature in a sort of local decompression pressurization recovery of the pressure results in imploding the cavities and formation of intense shock waves very high local energy density released at the imploding point can result in extremely high pressure and temperature in a range of 10 500 mpa and 1000 10 000 k respectively 130 because the waves are strong enough to damage moving parts cavitation is usually undesirable along with that cavitation can generate a highly reactive local radical wave usable for the treatment of organic impurities oxidation of unwanted organic compounds in wastewater by hydroxyl radicals oh was reported by 49 131 134 a release of free radicals from collapsing microbubbles is due to their charge a natural phenomenon that prescribes a higher concentration of ions near the bubble surface shrinkage of microbubbles results in the re concentration of ions near a narrowing bubble surface and creates a diffusion of ions from a diffusive layer into a water bulk however the diffusion rate is lower than the shrinking range the final bubble collapse results in generating hot spots with hundreds of atmospheres pressure thousands of degrees temperature and a concentrated ionic cloud the hot spot is a minimal area and the source of free radicals 51 which are the main reactive groups in the oxidative treatment of wastewater hydrodynamic cavitation was used to decompose pesticides and dyes 106 107 135 136 at present a lack of sufficient data prevents a more detailed explanation of the exact mechanism of radical generation from collapsing microbubbles 36 thus preventing the further development of that technology in addition microbubbles formed by hydrodynamic cavitation have a broad size distribution in acoustic cavitation the cavities are produced by sound waves passing through water bodies usually in ultrasound at higher than 16 khz frequency the waves are generated inside a bulk liquid with an ultrasonic probe 137 or outside with an external ultrasonic wave generator 138 cavities form when an acoustic wave produces high negative pressure periods that exceed an ambient hydrostatic pressure 139 the cavities grow uniformly in the solution or heterogeneously on hydrophobic surfaces and continuously accumulate sonic energy 140 in homogeneous nucleation the liquid ruptures because of a tensile strength that exceeds the intermolecular cohesion forces the required energy is typically much more significant than applied in practice the heterogeneous nucleation starts from tiny cracks on the surface of reactor walls or sonotrodes used for the cavitation the cracks are filled with gas and commonly termed gas pockets eventually the bubbles detach from the solid surface the detachment mechanism has been unclear so far the formed water vapor bubbles are smaller in diameter and have a narrowed bubble size distribution than air bubbles generated by hydrodynamic cavitation mean diameters of 400 700 nm 141 and 750 800 nm 62 are reported removing the ultrasonic field usually causes the collapse of vapor bubbles the entire process of generation growth and collapse of air bubbles occurs in milliseconds 104 the collapse of the bubbles forms hot spots with high pressure and temperature that promote the decomposition of air bubbles and the generation of highly reactive free radicals the acoustic cavitation was used to purify wastewater in numerous lab experiments 130 142 149 but hardly in full scale installations due to high operational costs and required expertise in chemical engineering material science and acoustics time 150 151 5 experimental determination of bubble properties 5 1 measurements of size and size distribution exact values of oxygen mass transfer coefficient bubble velocity and residence time require the knowledge of precise bubble size and bubble size distribution the latter is influenced by the internal parameters of a gas generator and the chemistry of a gas and a liquid for instance water chemistry temperature and ionic strength affect the bubble size in air water flow measurements of the bubble size can be performed with invasive and non invasive methods the former are based on an introduction of a probe for capillary suction 152 conductivity measurement 153 and light transmission with optical fibers 154 the non invasive methods are divided into optical including scattering photographic and holographic 155 158 electroresistive 159 and acoustic 160 162 among them optical microscopy is the simplest and the most direct method that has been widely used to measure 1 150 μm bubbles the approach suffers from a low automatization thus requiring slowly moving bubbles with no clustering that a human eye can hardly capture better high quality bubble images can be obtained by microphotography that combines a camera with a microscope fig 8 depicts microbubbles of various diameters obtained in a vortex device described in details in levitsky et al 95 as a function of applied air pressure a specific image processing software analyses the images the accuracy of the obtained results highly depends on the quality of the applied digital camera two main limitations of the technique are an obvious need for a transparent wall of a bubble container and a possibility of bubble clustering the camera is placed outside the bubble container and the pictures can only be taken through a transparent wall the possible clustering might change the results or make their interpretation difficult thus requiring photographing of dilute solutions only 155 meaningful results require a large number thousands of micrographs and their thorough time consuming analysis a static laser light scattering can measure bubbles of sizes 0 02 2000 μm a light screened through a bubble water mixture is scattered by the bubbles the intensity of the scattered light is detected by a photomultiplier tube and compared to the initial light intensity the relationship between the intensity and the bubble diameter varies with the size of the bubbles according to rayleigh scattering theory the scattered intensity is proportional to the sixth power of the bubble diameter if the bubble is significantly smaller than the wavelength of light 163 according to mie scattering theory a complex relation between scattered light intensity and bubble diameter exists when the diameter is close to the wavelength of light 164 finally the scattered intensity varies with the square of the bubble diameter when the bubbles are significantly larger than the wavelength of light 165 a dynamic light scattering can be used to determine the bubble diameter by its relative brownian motion bubble diameter is calculated from its translational diffusion coefficient using the stokes einstein equation that links the diameter absolute temperature of the bulk and water viscosity 166 the obtained diameter considers a water shell that forms around a moving bubble the accepted size is called a hydrodynamic diameter a diameter of a perfect sphere that moves in an electrolyte with a velocity like a velocity detected during the measurements usually displayed values are higher than a size of a real bubble one of the main problems in applying light scattering is in the presence of other objects that can scatter the light even in the form of nanodroplets nanoparticles or more significant impurities that can shield the bubbles 167 the electroresistivity method is based on electrophoresis through a separator with tiny pores the electrical resistance increases when a bubble passes through a pore according to tsuge 63 the number of bubbles and their size can be determined by resistivity the method can measure bubbles in a size range between 0 2 and 600 μm and at high concentrations however the results are less accurate and biased by the bubbles relative motion and behavior 159 acoustic methods are inverse methods that rely on the fact that bubbles strongly affect the propagation of acoustic waves the acoustical cross section is three to four orders of magnitude greater than the bubble s geometrical cross section 161 therefore the acoustic wave can be calibrated against the bubble population using either backscattering attenuation or dispersion the measurements can be performed rapidly and continuously even in opaque samples the sensor is placed outside the bubble container and the bubble motion does not bias the measurement acoustic techniques are relatively simple and applicable to much larger liquid samples the main problem in applying acoustic methods is a significant difference in the obtained results for instance the acoustic method overpredicts the bubble concentration by two orders of magnitude at small radii and underpredicts it significantly at large radii 168 an additional study reported an order of magnitude difference between the measurements performed by optical and acoustic methods 169 in general the size and size distribution of the formed bubbles change as a function of time due to collapse or coalescence and the initial detection is necessary but not critical 5 2 zeta potential of gas bubbles one of the essential properties of air bubbles is an electrical charge acquired through preferential adsorption of h or oh ions from water or electrolyte solutions at the water bubble interface the charge of a bubble is neutralized by counterions that form a separate diffusive layer of opposite charges two layers of opposite charges surround a bubble in a construct known as electric double layer edl the presence of edl does not allow the measurement of the surface charge of a bubble still it will enable us to estimate its value at a plane of shear 170 formed using electrophoresis an imposed bubble movement in an external electric field the obtained value known as zeta potential is characteristic of a surface charge of the bubble the ph and the ionic content of the electrolyte that surrounds it the zeta potential is calculated through the smoluchowski equation that links imposed bubble velocity to the strength of the imposing electric field electrophoretic light scattering els and laser doppler velocimetry are the most widely used techniques both methods calculate the zeta potential from the analysis of bubble velocity during electrophoresis table 1 provides the size and zeta potential of air bubbles in water at ph 7 the majority of the reported values are lower than 30 mv set as a threshold of air water mixture stability achieved through a mutual electrostatic repulsion of edls of contacting bubbles 64 negative zeta potential values of 45 mv 37 mv and 40 mv were observed for air nitrogen and oxygen bubbles respectively mixed in stagnant water 175 the reported point of zero charge pzc values are between 2 and 5 31 176 or even between 1 5 and 2 5 171 177 two explanations of the predominant negative charge of the bubbles in stagnant water 178 179 are preferential adsorption of oh ions on an air water interface and spatial orientation of polar water molecules on the shell of air bubbles the former explanation is based on the lower hydration energy of 489 kj mol of oh vs 1127 kj mol for h ion 171 180 the latter model assumes that partially positively charged oxygen atoms in a water molecule are positioned towards the gas phase and partially negatively charged hydrogen atoms turn towards the electrolyte both models are used to explain the prolonged residence time of micro and nanobubbles in an electrolyte through a mutual repulsion of strongly charged air bubbles 52 181 182 three earlier explanations were harvey nuclei bubbles existing in crevices of microscopic contamination particles or other achievable macroscopic surfaces 183 184 continuous formation of gas nuclei by cosmic radiation 185 and finally the concept of an organic skin 66 185 which is similar to the concept of contamination 186 188 according to the theory the bubble surface is completely covered by organic matter or surfactant this organic skin prevents the dissolution from the bubble s interior to the surrounding liquid none of the theories is universal yet each explains some results an additional obstacle to developing a more general profound understanding of the extended stability of air bubbles in liquids is the complexity in the experimental setups and an unconventional interpretation of obtained results 6 application of air bubbles in water and wastewater treatment the air is almost the ultimate component in gas liquid flows used for water and wastewater treatment rare exemptions are pure oxygen and co2 used in setups where their presence is economically and technologically justified the air is abundant and contains precisely the same elements including oxygen treatment processes based on air water mixtures include flotation aeration disinfection filtration and advanced oxidation the addition of air helps to downsize the treatment facility to reduce the operation time to reduce the operational expenses and at the same time increase the treatment efficiency in several applications the introduction of air serves several purposes at once as in the case of conventional activated sludge 6 1 conventional activated sludge typical sewage treatment is performed by a three stage operation that aims at reducing organic and microbiological loads to bearable levels so the effluents can be safely released into the environment or reused the aerobic treatment decreases organic and microbiological loads and the anaerobic treatment reduces nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations the aerobic treatment is accomplished by aerobic bacteria confined in reactors that vary by the air supply configuration popular configurations are aerated lagoons trickling filters constructed wetlands membrane bioreactors mbrs and conventional activated sludge cas the latter are intensified reactors featuring high bacterial loads and relatively short hydraulic residence time the reactor efficiency and decomposition rate depend on an instant supply of dissolved oxygen do constantly consumed by the bacteria as they decompose the organics air is a common source of do mainly due to its abundance and reasonable pumping cost oxygen is poorly soluble in water and typical saturation levels are between 8 at 27 c and 10 at 15 c mg l a massive decay of aerobic bacteria occurs at critically low levels below 2 mg l do concentration drops fast in intensified aerobic processes so a simple mutual exposure of extensive air and water surfaces is not an option available options include surface and subsurface aeration the operation applied to increase or maintain the oxygen concentration in natural and artificial aquatic environments in wastewater treatment the aeration also mixes the entire sludge and lifts the organics the surface aeration implies an operation of a mechanical device such as an impeller an aerator or a fountain however the power required to increase the oxygen supply increases with the impeller rate to the third power and the impeller diameter to the fifth power making the surface aeration prohibitively expensive at a commercial rate 189 the subsurface aeration implies intensive air pumping in bubbles or slugs into the reactor to induce do dissolution and diffusion fig 9 shows a qualitative scheme of a typical wastewater treatment plant with the average energy intensity of different stages typical sewage treatment is a three stage operation with core secondary aerobic and anaerobic stages the primary stage includes wastewater collection and pumping screening grit removal and sedimentation in a primary sedimentation tank except for wastewater pumping primary treatment requires low energy average energy demand is between 0 02 and 0 1 kwh m3 in canada between 0 045 and 0 14 kwh m3 in hungary and between 0 1 and 0 37 kwh m3 in australia 190 192 and even that level can be lowered using compact separation processes such as lamella settler floc blanket settler micro sand ballasted lamella settler 193 the tertiary treatment in the form of chlorination or sand filtration requires an additional 0 2 kwh m3 for the filtration only or up to 0 5 kwh m3 for the entire coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration tray chlorination has a relatively low energy demand between 2 10 5 and 2 10 3 kwh m3 194 the secondary treatment with aeration and sludge pumping is the biggest energy consumer the average demand is 0 46 kwh m3 in australia 0 27 kwh m3 in china 0 47 kwh m3 in us and 0 30 1 89 kwh m3 in japan 195 between 45 and 75 of the plant s total energy demand or between 0 45 and 0 8 kwh per m3 of treated influents 196 197 is spent on aeration 198 and yet cas is not the most energy demanding consumer in mbr for example the aeration consumes between 70 and 80 of the total energy being spent on both a biological degradation of organics and on membrane scouring 194 largely due to the aeration wastewater treatment consumes 1 2 of the united states annual energy demand 31 no wonder the aeration is under constant inspection for better performance and lower energy demand aeration efficiency is tested by standard parameters such as oxygen transfer rate otr and standard aeration efficiency sae here otr kg o2 h is defined as 21 otr k l a do d o sat v l where k l a is the mass transfer coefficient 1 h do is the dissolved oxygen in water kg o2 m3 dosat is the dissolved oxygen in water at saturation kg o2 m3 and v l is the volume m3 of sewage treatment reactor sae kg o2 kwh is 22 sae otr p where p is the power drawn by the aeration system kw the basic demands of aeration systems are high otr and sae i e more oxygen transferred into the mixture at low energy demand thus less air should be supplied to a reactor to ensure the concentration required in the process the oxygen is typically supplied from the air the aeration with high purity oxygen is much less common typical surface aerators shear the liquid into tiny droplets and throw them into the air the droplets increase their oxygen content to at least half saturation during contact with the atmosphere the oxygen diffuses back to the sludge body after the droplets return the mixing is due to the production of droplets low speed aerators have an sae of 1 5 2 1 kg o2 kwh and high speed aerators have an sae of 0 9 1 3 kg o2 kwh the aerators require shallow tanks up to 3 5 m depth and are characterized by the high energy demand of up to 0 7 kwh m3 of raw wastewater additional surface aerators such as fountains and floating devices are used in the aeration of natural water bodies aerated lagoons and basins subsurface aerators release oxygen or air bubbles from the bottom of a reactor the bubbles rise through the reactor to the air water interface exchanging the oxygen on their way and mixing the entire sludge the simplest subsurface aerator is subsurface aquatic plants through the natural process of photosynthesis the plants release oxygen into the water albeit at a low rate a higher rate requires implementing engineering devices such as diffusers that blow compressed air via pipes landed at the bottom of a reactor to the diffusers that release them to the reactor here the efficiency of a subsurface aeration device is evaluated through the oxygen transfer efficiency ote defined as 23 ote o 2 in o 2 out o 2 in where o2 in and o2 out are the mass fluxes of oxygen in and out of a clean water volume ote provides an absolute efficiency of aeration with no blower specifications more conveniently and uniformly a separate specification of ote and blower efficiency simplifies a design of an aeration system a typical measurement is performed in deionized water with no dissolved oxygen at 20 c and 1 atm pressure and reported as standard oxygen transfer efficiency sote a transition from standard to process conditions requires an introduction of an empirical factor α defined as 24 α αsote sote where sote is an oxygen transfer rate at standard conditions and αsote is oxygen transfer efficiency at process conditions with no effect of contamination the sote is influenced by bubble size and its rising velocity that depends on densities ρ l and ρ g dynamic viscosities μ l and μ g and superficial velocities j l and j g of its liquid l and gas g components these parameters are not independent but intrinsically linked and influence each other typical fine bubble diffusers produce 5 10 mm bubbles achieving 30 sote 4 5 m above the diffusers located at the bottom of bioreactors 199 200 the bubbles rapidly rise throughout the reactor and at the same time intensively exchange oxygen with the surrounding liquid still the aeration efficiency is limited by 1 oxygen transfer rate from gas to liquid and 2 uptake rate of microbes 31 but suppose the bubble triple function can be sub divided into mixing and lifting on one side and oxygen mass transfer rate on another in that case introducing micro and nanobubbles can improve the transfer rate for example an introduction of 50 60 μm microbubbles 201 doubled the k l a value and half life t ½ 202 thus either increasing the treatment efficiency or reducing the dimensions of the treatment vessel increased oxygen concentration and mass productivity were the positive effects of microbubble aeration in the fermentation of trichoderma reesei 203 the aeration with microbubbles resulted in two times higher leaf lettuce dry weight than macrobubbles 204 a 125 times higher oxygen mass transfer rate in groundwater with micronanobubbles resulted in 16 times higher dissolved oxygen concentration 205 a higher subsurface concentration of dissolved oxygen can predictably facilitate the aerobic biodegradation of contaminated groundwater an unexpected secondary positive effect of implementing micronanobubbles was found when cholesterol personal care products and endocrine disruptors were transferred to aerosols generated above the surface of conventional aeration basins 206 207 an unexpectedly positive effect of introducing micro and nano bubbles that have no lifting power is in the bridging of the impurities through the bubbles and a branched structure formation 110 a specific density of the construct reduces until it floats if the presence of microbubble and nanobubble can have such a detrimental effect on the efficiency of wastewater treatment fig 10 depicts a potentially new concept of mbr with a fast circulation of influent through a venturi type reactor no large open tanks are needed the bioreactor will be in the form of a pipe and will be supplied with persistent mnbs that will constantly float in bulk large bioreactors mechanical or pneumatic mixture will be exchanged with biofilms grown on carrier media one example of the media is aqwise biomass carrier a highly porous plastic carrier developed by an israeli company aqwise yet despite the consensus regarding the positive effect of micronanobubbles on gas transfer efficiency and potential additional beneficial reactions the long time impact of the suggested approach will only be answered using long pilot tests with natural wastewater of different qualities the majority of the publications use ultrapure water that likely influences bubble size and oxygen mass transfer coefficient k l a 6 2 flotation the earliest attempt to use flotation as a separation technique dates back to a british patent issued in 1860 208 the patented technology was based on the addition of oil to water the specific density of oil is lower than that of water and thus oil droplets that float over a water surface can accumulate and lift impurities attached to oil droplets the essence of flotation has not changed for more than 150 years flotation is the technology that uses the low specific gravity of a lifting substance and its ability to accumulate other impurities on its way up what has changed are the materials being used for the lifting the flotation is now performed with air bubbles that are either dissolved in water as in dissolved air flotation daf dispersed in water as in dispersed air flotation diaf or generated by electro coagulation as in efc in daf a part of the water is supersaturated with air under 400 kpa pressure and reintroduced into the flotation cell 209 the atmospheric pressure in the cell transfers dissolved air into dispersed bubbles of 10 120 μm diameter 27 210 the bubbles collect the impurities and float them to the surface of a tank where they are skimmed off the diaf forces air through shirasu porous glass spg into the water to produce bubbles with a large 75 to 655 μm size range 211 the efc uses water electrolysis to produce h2 and o2 bubbles of 22 50 μm diameter 212 flotation s separation of algae and cyanobacteria from water 213 215 is an excellent example of a well accepted technology that compares favorably against other technologies including coagulation sedimentation centrifugation and granular and membrane filtration the process cost is low the technology is robust and the separation efficiency is between 90 and 99 26 27 despite the low algae density and an order of magnitude size difference between algae and microbubbles typical algae hydrodynamic diameter is between 5 and 7 μm 216 and the reported bubbles have a 100 120 μm diameter 217 at present more than 50 plants based on flotation technology are in operation or under construction in scandinavian countries and the united kingdom alone the flotation efficiency depends on the efficiency of three sub processes of collision adhesion and lift of a stabilized alga bubble floc 218 the general aggregation rate can be expressed as 25 n ab α ab β ab n a n b where n ab is the rate of attachment between algae a and a bubble b α ab is the adhesion efficiency factor β ab is the collision efficiency factor n a is the concentration of algae and n b is the concentration of bubbles the probability of adhesion α ab depends on the electrostatic and hydrophobic characteristics of a bubble and an alga and can obtain values between 0 and 1 the adhesion probability is estimated as a ratio of the rate at which a bubble and algae form a floc to the rate at which a bubble and an alga collide under favorable coagulation conditions α ab values between 0 5 and 1 provide fairly reasonable agreement with the available experimental data 219 when the energy barrier is lower than the energy of motion k b t the adhesion probability equals 1 220 a probability of collision is defined as a ratio of the rate at which an air bubble strikes an alga to the rate at which a bubble flows towards an alga unlike the adhesion probability the collision probability can be calculated based on the separate effects of brownian motion differential flotation and an interception the impact of differential flotation is due to a density difference between air bubbles and particles the bubbles bump into the particles on their way up the interception is due to the action of a moving fluid that brings particles and bubbles into collision as they move along the fluid streamlines fig 11 shows the three mechanisms schematically the collision frequency function due to brownian motion is 26 β ab br 2 3 k b t μ l d a d b 2 d a d b where k b is boltzmann constant t is absolute temperature μ l is a dynamic liquid viscosity and d a and d b are the diameters of an alga and an air bubble the collision frequency due to a differential flotation is 221 27 β ab df π 4 d a d b 2 u b sp u a where u b sp and u a are the rising velocities of a bubble and an alga respectively a collision frequency due to interception mechanical mixing is calculated based on the saffman turner relation 222 28 β ab sh π 4 ε d a d b 3 where ε is a turbulent dissipation rate estimated based on k epsilon model at the inlet to the flotation tank 223 29 ε 0 1642 k l here l 0 07 lc k 3 2 ul and l c is the length of the inlet contact zone a total collision frequency is a superposition of three parallel collision mechanisms 30 β ab tot β ab br β ab df β ab sh fig 12 details the collision frequency function between an alga and a bubble as a function of bubble diameter previous models 221 224 neglected the effect of brownian motion of air bubbles on the collision efficiency claiming that only differential flotation and turbulence are essential according to our calculations the brownian motion is crucial and the single most significant collision mechanism for the bubbles up to 1 10 μm the total collision probability coincides with a probability due to a differential flotation at bubble sizes larger than 1 10 μm the collision due to the interception is less critical a minimal collision probability is for particles of 100 nm size as was previously reported by reay and ratcliff 225 for small impurities the influence of brownian motion is extended towards 10 mm suggesting that the process efficiency heavily relies on bubble size 219 specifically the collision probability between bubbles and impurities due to the interception is more influential when the bubble diameter is the same size as the impurities themselves a large body of experimental evidence confirms that tiny bubbles have a higher collision efficiency than large bubbles 226 227 according to 228 229 an anticipated increase of collision efficiency varies between d a d b and d a d b 2 as a function of reynolds number and bubble contamination level the average hydrodynamic diameter of an alga is between 5 and 7 μm and the possibility of generating air bubbles of the same size range is of paramount importance for process efficiency 216 micro and nanobubbles can disperse in the whole volume of the flotation tank and reach places that cannot be reached by bigger bubbles 230 231 the smaller the bubble diameter the higher the number of bubbles adhering to an impurity the initial adhesion probability is low but can be increased by deliberately changing the bubble charge gas bubbles are typically negatively charged in water but their charge can be reversed by the addition of multivalent cations 177 232 cationic surfactants 62 233 or colloidal gas aprons cgas 234 235 micro and nanobubbles perform better on the collision and adhesion but fail to quickly transfer the algae to the upper edge of the flotation tank for algae removal initially long flotation times of mnbs turn even longer when bubbles capture an alga thus increasing the floc density and reducing the density difference between a floc and surrounding water a lifting force of mnbs becomes critically low to ensure process selectivity opposite to the previous suggestions 34 138 mnbs should not replace the macrobubbles but comprehend them fig 13 depicts an optimized approach to flotation the combination of micro and nanobubbles with macrobubbles will improve froth flotation efficiency the mnbs have a higher charge due to their small size higher hydrophobicity and lower rising velocity all that increases not only the collision but also the adhesion probability an intermediate flock of an impurity surrounded by mnbs can easily promote an aggregation into a larger flock with a macrobubble thus significantly increasing the rising velocity the entrance and entrapment of mnbs in already formed flocs reduce their apparent density and increase rising velocity the presence of multiple contact points between the impurity the mnbs and the macrobubble reduces the probability of bubble detachment 6 3 mitigation of fouling in membrane filtration a membrane is a semi permeable active or passive barrier that permits the passage of one or more components in the initial mix while limiting the passage of others although graham 1848 used a sort of membrane in the development of diffusion law and although the first membranes were synthesized more than a century ago development and implementation of membranes evolved into a scientific discipline during the second half of the 20th century since the 1970s membranes have been the most investigated separation method widely implemented in many industries today with an unstable cost of fossil fuels membranes with modest energy demands and small footprint become even more attractive they are often compared favorably to other separation processes such as distillation adsorption granular filtration extraction or crystallization a membrane can be operated in either constant flux or constant pressure mode in a continuous flux mode the flux through the membrane remains constant but the transmembrane pressure tmp rises as the operation continues the pressure remains constant in a continuous pressure mode but the flux decreases the deterioration of membrane performance is due to the fouling defined as the process resulting in loss of performance of a membrane due to the deposition of suspended or dissolved substances on its external surfaces at its pore openings or within its pores international union for pure and applied chemistry 1997 the deterioration is so severe that the membrane operation is stopped periodically for cleaning fouling and cleaning are two integral parts of the membrane operation that now can be appropriately described as a sequence of four stages normal operation fouling cleaning integrity test the deterioration in membrane performance can be due to two separate phenomena but only one of them is called fouling the other is the pre concentration of solutes near the membrane surface due to a preferential passage of a solvent through the membrane the retained solutes are located near the membrane surface but not attached to the membrane in any way they reduce solvent activity and thereby the flow a concentration polarization is a natural phenomenon that can be mitigated by transmembrane pressure tmp and flux conversely fouling is a phenomenon of attachment of solutes to the membrane that reduces the available membrane surface or blocks membrane pores two other forms of fouling are cake formation and gel formation the cake is formed when fouling layers are built upon each other in that case the leading fouling cause is the solute solute attachment in a matter of extreme concentration polarization specific macromolecules such as proteins can form a gel layer on top of a membrane surface several fouling control techniques including feed pre treatment 236 membrane surface modification 237 flow manipulation turbulence promotion back flushing and pulsing 238 chemical cleaning 239 vibration and crystallization and ultrasonic treatment 240 have been tried with variable degree of success several studies have demonstrated that gas bubbling is one of the most effective ways of controlling membrane fouling mainly in micro and ultrafiltration membranes the beneficial impact of bubbles on the membrane fouling was first reported by imasaka et al 241 in 1989 the authors injected the produced methane into a tubular ceramic membrane and reported a reduction in membrane fouling at a reasonable energy cost then cui and wright 242 reported a 175 enhancement in permeate flux for microfiltration of yeasts and a noticeable permeate flux enhancement for dextran and bsa a relatively low gas sparging rate can increase the permeate flux up to 138 243 while a further increase of the gas sparging rate showed a negative effect on the permeate flux the two phase flow was also used in the filtration of suspensions 244 skimmed milk 245 dextran and proteins 246 247 two phase flows are widely applied in mbrs and submerged membrane systems 21 248 in mbrs aeration supplies oxygen to biomass inside the reactor and reduces membrane fouling by air sparging the introduction of bubbles has been reported to improve the permeate flux by 43 249 and the critical flux by up to 1 7 times 250 the energy cost of the air sparging with coarse air bubbles varies between 35 2 251 and 50 252 of the total energy demand of an mbr leaving the significant potential for optimization according to zhang et al 253 254 and radaei et al 255 the average cost of aeration energy is 2 07 kwh m3 which can be reduced to 1 41 kwh m3 by periodic slug bubbling during mbr operation a recently reported approach of forming air slugs by coalescence of macrobubbles released from four neighbor diffusers can save up to 53 of the energy compared to the traditional commercial mbr 256 the mechanism of fouling minimization depends on the bubble size macrobubbles and air slugs are implemented in mbrs to shake hollow membrane fibers ellipsoidal or spherical capped macrobubbles generate vortex rings and local eddies in the wake region formed as they are ascending through mbr 257 those rings and eddies promote local circulation and resuspension of the fouling layer followed by the back diffusion of foulants to the bulk 242 244 246 247 258 259 the promotion of slug flow in mbrs 259 260 is achieved by intentionally avoiding the sparger type of diffusers instead of using a t or solenoid valve to introduce the gas stream 261 262 every slug must sweep over the membrane surface on its way up and shake the membrane via the leonardo s paradox microbubbles are spherical and persistent in dispersion they spread evenly over the bulk and contact with the foulants to form a bubble foulants flock ahead of the foulant membrane contact these flocks are later removed from the feed side of a membrane during a periodical hydraulic wash nanobubbles form in large numbers per unit air volume and develop a cake layer near the membrane surface the cake is persistent due to the low rising velocity of the nanobubbles and continuously improves filtration efficiency due to adsorption of incoming impurities to the bubbles and to the previously retained molecules such a cake will have a lower density due to the presence of air bubbles and a higher overall volume thus the introduction of nanobubbles substitutes the fouling by cake formation during concentration polarization 212 263 the formed cake is reduced during a periodical backwash fig 14 depicts possible retention mechanisms for micro and nanobubbles in flat membranes some initial indication that tiny bubbles can be equally efficient in fouling mitigation can be obtained in the works of bérubé 264 265 who continuously reported that both large and small pulse bubbles were similarly effective at controlling hydraulically reversible fouling the reason is that at a given sparging rate a larger number of tiny bubbles per the same sparging flow results in a higher number of shear events induced onto the membrane surface unfortunately most studies used full scale setups and reported bubble sizes using a volumetric approximation further research is needed to investigate the effect of micro and nanobubbles having an exact size on fouling mitigation an additional pile of research is required to evaluate the impact of mnbs on oxygen saturation in municipal mbrs the current trend is to use a periodical shaking of immersed fibers with large air slugs the use of slugs can effectively release fouling and reduce the cost of mbr treatment but not saturate the bulk with oxygen a combination of periodic air slugs with a constant supply of mnbs will comprehend the goals of air bubbling in mbrs another way to use micro and nanobubbles to mitigate the membrane fouling is during a chemical cleaning of fouled membranes the cleaning is usually performed by soaking the membrane in concentrated cleaning chemicals 236 239 a more economical and efficient way of delivering chemicals to a fouled membrane is by micro bubbles targeting foulants with a high concentration of cleaning chemicals the approach has been tried on ro membranes and demonstrated that a combination of microbubbles generated in situ with specially formulated chemicals enhanced the performance of a cleaned membrane an averaged 20 improvement in permeate flux and 2 higher salt rejection were reported 266 in addition after a chemical cleaning the membrane can be mechanically scoured by the water air flow in dead end ultrafiltration pilot experiments with an injection of air in the feed flow during a forward flush cleaning show that a combined water air flow can improve the membrane performance 267 a commercial setup called the airflush showed that a forward flush cleaning with an air water flow significantly reduces chemical consumption results in a higher and more stable flux and increases overall system recovery optimal bubble size in the chemical cleaning of fouled membranes is still under dispute the experiments were performed with commercially available diffusers that can produce bubbles in mm sizes experiments with these bubbles provided controversial results some studies suggest that these large bubbles are efficient for membrane scouring purposes but that more bubbles are needed to cover the entire membrane surface others argued that tiny bubbles would completely cover the membrane surface the generation of little bubbles is also a more energy efficient process due to a direct dependence of pump power on air bubble size for example kubota released a new membrane frame sp400 with a diffuser that generates 3 mm bubbles the company claims that the new smaller bubbles are better distributed between membrane panels and scour membranes more efficiently than previously used 6 10 mm bubbles therefore the optimum bubble size is a matter of a compromise between the scouring effect and energy cost the generation of tiny bubbles is a less energy demanding process recently several researchers implemented mnbs to improve the performance of ro systems according to 268 co application of microbubbles and a coagulant can reduce the colloidal fouling potential more efficiently than other options rezvani mahmouee et al 269 reported that adding mnbs to the feed of ro membranes that treat brackish water improved the permeate flux by 14 and salt rejection by 1 6 7 conclusions bubble size bubble velocity oxygen mass transfer rate application of air bubbles in biological wastewater treatment algae flotation impurities oxidation and mitigation of organic fouling in membrane separation were discussed in the review we conclude that 1 micro and nanobubbles mnbs hold the potential to improve several industrial scale processes including biofuel production chemical production and water wastewater treatment 2 the persistence of mnbs along with a high oxygen transfer rate calls for a potential re design of activated sludge treatment instead of large open tanks with significant energy demand the operation can be performed by circulating influents with supported biomass in pipes enriched with mnbs 3 mnbs can be incorporated in mbrs to increase the oxygen saturation when the air slugs are responsible only for fouling mitigation 4 better collision and adhesion of mnbs along with a higher lift of macrobubbles can significantly increase the efficiency of algae flotation and adjust the process for the retention of micropollutants 5 a deliberate generation of oh radicals for inactivation of pathogens and oxidation of micropollutants may start the movement away from chemical oxidants chlorine ozone currently employed to achieve water treatment goals 6 large investments in pilot scale studies are needed to fully

13026,in recent years the management and mitigation of emerging contaminants ecs and pollutants in the environment engaging various bioresources has been an incipient focus of research the advancement of distinct processes to furnish definite requirements is immensely explored in the literature the occurrence of manifold emerging pollutants eps and the choice of a specific resource or a system to handle such xenobiotics is a challenge various strategies can be combined with prevailing remediation technologies to eliminate emerging contaminants from the environment effectively however the employment of microbial bio machines to mitigate ecs receives a priority due to its renewable and eco friendly approach over other chemical treatments microbial bioremediation and mitigatory strategies are impacted by numerous factors and operational settings in scaled up treatments this review focuses on the impacts of ecs on humans and ecosystems the implication of various groups of microbes bacteria fungi and algae as natural bio machines and systems for handling ecs in the aqueous environment the mitigation mechanisms of selected microbial bio machines and the merits along with challenges in mitigating ecs using unique strategies are also discussed keywords emerging contaminants toxicity biological techniques assorted mitigation eco friendly abbreviations agcs agrochemicals

1 introduction rapid usage of chemicals in industrial and agricultural operations linked to the constant increase in human population emits many sorts of pollutants into the ecosystem either directly or indirectly 1 emerging contaminants ecs are substances of emerging concern anthropogenic that appear in terrestrial and aquatic systems with varying concentrations these substances xenobiotics might be either of organic or inorganic origins or basis the organic contaminants comprise pharmaceutically active chemicals pacs endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs personal care products pcps agrochemicals agcs etc inorganic contaminants comprise nano or heavy metals microplastics etc accumulation of emerging pollutants eps in aquatic systems or any ecosystem is a global concern human and environmental health hazards are triggered by these emerging contaminants via discharges of effluent management facilities distributed directly into the environment distinguishing the foundations of ecs from the primary waste flows could offer invaluable perceptions into a profound awareness and competent management strategies 2 3 lately the ecs in effluents and in land disposal have drawn the interest of the policymakers and researchers owing to their probable hazard to human health and the ecosystem the ecs are getting substantial consideration in the direction of their handling and mitigation owing to their hazard quotient high polarity augmented bioaccumulation and endurance to biodegradation ecs are toxic metals and nano compounds are highly toxic to microorganisms 4 5 the worldwide scenario of surmounting the level of these emerging contaminants has expanded to several metric tons a year due to the expanding population demand for improved human lifestyle and due to the expansion and progress of the global economy a mutual pronouncement of the european union s water framework directive and the us environmental protection agency usepa has established regulations and procedures for ecs despite the directives owing to the dearth of published data and information pertaining to the effects of long term disclosure to ecs there exists a challenge to the environmental administrators regulators and other stakeholders the ecs medications and pharmaceuticals hormones cosmetic goods edcs and additional recalcitrant organic composites are persistently toxic implacable scarcely disintegrated and frequently dispersible in the aquatic environment numerous tools and mechanisms have been attempted to expel ecs from wastewater such as constructed wetlands activated sludge biochemical removal electrocoagulation advanced oxidation and anaerobic reactors 6 9 bio machine is a biological organism or group of organisms that function like or is treated as a machine with a unique biomechanics system that can perform on par or better than mechanical counterparts in specific aspects sans the limitations or impediments of conventional ones contrary to chemical methodologies utilization of microbial bio machines has emerged as more helpful in eliminating heavy metals and some ecs from effluents 3 10 in recent years researchers considered microbial bio machines bacteria fungi and algae as the best tool for mitigating ecs in wastewater due to the advantages such as wide range of mineralization less no generation of secondary pollutants high cost effective ratio reaction efficiency etc 11 assessments to explain the applications of microbial bio machines and their mechanisms for handling ecs the processes engaged in bio machines systems alongside the merits and shortcomings are gaining continuous interest among researchers only a few articles have reviewed the ecs elimination effectiveness in raw effluents along with the forementioned conditions with special reference to research works carried out in recent years therefore the use of microbial bio machines for the mitigation of ecs continues to be vague owing to the theoretical chasm that exists between experimental outcomes and real time applications 2 bibliometric analysis bibliometric analysis is a standard and effective method for identifying research trends and issues it s been used in a range of scientific and engineering sectors 12 scientific journals are the primary means of communication among scientists hence our analysis was based on data indexed in the scopus scientific database scopus was chosen as a data source since it is considered one of the most comprehensive and trustworthy scientific databases on interdisciplinary scientific knowledge 13 the current research is a bibliometric examination of global research production on a specified collection of keywords from 2012 through 2021 this type of analysis can be used to track the progression of scientific output in a particular field through time giving a glimpse of emerging trends in the scholarly community 14 the goal of this study was to determine how the eps issue has

the keywords and the size of the nodes indicates the frequency of use while the distance between the circles and the interconnecting lines reflects their connectivity and linkages 18 the network of nodes can be organized into clusters with a higher density of interrelating lines between cluster nodes a keyword has a significant link with another keyword discovered nearby and a keyword with a large number of links in a cluster has the most interlinked lines when a term is represented by a small node with a high density of links it suggests that it has a low frequency but high linkage density it is less researched but important 14 according to the map fig 2 water pollutants biodegradation and bioremediation are the primary terms with high interest these nodes are located in the map s core which indicates that it is transversal to all other topics addressed in research the primary secondary and tertiary priority of sources of eps and contaminations sites are assigned in the red green and yellow color nodes most linked with the node of water pollutant the contents associated with the biodegradation and bioremediation process are highlighted in a blue and violet color node the map demonstrates the significant diversity of research themes in the relevant field highlighting the core and most common concepts while also providing an opportunity to deliver higher discoverability along with the less explored fields to promote them as a relevant future research trend 3 sources occurrence and impacts of eps 3 1 sources of eps to the environment most eps such as pacs edcs pcps agcs etc reach the aquatic environment through anthropogenic and or natural sources 2 19 these pollutants enter the ecosystem either directly through point sources such as industrial discharges hospital effluents and outlets of wastewater treatment plants wwtp or indirectly through a variety of non point sources such as catchment runoff atmospheric deposition waste dumping sites and septic tanks 20 these pollutants go through metabolic processes after they ve been ingested these molecules however are not always entirely metabolized instead the unmetabolized component of these chemicals is expelled in the urine and feces ending up in the water streams 21 fig 3 depicts the key ec sources and paths into the aquatic environment ecs can pass through several treatment processes applied in wwtps due to their high solubility low volatility and for many of them has low degradability moreover most ecs are not regulated accurately due to a lack of standard guidelines for the discharging limits which end up in eps contamination of water bodies because surface waters are the direct receivers of effluents from wwtps and residence durations in surface waters are shorter than in groundwaters the range and concentrations of ecs observed in surface waters are usually larger than those reported in groundwaters in contrast marine water received a high possibility of eps entry because it is the endpoint of most polluted river sources 22 the basic properties and toxicity information of selected ecs observed in the pubchem database were compiled in this study table 2 3 2 occurrence in the water matrix eps such as pacs diclofenac ibuprofen naproxen ciprofloxacin azithromycin ketoprofen propranolol and atenolol edcs nonylphenol bisphenol a and estrone 1 pcps diethylhexyl phthalate propylparaben and salicylic acid and agcs triclosan atrazine and 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid were most commonly examined 3 ecs are usually identified at concentrations ranging from 0 15 ng l 1 to 2 0 g l 1 downstream of sanitary discharge locations 23 these chemicals are widely generated worldwide and because of their widespread use they can reach the environment through various routes i e leaching surface runoff volatilization spray drift erosion etc however the presence of these compounds in wwtp influents is determined mainly by consumption patterns population density and other factors 23 pacs enter the aquatic environment mostly by the dumping of leftover medications and personal excrement which are then released into the aquatic environment via wastewater streams the octanol water partition coefficient of most pacs is very low log kow 1 implying that they are polar and hydrophilic which helps them to remain in the ecosystem for a longer period 24 the study of biswas and vellanki 25 revealed the occurrence of 16 eps including pacs pcps and hormones in the anthropogenically influenced river yamuna in india the finding inferred that trimethoprim caffeine sulfamethoxazole gemfibrozil estrone and testosterone were found in all the samples collected from 13 sites in 575 km coverage the target chemical concentrations ranged from 25 5 to 2187 5 ng l 1 on average tak et al 4 found more than 300 compounds in an indian drinking water treatment plant dwtp with pacs accounting for the majority 58 of the compounds found followed by plasticizers and insecticides in lagos state nigeria ebele et al 26 identified pcps and pacs in surface ground and drinking water samples across two seasons in their study amoxicillin was found at the highest concentrations in surface water groundwater and drinking water with 1614 ng l 1 238 ng l 1 and 358 ng l 1 respectively acetaminophen nicotine ibuprofen and codeine among other things were detected during the dry season glyburide caffeine naproxen and diclofenac concentrations were considerably p 0 05 higher whereas nicotine and codeine concentrations were significantly p 0 05 greater during the rainy season faleye et al 27 reported the highest concentration of ciprofloxacin 501 575 5ng l 1 in the raw wastewater samples from south africa caffeine 19 and 31 5 μg l 1 acetaminophen 50 4 μg l 1 and trimethoprim 2 μg l 1 were detected at sites receiving untreated sewage and treated sewage in napo ecuador 28 diclofenac 1390 ng l 1 paracetamol 3069 l 1 caffeine 20 663 l 1 are detected in the lakes of saudi arabia 29 hormones such as 17β estradiol were found to range from 112 ng l 1 to 44 8 ng l 1 in south africa and mexico respectively 30 31 in egypt s river nile bisphenol a bpa ethylparaben methylparaben butylparaben propylparaben and o phenylphenol were found in concentrations ranging from 6 4 to 71 1 ng l 1 32 in the ebro river delta in spain 36 pesticide chemicals were found in rice irrigation water 33 the herbicide beta zone which was detected in all tested samples and measured at a maximum concentration of 18 104 ng l 1 was the compound with the greatest concentration in that study propanil acetamiprid mcpa and triallate had individual concentrations g l 1 with maximum values of 61 103 4000 8200 and 1000 ng l 1 respectively with concentrations exceeding 100 ng l 1 and occurrence maxima of 700 and 440 ng l 1 imidacloprid and 2 4 d might be emphasized as two of the most abundant pesticides in the studied area in water samples from beijing zhang et al 34 measured 10 pesticides ranging from not detected nd to 323 44 ng l 1 with metalaxyl having the highest quantity 89 58 ng l 1 stackpoole et al 35 found 221 pesticide concentrations in surface waters for samples collected from 74 river sites across the united states from 2013 to 2017 surface water samples from the northern shelf of the south china sea near the pearl river estuary revealed natural hormones estrone and 17β estradiol as well as the synthetic 17α ethinylestradiol at values of 1 1 ng l 1 0 7 ng l 1 and 0 6 ng l 1 respectively 36 in portugal the existence of edcs was studied in three rivers minho mondego and ave with estrogen contributions of 1 3 ng l 1 2 4 ng l 1 and 3 5 ng l 1for the minho mondego and ave estuaries respectively the alkylphenol concentrations in the mondego and minho estuaries were 2700 ng l 1and 600 ng l 1 respectively lower than those found in the ave 4855 ng l 1 37 hormones have been found in surface freshwater in several european and african nations at various concentration levels estrone values of 0 1 69 ng l 1 were found in france italy germany the czech republic luxembourg and spain while progesterone concentrations of 0 23 13 7 ng l 1 were found in hungary and france in italy and france estriol and testosterone were identified in concentrations of up to 2 38 ng l 1 and 3 ng l 1 respectively and 17β estradiol was found in amounts of 0 33 5 ng l 1 in hungary and luxembourg 38 39 the highest hormone levels were seen in africa where untreated residential and animal farm effluent is widely discharged 38 the quantities in africa are 3000 20 000 times greater than in europe with 17β estradiol concentrations ranging from 3310 to 15 700 ng l 1 and estriol concentrations ranging from 510 to 45 500 ng l 1 40 several edcs have been found in treated drinking water supplies worldwide mainly in tap water in the concentration range of 0 2 5510 ng l 1 with the highest value 28 000 ng l 1 found in drinking water from indian wells 39 in the surface water of the ganga river in india 7plasticizers 0 43 7 63 g l 1 and bpa 0 04 4 46 g l 1 were found 41 in conclusion eps have been found in aquatic settings worldwide at quantities ranging from ng l 1 to mg l 1 depending on the nature of the chemical the detection limits are subjected to vary based on several factors including sampling extraction and analytical instruments used to determine eps 42 however the continued release of these substances into the aquatic environment may negatively affect the biota as a result the evolution of legislation predicts that the limits for many of these compounds will be reduced further ensuring a reduction in the dangers related to exposure in some circumstances the new standards concentration levels below which no adverse effect on the medium occurs to which reference will be made are extremely low necessitating a significant amount of analytical work to ensure that these limits are met 3 3 impacts of eps mounting scientific evidence linking exposure to eps with environmental damage to aqueous ecosystems with their negative impacts on human and aquatic life has become a major issue 43 as stated above ecs can enter the aquatic food chain through multiple mechanisms inducing biomagnification as a result the food chain can see an increase in the concentration of a substance in creatures at successive trophic levels algae and other photosynthetic bacteria are important components of an aquatic ecosystem s food chain 44 as a result any changes to the normal functioning of photoautotrophic bacteria can have a significant impact on the organisms present at various trophic levels direct exposure is possible in some circumstances when humans and animals consume contaminated water 45 long term exposure has negative consequences for the aquatic ecology and in some situations can change animal and human metabolic and hormonal functions 13 46 because of eps toxicity environmental and human health risks have increased eps are considered extremely dangerous since nanogram per liter ng l 1 dosages in humans and aquatic organisms can induce hormonal interference in fish genotoxicity carcinogenicity in lab animals endocrine disruption and immunological toxicity 47 the chemical structure of a compound the extent to which it is absorbed by the body and its ability to detoxify transform the material into less hazardous chemicals and eliminate it are the three factors that define its toxicity a compound s physical chemical and toxicological properties are linked to its molecular structure 48 pcps and pacs are persistent and non degradable by conventional treatment strategies due to their physiological properties the inability of treatment processes to remove synthetic organic compounds puts aquatic animals human and environmental health at risk the ability of pacs to accumulate and cause harm in non target species poses a great risk 49 such compounds have been linked to negative pharmacological effects in exposed species furthermore pacs can cause the antibiotic resistance gene args to be expressed in microbes so the emergence of args causes serious problems in the treatment of fatal infectious diseases 50 51 edcs play a role in various endocrine problems including changes in the thyroid salivary glands and male genetic system bpa is the most ubiquitous edcs which causes hormone changes in humans that increase their risk of breast cancer and it also works as an antiandrogen feminizing male neurotoxicity wide genotoxic cancer causing cytogenetic disruption and microbial induction are linked to occupational exposure some other edcs such as brominated flame retardants have adverse effects including pulmonary impermeable endocrine activity neuroprotective and cancer growth 52 agcs have a negative impact on soil fauna and flora food safety and sustainable agriculture according to meena et al 53 as well as nutritional value and consumer health laboratory investigations have shown that agcs have the ability to induce acute and chronic damage to the neurological system reproductive organs lungs immunological and endocrine systems birth abnormalities and cancer pesticides bio magnification and persistence pose significant dangers to living species as well as pollute the ecosystem 54 eps are frequently thought to be harmful when inhaled or swallowed into the human body they infiltrate the lungs and other organs where their sheer number overwhelms the body s defense mechanisms 55 they are then transported to vital organs via the bloodstream or lymphatic system the toxicity of eps is undoubtedly linked to oxidative stress which causes inflammation genotoxicity and major cellular organelle dysfunction 56 some of the major health impacts of ecs in humans are illustrated in fig 4 however most of the reported data are have their limitations the long term effects of the majority of eps on the environment and human health are unknown or difficult to estimate and this remains a concern despite a lack of awareness about their behavior and hazards ecological risks the literature suggests using specific tools to assess the toxicity effects of eps environmental risk assessment the relationship between physicochemical properties and environmental behavior and fate and quantitative analysis of the structure activity relationship which can be aided by software tools 47 as a result more research is needed to develop appropriate regulatory guidelines for eps in aquatic media 4 bio machines for the remediation of emerging pollutants bioremediation is a metabolic process that uses bio machines to remove or neutralize environmental pollution bioremediation technologies have become widely used and are still increasing exponentially today for treating a wide variety of eps including edcs pacs pcps polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs 57 58 because of bio machines environmentally benign characteristics bioremediation of polluted places has proven to be effective and trustworthy recent advancements in bioremediation techniques have occurred in the last two decades with the ultimate goal of successfully restoring contaminated areas in an economical and environmentally beneficial manner different bioremediation approaches have been developed by researchers to mitigate various eps such as microbial assisted phytoremediation vermicomposting bioleaching land farming bioventing etc 5 among these utilization of microscopic bio machines such as bacteria fungi and algae is the best promising approach often exploited for contaminants removal in both in situ and ex situ conditions 59 microbial degradation can involve either indigenous or non indigenous microorganisms supplied to the contaminated site most of the pollution biodegradation and bioremediation issues can be solved by indigenous microorganisms found in contaminated areas 60 furthermore typical bioremediation technologies cannot concurrently assess comparative toxicity environmental effects and complete information on overall biologically altered substances which is a major concern of conventional bioremediation 61 hence the implementation of new techniques and the development of bio machines to overcome these issues are highly appropriate bio machinery that have been engineered or manipulated could be very different from spontaneous biodegradation in general biodegradation consists the stages such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis 62 integration of bio machines could be employed in some circumstances to counteract the current issue of obtaining maximal contamination degradation 60 jaiswal and shukla et al 63 looked at the future of synthetic biology based bioremediation as well as the conditions for analyzing research data and building synthetic biological frameworks of microbial bioremediation cell synchronization in a synthetic microbial community quorum sensing and cell signaling are also discussed as created for improved bioremediation procedures recently several other evaluations looked at microbial assisted bioremediation of various eps in both in situ and ex situ settings 11 64 in this context bio machines such as bioremediation in general and microbial bio machines in particular have gotten a lot of interest for pollution removal from various environmental matrices 4 1 bacterial bio machines for the degradation of eps researchers from all across the world have reported strains that are degrading eps pseudomonas sphingomonas bacillus rhodococcus arthrobacter photobacterium ralstonia acinetobacter alcaligens and microbacterium are the most common bacterial genera found in these strains 65 66 a list of selected bacterial species studied to remediate the eps is provided in table 3 due to the characteristics such as fast adaptation diversity vitality and ability to create less harmful metabolic intermediates bacteria particularly hydrocarbanoclastic species are the most effective scavengers for pah breakdown microbes use the energy released during the breakdown of various hydrocarbons ranging from n alkanes to cyclic ringed hydrocarbons to grow and maintain themselves 67 in the case of complex pah bacteria either emulsify the substrate or produce enzymes such as oxygenases which aid in incorporating an oxygen atom into the hydrocarbons and allow for easier reactions 68 pseudomonas mycobacterium sphingobium sphingomonas acinetobacter novosphingobium burkholderia and comamonas testeroni among other bacteria described by imam et al 69 have substantial catabolic capability against the degradation of a wide range of aromatic compounds bacterial species such as arthrobacter paenibacillus bacillus and rhodococcus used high molecular weight pah efficiently in one study other solo bacterial species can only consume a limited quantity of high molecular weight pah under identical conditions however under co metabolic settings reversal degradation patterns were seen 70 during the repairing process xu et al 71 found that bacterial mixtures can increase the degradation rates of certain pahs chemicals such as benzo a pyrene and phenanthrene with degradation rates of over 83 a few early publications claimed that the novosphingobium sp bacterium could be used to biotransform carbofuran 72 pseudomonas sp was used to bioremediate endosulfan 73 according to the study s findings using pseudomonas species can remove up to 80 of endosulfan in a 20 day batch trial experiment acinetobacter demonstrated around 88 diazinon degradation 74 the assorted microbial consortium can restore the inadequate and uneven performance of single strains of bacteria as a holistic solution for long term pesticide bioremediation 75 using lactobacillus plantarum 20261 yuan et al 76 found that dimethoate degraded at a rate of 60 82 while trichlorfon chlorpyrifos and parathion methyl degraded at 33 04 37 76 and 49 50 respectively pesticides are thought to be dissipated by microorganisms through one of two mechanisms decomposition or adsorption 77 the enzymatic breakdown of organophosphorus opp by l plantarum 20261 was evaluated in vitro to further understand the mechanism of opp degradation the results showed that crude phosphatase enzyme could break down chlorpyrifos trichlorfon parathion methyl and dimethoate at 50 67 52 39 53 62 and 54 36 respectively it was confirmed that l plantarum 20261 destroyed the opp rather than adsorption different opp degrading enzymes such as chlorpyrifos hydrolase organophosphate acid anhydrolase organophosphate hydrolases diisopropylfluorophosphatase and phosphotriesterases like lactonases specific activity either p s link group or p o link group type of agcs are reported 78 the selective uptake of pesticides based on bacterial strain caused a considerable difference in pesticide removal according to a recent study bacteria s selective uptake of pesticides causes a variation in their breakdown 79 this selective absorption could be owing to differences in pesticides binding to the phosphonate transporter s substrate binding protein on the cell membrane according to budeli et al 80 bacteria have a high ability to degrade edcs particularly estrogens like estrone 17β estradiol 17α ethinylestradiol and estriol with overall removal rate ranging from 0 99 0 99 26 99 72 99 and respectively for the concentrations ranging from 100 g l 1 to 5 mg l 1 as per the findings of this review gram negative bacteria have a higher degrading capability 44 99 than gram positive bacteria 30 80 the preponderance of the isolated strains cited could degrade estrone and 17β estradiol with up to 100 degradation efficiencies members of the achromobacter agromyces novosphingobium and rhodococcus genera have the highest degradation efficiency of estrone ranging from 90 to 100 bhandari et al 81 reviewed a number of bacterial taxa including sphingobium sphingomonas pseudomonas thauera pseudoxanthomonas bacillus novosphingonium stenotrophomonas arthrobacter clostridium maricurvus acidovorax corynebacterium rhizobium rhodococcus and acinetobacter for their probable significance in the metabolic pathway s breakdown of nonylphenol another well known edc of bpa biodegradation up to 70 6 was achieved using alcaligenes faecalis strain bpan5 as a halotolerant bacterial isolate 82 in another investigation cupriavidus basilensis sbug 290 was used to determine the bio transformation of bpa and its seven bisphenol analogs with transformation rates ranging from 6 to 98 83 bpa degradation has also been observed to be carried out by lactobacillus reuteri enterobacter cloacae bacillus pumilus pantoea sp klebsiella sp and acinetobacter sp in literature 84 diclofenac is a regularly used nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medicine that has been documented to be degraded by various bacteria including raoultella sp kdf8 85 labrys portucalensis f11 86 klebsiella sp ksc 87 other investigations utilized alicaligenes sp 88 and serratia sp r1 89 found an 84 degradation rate for amoxicillin and penicillin g respectively ibuprofen degrading bacteria from the genera pseudomonas and novosphingobium with 300 and 400 μm ibuprofen consumption in 3 8 days respectively 90 similarly a number of bacterial degradation experiments involving the removal of pacs from a variety of environmental matrices have been published 91 most antibiotic resistant bacteria have enzymatic mechanisms such as beta lactams chloramphenicol acetyltransferase aminoglycoside resistance modifying enzymes tetracycline inactivation and macrolide lincosamide streptomycin inactivating enzyme nucleotidyl transferases change the activity of tobramycin acetyltransferases change the activity of gentamicin tobramycin amikacin and netilmicin and phosphotransferases change the susceptibility of amikacin 50 the existence of readily biodegradable substrates such as organic carbon or ammonia as primary substrates or biogenic substrates plays an essential role in the biological transformation of eps regardless of how biotransformations of eps occur i e via metabolic or co metabolic processes these substrates can stimulate non specific catabolic enzymes for absorption or biodegradation or provide energy for biomass development and maintenance among other things 92 4 2 fungi as bio machines for the removal of eps fungi are the most well known and efficacious removal agents for a wide range of eps resistant to bacterial breakdown whole cell fungal therapy offers a lot of promise for degrading resistant substances like anti inflammatories antibiotics antiepileptics edcs pcps and agcs because of the activity of enzymes intracellular extracellular biosorption fig 5 many researches have looked into the efficacy of various fungus species in removing developing pollutants 93 94 laccases proteases peroxidases lipasesxylanases cellulases catalases amylases chitinases and other fungal enzymes have industrial applications and can be employed in organic waste management such as organic fractionation 94 the fungal treatment method relies on the enzymatic biodegradation of micropollutants which has previously been utilized to remove edc fungi s potential to digest edcs in synthetic media and real wastewater has been extensively investigated fungal therapies can be considered effective biological treatments for eliminating pharmaceutical substances among standard procedures used in practice 95 bhandari et al 81 stated the potential contribution of fungal taxa such as aspergillus pleurotus metarhizium clavariopsis trametes candida bjerkandera phanerochaete fusarium and mucor in the breakdown of nonylphenol via its metabolic route at ideal conditions ph 6 and temperature 30 c wu et al 96 found that fusarium sp reduced 17β estradiol by 92 5 in 48 h křesinova et al 97 investigated the biodegradation of estriol by farmed pleurotus ostreatus hk 35 and found that 90 of the estriol was removed within 12 days pycnoporus sanguineus laccase was proposed as another bioremediation technique for 17α ethinylestradiol 98 laccase from trametes versicolor and trametes hirsuta were found to digest 17β estradiol and 17α ethinylestradiol respectively 99 100 species like talaromyces gossypii syncephalastrum monosporum aspergillus tabacinus and talaromyces verruculosus have been observed to degrade diclofenac and bpa up to 80 101 laccase from ganoderma lucidum decomposed 96 1 and 80 9 of bpa as an immobilized and free form respectively at a starting concentration of 100 mg l 1 102 lignin modifying enzymes lme are enzymatic machinery found in the white rot fungus group responsible for lignin breakdown and wood disintegration other targets such as contaminated chemicals like pacs and antibiotics can be destroyed due to the limited specificity of this biochemical machinery naghdi et al 103 conducted a literature analysis and discovered that the stable fungal reactor requires thorough exploration into the role of biosorption and biodegradation in the removal of pacs and micropollutants 104 mir tutusaus et al 105 also discovered that a fungal operation managed to remove anti inflammatories and analgesics from wastewater as well as the most resistant pharmaceutical classes such as antibiotics and psychiatric medicines in practice various factors influence the efficacy of fungal treatments including sterilization methods fungal nutrient inputs and aeration rates 106 furthermore wastewater can alter fungal survival during the treatment system due to bacterial competition highly concentrated wastewater can lower surviving fungi as a result fungal biological therapies for the secondary treatment or post treatment processes are safe physically treated effluents i e reverse osmosis and coagulation flocculation are the best suitable for the fungal treatment procedure 107 selected fungal species reported remediating the eps are provided in table 4 white rot fungi pleurotus ostreatus trametes versicolor brown rot fungi daedalea dickinsii fomitopsis pinicola and gloeophyllum trabeum and other filamentous fungi aspergillus fumigatus trichoderma harzianum aspergillus terreus and penicillium citrinum have all been extensively reported 108 110 while the presence of ligninolytic enzymes is commonly linked to fungi s ability to break down pesticides t versicolor was utilized by hu et al 111 to degrade medium to highly polar pesticides such as malathion organophosphate acetamiprid and imidacloprid neonicotinoids t versicolor eliminated 1 mg l 1 of malathion but trials with acetamiprid and imidacloprid 4 mg l 1 in air pulse fluidized bioreactors yielded degradation percentages of 20 and 64 7 respectively after 7 days the cytochrome p450 system rather than the extracellular enzyme laccase is involved in the degradation of imidacloprid and acetamiprid according to enzyme exploration investigations two fungus strains verticilium sp h5 and metacordyceps sp h12 isolated from a bio purification system s bio mixture were able to efficiently remove pesticide concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 mg l 1 from the liquid medium 112 pesticide breakdown by fungi is frequently inefficient and necessitates lengthy incubation and acclimatization 110 aspergillus sydowii metabolized pahs as the source of carbon removing up to 90 10 days of two pahs benzo a pyrene bap and phenanthrene phe the elimination of these two was nearly entirely attributable to biotransformation rather than adsorption by dead mycelium and was unrelated to lme activity 113 lme podoscypha elegans strain ftg4 eliminated 98 9 of pyrene and 99 of phenanthrene from the degradation medium 20 mg l 1 114 hamad et al 115 has been concerned with studying the capability of six fungal species penicillium chrysogenum curvularia brachyspora cladosporium sphaerospermum scopulariopsis brevicaulis stemphylium botryosum and alternaria alternata as well as three fungal consortia fc fc1 c brachyspora and p chrysogenum fc2 s botry and s brevicaulis and fc3 c sphaerospermum s botryosum and s brevicaulis to remediate petroleum hydrocarbons from the findings it was observed that c sphaerospermum exhibited extensive saturated hydrocarbons sh degradation with normal paraffin and isoparaffin degradation of 97 19 and 98 88 respectively the highest significant at 0 05 pah degradation was found in a alternata at 72 07 followed by p chrysogenum at 59 51 whereas high molecular weight pah decreased significantly from 98 94 to 68 78 in control samples to a alternata treated samples individual isolates had lower significant ph deteriorating abilities than the fc1 and fc2 consortia showing that these fungal consortia had favorable synergistic effects the study backs up the crucial premise of pah and sh biodegradation as a more environmentally friendly alternative to chemical degradation furthermore bioremediation with fungi has benefits over bioremediation via bacteria because of the variety of operations and degrading enzymatic abilities as well as their capacity to function within a wide ph range 116 4 3 algae as bio machines for the mitigation of eps organic compounds can be converted into very cost effective and useful new molecules by microalgae and cyanobacteria utilizing selected algae species with potential the process removes pesticides from aquatic and terrestrial habitats 117 algae have also been found to break down a wide range of new contaminants and produce value added products like biofuel sharma and arivalagan 118 compared the procedures and technologies used for bacterial wwt and evaluated the significant achievements in algal wwt this comparison is crucial not only for the large manufacturing of bioproducts from wastewater but also for environmental protection against harmful and hazardous wastes the ability of algae to digest and detoxify contaminants has been extensively documented however the future of algae based wwt is dependent on overcoming problems such as microbial growth kinetics facile biomass separation and bioproduct recovery among others excess inorganic and organic chemicals can be removed from wastewater by mixotrophic algae 119 these compounds also include but are not limited to various eps such as agcs pacs pcps pahs and edcs 120 phycoremediation is a fascinating stage in the wwt process since it provides tertiary bio treatment while also creating potentially lucrative biomass that may be used for various purposes 121 biodegradation biosorption bioaccumulation cellular absorption and photodegradation are some of the response mechanisms involved in eliminating eps using a microalgal based treatment system fig 6 however priority has been provided to the biodegradation aspects of microalgae in this current section the use of algae based systems to treat wastewater and water as well as to remove new toxins has been documented 122 these systems include high rate algal ponds hraps membrane photobioreactors rotating algal biofilm reactors and stirred tank photobioreactors for example lindberg et al 123 reported that 36 pacs were assessed within a north sweden hrap utilizing untreated municipal wastewater as a medium with 14 being removed from the aqueous phase over 50 seven being removed above 90 of their initial concentrations the algal biomass recovered after each batch was predominantly connected with twelve apis of a hydrophobic type in six days hraps therapy successfully eliminated 69 of the pacs examined 25 of 36 studied the distribution of various pacs between the aqueous phase and biomass revealed that various removal processes including hydrophobicity driven removal active bioaccumulation and passive biosorption may be used naghdi et al 103 confirmed that the influence of extracellular enzymes produced by microalgae transforms harmful antibiotics into less or non toxic intermediates xiong et al 124 found that after 11 days of cultivation of chlamydomonas mexicana 13 of ciprofloxacin 2 mg l 1 was eliminated whereas the eradication of these compounds was increased by threefold 56 due to the addition of sodium acetate electron donor the results revealed that an algal pond hrap system dominated by coelastrum sp was highly efficient in removing 64 ppcps including 33 antibiotics at an average concentration of 223 g l 1 with antibiotic elimination percentages ranging from 5 to 50 higher than those of conventional activated sludge treatment microalgae can bio adsorb pharmaceuticals because of their composition including teichoic acid lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan pharmaceuticals are better absorbed when these substances are present a study investigated the removal effectiveness of three distinct microalgae strains chlorella vulgaris chlorella sorokiniana and scenedesmus obliquus used in pharmaceutical bioremediation 125 the strain s obliquus was the most effective in removing diclofenac concentration when s obliquus is utilized the starting concentration 25 mg l 1 is reduced by 99 a study looked at the biodegradation efficiency of s obliquus and found that the starting concentrations of sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole were reduced by 62 3 and 46 8 respectively 126 microalgae have also been demonstrated to extract refractory chemicals such as carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole during standard and advanced wastewater treatment 127 several algae species have also been tested for their ability to remove medications such as sulfamethoxazole clarithromycin erythromycin levofloxacin ciprofloxacin cefradine and amoxicillin 128 chen et al 129 included five models of pacs and pcps compounds oxybenzone ibuprofen bpa triclosan and n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide to the algal culture media according to the data the rotating algal biofilm reactor s ppcp removal efficiency ranged from 70 to 100 the breakdown of ppcps in the rotating algal biofilm reactor contributed 90 of ppcp removal while build up in the algal biomass contributed only 10 the revolving algal biofilm system is a viable method for eliminating pacs and pcps from wastewater according to this research nannochloris sp a type of green algae was found to remove 99 of triclosan and less than 10 of trimethoprim in recent research 122 similarly nannochloropsis sp was found to remove 4 39 μg ml 1 imidacloprid insecticide in the first 20 h from an initial concentration of 9 59 μg ml 1 130 the elimination of imidacloprid by the nannochloropsis sp marine microalga is both effective and light dependent according to this study the bioremediation of fluoranthene a four ring pah was tested using chlorella vulgaris with a cell density of c vulgaris od680 0 100 54 58 of fluoranthene 25 m was eliminated from the growing medium within three days and nearly 90 94 after seven days 213 organic chemicals such as naphthalene benzo a pyrene benzo b fluoranthene and acenaphthylene were reported to be removed by nannochloropsis oculata microalgae with greater removal percentages 89 and 99 in generated water 214 according to premnath et al 131 different microalgal species scenedesmus platydiscus selenastrum capricornutum scenedesmus quadricauda and chlorella vulgaris were used to degrade pahs fluoranthene pyrene and both fluoranthene and pyrene with c vulgaris and s capricornutum removing 78 and 48 of pahs respectively in 7 days microalgae based wwt generates high quality treated effluents hence it has gotten much interest for removing edc effluents microalgae based treatments have been shown to successfully remove edcs from effluents by biodegradation photodegradation and evaporation mechanisms in practice 132 wang et al 133 investigated algae mediated biotransformation as a potential mechanism for eliminating 17α ethinylestradiol 75 3 removal and 17β estradiol 95 removal furthermore ruksrithong and phattarapattamawon 134 demonstrated that biodegradation and adsorption were the most common removal strategies for estrone and estradiol as a result of the effectiveness of microalgae based biodegradation most estrogenic and pharmaceutical effluents have been successfully eradicated from wastewater systems shallow raceway reactors produce high rate algal and use oxygen via microalgal photosynthesis according to young et al 135 as a result microalgae based treatment systems do not require additional oxygen aeration 136 nonetheless as compared to other edc chemicals pesticide compounds have a lower removal efficacy 32 89 137 in this regard researchers might look into the culture and growth of microorganisms to learn more about microalgae s success in removing pesticides one of the potential possibilities for further boosting performance is the integrated biological treatment process with microalgae in pilot scale investigations bpa and np at the environmentally relevant concentration 100 g l 1 were effectively removed by ulva pertusa after three cycles 138 different microalgae employed for the degradation of eps are summarized in table 5 microalgae are oxygen evolving organisms capable of absorbing significant amounts of nutrients carbon nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater for growth and development since they lower nutrient delivery costs the nitro and amino groups can also be absorbed by microalgae and reduce toxicity they can also develop in various meteorological and environmental settings hence algae based wastewater remediation is both a cost effective and environmentally friendly technique to remove the eps 4 4 hybrid or co cultivation of bio machines the hybrid or mixed waste water treatment wwt removes ecs that combine two or more treatment approaches in terms of treatment efficiency and energy savings this procedure is long term and robust according to recent research the industrial implementation of these technologies is important to solving many of today s wastewater treatment problems physical and or chemical treatments are typically incorporated after biological treatment methods or bio machines co cultivation can be applied in various ways in hybrid systems in numerous studies these hybrid approaches have been shown to reduce energy usage while also increasing the separation efficiency of water pollutants 139 however while several hybrid strategies were used in wwt to remove eps 140 only the diverse nature of bio machines and their impact on eps were prioritized in this part co cultivation cultures are microorganisms associated with one another 141 such as bacteria with fungi algae with bacteria fungi with algae microscopic bio machines such as bacteria fungi and algae are well known for their capacity to break down a wide spectrum of organic compounds in a controlled environment making them suitable candidates for the mitigation of organic pollutants including eps when algae fungus and bacteria cohabit in various natural and artificial environments their correlation and interaction which can range from hostility to cooperation can impact the interacting partners survival colonization spatial dispersion and stress resistance the eps deterioration may be influenced by coexistence behavior 110 as a result polymicrobial cultivation methods must be used to gain a better knowledge of microbial dynamics in heterogeneous microbial communities as well as their impact on ecosystem processes mixed multi domain microbiomes have unique linkages and interactions that lead to more efficient organic pollution degradation and removal systems 142 microbial interactions between diverse model microbes revealed that native fungal and bacterial strains had the metabolic machinery to digest hazardous pollutants 143 and survive a high abundance of eps 144 compared to pure cultures or communities of either fungi or bacteria single domain systems some previous studies have indicated better biodegradation of specific contaminants when utilizing combination fungal bacterial treatments 110 ghorbannezhad et al 145 investigated the removal of pyrene 500 mg l 1 and tetracosane 1 w v either as single compounds or as a combination the degradation of pyrene and tetracosane was 60 76 and 73 48 respectively in sequential mixed cultures containing fungi and bacteria nearly 10 higher than traditional mixed cultures when pollutants were co degraded pyrene degradation increased by 24 65 and tetracosane degradation decreased by 6 41 the early attacks on hydrocarbons are carried out by fungi s non specified external enzymes delayed bacteria addition and co contamination would result in more fungal development which would enhance pyrene breakdown the findings demonstrated the need to have a sufficient understanding of the polluted site s features pollutants and oil degrading organisms 146 obtaining this knowledge and properly applying it such as adding bacteria to the contaminated culture later a new way of mixed cultures inoculation can be a promising strategy similarly despite recent research into using pure microalgal strains for wwt the symbiosis of algae and bacteria is successfully used for wwt systems 147 because microalgae may exploit inorganic substances for their development algae bacteria partnerships are an excellent choice for tertiary and scrape medications furthermore it does not urge optional contamination due to its potential to eliminate noxious pollutants in this manner 148 natural substrate artificial inoculation and colonization are three techniques used by the algal bacterial consortium many bacteria will develop a link with algae in the aquatic habitat acting as a natural water filtration system the inorganic chemicals were digested by a pairing of bacteria and algae where an innovative water eutrophication technique was exploited compared to algal bacterial systems solitary algae systems have very poor removal effectiveness 149 based on the critical review méndez garcía and garcía de llasera 150 found that microalgal biodegradation of pahs works well in association with bacterial co cultures algal bacterial consortia have sparked much interest in wwt in the recent two decades 151 and multi species coupling has been used to remove toxic contaminants such pcps pacs edcs pahs and agcs as well as a range of other eps 152 prosenc et al 153 compared the removal of 28 ecs from a lab scale monoculture of chlorella vulgaris and a mixed microalgal bacterial culture bisphenols bps 2018 eu watch list substances including neonicotinoids pacs selected transformation products the data demonstrated that in 11 days of incubation most of the bps tested were highly removable 67 in mixed culture where12 bps achieved excellent removal 90 which is 32 higher than the solo culture of c vulgaris erythromycin clarithromycin thiamethoxam estrone and estrone were all highly removable compounds on the eu 2018 840 watch list 100 imidacloprid thiacloprid and acetamiprid were all removable to varying degrees 40 65 in a mixed culture matrix estradiol thiamethoxam and imidacloprid were abiotically eliminated to a great amount the reduction efficiencies of pacs in c vulgaris and mixed cultures were comparable in mixed culture ibuprofen metoprolol and sulfamethoxazole were all highly removable 78 however carbamazepine was only marginally removed 12 overall the co cultivations or consortium of algae and bacteria improved the removal of most eps examined in the study compared to a single c vulgaris culture the fungi microalgae consortium also has much promise in terms of wwt 154 due to its low cost and great efficiency fungi assisted microalgae bio flocculation for microalgae harvesting and wwt at the same time which was previously overlooked has gotten much attention in the last decade co pelletization of microalgae with filamentous fungi has been created to collect microalgae by co pelletizing them into fungal pellets effectively 155 fungi and microalgae co pelletization can occur at any stage of the pelletization process due to interactions between microalgae cells and fungus spores these two harvesting methods are known as fungal pellet assisted fpa and fungal spore assisted fsa and microalgal harvesting methods according to chen et al 156 fpa had a greater harvest efficiency but fungal cultivation depleted nutrients if there is no need to introduce exogenous compounds or if the extrinsic substances are wastes fpa may be a preferable option the key mechanisms that explain the development of fungal algal pellets are electrostatic contacts hydrophobic interactions and interactions related to particular components on cell walls 157 the consortium of fungi and microalgae has the potential to remediate pharmaceutical and dye effluent using c vulgaris the filamentous fungus aspergillus niger and bio pellets made out of these microorganisms hultberg and bodin 158 studied whether fungal assisted algal harvesting may also remove chemicals from contaminated water a total of 38 pesticides were examined in this investigation and the concentrations of 17 of them were shown to be considerably lower in the bio pellet treatment than in the control fungi based flocculation technology is relatively new compared to algae bacteria co cultivation techniques there is currently only a little research in this sector of wwt and the concept of eps removal is still in its nascent stage 155 in brief the combination or co cultivation of these microbial bio machines into soil or water could aid in the fast elimination of pollutants although these consortia of indigenous strains can be effective in some situations their efficiency varies depending on the environment and operational conditions 159 5 influencing factors merits and demerits of microbial bio machines mediated remediation of ecs the performance of the bio machines is governed by different components such as ph temperature length of the process and concentration of the ecs hydraulic retention time hrt the ph of any remediation process involving bio machines is the imperative factor that can influence the outcome of some bio machines as ph impacts the ionization states of a variety of functional groups occurring on the surface of the biomass derived bio machines 116 any alteration in the ph of the system in which bio machines process might impact the reaction rate the charge of the system gets altered reducing the mitigation rate ecs most ecs can transform into precipitates at elevated ph changing the bio machine performance the bio machine productivity considerably varies with alteration in temperature the hrt can impact the ecs uptake processes in a few scenarios a shorter hrt could lead to deficient or incomplete elimination of ecs the ecs elimination procedure relies on the quantum of bio machines and hydraulic retention time the elimination rate improves with the high quantum of bio machines and hrt up to optimum levels the elimination competencies are substantially reduced in processes ahead of or beneath the optimal hrt 145 the smaller the ecs particle size the greater is the permeability boosting assimilation into biomass sourced bio machines and the success rate hangs on the extension availability of surface area the factors affecting biomass bio machines include surface area electrostatic function functional groups participating in the interface etc the exclusion rate enhanced the hrt between the ecs and the bio machines most ecs usually appear in water systems in minimal concentrations and their assessment is complex and necessitates many enhancements lower concentrations of ecs might also impact the performance of bio machines in a natural system contrary to a simulated system where many works are currently being reported 139 147 the current primary wastewater management methods are not cost effectively approachable with massive energy and labor requirements most notably these methodologies cannot eliminate a wide spectrum of ecs found in effluent consequently it is crucial to use the machinery that can overwhelm the constraints of such processes and bio machines appear to be a hopeful process for the mitigation of ecs the bio machines extend various improvements over other effluent management techniques non requirement of any chemical additives hence could work independently 131 148 although there are benefits of bio machines there are few demerits with bio machines bio machine adaptability in adverse conditions resistance to environmental fluctuations bio machine capability in scenarios of mass fabrication and environmental protection should be maximized recent bio machine utility via a combo of processes could increase ecs removal scientists are still operating on several constraints involving but not restricted to compound factors that must be augmented to remediate multiple ecs concurrently an elevated concentration of ecs in some systems can inhibit the performance of some bio machines 23 42 62 the operation or the rate of bio machines is restricted to the attributes of ecs and the type of effluent and functioning conditions the combination of bio machines with other management methods has been barely detailed in articles and is still under scrutiny only inadequate examinations have centered on incorporated approaches but there is still an exploration gap to be filled to expel ecs from effluent among the numerous treatment practices and techniques indisputable evaluation of the most suitable and beneficial solution for bio machines is not yet feasible further extensive research on bio machines to handle ecs is vital in addition bio machines remediation of ecs with a variety of models and constructions are essential examinations on real time functions are necessary to assess bio machines overall utility and pertinence 6 current status and future perspectives there are numerous advantages of bio machine enabled bioremediation there are few demerits associated with bioremediation via bio machines the adaptableness or flexibility of bio machines in adversative surroundings mitigation of complex emerging contaminants has not been extensively explored at a larger scale or commercial scale even though the application of bio machines in the field application is reaching consideration for its effectiveness in the elimination of ecs in many parts of the world the practical possibility of numerous integrated systems still requires widescale investigation ensuring the advance of appropriate integrated bio machines treatment modules the commercial sustainability of bio machines in larger scale appliances and possible fusion integrated systems is the most significant interest and concern for various stakeholders specific degradation pathways or work mechanics of bio machines and the metabolites arising out of ecs degradation are a substantial consequence for implementing a unique or specific integrated system the impact of different design and functioning factors and attributes must be decisively and acutely evaluated for this advanced integrated system either on a sizeable real time or pilot scale development in genetic engineering necessitates choosing and improving the efficiency of bio machines by incorporating these advancements for ecs degradation which can guarantee the technological and commercial sustainability of many integrated systems 7 conclusion this review depicts the development of processes and techniques their merits and demerits via the application of bio machines to mitigate emerging contaminants as bio machines offer better elimination effectiveness for a variety of ecs it can conclude that the use of bio machines in the future way of restitution of the environment via elimination of ecs although there are still few demerits in the application of bio machines and some ecs prove challenging to reclaim by bio machines the operational conditions such as ec load hrt and ph played a crucial role in attaining

13026,in recent years the management and mitigation of emerging contaminants ecs and pollutants in the environment engaging various bioresources has been an incipient focus of research the advancement of distinct processes to furnish definite requirements is immensely explored in the literature the occurrence of manifold emerging pollutants eps and the choice of a specific resource or a system to handle such xenobiotics is a challenge various strategies can be combined with prevailing remediation technologies to eliminate emerging contaminants from the environment effectively however the employment of microbial bio machines to mitigate ecs receives a priority due to its renewable and eco friendly approach over other chemical treatments microbial bioremediation and mitigatory strategies are impacted by numerous factors and operational settings in scaled up treatments this review focuses on the impacts of ecs on humans and ecosystems the implication of various groups of microbes bacteria fungi and algae as natural bio machines and systems for handling ecs in the aqueous environment the mitigation mechanisms of selected microbial bio machines and the merits along with

1 introduction rapid usage of chemicals in industrial and agricultural operations linked to the constant increase in human population emits many sorts of pollutants into the ecosystem either directly or indirectly 1 emerging contaminants ecs are substances of emerging concern anthropogenic that appear in terrestrial and aquatic systems with varying concentrations these substances xenobiotics might be either of organic or inorganic origins or basis the organic contaminants comprise pharmaceutically active chemicals pacs endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs personal care products pcps agrochemicals agcs etc inorganic contaminants comprise nano or heavy metals microplastics etc accumulation of emerging pollutants eps in aquatic systems or any ecosystem is a global concern human and environmental health hazards are triggered by these emerging contaminants via discharges of effluent management facilities distributed directly into the environment distinguishing the foundations of ecs from the primary waste flows could offer invaluable perceptions into a profound awareness and competent management strategies 2 3 lately the ecs in effluents and in land disposal have drawn the interest of the policymakers and researchers owing to their probable hazard to human health and the ecosystem the ecs are getting substantial consideration in the direction of their handling and mitigation owing to their hazard quotient high polarity augmented bioaccumulation and endurance to biodegradation ecs are toxic metals and nano compounds are highly toxic to microorganisms 4 5 the worldwide scenario of surmounting the level of these emerging contaminants has expanded to several metric tons a year due to the expanding population demand for improved human lifestyle and due to the expansion and progress of the global economy a mutual pronouncement of the european union s water framework directive and the us environmental protection agency usepa has established regulations and procedures for ecs despite the directives owing to the dearth of published data and information pertaining to the effects of long term disclosure to ecs there exists a challenge to the environmental administrators regulators and other stakeholders the ecs medications and pharmaceuticals hormones cosmetic goods edcs and additional recalcitrant organic composites are persistently toxic implacable scarcely disintegrated and frequently dispersible in the aquatic environment numerous tools and mechanisms have been attempted to expel ecs from wastewater such as constructed wetlands activated sludge biochemical removal electrocoagulation advanced oxidation and anaerobic reactors 6 9 bio machine is a biological organism or group of organisms that function like or is treated as a machine with a unique biomechanics system that can perform on par or better than mechanical counterparts in specific aspects sans the limitations or impediments of conventional ones contrary to chemical methodologies utilization of microbial bio machines has emerged as more helpful in eliminating heavy metals and some ecs from effluents 3 10 in recent years researchers considered microbial bio machines bacteria fungi and algae as the best tool for mitigating ecs in wastewater due to the advantages such as wide range of mineralization less no generation of secondary pollutants high cost effective ratio reaction efficiency etc 11 assessments to explain the applications of microbial bio machines and their mechanisms for handling ecs the processes engaged in bio machines systems alongside the merits and shortcomings are gaining continuous interest among researchers only a few articles have reviewed the ecs elimination effectiveness in raw effluents along with the forementioned conditions with special reference to research works carried out in recent years therefore the use of microbial bio machines for the mitigation of ecs continues to be vague owing to the theoretical chasm that exists between experimental outcomes and real time applications 2 bibliometric analysis bibliometric analysis is a standard and effective method for identifying research trends and issues it s been used in a range of scientific and engineering sectors 12 scientific journals are the primary means of communication among scientists hence our analysis was based on data indexed in the scopus scientific database scopus was chosen as a data source since it is considered one of the most comprehensive and trustworthy scientific databases on interdisciplinary scientific knowledge 13 the current research is a bibliometric examination of global research production on a specified collection of keywords from 2012 through 2021 this type of analysis can be used to track the progression of scientific output in a particular field through time giving a glimpse of emerging trends in the scholarly community 14 the goal of this study was to determine how the eps issue has piqued the scientific community s interest during the last decade five different keywords are provided in the section of title abs key as follows keyword 1 emerging and contaminants keyword 2 biodegradation and emerging and contaminants keyword 3 bioremediation and emerging and contaminants keyword 4 biodegradation and emerging and contaminants and wastewater and keyword 5 biodegradation

publications to this the most frequently used index keywords among all retrieved documents in the scopus database based on the keyword title abs key biodegradation and emerging and contaminants and aquatic and environment were analyzed out of 2107 keywords 178 meet the threshold for the provided conditions type of analysis co occurrence counting method fractional counting unit of analysis index keywords minimum number of occurrences of keyword 5 fig 2 depicts a review of the co occurrence of the most often used index terms in papers published between 2012 and 2021 the nodes circles represent the keywords and the size of the nodes indicates the frequency of use while the distance between the circles and the interconnecting lines reflects their connectivity and linkages 18 the network of nodes can be organized into clusters with a higher density of interrelating lines between cluster nodes a keyword has a significant link with another keyword discovered nearby and a keyword with a large number of links in a cluster has the most interlinked lines when a term is represented by a small node with a high density of links it suggests that it has a low frequency but high linkage density it is less researched but important 14 according to the map fig 2 water pollutants biodegradation and bioremediation are the primary terms with high interest these nodes are located in the map s core which indicates that it is transversal to all other topics addressed in research the primary secondary and tertiary priority of sources of eps and contaminations sites are assigned in the red green and yellow color nodes most linked with the node of water pollutant the contents associated with the biodegradation and bioremediation process are highlighted in a blue and violet color node the map demonstrates the significant diversity of research themes in the relevant field highlighting the core and most common concepts while also providing an opportunity to deliver higher discoverability along with the less explored fields to promote them as a relevant future research trend 3 sources occurrence and impacts of eps 3 1 sources of eps to the environment most eps such as pacs edcs pcps agcs etc reach the aquatic environment through anthropogenic and or natural sources 2 19 these pollutants enter the ecosystem either directly through point sources such as industrial discharges hospital effluents and outlets of wastewater treatment plants wwtp or indirectly through a variety of non point sources such as catchment runoff atmospheric deposition waste dumping sites and septic tanks 20 these pollutants go through metabolic processes after they ve been ingested these molecules however are not always entirely metabolized instead the unmetabolized component of these chemicals is expelled in the urine and feces ending up in the water streams 21 fig 3 depicts the key ec sources and paths into the aquatic environment ecs can pass through several treatment processes applied in wwtps due to their high solubility low volatility and for many of them has low degradability moreover most ecs are not regulated accurately due to a lack of standard guidelines for the discharging limits which end up in eps contamination of water bodies because surface waters are the direct receivers of effluents from wwtps and residence durations in surface waters are shorter than in groundwaters the range and concentrations of ecs observed in surface waters are usually larger than those reported in groundwaters in contrast marine water received a high possibility of eps entry because it is the endpoint of most polluted river sources 22 the basic properties and toxicity information of selected ecs observed in the pubchem database were compiled in this study table 2 3 2 occurrence in the water matrix eps such as pacs diclofenac ibuprofen naproxen ciprofloxacin azithromycin ketoprofen propranolol and atenolol edcs nonylphenol bisphenol a and estrone 1 pcps diethylhexyl phthalate propylparaben and salicylic acid and agcs triclosan atrazine and 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid were most commonly examined 3 ecs are usually identified at concentrations ranging from 0 15 ng l 1 to 2 0 g l 1 downstream of sanitary discharge locations 23 these chemicals are widely generated worldwide and because of their widespread use they can reach the environment through various routes i e leaching surface runoff volatilization spray drift erosion etc however the presence of these compounds in wwtp influents is determined mainly by consumption patterns population density and other factors 23 pacs enter the aquatic environment mostly by the dumping of leftover medications and personal excrement which are then released into the aquatic environment via wastewater streams the octanol water partition coefficient of most pacs is very low log kow 1 implying that they are polar and hydrophilic which helps them to remain in the ecosystem for a longer period 24 the study of biswas and vellanki 25 revealed the occurrence of 16 eps including pacs pcps and hormones in the anthropogenically influenced river yamuna in india the finding inferred that trimethoprim caffeine sulfamethoxazole gemfibrozil estrone and testosterone were found in all the samples collected from 13 sites in 575 km coverage the target chemical concentrations ranged from 25 5 to 2187 5 ng l 1 on average tak et al 4 found more than 300 compounds in an indian drinking water treatment plant dwtp with pacs accounting for the majority 58 of the compounds found followed by plasticizers and insecticides in lagos state nigeria ebele et al 26 identified pcps and pacs in surface ground and drinking water samples across two seasons in their study amoxicillin was found at the highest concentrations in surface water groundwater and drinking water with 1614 ng l 1 238 ng l 1 and 358 ng l 1 respectively acetaminophen nicotine ibuprofen and codeine among other things were detected during the dry season glyburide caffeine naproxen and diclofenac concentrations were considerably p 0 05 higher whereas nicotine and codeine concentrations were significantly p 0 05 greater during the rainy season faleye et al 27 reported the highest concentration of ciprofloxacin 501 575 5ng l 1 in the raw wastewater samples from south africa caffeine 19 and 31 5 μg l 1 acetaminophen 50 4 μg l 1 and trimethoprim 2 μg l 1 were detected at sites receiving untreated sewage and treated sewage in napo ecuador 28 diclofenac 1390 ng l 1 paracetamol 3069 l 1 caffeine 20 663 l 1 are detected in the lakes of saudi arabia 29 hormones such as 17β estradiol were found to range from 112 ng l 1 to 44 8 ng l 1 in south africa and mexico respectively 30 31 in egypt s river nile bisphenol a bpa ethylparaben methylparaben butylparaben propylparaben and o phenylphenol were found in concentrations ranging from 6 4 to 71 1 ng l 1 32 in the ebro river delta in spain 36 pesticide chemicals were found in rice irrigation water 33 the herbicide beta zone which was detected in all tested samples and measured at a maximum concentration of 18 104 ng l 1 was the compound with the greatest concentration in that study propanil acetamiprid mcpa and triallate had individual concentrations g l 1 with maximum values of 61 103 4000 8200 and 1000 ng l 1 respectively with concentrations exceeding 100 ng l 1 and occurrence maxima of 700 and 440 ng l 1 imidacloprid and 2 4 d might be emphasized as two of the most abundant pesticides in the studied area in water samples from beijing zhang et al 34 measured 10 pesticides ranging from not detected nd to 323 44 ng l 1 with metalaxyl having the highest quantity 89 58 ng l 1 stackpoole et al 35 found 221 pesticide concentrations in surface waters for samples collected from 74 river sites across the united states from 2013 to 2017 surface water samples from the northern shelf of the south china sea near the pearl river estuary revealed natural hormones estrone and 17β estradiol as well as the synthetic 17α ethinylestradiol at values of 1 1 ng l 1 0 7 ng l 1 and 0 6 ng l 1 respectively 36 in portugal the existence of edcs was studied in three rivers minho mondego and ave with estrogen contributions of 1 3 ng l 1 2 4 ng l 1 and 3 5 ng l 1for the minho mondego and ave estuaries respectively the alkylphenol concentrations in the mondego and minho estuaries were 2700 ng l 1and 600 ng l 1 respectively lower than those found in the ave 4855 ng l 1 37 hormones have been found in surface freshwater in several european and african nations at various concentration levels estrone values of 0 1 69 ng l 1 were found in france italy germany the czech republic luxembourg and spain while progesterone concentrations of 0 23 13 7 ng l 1 were found in hungary and france in italy and france estriol and testosterone were identified in concentrations of up to 2 38 ng l 1 and 3 ng l 1 respectively and 17β estradiol was found in amounts of 0 33 5 ng l 1 in hungary and luxembourg 38 39 the highest hormone levels were seen in africa where untreated residential and animal farm effluent is widely discharged 38 the quantities in africa are 3000 20 000 times greater than in europe with 17β estradiol concentrations ranging from 3310 to 15 700 ng l 1 and estriol concentrations ranging from 510 to 45 500 ng l 1 40 several edcs have been found in treated drinking water supplies worldwide mainly in tap water in the concentration range of 0 2 5510 ng l 1 with the highest value 28 000 ng l 1 found in drinking water from indian wells 39 in the surface water of the ganga river in india 7plasticizers 0 43 7 63 g l 1 and bpa 0 04 4 46 g l 1 were found 41 in conclusion eps have been found in aquatic settings worldwide at quantities ranging from ng l 1 to mg l 1 depending on the nature of the chemical the detection limits are subjected to vary based on several factors including sampling extraction and analytical instruments used to determine eps 42 however the continued release of these substances into the aquatic environment may negatively affect the biota as a result the evolution of legislation predicts that the limits for many of these compounds will be reduced further ensuring a reduction in the dangers related to exposure in some circumstances the new standards concentration levels below which no adverse effect on the medium occurs to which reference will be made are extremely low necessitating a significant amount of analytical work to ensure that these limits are met 3 3 impacts of eps mounting scientific evidence linking exposure to eps with environmental damage to aqueous ecosystems with their negative impacts on human and aquatic life has become a major issue 43 as stated above ecs can enter the aquatic food chain through multiple mechanisms inducing biomagnification as a result the food chain can see an increase in the concentration of a substance in creatures at successive trophic levels algae and other photosynthetic bacteria are important components of an aquatic ecosystem s food chain 44 as a result any changes to the normal functioning of photoautotrophic bacteria can have a significant impact on the organisms present at various trophic levels direct exposure is possible in some circumstances when humans and animals consume contaminated water 45 long term exposure has negative consequences for the aquatic ecology and in some situations can change animal and human metabolic and hormonal functions 13 46 because of eps toxicity environmental and human health risks have increased eps are considered extremely dangerous since nanogram per liter ng l 1 dosages in humans and aquatic organisms can induce hormonal interference in fish genotoxicity carcinogenicity in lab animals endocrine disruption and immunological toxicity 47 the chemical structure of a compound the extent to which it is absorbed by the body and its ability to detoxify transform the material into less hazardous chemicals and eliminate it are the three factors that define its toxicity a compound s physical chemical and toxicological properties are linked to its molecular structure 48 pcps and pacs are persistent and non degradable by conventional treatment strategies due to their physiological properties the inability of treatment processes to remove synthetic organic compounds puts aquatic animals human and environmental health at risk the ability of pacs to accumulate and cause harm in non target species poses a great risk 49 such compounds have been linked to negative pharmacological effects in exposed species furthermore pacs can cause the antibiotic resistance gene args to be expressed in microbes so the emergence of args causes serious problems in the treatment of fatal infectious diseases 50 51 edcs play a role in various endocrine problems including changes in the thyroid salivary glands and male genetic system bpa is the most ubiquitous edcs which causes hormone changes in humans that increase their risk of breast cancer and it also works as an antiandrogen feminizing male neurotoxicity wide genotoxic cancer causing cytogenetic disruption and microbial induction are linked to occupational exposure some other edcs such as brominated flame retardants have adverse effects including pulmonary impermeable endocrine activity neuroprotective and cancer growth 52 agcs have a negative impact on soil fauna and flora food safety and sustainable agriculture according to meena et al 53 as well as nutritional value and consumer health laboratory investigations have shown that agcs have the ability to induce acute and chronic damage to the neurological system reproductive organs lungs immunological and endocrine systems birth abnormalities and cancer pesticides bio magnification and persistence pose significant dangers to living species as well as pollute the ecosystem 54 eps are frequently thought to be harmful when inhaled or swallowed into the human body they infiltrate the lungs and other organs where their sheer number overwhelms the body s defense mechanisms 55 they are then transported to vital organs via the bloodstream or lymphatic system the toxicity of eps is undoubtedly linked to oxidative stress which causes inflammation genotoxicity and major cellular organelle dysfunction 56 some of the major health impacts of ecs in humans are illustrated in fig 4 however most of the reported data are have their limitations the long term effects of the majority of eps on the environment and human health are unknown or difficult to estimate and this remains a concern despite a lack of awareness about their behavior and hazards ecological risks the literature suggests using specific tools to assess the toxicity effects of eps environmental risk assessment the relationship between physicochemical properties and environmental behavior and fate and quantitative analysis of the structure activity relationship which can be aided by software tools 47 as a result more research is needed to develop appropriate regulatory guidelines for eps in aquatic media 4 bio machines for the remediation of emerging pollutants bioremediation is a metabolic process that uses bio machines to remove or neutralize environmental pollution bioremediation technologies have become widely used and are still increasing exponentially today for treating a wide variety of eps including edcs pacs pcps polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs 57 58 because of bio machines environmentally benign characteristics bioremediation of polluted places has proven to be effective and trustworthy recent advancements in bioremediation techniques have occurred in the last two decades with the ultimate goal of successfully restoring contaminated areas in an economical and environmentally beneficial manner different bioremediation approaches have been developed by researchers to mitigate various eps such as microbial assisted phytoremediation vermicomposting bioleaching land farming bioventing etc 5 among these utilization of microscopic bio machines such as bacteria fungi and algae is the best promising approach often exploited for contaminants removal in both in situ and ex situ conditions 59 microbial degradation can involve either indigenous or non indigenous microorganisms supplied to the contaminated site most of the pollution biodegradation and bioremediation issues can be solved by indigenous microorganisms found in contaminated areas 60 furthermore typical bioremediation technologies cannot concurrently assess comparative toxicity environmental effects and complete information on overall biologically altered substances which is a major concern of conventional bioremediation 61 hence the implementation of new techniques and the development of bio machines to overcome these issues are highly appropriate bio machinery that have been engineered or manipulated could be very different from spontaneous biodegradation in general biodegradation consists the stages such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis 62 integration of bio machines could be employed in some circumstances to counteract the current issue of obtaining maximal contamination degradation 60 jaiswal and shukla et al 63 looked at the future of synthetic biology based bioremediation as well as the conditions for analyzing research data and building synthetic biological frameworks of microbial bioremediation cell synchronization in a synthetic microbial community quorum sensing and cell signaling are also discussed as created for improved bioremediation procedures recently several other evaluations looked at microbial assisted bioremediation of various eps in both in situ and ex situ settings 11 64 in this context bio machines such as bioremediation in general and microbial bio machines in particular have gotten a lot of interest for pollution removal from various environmental matrices 4 1 bacterial bio machines for the degradation of eps researchers from all across the world have reported strains that are degrading eps pseudomonas sphingomonas bacillus rhodococcus arthrobacter photobacterium ralstonia acinetobacter alcaligens and microbacterium are the most common bacterial genera found in these strains 65 66 a list of selected bacterial species studied to remediate the eps is provided in table 3 due to the characteristics such as fast adaptation diversity vitality and ability to create less harmful metabolic intermediates bacteria particularly hydrocarbanoclastic species are the most effective scavengers for pah breakdown microbes use the energy released during the breakdown of various hydrocarbons ranging from n alkanes to cyclic ringed hydrocarbons to grow and maintain themselves 67 in the case of complex pah bacteria either emulsify the substrate or produce enzymes such as oxygenases which aid in incorporating an oxygen atom into the hydrocarbons and allow for easier reactions 68 pseudomonas mycobacterium sphingobium sphingomonas acinetobacter novosphingobium burkholderia and comamonas testeroni among other bacteria described by imam et al 69 have substantial catabolic capability against the degradation of a wide range of aromatic compounds bacterial species such as arthrobacter paenibacillus bacillus and rhodococcus used high molecular weight pah efficiently in one study other solo bacterial species can only consume a limited quantity of high molecular weight pah under identical conditions however under co metabolic settings reversal degradation patterns were seen 70 during the repairing process xu et al 71 found that bacterial mixtures can increase the degradation rates of certain pahs chemicals such as benzo a pyrene and phenanthrene with degradation rates of over 83 a few early publications claimed that the novosphingobium sp bacterium could be used to biotransform carbofuran 72 pseudomonas sp was used to bioremediate endosulfan 73 according to the study s findings using pseudomonas species can remove up to 80 of endosulfan in a 20 day batch trial experiment acinetobacter demonstrated around 88 diazinon degradation 74 the assorted microbial consortium can restore the inadequate and uneven performance of single strains of bacteria as a holistic solution for long term pesticide bioremediation 75 using lactobacillus plantarum 20261 yuan et al 76 found that dimethoate degraded at a rate of 60 82 while trichlorfon chlorpyrifos and parathion methyl degraded at 33 04 37 76 and 49 50 respectively pesticides are thought to be dissipated by microorganisms through one of two mechanisms decomposition or adsorption 77 the enzymatic breakdown of organophosphorus opp by l plantarum 20261 was evaluated in vitro to further understand the mechanism of opp degradation the results showed that crude phosphatase enzyme could break down chlorpyrifos trichlorfon parathion methyl and dimethoate at 50 67 52 39 53 62 and 54 36 respectively it was confirmed that l plantarum 20261 destroyed the opp rather than adsorption different opp degrading enzymes such as chlorpyrifos hydrolase organophosphate acid anhydrolase organophosphate hydrolases diisopropylfluorophosphatase and phosphotriesterases like lactonases specific activity either p s link group or p o link group type of agcs are reported 78 the selective uptake of pesticides based on bacterial strain caused a considerable difference in pesticide removal according to a recent study bacteria s selective uptake of pesticides causes a variation in their breakdown 79 this selective absorption could be owing to differences in pesticides binding to the phosphonate transporter s substrate binding protein on the cell membrane according to budeli et al 80 bacteria have a high ability to degrade edcs particularly estrogens like estrone 17β estradiol 17α ethinylestradiol and estriol with overall removal rate ranging from 0 99 0 99 26 99 72 99 and respectively for the concentrations ranging from 100 g l 1 to 5 mg l 1 as per the findings of this review gram negative bacteria have a higher degrading capability 44 99 than gram positive bacteria 30 80 the preponderance of the isolated strains cited could degrade estrone and 17β estradiol with up to 100 degradation efficiencies members of the achromobacter agromyces novosphingobium and rhodococcus genera have the highest degradation efficiency of estrone ranging from 90 to 100 bhandari et al 81 reviewed a number of bacterial taxa including sphingobium sphingomonas pseudomonas thauera pseudoxanthomonas bacillus novosphingonium stenotrophomonas arthrobacter clostridium maricurvus acidovorax corynebacterium rhizobium rhodococcus and acinetobacter for their probable significance in the metabolic pathway s breakdown of nonylphenol another well known edc of bpa biodegradation up to 70 6 was achieved using alcaligenes faecalis strain bpan5 as a halotolerant bacterial isolate 82 in another investigation cupriavidus basilensis sbug 290 was used to determine the bio transformation of bpa and its seven bisphenol analogs with transformation rates ranging from 6 to 98 83 bpa degradation has also been observed to be carried out by lactobacillus reuteri enterobacter cloacae bacillus pumilus pantoea sp klebsiella sp and acinetobacter sp in literature 84 diclofenac is a regularly used nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medicine that has been documented to be degraded by various bacteria including raoultella sp kdf8 85 labrys portucalensis f11 86 klebsiella sp ksc 87 other investigations utilized alicaligenes sp 88 and serratia sp r1 89 found an 84 degradation rate for amoxicillin and penicillin g respectively ibuprofen degrading bacteria from the genera pseudomonas and novosphingobium with 300 and 400 μm ibuprofen consumption in 3 8 days respectively 90 similarly a number of bacterial degradation experiments involving the removal of pacs from a variety of environmental matrices have been published 91 most antibiotic resistant bacteria have enzymatic mechanisms such as beta lactams chloramphenicol acetyltransferase aminoglycoside resistance modifying enzymes tetracycline inactivation and macrolide lincosamide streptomycin inactivating enzyme nucleotidyl transferases change the activity of tobramycin acetyltransferases change the activity of gentamicin tobramycin amikacin and netilmicin and phosphotransferases change the susceptibility of amikacin 50 the existence of readily biodegradable substrates such as organic carbon or ammonia as primary substrates or biogenic substrates plays an essential role in the biological transformation of eps regardless of how biotransformations of eps occur i e via metabolic or co metabolic processes these substrates can stimulate non specific catabolic enzymes for absorption or biodegradation or provide energy for biomass development and maintenance among other things 92 4 2 fungi as bio machines for the removal of eps fungi are the most well known and efficacious removal agents for a wide range of eps resistant to bacterial breakdown whole cell fungal therapy offers a lot of promise for degrading resistant substances like anti inflammatories antibiotics antiepileptics edcs pcps and agcs because of the activity of enzymes intracellular extracellular biosorption fig 5 many researches have looked into the efficacy of various fungus species in removing developing pollutants 93 94 laccases proteases peroxidases lipasesxylanases cellulases catalases amylases chitinases and other fungal enzymes have industrial applications and can be employed in organic waste management such as organic fractionation 94 the fungal treatment method relies on the enzymatic biodegradation of micropollutants which has previously been utilized to remove edc fungi s potential to digest edcs in synthetic media and real wastewater has been extensively investigated fungal therapies can be considered effective biological treatments for eliminating pharmaceutical substances among standard procedures used in practice 95 bhandari et al 81 stated the potential contribution of fungal taxa such as aspergillus pleurotus metarhizium clavariopsis trametes candida bjerkandera phanerochaete fusarium and mucor in the breakdown of nonylphenol via its metabolic route at ideal conditions ph 6 and temperature 30 c wu et al 96 found that fusarium sp reduced 17β estradiol by 92 5 in 48 h křesinova et al 97 investigated the biodegradation of estriol by farmed pleurotus ostreatus hk 35 and found that 90 of the estriol was removed within 12 days pycnoporus sanguineus laccase was proposed as another bioremediation technique for 17α ethinylestradiol 98 laccase from trametes versicolor and trametes hirsuta were found to digest 17β estradiol and 17α ethinylestradiol respectively 99 100 species like talaromyces gossypii syncephalastrum monosporum aspergillus tabacinus and talaromyces verruculosus have been observed to degrade diclofenac and bpa up to 80 101 laccase from ganoderma lucidum decomposed 96 1 and 80 9 of bpa as an immobilized and free form respectively at a starting concentration of 100 mg l 1 102 lignin modifying enzymes lme are enzymatic machinery found in the white rot fungus group responsible for lignin breakdown and wood disintegration other targets such as contaminated chemicals like pacs and antibiotics can be destroyed due to the limited specificity of this biochemical machinery naghdi et al 103 conducted a literature analysis and discovered that the stable fungal reactor requires thorough exploration into the role of biosorption and biodegradation in the removal of pacs and micropollutants 104 mir tutusaus et al 105 also discovered that a fungal operation managed to remove anti inflammatories and analgesics from wastewater as well as the most resistant pharmaceutical classes such as antibiotics and psychiatric medicines in practice various factors influence the efficacy of fungal treatments including sterilization methods fungal nutrient inputs and aeration rates 106 furthermore wastewater can alter fungal survival during the treatment system due to bacterial competition highly concentrated wastewater can lower surviving fungi as a result fungal biological therapies for the secondary treatment or post treatment processes are safe physically treated effluents i e reverse osmosis and coagulation flocculation are the best suitable for the fungal treatment procedure 107 selected fungal species reported remediating the eps are provided in table 4 white rot fungi pleurotus ostreatus trametes versicolor brown rot fungi daedalea dickinsii fomitopsis pinicola and gloeophyllum trabeum and other filamentous fungi aspergillus fumigatus trichoderma harzianum aspergillus terreus and penicillium citrinum have all been extensively reported 108 110 while the presence of ligninolytic enzymes is commonly linked to fungi s ability to break down pesticides t versicolor was utilized by hu et al 111 to degrade medium to highly polar pesticides such as malathion organophosphate acetamiprid and imidacloprid neonicotinoids t versicolor eliminated 1 mg l 1 of malathion but trials with acetamiprid and imidacloprid 4 mg l 1 in air pulse fluidized bioreactors yielded degradation percentages of 20 and 64 7 respectively after 7 days the cytochrome p450 system rather than the extracellular enzyme laccase is involved in the degradation of imidacloprid and acetamiprid according to enzyme exploration investigations two fungus strains verticilium sp h5 and metacordyceps sp h12 isolated from a bio purification system s bio mixture were able to efficiently remove pesticide concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 mg l 1 from the liquid medium 112 pesticide breakdown by fungi is frequently inefficient and necessitates lengthy incubation and acclimatization 110 aspergillus sydowii metabolized pahs as the source of carbon removing up to 90 10 days of two pahs benzo a pyrene bap and phenanthrene phe the elimination of these two was nearly entirely attributable to biotransformation rather than adsorption by dead mycelium and was unrelated to lme activity 113 lme podoscypha elegans strain ftg4 eliminated 98 9 of pyrene and 99 of phenanthrene from the degradation medium 20 mg l 1 114 hamad et al 115 has been concerned with studying the capability of six fungal species penicillium chrysogenum curvularia brachyspora cladosporium sphaerospermum scopulariopsis brevicaulis stemphylium botryosum and alternaria alternata as well as three fungal consortia fc fc1 c brachyspora and p chrysogenum fc2 s botry and s brevicaulis and fc3 c sphaerospermum s botryosum and s brevicaulis to remediate petroleum hydrocarbons from the findings it was observed that c sphaerospermum exhibited extensive saturated hydrocarbons sh degradation with normal paraffin and isoparaffin degradation of 97 19 and 98 88 respectively the highest significant at 0 05 pah degradation was found in a alternata at 72 07 followed by p chrysogenum at 59 51 whereas high molecular weight pah decreased significantly from 98 94 to 68 78 in control samples to a alternata treated samples individual isolates had lower significant ph deteriorating abilities than the fc1 and fc2 consortia showing that these fungal consortia had favorable synergistic effects the study backs up the crucial premise of pah and sh biodegradation as a more environmentally friendly alternative to chemical degradation furthermore bioremediation with fungi has benefits over bioremediation via bacteria because of the variety of operations and degrading enzymatic abilities as well as their capacity to function within a wide ph range 116 4 3 algae as bio machines for the mitigation of eps organic compounds can be converted into very cost effective and useful new molecules by microalgae and cyanobacteria utilizing selected algae species with potential the process removes pesticides from aquatic and terrestrial habitats 117 algae have also been found to break down a wide range of new contaminants and produce value added products like biofuel sharma and arivalagan 118 compared the procedures and technologies used for bacterial wwt and evaluated the significant achievements in algal wwt this comparison is crucial not only for the large manufacturing of bioproducts from wastewater but also for environmental protection against harmful and hazardous wastes the ability of algae to digest and detoxify contaminants has been extensively documented however the future of algae based wwt is dependent on overcoming problems such as microbial growth kinetics facile biomass separation and bioproduct recovery among others excess inorganic and organic chemicals can be removed from wastewater by mixotrophic algae 119 these compounds also include but are not limited to various eps such as agcs pacs pcps pahs and edcs 120 phycoremediation is a fascinating stage in the wwt process since it provides tertiary bio treatment while also creating potentially lucrative biomass that may be used for various purposes 121 biodegradation biosorption bioaccumulation cellular absorption and photodegradation are some of the response mechanisms involved in eliminating eps using a microalgal based treatment system fig 6 however priority has been provided to the biodegradation aspects of microalgae in this current section the use of algae based systems to treat wastewater and water as well as to remove new toxins has been documented 122 these systems include high rate algal ponds hraps membrane photobioreactors rotating algal biofilm reactors and stirred tank photobioreactors for example lindberg et al 123 reported that 36 pacs were assessed within a north sweden hrap utilizing untreated municipal wastewater as a medium with 14 being removed from the aqueous phase over 50 seven being removed above 90 of their initial concentrations the algal biomass recovered after each batch was predominantly connected with twelve apis of a hydrophobic type in six days hraps therapy successfully eliminated 69 of the pacs examined 25 of 36 studied the distribution of various pacs between the aqueous phase and biomass revealed that various removal processes including hydrophobicity driven removal active bioaccumulation and passive biosorption may be used naghdi et al 103 confirmed that the influence of extracellular enzymes produced by microalgae transforms harmful antibiotics into less or non toxic intermediates xiong et al 124 found that after 11 days of cultivation of chlamydomonas mexicana 13 of ciprofloxacin 2 mg l 1 was eliminated whereas the eradication of these compounds was increased by threefold 56 due to the addition of sodium acetate electron donor the results revealed that an algal pond hrap system dominated by coelastrum sp was highly efficient in removing 64 ppcps including 33 antibiotics at an average concentration of 223 g l 1 with antibiotic elimination percentages ranging from 5 to 50 higher than those of conventional activated sludge treatment microalgae can bio adsorb pharmaceuticals because of their composition including teichoic acid lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan pharmaceuticals are better absorbed when these substances are present a study investigated the removal effectiveness of three distinct microalgae strains chlorella vulgaris chlorella sorokiniana and scenedesmus obliquus used in pharmaceutical bioremediation 125 the strain s obliquus was the most effective in removing diclofenac concentration when s obliquus is utilized the starting concentration 25 mg l 1 is reduced by 99 a study looked at the biodegradation efficiency of s obliquus and found that the starting concentrations of sulfamethazine and sulfamethoxazole were reduced by 62 3 and 46 8 respectively 126 microalgae have also been demonstrated to extract refractory chemicals such as carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole during standard and advanced wastewater treatment 127 several algae species have also been tested for their ability to remove medications such as sulfamethoxazole clarithromycin erythromycin levofloxacin ciprofloxacin cefradine and amoxicillin 128 chen et al 129 included five models of pacs and pcps compounds oxybenzone ibuprofen bpa triclosan and n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide to the algal culture media according to the data the rotating algal biofilm reactor s ppcp removal efficiency ranged from 70 to 100 the breakdown of ppcps in the rotating algal biofilm reactor contributed 90 of ppcp removal while build up in the algal biomass contributed only 10 the revolving algal biofilm system is a viable method for eliminating pacs and pcps from wastewater according to this research nannochloris sp a type of green algae was found to remove 99 of triclosan and less than 10 of trimethoprim in recent research 122 similarly nannochloropsis sp was found to remove 4 39 μg ml 1 imidacloprid insecticide in the first 20 h from an initial concentration of 9 59 μg ml 1 130 the elimination of imidacloprid by the nannochloropsis sp marine microalga is both effective and light dependent according to this study the bioremediation of fluoranthene a four ring pah was tested using chlorella vulgaris with a cell density of c vulgaris od680 0 100 54 58 of fluoranthene 25 m was eliminated from the growing medium within three days and nearly 90 94 after seven days 213 organic chemicals such as naphthalene benzo a pyrene benzo b fluoranthene and acenaphthylene were reported to be removed by nannochloropsis oculata microalgae with greater removal percentages 89 and 99 in generated water 214 according to premnath et al 131 different microalgal species scenedesmus platydiscus selenastrum capricornutum scenedesmus quadricauda and chlorella vulgaris were used to degrade pahs fluoranthene pyrene and both fluoranthene and pyrene with c vulgaris and s capricornutum removing 78 and 48 of pahs respectively in 7 days microalgae based wwt generates high quality treated effluents hence it has gotten much interest for removing edc effluents microalgae based treatments have been shown to successfully remove edcs from effluents by biodegradation photodegradation and evaporation mechanisms in practice 132 wang et al 133 investigated algae mediated biotransformation as a potential mechanism for eliminating 17α ethinylestradiol 75 3 removal and 17β estradiol 95 removal furthermore ruksrithong and phattarapattamawon 134 demonstrated that biodegradation and adsorption were the most common removal strategies for estrone and estradiol as a result of the effectiveness of microalgae based biodegradation most estrogenic and pharmaceutical effluents have been successfully eradicated from wastewater systems shallow raceway reactors produce high rate algal and use oxygen via microalgal photosynthesis according to young et al 135 as a result microalgae based treatment systems do not require additional oxygen aeration 136 nonetheless as compared to other edc chemicals pesticide compounds have a lower removal efficacy 32 89 137 in this regard researchers might look into the culture and growth of microorganisms to learn more about microalgae s success in removing pesticides one of the potential possibilities for further boosting performance is the integrated biological treatment process with microalgae in pilot scale investigations bpa and np at the environmentally relevant concentration 100 g l 1 were effectively removed by ulva pertusa after three cycles 138 different microalgae employed for the degradation of eps are summarized in table 5 microalgae are oxygen evolving organisms capable of absorbing significant amounts of nutrients carbon nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater for growth and development since they lower nutrient delivery costs the nitro and amino groups can also be absorbed by microalgae and reduce toxicity they can also develop in various meteorological and environmental settings hence algae based wastewater remediation is both a cost effective and environmentally friendly technique to remove the eps 4 4 hybrid or co cultivation of bio machines the hybrid or mixed waste water treatment wwt removes ecs that combine two or more treatment approaches in terms of treatment efficiency and energy savings this procedure is long term and robust according to recent research the industrial implementation of these technologies is important to solving many of today s wastewater treatment problems physical and or chemical treatments are typically incorporated after biological treatment methods or bio machines co cultivation can be applied in various ways in hybrid systems in numerous studies these hybrid approaches have been shown to reduce energy usage while also increasing the separation efficiency of water pollutants 139 however while several hybrid strategies were used in wwt to remove eps 140 only the diverse nature of bio machines and their impact on eps were prioritized in this part co cultivation cultures are microorganisms associated with one another 141 such as bacteria with fungi algae with bacteria fungi with algae microscopic bio machines such as bacteria fungi and algae are well known for their capacity to break down a wide spectrum of organic compounds in a controlled environment making them suitable candidates for the mitigation of organic pollutants including eps when algae fungus and bacteria cohabit in various natural and artificial environments their correlation and interaction which can range from hostility to cooperation can impact the interacting partners survival colonization spatial dispersion and stress resistance the eps deterioration may be influenced by coexistence behavior 110 as a result polymicrobial cultivation methods must be used to gain a better knowledge of microbial dynamics in heterogeneous microbial communities as well as their impact on ecosystem processes mixed multi domain microbiomes have unique linkages and interactions that lead to more efficient organic pollution degradation and removal systems 142 microbial interactions between diverse model microbes revealed that native fungal and bacterial strains had the metabolic machinery to digest hazardous pollutants 143 and survive a high abundance of eps 144 compared to pure cultures or communities of either fungi or bacteria single domain systems some previous studies have indicated better biodegradation of specific contaminants when utilizing combination fungal bacterial treatments 110 ghorbannezhad et al 145 investigated the removal of pyrene 500 mg l 1 and tetracosane 1 w v either as single compounds or as a combination the degradation of pyrene and tetracosane was 60 76 and 73 48 respectively in sequential mixed cultures containing fungi and bacteria nearly 10 higher than traditional mixed cultures when pollutants were co degraded pyrene degradation increased by 24 65 and tetracosane degradation decreased by 6 41 the early attacks on hydrocarbons are carried out by fungi s non specified external enzymes delayed bacteria addition and co contamination would result in more fungal development which would enhance pyrene breakdown the findings demonstrated the need to have a sufficient understanding of the polluted site s features pollutants and oil degrading organisms 146 obtaining this knowledge and properly applying it such as adding bacteria to the contaminated culture later a new way of mixed cultures inoculation can be a promising strategy similarly despite recent research into using pure microalgal strains for wwt the symbiosis of algae and bacteria is successfully used for wwt systems 147 because microalgae may exploit inorganic substances for their development algae bacteria partnerships are an excellent choice for tertiary and scrape medications furthermore it does not urge optional contamination due to its potential to eliminate noxious pollutants in this manner 148 natural substrate artificial inoculation and colonization are three techniques used by the algal bacterial consortium many bacteria will develop a link with algae in the aquatic habitat acting as a natural water filtration system the inorganic chemicals were digested by a pairing of bacteria and algae where an innovative water eutrophication technique was exploited compared to algal bacterial systems solitary algae systems have very poor removal effectiveness 149 based on the critical review méndez garcía and garcía de llasera 150 found that microalgal biodegradation of pahs works well in association with bacterial co cultures algal bacterial consortia have sparked much interest in wwt in the recent two decades 151 and multi species coupling has been used to remove toxic contaminants such pcps pacs edcs pahs and agcs as well as a range of other eps 152 prosenc et al 153 compared the removal of 28 ecs from a lab scale monoculture of chlorella vulgaris and a mixed microalgal bacterial culture bisphenols bps 2018 eu watch list substances including neonicotinoids pacs selected transformation products the data demonstrated that in 11 days of incubation most of the bps tested were highly removable 67 in mixed culture where12 bps achieved excellent removal 90 which is 32 higher than the solo culture of c vulgaris erythromycin clarithromycin thiamethoxam estrone and estrone were all highly removable compounds on the eu 2018 840 watch list 100 imidacloprid thiacloprid and acetamiprid were all removable to varying degrees 40 65 in a mixed culture matrix estradiol thiamethoxam and imidacloprid were abiotically eliminated to a great amount the reduction efficiencies of pacs in c vulgaris and mixed cultures were comparable in mixed culture ibuprofen metoprolol and sulfamethoxazole were all highly removable 78 however carbamazepine was only marginally removed 12 overall the co cultivations or consortium of algae and bacteria improved the removal of most eps examined in the study compared to a single c vulgaris culture the fungi microalgae consortium also has much promise in terms of wwt 154 due to its low cost and great efficiency fungi assisted microalgae bio flocculation for microalgae harvesting and wwt at the same time which was previously overlooked has gotten much attention in the last decade co pelletization of microalgae with filamentous fungi has been created to collect microalgae by co pelletizing them into fungal pellets effectively 155 fungi and microalgae co pelletization can occur at any stage of the pelletization process due to interactions between microalgae cells and fungus spores these two harvesting methods are known as fungal pellet assisted fpa and fungal spore assisted fsa and microalgal harvesting methods according to chen et al 156 fpa had a greater harvest efficiency but fungal cultivation depleted nutrients if there is no need to introduce exogenous compounds or if the extrinsic substances are wastes fpa may be a preferable option the key mechanisms that explain the development of fungal algal pellets are electrostatic contacts hydrophobic interactions and interactions related to particular components on cell walls 157 the consortium of fungi and microalgae has the potential to remediate pharmaceutical and dye effluent using c vulgaris the filamentous fungus aspergillus niger and bio pellets made out of these microorganisms hultberg and bodin 158 studied whether fungal assisted algal harvesting may also remove chemicals from contaminated water a total of 38 pesticides were examined in this investigation and the concentrations of 17 of them were shown to be considerably lower in the bio pellet treatment than in the control fungi based flocculation technology is relatively new compared to algae bacteria co cultivation techniques there is currently only a little research in this sector of wwt and the concept of eps removal is still in its nascent stage 155 in brief the combination or co cultivation of these microbial bio machines into soil or water could aid in the fast elimination of pollutants although these consortia of indigenous strains can be effective in some situations their efficiency varies depending on the environment and operational conditions 159 5 influencing factors merits and demerits of microbial bio machines mediated remediation of ecs the performance of the bio machines is governed by different components such as ph temperature length of the process and concentration of the ecs hydraulic retention time hrt the ph of any remediation process involving bio machines is the imperative factor that can influence the outcome of some bio machines as ph impacts the ionization states of a variety of functional groups occurring on the surface of the biomass derived bio machines 116 any alteration in the ph of the system in which bio machines process might impact the reaction rate the charge of the system gets altered reducing the mitigation rate ecs most ecs can transform into precipitates at elevated ph changing the bio machine performance the bio machine productivity considerably varies with alteration in temperature the hrt can impact the ecs uptake processes in a few scenarios a shorter hrt could lead to deficient or incomplete elimination of ecs the ecs elimination procedure relies on the quantum of bio machines and hydraulic retention time the elimination rate improves with the high quantum of bio machines and hrt up to optimum levels the elimination competencies are substantially reduced in processes ahead of or beneath the optimal hrt 145 the smaller the ecs particle size the greater is the permeability boosting assimilation into biomass sourced bio machines and the success rate hangs on the extension availability of surface area the factors affecting biomass bio machines include surface area electrostatic function functional groups participating in the interface etc the exclusion rate enhanced the hrt between the ecs and the bio machines most ecs usually appear in water systems in minimal concentrations and their assessment is complex and necessitates many enhancements lower concentrations of ecs might also impact the performance of bio machines in a natural system contrary to a simulated system where many works are currently being reported 139 147 the current primary wastewater management methods are not cost effectively approachable with massive energy and labor requirements most notably these methodologies cannot eliminate a wide spectrum of ecs found in effluent consequently it is crucial to use the machinery that can overwhelm the constraints of such processes and bio machines appear to be a hopeful process for the mitigation of ecs the bio machines extend various improvements over other effluent management techniques non requirement of any chemical additives hence could work independently 131 148 although there are benefits of bio machines there are few demerits with bio machines bio machine adaptability in adverse conditions resistance to environmental fluctuations bio machine capability in scenarios of mass fabrication and environmental protection should be maximized recent bio machine utility via a combo of processes could increase ecs removal scientists are still operating on several constraints involving but not restricted to compound factors that must be augmented to remediate multiple ecs concurrently an elevated concentration of ecs in some systems can inhibit the performance of some bio machines 23 42 62 the operation or the rate of bio machines is restricted to the attributes of ecs and the type of effluent and functioning conditions the combination of bio machines with other management methods has been barely detailed in articles and is still under scrutiny only inadequate examinations have centered on incorporated approaches but there is still an exploration gap to be filled to expel ecs from effluent among the numerous treatment practices and techniques indisputable evaluation of the most suitable and beneficial solution for bio machines is not yet feasible further extensive research on bio machines to handle ecs is vital in addition bio machines remediation of ecs with a variety of models and constructions are essential examinations on real time functions are necessary to assess bio machines overall utility and pertinence 6 current status and future perspectives there are numerous advantages of bio machine enabled bioremediation there are few demerits associated with bioremediation via bio machines the adaptableness or flexibility of bio machines in adversative surroundings mitigation of complex emerging contaminants has not been extensively explored at a larger scale or commercial scale even though the application of bio machines in the field application is reaching consideration for its effectiveness in the elimination of ecs in many parts of the world the practical possibility of numerous integrated systems still requires widescale investigation ensuring the advance of appropriate integrated bio machines treatment modules the commercial sustainability of bio machines in larger scale appliances and possible fusion integrated systems is the most significant interest and concern for various stakeholders specific degradation pathways or work mechanics of bio machines and the metabolites arising out of ecs degradation are a substantial consequence for implementing a unique or specific integrated system the impact of different design and functioning factors and attributes must be decisively and acutely evaluated for this advanced integrated system either on a sizeable real time or pilot scale development in genetic engineering necessitates choosing and improving the efficiency of bio machines by incorporating these advancements for ecs degradation which can guarantee the technological and commercial sustainability of many integrated systems 7 conclusion this review depicts the development of processes and techniques their merits and demerits via the application of bio machines to mitigate emerging contaminants as bio machines offer better elimination effectiveness for a variety of ecs it can conclude that the use of bio machines in the future way of restitution of the environment via elimination of ecs although there are still few demerits in the application of bio machines and some ecs prove challenging to reclaim by bio machines the operational conditions such as ec load hrt and ph played a crucial role in attaining optimal elimination efficiencies of bio machines few works show that the removal efficiency of bio machines for handling ecs is inadequate hence integrated systems by modifying the conventional systems and integrating with bio machines is the way forward declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

introduction the global deficiency of potable water increased water consumption and overwhelming pollution has created a water deficit between demand and availability of fresh water to meet the requirement of increasing population of the world one fifth of the world s population especially in the middle east and north africa mena region suffers from severe water scarcity 1 2 mena containing only 1 4 of the global freshwater resources reports 60 population experiencing extreme water shortage 3 in addition to this increased water pollution and low rates of water recycling has created an alarming situation in mena region an estimated 57 of the wastewater collected at wastewater treatment plants returns to the environment untreated every year which accounts for 0 5 2 5 of the region s gross domestic product gdp 4 specifically in developing countries the cost of wastewater treatment has severely hampered the management of wastewater consequently there is a dire need of developing cost effective and efficient methods for treatment of wastewater heavy consumption of water and use of dyes in textile pharmaceutical paper leather and other industries result in accumulation and release of enormous quantity of colourful effluents causing devastating effects on aquatic biota agriculture and human health 5 6 due to stringent regulations about effluent discharge into the environment colour removal from wastewater has emerged as a significant concern for dye manufacturing and consuming industries 7 the recent trends in green technology have necessitated the development of economically viable and eco friendly methods to tackle with the coloured effluents among various dye removal wastewater treatment technologies adsorption process has been acknowledged as the most cost effective environmentally friendly and technologically advanced method 8 10 activated carbon acts as a benchmark in the adsorption technology for removal of myriads of both organic and inorganic pollutants due to its huge surface area 500 2000 m2 g and porosity 11 nevertheless the production of activated carbon possessing such characteristics requires high temperature and or prolonged duration which makes it tremendously costly 12 13 the production of low cost adsorbent via economically feasible method is highly desirable besides growing research efforts has led the incorporation of transition metal oxide nanomaterials into benchmark activated carbon causing synergetic effects for the adsorptive removal of dyes from wastewater 14 16 it has been reported that apart from functional groups of activated carbon metal oxides provide abundant hydroxyl and oxygen linkage sites for mutual interaction with dye which greatly improves the adsorption capacity of activated carbon based metal oxide nanocomposite for instance iron oxide fe3o4 17 19 copper oxide 20 23 and zinc oxide zno loaded activated carbon 24 25 have demonstrated remarkably high adsorption capacity of cationic dyes due to efficient inter diffusion of dye the earth abundant environmentally friendly functional copper oxide can bind to activated carbon via oxygen and copper sites thereby effectively enhancing the performance of nanocomposite adsorbents by imparting synergetic adsorption 23 26 27 methylene blue mb c16h18n3scl a heterocyclic aromatic phenothiazine dye as illustrated in fig 1 is cationic in nature having molecular weight 319 85 g mol and ƛmax at 664 nm wavelength it is an odorless green powder that turns blue in aqueous solution at room temperature it is used in a variety of industries such as textile industry paper industry staining tissue cultures and aquaculture due to its colour mb as a wastewater treatment effluent presents many problems in terms of scale up issues 28 additionally there is scope for developing green synthesis methods to prepare efficient adsorbents with synergetic effects to meet the requirements of wastewater treatment effectively consequently present study was aimed at utilizing prosopis juliflora mesquite plant s pods a potential invader species 29 30 to prepare activated carbon by simple low temperature method in minimum possible time duration the activated carbon based copper oxide nanocomposites cuo ac were prepared by facile in situ synthesis method at room temperature for the adsorptive removal of mb dye from aqueous solution all the reactions in both procedures were carried out at low temperature and shortest possible duration which ensure their cost effectiveness and economic feasibility the adsorption characteristics have been investigated in term of kinetics and thermodynamics to elucidate its mechanism 2 experimental section 2 1 materials required copper sulphate cuso4 4h2o 99 99 oxalic acid 99 sodium hydroxide 96 4 mb c16h18n3sc 99 8 and potassium hydroxide koh 98 were obtained from sigma aldrich usa and were used without further purification the pods of p juliflora were collected from the valleys of north al batinah region oman cleaned and washed with distilled water dried in oven at temperature of 130 c for an hour and used for preparation of activated carbon as per the following procedure 2 2 preparation of activated carbon the dried pods of p juliflora were chopped down into tiny pieces and burned on an electric burner for 5 min at 180 c until they turned into charcoal the charcoal was ground into fine powder with mortar and pestle and then homogenized using motorized automatic sieve shaker with a capacity of 240 μ mesh size to obtain precise particles the prepared coal was transferred to a clean sample container for storage for activation of the charcoal 1 g of p juliflora biochar was added to 100 ml of 3 74 m koh aqueous solution the mixture was kept at stirring for 24 h followed by vacuum filtration the supernatant was dried out in oven for 24 h at 110 c the activated carbon was kept stored in a sealed glass vial for further analysis 2 3 preparation of activated carbon based copper oxide nanocomposite the in situ synthesis of cuo ac activated carbon nanocomposite was done by modified co precipitation method 31 10 mg activated carbon was dispersed in 10 ml of deionised water by ultrasonication for 2 h at room temperature to form a homogenous carbon dispersion 20 mmol cuso4 was mixed with the dispersion under constant stirring 40 mmol oxalic acid was added to above mixture as a reducing agent along with 1 m naoh drop wise addition until the solution turned brownish black the mixture was stirred continuously for 30 min till solution colour changed to black which indicated the formation of cuo ac nanocomposites the precipitates were centrifuged at 3000 rpm washed with distilled water and ethanol followed by drying at 60 c for 1 h 2 4 characterization of the synthesized nanocomposite x ray diffraction xrd analysis was performed using d8 discover bruker x ray diffractometer in the range of 10 to 80 to determine the structure of synthesized compound the ftir analysis was performed using perkin elmer 1000 over scanning range of 400 4000 cm 1 the surface morphology and elemental analysis of the nanocomposite were obtained using jeol jsm 6510la sem microscope coupled with edx oxford instruments microscope 2 5 adsorption studies an aqueous stock solution of mb dye 50 mg l was diluted to prepare desired concentrations of 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l the as synthesized cuo ac nanocomposite was tested as adsorbent for the removal of mb from aqueous solutions using batch adsorption technique as described below the effect of adsorbent amount on mb removal efficiency was studied by carrying out batch adsorption experiments at ph 7 using five different absorbent dosages i e 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 1 g in 50 ml of aqueous dye solution with initial dye concentration 10 mg l the solution ph was adjusted using 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh solution moreover the effect of contact time and initial dye concentration were evaluated by adding 0 1 g adsorbent a fixed amount into 50 ml of aqueous mb solution with variable initial concentrations in the range of 5 25 mg l at neutral ph for varying contact time duration 5 30 min further thermodynamic studies were performed keeping the amount of adsorbent fixed 0 1 g for different initial dye concentrations 5 25 mg l at different working temperatures ranging from 293 to 313 k at neutral ph the adsorption kinetics for different initial concentrations of mb 5 25 mg l were investigated using 0 1 g adsorbent in varying contact times of 5 to 60 min at room temperature and neutral ph for each experiment aliquots 1 ml of supernatant dye solution were taken at fixed intervals centrifuged at 3000 rpm eppendorf 5702 for 5 min followed by measuring the absorbance at 664 nm wavelength each sample measurement was repeated twice for error minimization the adsorption capacity of cuo ac nanocomposite in mg g and its percentage removal were calculated using following equations 1 q c i c f v w 2 removal c i c f c i 100 where c i and cf mg l are the initial and final concentrations of dye before and after adsorption respectively v is the solution volume l and w is the adsorbent mass used g 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nanocomposite adsorbent fig 2 i a c represents the x ray diffraction images of cuo ac nanocomposite in comparison with cuo and ac activated carbon two main diffraction peaks at 35 5 and 38 6 representing 002 and 111 lattice planes in fig 2 ia mark the signature pattern of monoclinic crystal structure of cuo with lattice constants a 4 68 å b 3 41 å and c 5 13 å these findings have good corroboration with the standard pattern of cuo jcpds 80 1268 and literature 32 the diffraction peak at around 43 7 in fig 2 ib correspond to the 101 reflection of activated carbon its wide diffraction peak pattern indicates that activated carbon is amorphous which makes it an ideal substrate for formation of the nanocomposite materials 33 the diffraction peaks of cuo ac nanocomposite fig 2 ic are similar to cuo and activated carbon nonetheless the intensity 101 reflection of activated carbon has been found to decrease due to in situ synthesis of nanocomposite 32 34 these results confirm that nanocomposite has been successfully synthesized under given experimental conditions the average crystallite size was determined using debye scherrer equation from the main intensity peaks and was found to be 28 1 nm the structural fingerprint can be obtained by ftir analysis of prepared samples of ac and cuo ac nanocomposite as presented in fig 2 ii a b the ftir spectrum of activated carbon fig 2 iia shows a prominent spectral peak at around 3400 cm 1 which is assigned to stretching vibrational mode of hydroxyl groups 35 whereas peaks at 1650 and 1050 cm 1 are ascribed to co and co vibrational bands of aliphatic groups 36 37 respectively the ftir spectral details of cuo ac nanocomposite as illustrated in fig 2 iib highlights a broad spectral region at around 3000 3600 cm 1 for stretching mode of hydroxyl groups peaks at 770 590 and 445 cm 1 are designated to the cuo vibrational modes in the sample 36 38 signature peaks of metal oxide and activated carbon confirm the successful synthesis of cuo loaded with activated carbon it is noteworthy that both the intensity and width of the peak assigned to hydroxyl groups have changed in the nanocomposite which probably explains the surface hydroxyl groups of copper oxide the representative sem images of copper oxide and cuo ac nanocomposite are illustrated in fig 2 iii a b it is evident from fig 2 iiia that cuo nanoparticles have grown in a non uniform morphology with clustered agglomerates cuo nanomaterials have particle sizes ranging from a few nanometers to several micrometres on the other hand fig 2 iiib clearly depicts that combining with activated carbon cuo particles have scattered themselves over the surface of activated carbon with strong binding the surface functional groups of activated carbon may act as anchor sites to bind cuo during in situ synthesis leading to its uniform scattering and binding over the surface furthermore fig 2 iv a b reveals the elemental composition of cuo and cuo ac nanocomposite it is evident that no elements other than copper oxygen and carbon are present providing a primitive proof of single phase cuo and its nancocomposite formation which is consistent with xrd results 3 2 influence of experimental variables on adsorption the adsorption ability of as synthesized cuo ac nanocomposite was compared with activated carbon by taking 0 1 g of each adsorbent for the removal of 10 mg l mb at room temperature and neutral ph fig 3a depicts difference in the maximum absorption of dye in the presence of ac and cuo ac whereby the nanocomposite has shown better adsorption ability verifying our hypothesis the adsorbent dosage is a paramount factor which strongly affects the extent of adsorption on the surface of adsorbent fig 3b clearly demonstrate the relationship of adsorbent amount with adsorption capacity the absorbance of 10 mg l mb solution gradually decreases with increasing the amount of cuo ac nanocomposite adsorbent from 0 02 to 0 1 g at 298 k the influence of experimental variables on removal efficiency and adsorption capacity such as initial dye concentration contact time solution ph adsorbent dosage and temperature were investigated and presented in fig 4 a e 3 2 1 adsorbent dosage fig 4a illustrates the influence of adsorbent dosage on mb removal efficiency and adsorption capacity q e of cuo ac nanocomposite under the experimental conditions of initial dye concentration 10 mg l ph 7 contact time 20 min and 298 k the removal efficiency was found to be directly influenced by adsorbent amount and increased from 83 to 97 with increasing adsorbent from 0 02 0 10 g whereas the increase in adsorbent amount has decreased the adsorption capacity from 21 to 5 mg g generally higher dosage ensures greater probability of active adsorption sites availability on surface of absorbent resulting in better removal efficiency due to competitive adsorption of dye onto adsorbent and also due to an adsorption desorption equilibrium occurring in the adsorption system complete removal could not be achieved on other hand decrease in the adsorption capacity of dye with adsorbent dosage could be attributed to the following reasons at low adsorbent amount in the solution mb molecules competed active adsorption sites of cuo ac nanocomposite and thus reached high adsorption capacity whereas aggregation of adsorbent would possibly have taken place at higher dosage in the given volume of solution reducing the available active sites therefore decreasing the adsorption capacity of mb similar findings were reported in literature 39 40 for adsorptive removal of heavy metals on activated carbon adsorbent keeping in view both the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity mg g 0 1 g cuo ac adsorbent was selected for the rest of experiments 3 2 2 contact time the contact time between adsorbent and adsorbate plays a vital role in adsorption which was experimentally tested for the adsorption of 10 mg l mb dye solution on 0 1 g cuo ac nanocomposite at 298 k and neutral ph for different contact durations fig 7b reveals 90 dye removal takes place within 10 min of contact which gradually increased to 97 in 30 min similarly the adsorption capacity mg g was changed from 24 to 27 mg g with increasing time from 5 to 30 min the adsorption amount was observed to be in the range of 5 30 mg g for very low adsorbent dosage and initial dye concentration used in the current study the initial rapid increase in adsorption of mb onto cuo ac nanocomposite refers to multiple factors such as availability of rich active sites high concentration gradient of mb and its diffusion rate adsorption energy of nanocomposite and its porous nature 39 41 the porous surface of nanocomposite is also confirmed by sem analysis fig 3iii a c 3 2 3 initial dye concentration the effect of initial dye concentration was studied for different mb concentrations 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l at ph 7 adsorbent dosage 0 1 g and contact time 20 min at 298 k as shown in fig 4c the mb dye removal sharply decreases from 96 to 81 with increasing concentration of mb from 5 to 25 mg l which is due to the widely accepted fact that at higher concentration of dye solution large amount of adsorbate competes with each other for available active sites moreover the number of available active sites reduces along with the successive progression of adsorption which eventually leads to low removal efficiency of mb at higher concentration 42 on contrary to that the adsorption capacity mg g increases from 2 5 to 12 5 mg g with increase in mb concentration from 0 02 to 0 1 mg l because higher mb concentration significantly strengthen the driving force to adequately overcome the resistance to mass transfer process between solid phase to liquid solution thereby increasing the adsorption capacity of mb the observed trends corroborate with reported literature findings on adsorption studies 17 43 44 3 2 4 solution ph the solution ph is a vital variable of solution phase adsorption process the effect of ph was investigated for ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 under experimental conditions of initial mb concentration 10 mg l adsorbent dosage 0 1 g and contact time 20 min at 298 k as shown in fig 4d with increasing ph from 3 to 7 both removal efficiency and adsorption capacity mg g increase from 76 and 3 82 mg g to 96 and 5 mg g respectively followed by nearly saturation 91 and 4 81 mg g at basic ph ranges pointing towards multiple phenomena involved in mb adsorption process such as nature of dye molecule surface charge of adsorbent and mode of interactions electrostatic interaction van der waals interaction and hydrogen bonding at acidic ph range 3 5 mb having pka 3 exists as protonated form mb and thus competes with excessively available h which hinders its adsorption 45 46 moreover the surface charge pzc of nanocomposite was found to be at ph 5 58 fig s1 implying positive surface below this ph value and interestingly the hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on the surface of activated carbon get protonated at acidic ph both of these factors contribute to hinder the adsorption of mb dye onto cuo ac at acidic ph the negatively charged surface of nanocomposite beyond pzc value greatly favours the adsorption of mb mainly through the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding between nitro group of mb and surface hydroxyl groups 47 whereas at basic ph range 9 11 the negatively charged hydroxyl ions oh compete with the dye for cuo ac nanocomposite surface so fewer active adsorption sites are available which leads to less removal as illustrated in fig 4d nonetheless both highly acidic or basic ph ranges cause leaching of cuo from the nanocomposite to some extent though suggesting its instability and ineffectiveness for adsorption at extreme ph values 23 similar observation for adsorptive removal of dyes over copper oxide has been reported previously 47 3 2 5 solution temperature the effect of temperature was studied for different solution temperatures 293 298 303 308 and 313 k at ph 7 adsorbent dosage 0 1 g initial dye concentration 10 mg l and contact time 20 min as shown in fig 4e the mb dye removal sharply increases from 86 to 97 with increasing solution temperature from 293 to 313 k which indicates the endothermic nature of adsorption generally adsorption of adsorbate on adsorbent surfaces involves the release of heat which hinders mass transfer process at higher temperatures but in case of low adsorbate initial concentration the exothermicity effect negligibly affect the adsorption process 48 as observed in the current study the observed behaviour can be attributed to the fact that increment in solution temperature enhances the availability of surface active sites and reduces the diffusion resistance of mb to nanocomposite thereby facilitating its adsorption similar observation has been reported by other researchers for adsorption of dyes onto metal oxide adsorbents 17 39 3 3 adsorption kinetics studies the kinetic study of adsorption is a key to understand its mechanism by exploring the mass transfer of adsorbate from liquid phase to solid surface of adsorbent 49 the adsorption kinetics for different initial concentrations of mb dye adsorption on cuo ac nanocomposite at 298 k is investigated in this work the so far obtained experimental data was plotted for various kinetic models such as pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso as presented in table 1 the best fitted model was obtained by finding its reliability in expressing the experimental qe values and r2 the kinetic model equations are as following 50 3 pfo q t q e 1 exp k 1 t 4 pso q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t in these eqs 3 4 q e and q t are the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent mg g at equilibrium and at any time t interval respectively whereas k 1 and k 2 are the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 and pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 respectively a graphically non linear relationship between q t versus t provides values of rate constant k and q e for both pfo and pso the data from these models is presented in table 1 and fig 5 a b in contrast to pfo model results of pso shows the value of correlation factor r2 closest to 1 as shown in table 1 authenticating the mb adsorption kinetics onto nanocomposite best fits and follows the pseudo second order model on other hand pfo has r2 value far from 1 indicating its lack of applicability to the current study these observations prove that pseudo second order kinetics best explain the mb dye adsorptive removal by cuo ac nanocomposite over entire concentration range 3 4 evaluation of adsorption equilibrium isotherm the equilibrium study of adsorption describes the partitioning of adsorbate between solid adsorbent and liquid solution at equilibrium with respect to adsorbate concentration in the present study the well known equibrium adsorption isotherms such as langmuir and freundlich at different temperatures 293 313 k were investigated to obtain information about both the mechanism of adsorption and maximum adsorption capacity q max of adsorbent as presented in table 2 the langmuir adsorption isotherm relies on a basic assumption of monolayer adsorption on a homogenous surface which can be represented mathematically by the following equation 5 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where q m mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity and k l l mg is langmuir constant refers to the affinity of adsorbent to adsorbate the values of q m and k l were calculated from non linear regression analysis of plot q e versus c e as shown in fig 6a the feasibility of adsorption can also be obtained from the fundamental characteristics of the langmuir isotherm by a dimensionless equilibrium parameter r l which is defined by the following equation 6 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c 0 mg l is the initial concentration of dye the value of rl ranges from 0 to 1 indicating the type of adsorption to be either unfavorable rl 0 linear rl 1 favourable 0 rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 47 the freundlich isotherm entails the multilayer adsorption on heterogenous surface system which can be represented by the following equation 51 7 q e k f c 1 n where q e is the equilibrium capacity of dye being adsorbed on a given mass of adsorbent mg g c e is the equilibrium concentration of the dye solution after adsorption mg l k f is the freundlich constant refers to the adsorption capacity and n is a constant indicating the adsorption strength table 2 presents the summarized results of isotherms constants which were retrieved by non linear regression analysis of the plots which are displayed in fig 6b it is evident from table 2 and fig 6 a b that correlation coefficient perfectly fits the langmuir isotherm r2 0 998 ensuring the monolayer adsorption of mb over cuo ac nanocomposite at all temperature conditions with maximum adsorption capacity q m to be 55 mg g at 313 k for a low initial concentration range of dye 5 25 mg l the value of q m was found to increase from 23 21 to 54 74 mg g with increasing temperature from 293 to 313 k which was further supported by higher values of kl at high temperature assuring enhanced affinity of mb to cuo ac nanocomposite surface all the values of rl eq 6 were found to be less than 1 0 1 0 5 as shown in table 3 confirm that adsorption of mb is favourable over cuo ac nanocomposite under experimental conditions used in this study on other hand lower values of r2 for freundlich isotherm than langmuir demonstrate minimal agreement of the experimental results as presented in table 2 these findings affirm that the langmuir isotherm best describes the mb adsorption over cuo ac nanocomposite in the current study 3 5 evaluation of adsorption thermodynamics the thermodynamic parameters such as change in gibbs free energy δg change in entropy δs and change in enthalpy δh for adsorption of mb over cuo ac nanocomposite from aqueous solutions were calculated using vant hoff s equation 51 52 8 ln k d δh rt δs r where δh δs r t and k d refer to enthalpy change entropy change universal gas constant temperature and distribution constant respectively the slope and intercept of the linearized plot provide values of δh and δs the k d value can be determined utilizing equilibrium adsorption capacity q e and equilibrium concentration c e of mb via following relation 9 k q e c e δg provides the basic criteria of spontaneity of any process which was calculated using following relation 10 δ g δ h t δ s fig 7 illustrates the vant hoff s equation eq 8 fitting for adsorption of mb for 10 mg l initial concentration the linear fitting with r2 nearly equal to 1 approves the best fitting of vant hoff s equation to mb adsorption process table 4 summarizes the thermodynamic parameters for adsorption of mb over cuo ac nanocomposite from aqueous solutions the linearized relation of lnk and 1 t has provided the value of enthalpy and entropy of adsorption to be 22 03 kj mol and 95 12 j k mol respectively the positive heat of enthalpy confirms the endothermicity of adsorption alternatively the increase of temperature has favoured the mb adsorption the reason could be attributed to the fact that number of active sites were enhanced with rise in temperature thereby minimizing the resistance to diffusion of mb to nanocomposite adsorbent and hence facilitating its adsorption 48 the spontaneity of mb adsorption onto nanocomposite was indicated by a positive value of δs which implies the rise in degree of randomness due to adsorption of mb on to adsorbent surface furthermore the gibbs free energy values were negative and found to gradually decrease from 5 865 to 7 736 kj mol with increasing temperature from 293 to 313 k confirm that mb adsorption over cuo ac nanocomposite is spontaneous and favourable in nature under studied experimental conditions similar to reported by other researchers 17 the low values of δh less than 50 kj mol further confirm the physical adsorption via van der waals interaction 53 3 6 adsorption mechanism the detailed investigation of mb adsorption over cuo ac nanocomposite adsorption demonstrates the mechanism of adsorption involving different kinds of interactions as illustrated by fig 8 the effect of solution ph on adsorption capacity predicts the electrostatic interaction between positively charged adsorbed mb dye and surface hydroxyl groups oh of the adsorbent both adsorption isotherm and kinetics suggest the van der waals interactions leading to physical adsorption the ftir analysis assures strong interactions between adsorbed mb and surface of nanocomposite via hydrogen bonding there could be some other kind of interaction be involved such as n π interaction due to structural aromatic rings making adsorptive removal of mb using cuo ac nanocomposite to be favourable 23 54 mo adsorbent surface mb mo adsorbent surface mb where m stands for metal ions in the nanocomposite both the surface charge and hydroxyl groups play vital role in adsorption over metal oxide adsorbent it has been reported that metal oxides in their aqueous dispersions develop an outer surface layer of hydroxyl ions due to water interaction besides the surface charge of metal oxide varies depending upon solution ph from negative at low ph to positive at high ph 52 53 3 7 proof of removal of mb by adsorption over cuo ac nanocomposite to ascertain the adsorption of mb onto cuo ac nanocomposite ftir analysis was performed for mb cuo ac nanocomposite before and after adsorption of mb as presented in fig 9 a c there are distinct peaks in cuo ac nanocomposite ftir spectrum fig 9a same as fig 2 iib namely 3430 1650 1107 870 and 605 cm 1 assigned to oh stretching vibrations hoh bending vibrations and copper oxide skeletal groups 38 fig 9b depicting the ftir spectrum of cuo ac nanocomposite after mb adsorption shows few extra peaks at 2870 1410 and 1107 cm 1 assigned to stretching vibrations of methylene group and stretching vibrations of aromatic rings 55 the origin of those peaks can clearly be evident by comparison with ftir of pure mb fig 9c authenticating the signature pattern of mb being adsorbed on cuo ac nanocomposite the ftir of mb fig 9c indicates two major peaks at 2816 and 2720 cm 1 for the stretching vibration modes of ch aromatic group and methyl ch3 group 37 a broad spectral region from 1591 to 1363 cm 1 is also assigned to the aromatic rings of mb whereas spectral peak at 1170 cm 1 belongs to double bond skeleton cc of the aromatic rings 56 moreover slight variation in peak intensities and positions was observed after adsorption of mb over cuo ac nanocomposite the slight variation in conjoint peaks positioned at 524 and 445 cm 1 to 500 and 415 cm 1 manifest the adsorption of mb dye due to electrostatic interactions 37 besides reduction in peak intensities of 1591 1363 cm 1 not only further indicates the adsorption of dye over cuo ac nanocomposite but also points to the stability of nanocomposite after adsorption 23 the visual manifestation of adsorptive removal of mb by cuo ac nanocomposite is shown in fig 9d indicating a vivid colour transition from dark blue to faded colourless dye solution after adsorption these findings indicate that cuo ac nanocomposite as a low cost adsorbent could be potential candidate for economic and effective removal of a range of wastewater pollutants 3 8 recyclability performance generally the economic feasibility of any adsorbent governs its practical applicability which undoubtably depends upon recyclability efficiency of the adsorbent we have investigated the recyclability performance of adsorbent for mb removal for four cycles by monitoring its adsorption capacity and percentage removal as presented in fig 10 the adsorption experiment was performed at room temperature neutral ph using 0 1 g cuo ac nanocomposite in 10 mg l mb dye solution for 30 min the retrieved adsorbent was washed with dilute ethanol 2 10 3 m followed by drying after each experimental run fig 10 illustrates that adsorption capacity of cuo ac nanocomposite sustains till four experiments which guarantee its adsorptive performance 3 9 comparison of mb adsorption capacity of cuo ac nanocomposite with other adsorbents the comparison of adsorbent capacity of synthesized nanocomposite for mb uptake with other reported adsorbents is summarized in table 5 according to table 5 the adsorption capacity of cuo ac is comparable to other similar structured adsorbents which authenticates its potential for wastewater treatment nevertheless the observed discrepancies in the adsorption capacities of different kind of adsorbents are mainly attributed to the differences in experimental conditions and geometric configuration of adsorbent 4 conclusions the invading weed p juliflora pods were recycled to produce activated carbon at low temperature 180 c for the preparation of an integrated adsorbent cuo ac nanocomposites were successfully prepared by facile in situ synthesis method at room temperature for subsequent application of mb removal from aqueous solution the detailed material characterization revealed the formation of single phase monoclinic copper oxide impregnated with activated carbon having porous surface the maximum mb was adsorbed at around neutral ph 95 the adsorption capacity of mb onto cuo ac nanocomposite was found to increase with increasing solution ph from ph 3 to 7 and temperature from 293 to 313 k the adsorption mechanism preferably involved both electrostatic charge interaction between negatively charged surface of cuo ac nanocomposite and positively charged polar groups of mb and hydrogen bonding between surface hydroxyl groups and lone pair electrons of mb the kinetic data revealed that adsorption followed pseudo second order kinetics and best fitting to the langmuir isotherm model the thermodynamics investigation depicted the endothermic nature of adsorption with high feasibility at higher temperature the synthesized nanocomposite presented stability and recyclability for four consecutive adsorption experiments these findings demonstrated that cuo ac nanocomposite could be a promising candidate for wastewater treatment credit

friendly and green synthesis approach cuo ac nanocomposites were characterized by xrd sem edx and ftir and tested for adsorption kinetics isotherm thermodynamics mechanism and effect of experimental variables on removal of mb from aqueous solution the obtained results revealed that 97 mb removal over cuo ac was achieved within 15 min by using 0 1 g adsorbent dosage 10 mg l mb at neutral ph and 313 k the monolayer adsorption of mb was found to be favourable with maximum adsorption capacity to be 54 73 mg g at 313 k both the gradual decrease in values of δg 5 865 kj mol at 293 k to 7 71 kj mol at 313 k and positive values of δs 95 12 j k mol and δh 22 035 kj mol are indicative of spontaneity and endothermicity of mb adsorption in the current study under studied experimental conditions cuo ac nanocomposite has demonstrated stability and recyclability to four adsorption cycles with nearly same adsorption efficiency these findings prove that cuo ac nanocomposite can be utilized as an excellent adsorbent for wastewater treatment at wider scale graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords copper oxide nanocomposites cationic dye decontamination adsorption prosopis juliflora 1 introduction the global deficiency of potable water increased water consumption and overwhelming pollution has created a water deficit between demand and availability of fresh water to meet the requirement of increasing population of the world one fifth of the world s population especially in the middle east and north africa mena region suffers from severe water scarcity 1 2 mena containing only 1 4 of the global freshwater resources reports 60 population experiencing extreme water shortage 3 in addition to this increased water pollution and low rates of water recycling has created an alarming situation in mena region an estimated 57 of the wastewater collected at wastewater treatment plants returns to the environment untreated every year which accounts for 0 5 2 5 of the region s gross domestic product gdp 4 specifically in developing countries the cost of wastewater treatment has severely hampered the management of wastewater consequently there is a dire need of developing cost effective and efficient methods for treatment of wastewater heavy consumption of water and use of dyes in textile pharmaceutical paper leather and other industries result in accumulation and release of enormous quantity of colourful effluents causing devastating effects on aquatic biota agriculture and human health 5 6 due to stringent regulations about effluent discharge into the environment colour removal from wastewater has emerged as a significant concern for dye manufacturing and consuming industries 7 the recent trends in green technology have necessitated the development of economically viable and eco friendly methods to tackle with the coloured effluents among various dye removal wastewater treatment technologies adsorption process has been acknowledged as the most cost effective environmentally friendly and technologically advanced method 8 10 activated carbon acts as a benchmark in the adsorption technology for removal of myriads of both organic and inorganic pollutants due to its huge surface area 500 2000 m2 g and porosity 11 nevertheless the production of activated carbon possessing such characteristics requires high temperature and or prolonged duration which makes it tremendously costly 12 13 the production of low cost adsorbent via economically feasible method is highly desirable besides growing research efforts has led the incorporation of transition metal oxide nanomaterials into benchmark activated carbon causing synergetic effects for the adsorptive removal of dyes from wastewater 14 16 it has been reported that apart from functional groups of activated carbon metal oxides provide abundant hydroxyl and oxygen linkage sites for mutual interaction with dye which greatly improves the adsorption capacity of activated carbon based metal oxide nanocomposite for instance iron oxide fe3o4 17 19 copper oxide 20 23 and zinc oxide zno loaded activated carbon 24 25 have demonstrated remarkably high adsorption capacity of cationic dyes due to efficient inter diffusion of dye the earth abundant environmentally friendly functional copper oxide can bind to activated carbon via oxygen and copper sites thereby effectively enhancing the performance of nanocomposite adsorbents by imparting synergetic adsorption 23 26 27 methylene blue mb c16h18n3scl a heterocyclic aromatic phenothiazine dye as illustrated in fig 1 is cationic in nature having molecular weight 319 85 g mol and ƛmax at 664 nm wavelength it is an odorless green powder that turns blue in aqueous solution at room temperature it is used in a variety of industries such as textile industry paper industry staining tissue cultures and aquaculture due to its colour mb as a wastewater treatment effluent presents many problems in terms of scale up issues 28 additionally there is scope for developing green synthesis methods to prepare efficient adsorbents with synergetic effects to meet the requirements of wastewater treatment effectively consequently present study was aimed at utilizing prosopis juliflora mesquite plant s pods a potential invader species 29 30 to prepare activated carbon by simple low temperature method in minimum possible time duration the activated carbon based copper oxide nanocomposites cuo ac were prepared by facile in situ synthesis method at room temperature for the adsorptive removal of mb dye from aqueous solution all the reactions in both procedures were carried out at low temperature and shortest possible duration which ensure their cost effectiveness and economic feasibility the adsorption characteristics have been investigated in term of kinetics and thermodynamics to elucidate its mechanism 2 experimental section 2 1 materials required copper sulphate cuso4 4h2o 99 99 oxalic acid 99 sodium hydroxide 96 4 mb c16h18n3sc 99 8 and potassium hydroxide koh 98 were obtained from sigma aldrich usa and were used without further purification the pods of p juliflora were collected from the valleys of north al batinah region oman cleaned and washed with distilled water dried in oven at temperature of 130 c for an hour and used for preparation of activated carbon as per the following procedure 2 2 preparation of activated carbon the dried pods of p juliflora were chopped down into tiny pieces and burned on an electric burner for 5 min at 180 c until they turned into charcoal the charcoal was ground into fine powder with mortar and pestle and then homogenized using motorized automatic sieve shaker with a capacity of 240 μ mesh size to obtain precise particles the prepared coal was transferred to a clean sample container for storage for activation of the charcoal 1 g of p juliflora biochar was added to 100 ml of 3 74 m koh aqueous solution the mixture was kept at stirring for 24 h followed by vacuum filtration the supernatant was dried out in oven for 24 h at 110 c the activated carbon was kept stored in a sealed glass vial for further analysis 2 3 preparation of activated carbon based copper oxide nanocomposite the in situ synthesis of cuo ac activated carbon nanocomposite was done by modified co precipitation method 31 10 mg activated carbon was dispersed in 10 ml of deionised water by ultrasonication for 2 h at room temperature to form a homogenous carbon dispersion 20 mmol cuso4 was mixed with the dispersion under constant stirring 40 mmol oxalic acid was added to above mixture as a reducing agent along with 1 m naoh drop wise addition until the solution turned brownish black the mixture was stirred continuously for 30 min till solution colour changed to black which indicated the formation of cuo ac nanocomposites the precipitates were centrifuged at 3000 rpm washed with distilled water and ethanol followed by drying at 60 c for 1 h 2 4 characterization of the synthesized nanocomposite x ray diffraction xrd analysis was performed using d8 discover bruker x ray diffractometer in the range of 10 to 80 to determine the structure of synthesized compound the ftir analysis was performed using perkin elmer 1000 over scanning range of 400 4000 cm 1 the surface morphology and elemental analysis of the nanocomposite were obtained using jeol jsm 6510la sem microscope coupled with edx oxford instruments microscope 2 5 adsorption studies an aqueous stock solution of mb dye 50 mg l was diluted to prepare desired concentrations of 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l the as synthesized cuo ac nanocomposite was tested as adsorbent for the removal of mb from aqueous solutions using batch adsorption technique as described below the effect of adsorbent amount on mb removal efficiency was studied by carrying out batch adsorption experiments at ph 7 using five different absorbent dosages i e 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 1 g in 50 ml of aqueous dye solution with initial dye concentration 10 mg l the solution ph was adjusted using 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh solution moreover the effect of contact time and initial dye concentration were evaluated by adding 0 1 g adsorbent a fixed amount into 50 ml of aqueous mb solution with variable initial concentrations in the range of 5 25 mg l at neutral ph for varying contact time duration 5 30 min further thermodynamic studies were performed keeping the amount of adsorbent fixed 0 1 g for different initial dye concentrations 5 25 mg l at different working temperatures ranging from 293 to 313 k at neutral ph the adsorption kinetics for different initial concentrations of mb 5 25 mg l were investigated using 0 1 g adsorbent in varying contact times of 5 to 60 min at room temperature and neutral ph for each experiment aliquots 1 ml of supernatant dye solution were taken at fixed intervals centrifuged at 3000 rpm eppendorf 5702 for 5 min followed by measuring the absorbance at 664 nm wavelength each sample measurement was repeated twice for error minimization the adsorption capacity of cuo ac nanocomposite in mg g and its percentage removal were calculated using following equations 1 q c i c f v w 2 removal c i c f c i 100 where c i and cf mg l are the initial and final concentrations of dye before and after adsorption respectively v is the solution volume l and w is the adsorbent mass used g 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nanocomposite adsorbent fig 2 i a c represents the x ray diffraction images of cuo ac nanocomposite in comparison with cuo and ac activated carbon two main diffraction peaks at 35 5 and 38 6 representing 002 and 111 lattice planes in fig 2 ia mark the signature pattern of monoclinic crystal structure of cuo with lattice constants a 4 68 å b 3 41 å and c 5 13 å these findings have good corroboration with the standard pattern of cuo jcpds 80 1268 and literature 32 the diffraction peak at around 43 7 in fig 2 ib correspond to the 101 reflection of activated carbon its wide diffraction peak pattern indicates that activated carbon is amorphous which makes it an ideal substrate for formation of the nanocomposite materials 33 the diffraction peaks of cuo ac nanocomposite fig 2 ic are similar to cuo and activated carbon nonetheless the intensity 101 reflection of activated carbon has been found to decrease due to in situ synthesis of nanocomposite 32 34 these results confirm that nanocomposite has been successfully synthesized under given experimental conditions the average crystallite size was determined using debye scherrer equation from the main intensity peaks and was found to be 28 1 nm the structural fingerprint can be obtained by ftir analysis of prepared samples of ac and cuo ac nanocomposite as presented in fig 2 ii a b the ftir spectrum of activated carbon fig 2 iia shows a prominent spectral peak at around 3400 cm 1 which is assigned to stretching vibrational mode of hydroxyl groups 35 whereas peaks at 1650 and 1050 cm 1 are ascribed to co and co vibrational bands of aliphatic groups 36 37 respectively the ftir spectral details of cuo ac nanocomposite as illustrated in fig 2 iib highlights a broad spectral region at around 3000 3600 cm 1 for stretching mode of hydroxyl groups peaks at 770 590 and 445 cm 1 are designated to the cuo vibrational modes in the sample 36 38 signature peaks of metal oxide and activated carbon confirm the successful synthesis of cuo loaded with activated carbon it is noteworthy that both the intensity and width of the peak assigned to hydroxyl groups have changed in the nanocomposite which probably explains the surface hydroxyl groups of copper oxide the representative sem images of copper oxide and cuo ac nanocomposite are illustrated in fig 2 iii a b it is evident from fig 2 iiia that cuo nanoparticles have grown in a non uniform morphology with clustered agglomerates cuo nanomaterials have particle sizes ranging from a few nanometers to several micrometres on the other hand fig 2 iiib clearly depicts that combining with activated carbon cuo particles have scattered themselves over the surface of activated carbon with strong binding the surface functional groups of activated carbon may act as anchor sites to bind cuo during in situ synthesis leading to its uniform scattering and binding over the surface furthermore fig 2 iv a b reveals the elemental composition of cuo and cuo ac nanocomposite it is evident that no elements other than copper oxygen and carbon are present providing a primitive proof of single phase cuo and its nancocomposite formation which is consistent with xrd results 3 2 influence of experimental variables on adsorption the adsorption ability of as synthesized cuo ac nanocomposite was compared with activated carbon by taking 0 1 g of each adsorbent for the removal of 10 mg l mb at room temperature and neutral ph fig 3a depicts difference in the maximum absorption of dye in the presence of ac and cuo ac whereby the nanocomposite has shown better adsorption ability verifying our hypothesis the adsorbent dosage is a paramount factor which strongly affects the extent of adsorption on the surface of adsorbent fig 3b clearly demonstrate the relationship of adsorbent amount with adsorption capacity the absorbance of 10 mg l mb solution gradually decreases with increasing the amount of cuo ac nanocomposite adsorbent from 0 02 to 0 1 g at 298 k the influence of experimental variables on removal efficiency and adsorption capacity such as initial dye concentration contact time solution ph adsorbent dosage and temperature were investigated and presented in fig 4 a e 3 2 1 adsorbent dosage fig 4a illustrates the influence of adsorbent dosage on mb removal efficiency and adsorption capacity q e of cuo ac nanocomposite under the experimental conditions of initial dye concentration 10 mg l ph 7 contact time 20 min and 298 k the removal efficiency was found to be directly influenced by adsorbent amount and increased from 83 to 97 with increasing adsorbent from 0 02 0 10 g whereas the increase in adsorbent amount has decreased the adsorption capacity from 21 to 5 mg g generally higher dosage ensures greater probability of active adsorption sites availability on surface of absorbent resulting in better removal efficiency due to competitive adsorption of dye onto adsorbent and also due to an adsorption desorption equilibrium occurring in the adsorption system complete removal could not be achieved on other hand decrease in the adsorption capacity of dye with adsorbent dosage could be attributed to the following reasons at low adsorbent amount in the solution mb molecules competed active adsorption sites of cuo ac nanocomposite and thus reached high adsorption capacity whereas aggregation of adsorbent would possibly have taken place at higher dosage in the given volume of solution reducing the available active sites therefore decreasing the adsorption capacity of mb similar findings were reported in literature 39 40 for adsorptive removal of heavy metals on activated carbon adsorbent keeping in view both the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity mg g 0 1 g cuo ac adsorbent was selected for the rest of experiments 3 2 2 contact time the contact time between adsorbent and adsorbate plays a vital role in adsorption which was experimentally tested for the adsorption of 10 mg l mb dye solution on 0 1 g cuo ac nanocomposite at 298 k and neutral ph for different contact durations fig 7b reveals 90 dye removal takes place within 10 min of contact which gradually increased to 97 in 30 min similarly the adsorption capacity mg g was changed from 24 to 27 mg g with increasing time from 5 to 30 min the adsorption amount was observed to be in the range of 5 30 mg g for very low adsorbent dosage and initial dye concentration used in the current study the initial rapid increase in adsorption of mb onto cuo ac nanocomposite refers to multiple factors such as availability of rich active sites high concentration gradient of mb and its diffusion rate adsorption energy of nanocomposite and its porous nature 39 41 the porous surface of nanocomposite is also confirmed by sem analysis fig 3iii a c 3 2 3 initial dye concentration the effect of initial dye concentration was studied for different mb concentrations 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l at ph 7 adsorbent dosage 0 1 g and contact time 20 min at 298 k as shown in fig 4c the mb dye removal sharply decreases from 96 to 81 with increasing concentration of mb from 5 to 25 mg l which is due to the widely accepted fact that at higher concentration of dye solution large amount of adsorbate competes with each other for available active sites moreover the number of available active sites reduces along with the successive progression of adsorption which eventually leads to low removal efficiency of mb at higher concentration 42 on contrary to that the adsorption capacity mg g increases from 2 5 to 12 5 mg g with increase in mb concentration from 0 02 to 0 1 mg l because higher mb concentration significantly strengthen the driving force to adequately overcome the resistance to mass transfer process between solid phase to liquid solution thereby increasing the adsorption capacity of mb the observed trends corroborate with reported literature findings on adsorption studies 17 43 44 3 2 4 solution ph the solution ph is a vital variable of solution phase adsorption process the effect of ph was investigated for ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 under experimental conditions of initial mb concentration 10 mg l adsorbent dosage 0 1 g and contact time 20 min at 298 k as shown in fig 4d with increasing ph from 3 to 7 both removal efficiency and adsorption capacity mg g increase from 76 and 3 82 mg g to 96 and 5 mg g respectively followed by nearly saturation 91 and 4 81 mg g at basic ph ranges pointing towards multiple phenomena involved in mb adsorption process such as nature of dye molecule surface charge of adsorbent and mode of interactions electrostatic interaction van der waals interaction and hydrogen bonding at acidic ph range 3 5 mb having pka 3 exists as protonated form mb and thus competes with excessively available h which hinders its adsorption 45 46 moreover the surface charge pzc of nanocomposite was found to be at ph 5 58 fig s1 implying positive surface below this ph value and interestingly the hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on the surface of activated carbon get protonated at acidic ph both of these factors contribute to hinder the adsorption of mb dye onto cuo ac at acidic ph the negatively charged surface of nanocomposite beyond pzc value greatly favours the adsorption of mb mainly through the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding between nitro group of mb and surface hydroxyl groups 47 whereas at basic ph range 9 11 the negatively charged hydroxyl ions oh compete with the dye for cuo ac nanocomposite surface so fewer active adsorption sites are available which leads to less removal as illustrated in fig 4d nonetheless both highly acidic or basic ph ranges cause leaching of cuo from the nanocomposite to some extent though suggesting its instability and ineffectiveness for adsorption at extreme ph values 23 similar observation for adsorptive removal of dyes over copper oxide has been reported previously 47 3 2 5 solution temperature the effect of temperature was studied for different solution temperatures 293 298 303 308 and 313 k at ph 7 adsorbent dosage 0 1 g initial dye concentration 10 mg l and contact time 20 min as shown in fig 4e the mb dye removal sharply increases from 86 to 97 with increasing solution temperature from 293 to 313 k which indicates the endothermic nature of adsorption generally adsorption of adsorbate on adsorbent surfaces involves the release of heat which hinders mass transfer process at higher temperatures but in case of low adsorbate initial concentration the exothermicity effect negligibly affect the adsorption process 48 as observed in the current study the observed behaviour can be attributed to the fact that increment in solution temperature enhances the availability of surface active sites and reduces the diffusion resistance of mb to nanocomposite thereby facilitating its adsorption similar observation has been reported by other researchers for adsorption of dyes onto metal oxide adsorbents 17 39 3 3 adsorption kinetics studies the kinetic study of adsorption is a key to understand its mechanism by exploring the mass transfer of adsorbate from liquid phase to solid surface of adsorbent 49 the adsorption kinetics for different initial concentrations of mb dye adsorption on cuo ac nanocomposite at 298 k is investigated in this work the so far obtained experimental data was plotted for various kinetic models such as pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso as presented in table 1 the best fitted model was obtained by finding its reliability in expressing the experimental qe values and r2 the kinetic model equations are as following 50 3 pfo q t q e 1 exp k 1 t 4 pso q t q e 2 k 2 t 1 q e k 2 t in these eqs 3 4 q e and q t are the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent mg g at equilibrium and at any time t interval respectively whereas k 1 and k 2 are the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 and pseudo second order rate constant g mg 1 min 1 respectively a graphically non linear relationship between q t versus t provides values of rate constant k and q e for both pfo and pso the data from these models is presented in table 1 and fig 5 a b in contrast to pfo model results of pso shows the value of correlation factor r2 closest to 1 as shown in table 1 authenticating the mb adsorption kinetics onto nanocomposite best fits and follows the pseudo second order model on other hand pfo has r2 value far from 1 indicating its lack of applicability to the current study these observations prove that pseudo second order kinetics best explain the mb dye adsorptive removal by cuo ac nanocomposite over entire concentration range 3 4 evaluation of adsorption equilibrium isotherm the equilibrium study of adsorption describes the partitioning of adsorbate between solid adsorbent and liquid solution at equilibrium with respect to adsorbate concentration in the present study the well known equibrium adsorption isotherms such as langmuir and freundlich at different temperatures 293 313 k were investigated to obtain information about both the mechanism of adsorption and maximum adsorption capacity q max of adsorbent as presented in table 2 the langmuir adsorption isotherm relies on a basic assumption of monolayer adsorption on a homogenous surface which can be represented mathematically by the following equation 5 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e where q m mg g is the maximum adsorption capacity and k l l mg is langmuir constant refers to the affinity of adsorbent to adsorbate the values of q m and k l were calculated from non linear regression analysis of plot q e versus c e as shown in fig 6a the feasibility of adsorption can also be obtained from the fundamental characteristics of the langmuir isotherm by a dimensionless equilibrium parameter r l which is defined by the following equation 6 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c 0 mg l is the initial concentration of dye the value of rl ranges from 0 to 1 indicating the type of adsorption to be either unfavorable rl 0 linear rl 1 favourable 0 rl 1 or irreversible rl 0 47 the freundlich isotherm entails the multilayer adsorption on heterogenous surface system which can be represented by the following equation 51 7 q e k f c 1 n where q e is the equilibrium capacity of dye being adsorbed on a given mass of adsorbent mg g c e is the equilibrium concentration of the dye solution after adsorption mg l k f is the freundlich constant refers to the adsorption capacity and n is a constant indicating the adsorption strength table 2 presents the summarized results of isotherms constants which were retrieved by non linear regression analysis of the plots which are displayed in fig 6b it is evident from table 2 and fig 6 a b that correlation coefficient perfectly fits the langmuir isotherm r2 0 998 ensuring the monolayer adsorption of mb over cuo ac nanocomposite at all temperature conditions with maximum adsorption capacity q m to be 55 mg g at 313 k for a low initial concentration range of dye 5 25 mg l the value of q m was found to increase from 23 21 to 54 74 mg g with increasing temperature from 293 to 313 k which was further supported by higher values of kl at high temperature assuring enhanced affinity of mb to cuo ac nanocomposite surface all the values of rl eq 6 were found to be less than 1 0 1 0 5 as shown in table 3 confirm that adsorption of mb is favourable over cuo ac nanocomposite under experimental conditions used in this study on other hand lower values of r2 for freundlich isotherm than langmuir demonstrate minimal agreement of the experimental results as presented in table 2 these findings affirm that the langmuir isotherm best describes the mb adsorption over cuo ac nanocomposite in the current study 3 5 evaluation of adsorption thermodynamics the thermodynamic parameters such as change in gibbs free energy δg change in entropy δs and change in enthalpy δh for adsorption of mb over cuo ac nanocomposite from aqueous solutions were calculated using vant hoff s equation 51 52 8 ln k d δh rt δs r where δh δs r t and k d refer to enthalpy change entropy change universal gas constant temperature and distribution constant respectively the slope and intercept of the linearized plot provide values of δh and δs the k d value can be determined utilizing equilibrium adsorption capacity q e and equilibrium concentration c e of mb via following relation 9 k q e c e δg provides the basic criteria of spontaneity of any process which was calculated using following relation 10 δ g δ h t δ s fig 7 illustrates the vant hoff s equation eq 8 fitting for adsorption of mb for 10 mg l initial concentration the linear fitting with r2 nearly equal to 1 approves the best fitting of vant hoff s equation to mb adsorption process table 4 summarizes the thermodynamic parameters for adsorption of mb over cuo ac nanocomposite from aqueous solutions the linearized relation of lnk and 1 t has provided the value of enthalpy and entropy of adsorption to be 22 03 kj mol and 95 12 j k mol respectively the positive heat of enthalpy confirms the endothermicity of adsorption alternatively the increase of temperature has favoured the mb adsorption the reason could be attributed to the fact that number of active sites were enhanced with rise in temperature thereby minimizing the resistance to diffusion of mb to nanocomposite adsorbent and hence facilitating its adsorption 48 the spontaneity of mb adsorption onto nanocomposite was indicated by a positive value of δs which implies the rise in degree of randomness due to adsorption of mb on to adsorbent surface furthermore the gibbs free energy values were negative and found to gradually decrease from 5 865 to 7 736 kj mol with increasing temperature from 293 to 313 k confirm that mb adsorption over cuo ac nanocomposite is spontaneous and favourable in nature under studied experimental conditions similar to reported by other researchers 17 the low values of δh less than 50 kj mol further confirm the physical adsorption via van der waals interaction 53 3 6 adsorption mechanism the detailed investigation of mb adsorption over cuo ac nanocomposite adsorption demonstrates the mechanism of adsorption involving different kinds of interactions as illustrated by fig 8 the effect of solution ph on adsorption capacity predicts the electrostatic interaction between positively charged adsorbed mb dye and surface hydroxyl groups oh of the adsorbent both adsorption isotherm and kinetics suggest the van der waals interactions leading to physical adsorption the ftir analysis assures strong interactions between adsorbed mb and surface of nanocomposite via hydrogen bonding there could be some other kind of interaction be involved such as n π interaction due to structural aromatic rings making adsorptive removal of mb using cuo ac nanocomposite to be favourable 23 54 mo adsorbent surface mb mo adsorbent surface mb where m stands for metal ions in the nanocomposite both the surface charge and hydroxyl groups play vital role in adsorption over metal oxide adsorbent it has been reported that metal oxides in their aqueous dispersions develop an outer surface layer of hydroxyl ions due to water interaction besides the surface charge of metal oxide varies depending upon solution ph from negative at low ph to positive at high ph 52 53 3 7 proof of removal of mb by adsorption over cuo ac nanocomposite to ascertain the adsorption of mb onto cuo ac nanocomposite ftir analysis was performed for mb cuo ac nanocomposite before and after adsorption of mb as presented in fig 9 a c there are distinct peaks in cuo ac nanocomposite ftir spectrum fig 9a same as fig 2 iib namely 3430 1650 1107 870 and 605 cm 1 assigned to oh stretching vibrations hoh bending vibrations and copper oxide skeletal groups 38 fig 9b depicting the ftir spectrum of cuo ac nanocomposite after mb adsorption shows few extra peaks at 2870 1410 and 1107 cm 1 assigned to stretching vibrations of methylene group and stretching vibrations of aromatic rings 55 the origin of those peaks can clearly be evident by comparison with ftir of pure mb fig 9c authenticating the signature pattern of mb being adsorbed on cuo ac nanocomposite the ftir of mb fig 9c indicates two major peaks at 2816 and 2720 cm 1 for the stretching vibration modes of ch aromatic group and methyl ch3 group 37 a broad spectral region from 1591 to 1363 cm 1 is also assigned to the aromatic rings of mb whereas spectral peak at 1170 cm 1 belongs to double bond skeleton cc of the aromatic rings 56 moreover slight variation in peak intensities and positions was observed after adsorption of mb over cuo ac nanocomposite the slight variation in conjoint peaks positioned at 524 and 445 cm 1 to 500 and 415 cm 1 manifest the adsorption of mb dye due to electrostatic interactions 37 besides reduction in peak intensities of 1591 1363 cm 1 not only further indicates the adsorption of dye over cuo ac nanocomposite but also points to the stability of nanocomposite after adsorption 23 the visual manifestation of adsorptive removal of mb by cuo ac nanocomposite is shown in fig 9d indicating a vivid colour transition from dark blue to faded colourless dye solution after adsorption these findings indicate that cuo ac nanocomposite as a low cost adsorbent could be potential candidate for economic and effective removal of a range of wastewater pollutants 3 8 recyclability performance generally the economic feasibility of any adsorbent governs its practical applicability which undoubtably depends upon recyclability efficiency of the adsorbent we have investigated the recyclability performance of adsorbent for mb removal for four cycles by monitoring its adsorption capacity and percentage removal as presented in fig 10 the adsorption experiment was performed at room temperature neutral ph using 0 1 g cuo ac nanocomposite in 10 mg l mb dye solution for 30 min the retrieved adsorbent was washed with dilute ethanol 2 10 3 m followed by drying after each experimental run fig 10 illustrates that adsorption capacity of cuo ac nanocomposite sustains till four experiments which guarantee its adsorptive performance 3 9 comparison of mb adsorption capacity of cuo ac nanocomposite with other adsorbents the comparison of adsorbent capacity of synthesized nanocomposite for mb uptake with other reported adsorbents is summarized in table 5 according to table 5 the adsorption capacity of cuo ac is comparable to other similar structured adsorbents which authenticates its potential for wastewater treatment nevertheless the observed discrepancies in the adsorption capacities of different kind of adsorbents are mainly attributed to the differences in experimental conditions and geometric configuration of adsorbent 4 conclusions the invading weed p juliflora pods were recycled to produce activated carbon at low temperature 180 c for the preparation of an integrated adsorbent cuo ac nanocomposites were successfully prepared by facile in situ synthesis method at room temperature for subsequent application of mb removal from aqueous solution the detailed material characterization revealed the formation of single phase monoclinic copper oxide impregnated with activated carbon having porous surface the maximum mb was adsorbed at around neutral ph 95 the adsorption capacity of mb onto cuo ac nanocomposite was found to increase with increasing solution ph from ph 3 to 7 and temperature from 293 to 313 k the adsorption mechanism preferably involved both electrostatic charge interaction between negatively charged surface of cuo ac nanocomposite and positively charged polar groups of mb and hydrogen bonding between surface hydroxyl groups and lone pair electrons of mb the kinetic data revealed that adsorption followed pseudo second order kinetics and best fitting to the langmuir isotherm model the thermodynamics investigation depicted the endothermic nature of adsorption with high feasibility at higher temperature the synthesized nanocomposite presented stability and recyclability for four consecutive adsorption experiments these findings demonstrated that cuo ac nanocomposite could be a promising candidate for wastewater treatment credit

13028,the removal of nh4 and po4 3 from water using adsorbents produced from rice husk and corn cob byproducts was examined the synthesis of mgo biochar nanocomposites was conducted by magnesium activation under nitrogen atmosphere at 400 c and 500 c the characterization of different materials was performed using various modern instruments such as xps sem eds xrd ft ir bet the comparison between modified and unmodified biochars for removing nh4 and po4 3 from water and the impact of different parameters on adsorption capacity of obtained materials were also performed the results showed that the activation of biochar by magnesium led to changes in surface areas pore volume surface charge and chemical properties of biochars and to increases in nh4 and po4 3 adsorption capacity the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 onto biochar based nanocomposites followed both chemisorption and physisorption were spontaneous and endothermic the nh4 maximum uptake calculated according to langmuir model were 21 32 mg g for rmgn500 and 16 31 mg g for cmgn500 while the po4 3 maximum uptake were 117 77 mg g and 52 24 mg g for of rmgn500 and cmgn500 respectively the desorption and recyclability of the rmgn500 and cmgn500 were very effective by using 0 5 m naoh solution for po4 3 and diluted hcl solutions for nh4 this approach of synthesizing mgo nanoparticles impregnated in biochar matrix provided new opportunities in developing low cost and highly efficient adsorbent to removal and recovery of nh4 and po4 3 from water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mgo biochar nanocomposites adsorption kinetics thermodynamics recyclability 1 introduction eutrophication is a serious and widespread problem that is particularly pervasive in developing countries eutrophication is caused by excessive nutrient content in surface waters and warm climate resulting in harmful outbreaks of cyanobacteria 1 cyanobacteria outbreaks also known as harmful algal blooms can be particularly harmful to human beings and animals it is estimated that eutrophication problems in coastal areas can cost the us and eu about 100 million and 1 billion each year 2 run off water containing nitrogen and phosphorus often in form of ammonium and phosphate is the main source of nutrient charge to the environment and the main cause of eutrophication 3 4 7 these nutrients can be removed by several techniques including adsorption 8 10 chemical treatment 11 biological treatment 12 13 chemical treatment requires a large amount of chemicals which raises its operation cost and may lead to secondary pollution while biological method is relatively effective but the treatment time is generally quite long and its efficiency in the removal of ammonium and phosphate largely depends on the operating conditions adsorption is the preferred method because of its economic efficiency simplicity and outstanding adsorption capacity of adsorbents it is usually applied in the latest stage of water waste water treatment process for the removal of pollutants with low concentrations and for the removal and recovery of valuable adsorbates precious metals organic solvents and so on a number of adsorbents had been subjected to immediately remove phosphate and ammonium in water including metal metal hydroxides based materials and metal oxide based materials 14 17 modified zeolite 18 biochars and modified biochars 19 22 among these adsorbents modified biochars were promising materials due to their enhanced physiochemical properties such as high surface area high adsorption capacity of targeted molecules and the introduction of new functional groups which further enhance the adsorption capacity of specific contaminants 21 22 in addition modified biochar was fabricated using waste or by products originated from agricultural and or industrial activities which help to reduce the volume of waste by products and valorize them in alleviating the environmental pollution with a reasonable cost therefore application of modified biochar as a low cost adsorbent in the removal of contaminants is one of the most cost effective approaches for removing nutrient from run off waters 23 biochar is a carbon rich material obtained by the pyrolysis of biomass with the absence of oxygen 21 there were various organic wastes that could be used as feedstock to produce biochar such as municipal solid waste and agriculture wastes 21 rice husk and corn cob were the most common agricultural byproducts that could be fed to the production of biochar especially in vietnam 9 however the adsorption capacity of biochars derived from corn cob and rice husk are still limited the corn cob and rice husk biochar should be modified 9 metal oxide modification of biochar is an effective method to change the adsorption behavior of biochar 21 recently magnesium oxide nanoparticle decorated biochar is gaining interest to remove phosphate in water media due to its higher phosphate adsorption capacity than other adsorbents 24 27 the mgo adsorption sites are considered the main reason for phosphate adsorption in aqueous solutions 25 several studies showed that the precipitation of different magnesium phosphates such as mg3 po4 2 mghpo4 mg h2po4 2 are the contributors to phosphate removal 26 the mgo loaded wood waste biochar demonstrated adsorption capacity of 47 5 mg g for n and 116 4 mg g for p 25 zhu et al 27 synthesized mgo biochar by fast pyrolysis of mgcl2 impregnated corn stalks the mgo nanoparticle biochar could remove 99 of p with the initial p concentration of 200 mg l the mgo magnetic biochar was prepared by li et al 26 had maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of 121 25 mg g at ph 4 however there are only few studies on the removal of both ammonium and phosphate by mgo biochar composites for instance li et al 24 developed mgo biochar for the removal of ammonium and phosphate and humate in aqueous solutions and found that mgo biochar made from sugarcane was a good adsorbent that exhibited maximum adsorption capabilities of about 398 mg g for phosphate and 22 mg g for ammonium xu et al 25 revealed that mgo biochars synthesized from wood waste adsorbed ammonium and phosphate very well from urine with high adsorption capacities of 47 5 mgn g and 116 4 mgp g however no previous studies have examined the thermodynamics of ammonium and phosphate adsorption processes and the regeneration and reuse of mgo biochar to reveal the applicability of such an adsorbent in addition to the best of our knowledge there is no report on the presence of different forms of magnesium in mgo biochar which is also an important factor influencing the adsorption capacity of mgo biochar to address the above mentioned gaps this study aims to produce eight types of biochar and biochar composites characterize their surface structure and chemical composition and examine different factors influencing the adsorption capacity of mgo biochar composites regarding the removal of ammonium and phosphate from solutions the adsorption isotherm models kinetics thermodynamics and regeneration and reuse of adsorbents were also studied in this study the mgo biochar was prepared from mgcl2 impregnated rice husk and corn cob the introduction of mgo into biochar matrix is believed to increase the adsorption capacity of biochar by providing mg active sites for the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 especially the strong removal of po4 3 from solutions by precipitation between mg2 and po4 3 26 the obtained materials were characterized by various methods such as x ray diffraction x ray photoelectron spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscope coupled with edx and n2 adsorption desorption technique 2 experimental 2 1 biochar feedstocks and chemicals rice husk and corn cob were collected as agricultural byproducts from the thai nguyen province vietnam they were dried by sunlight for several days and stored in plastic bags prior to the production of biochar rice husk was used without any further processing while corn cob was cut to size of 20 50 mm all chemicals in this study were of analytical reagents from daejung chemicals co south korea or sigma aldrich singapore all solutions were prepared using deionized water 2 2 biochar preparation 2 2 1 production of biochar in nitrogen atmosphere prior to thermal pyrolysis for biochar production rice husk and corn cob were further dried in the oven at 105 c for 24 h a pre weighed amount approximately 30 g of either rice husk or corn cob was added to a ceramic crucible which was then placed in a 3 zones quartz tube furnace model tzf12 carbolite uk the tube furnace was heated to either 400 or 500 c under a nitrogen atmosphere flow rate of 1 l min after 60 min the ceramic crucible was removed from the reaction zone and allowed to cool to room temperature the mass of the residues was weighed for biochar yield evaluation 2 2 2 synthesis of mgo biochars nanocomposites mgo biochar nanocomposite was synthesized using a modified procedure reported in a previous study 20 dried rice husk or corn cob was immersed into mgcl2 solution 3 3 m which was mixed continuously by a magnetic stirrer model ks 260 basic ika italia for 2 h the mixture was then dried at 80 c the dry mixture of agriculture waste and mgcl2 was used to prepare mgo biochar nanocomposite using a 3 zones quartz tube furnace and the same procedure described in section 2 2 1 2 3 material characterization 2 3 1 proximate analysis moisture volatile matter and ash contents of rice husk and corn cob were determined according to the standard method d1762 84 astm 2007 all experiments were performed in triplicate and the same procedure for determining moisture ash and volatile matter contents were applied for corn cob feedstock 2 3 2 surface morphology and analysis methods x ray diffraction xrd spectra of the as synthesized materials were obtained using a bruker axn equipped with a cu ka radiation source k 1 5418 å and operated at a scan rate of 0 02o s 1 over the 2θ range of 10 80 surface morphology of the samples was examined by a hitachi s4700 scanning electron microscope which was coupled with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer for chemical composition analysis a thermo scientific model k alpha xps instrument usa equipped with a monochromated al kα x ray source with a photon energy of 1486 6 ev was used to obtain x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra of the synthesized materials the gaussian multi peak shapes were used

usa point of zero charge phpzc of materials was determined by drift method as presented in a previous study 28 the calculation of crystalline particles from xrd data the debye scherrer equation was used as follows 1 d 0 9 λ β cosθ where λ is the x ray wavelength of cu kα radiation source λ 0 15418 nm β in radians is the full width at half maximum fwhm intensity of the diffraction peak located at 2θ and θ the bragg angle 2 4 batch experiments 2 4 1 impact of experimental factors for each adsorption experiment 100 mg of adsorbent was added into an erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml solution of either nh4 or po4 3 at 100 mg l the mixture was then agitated at 150 rpm using a mechanical shaker to examine the effect of contact time on adsorption efficiency of the adsorbents the mixture was sampled at an interval time of 2 h sampled at an interval time of 2 h then filtered through a 0 45 μm filter to determine the remaining concentration of pollutants the ph values of solutions were varied from 2 to 10 to investigate the impact of ph on adsorption efficiency to establish the adsorption isotherms adsorption experiments were conducted with nh4 or po4 3 concentration in the range of 10 100 mg l using the same protocol described above ammonium in the sample was determined according to the nessler standard method 29 phosphate was analyzed by the vanaomolybdophoshoric acid standard method 30 2 4 2 adsorption isotherm modeling the adsorption capacity of the examined materials at time t q t mg g was calculated by 2 q t c 0 c t v m where c 0 mg l and c t mg l are the initial

describing the adsorption of pollutants onto biochar based adsorbents the langmuir isotherm is presented as 3 q e q max b c e 1 b c e where c e is the equilibrium solution sorbate concentration mg l b denotes the langmuir bonding term related to the interaction energies l mg q e and q max represent the equilibrium uptake mg g and the langmuir maximum uptake mg g respectively the freundlich isotherm is presented as 4 q e k c e n where c e is the equilibrium solution sorbate concentration mg l q e denotes the equilibrium uptake mg g k and n are respectively the freundlich affinity coefficient ln mg 1 n g and the freundlich linearity constant the langmuir model supposes homogeneous binding sites with equivalent sorption energies and no interaction between adsorbed pollutants while the freundlich is an empirical model related to an exponential distribution of adsorption sites and energies the parameters obtained from the langmuir and freundlich models reveal important information on the surface property and affinity of the adsorbent as well as the sorption mechanism in this work the experimental data was fitted with langmuir and freundlich isotherm models by using originlab software version 9 0 originlab corporation 2 4 3 adsorption kinetics modeling in this study pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and the avrami kinetic models were deployed

and k and n are respectively the avrami constant and the exponent of time associated with the change in mechanism during the adsorption process these kinetics models were evaluated in terms of the normalized standard deviation q which is calculated as 8 q q e exp q e cal q e exp 100 2 4 4 adsorption thermodynamics modeling thermodynamic characteristics of nh4 and po4 3 adsorption processes on modified biochars were evaluated by thermodynamic parameters which involved in changes in gibbs free energy g enthalpy h and entropy s these parameters can be expressed as follows 9 g 0 r t ln k c 10 k c c a c e c 0 c e c e 11 g 0 h 0 t s 0 12 ln k c s 0 r h 0 rt where r the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t the temperature k k c the distribution coefficient for the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 c0 ca and ce the initial concentration the equilibrium adsorbate concentration on the surface of adsorbent mg l and the equilibrium adsorbate concentration in the solution mg l respectively 2 4 5 regeneration of the adsorbent to generate the adsorbent 0 25 m 0 5 m 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solutions were used to desorb po4 3 and nh4 respectively the generated adsorbents were then washed with di water to neutral ph confirmed by a ph meter before using for the next adsorption experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 proximate analysis and biochar yield detailed proximate analysis shows that the rice husk and corn cob in this study had low moisture content of 12 5 and 6 9 respectively the volatile matter was about 80 for both rice husk and corn cob table 1 rice husk had higher ash content 14 3 0 5 than corn cob 1 5 0 6 table 1 the higher ash content in rice husk than corn cob and other biomass e g oak wood pine wood and hazelnut shells could be due to the mineral contents in rice husk 31 rice husk also had lower fixed carbon content than corn cob 13 1 1 1 vs 7 3 0 8 biochar yield decreased slightly when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 400 to 500 c table 2 these results are consistent with previous work by ronssee et al 31 who studied the production of biochars from different feedstocks at different conditions such as retention time pyrolysis environment and temperature table 2 also provides the denotation of different biochar materials obtained in this study for further analysis and experiments the appearance of raw materials and products are presented in fig s1 supplementary materials 3 2 surface characteristics of biochar and mgo biochar nanocomposites xrd results confirm the presence of mgo crystalline in the mgo biochar nanocomposite system fig 1 biochars from rice husk and corn cob at different temperatures showed a broadened peak at 23 which is attributed to the crystal plane 002 of cellulose 32 mg in the lattice was in the form of mgo with 2θ peaks of 36 82 42 55 62 08 74 51 and 78 44 corresponding to planes 111 200 220 311 and 222 jcpds card no 75 0447 in fig 1 mg was also in the form of mg oh 2 with the characteristic peaks at 2θ of 18 40 32 71 37 98 50 67 58 51 68 18 72 14 which respectively correspond to planes 001 100 101 102 110 103 201 jcpds card no 00 007 0239 in fig 1 the absence of any unidentified characteristic peaks confirms the high purity of the produced mgo biochar composites results from fig 1 can also be used to calculate the size of mgo particles the calculation based on debye scherrer equation eq 1 showed that mgo particles were within the range of 14 08 nm and 30 91 nm the average crystallite size d calculated from the diffraction peaks was found to be 15 6 nm by using similar approach the mg oh 2 nanoparticles corresponding to planes 001 100 101 102 110 103 201 of mg oh 2 were revealed to range from 17 48 nm to 24 66 nm averaging 21 85 nm and being comparable with the particle sizes of nano mgo the presence of mgo and mg oh 2 in the biochar based composites could be explained by the fact that mg oh 2 formed from precursors mg2 and oh in solutions were annealed at high temperatures 400 and 500 c in this work to from mgo via degradation reaction of mg oh 2 33 the obtained results in this work were comparable with those reported in previous studies 24 32 the panalytical x pert highscore plus version 3 0 5 software was used to determine the proportion of mgo and mg oh 2 crystallization in biochar as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 400 to 500 c the proportion of mg oh 2 decreased while the proportion of mgo increased in the mgo biochar composites from both biomass materials for instance in the corn cob based mgo biochar the proportion of mg oh 2 declined from 61 to 49 whereas those of mgo increased from 39 to 51 when pyrolysis temperature increased from 400 to 500 c supplementary materials fig s2 this could be explained by the degradation of mg oh 2 to form mgo at high temperature 33 the ft ir spectra of four biochars rn400 rn500 cn400 and cn500 and their corresponding composites mgrn400 mgrn500 mgcn400 and mgcn500 are shown in fig 2 the presence of mgo and mg oh 2 in biochars based nanocomposites was also confirmed by ft ir spectrum a sharp and intense peak at 3698 cm 1 corresponded to asymmetric stretching vibrations of oh groups 24 while the wide and strong absorption band at 475 cm 1 was the bending vibration of mgo 25 the peak at 1680 cm 1 was also linked with the stretching vibration of oh groups of cellulose chains the large peak at around 1100 cm 1 corresponded to oc stretching vibrations in cellulose 26 27 and or the sio2 residue after the pyrolysis to produce biochars 34 in addition the vibrations of cc and co in aromatic structures on the surface of biochar were observed at the region of 1560 1575 cm 1 26 27 the surface chemical state of biochar based nanocomposites was analyzed using xps the xps survey spectra of rmgn400 cmgn400 rmgn500 and cmgn500 samples presented in fig 3 and xps spectra of the c 1s o 1s mg 1s and mg 2p regions presented in fig s3 supplementary materials confirmed the presence of mg c o on the surface of biochars for instance the energy binding of mg 1s o 1s and c 1s respectively at around 1303 532 and 284 ev can be assigned to magnesium in mgo mg oh 2 oxygen in the biochar and mgo mg oh 2 and c in the biochar 35 it is noted that the intensity of mg 1s peak in rmgn400 and rmgn500 were relatively higher than the corresponding corn cob biochar based nanocomposites cmgn400 and cmgn500 suggesting that the nanocomposites produced from rice husk as precursor resulted in higher mgo and mg oh 2 proportions than those produced from corn cob this may be linked with the discrepancy in the porosity of the studied materials the surface morphology of biochar and mgo biochar composites was examined by sem method and the chemical composition was analyzed with the aid of edx method the results on surface morphology revealed that the corncob unmodified biochar fig 4b was coarser and more porous than rice husk unmodified biochar fig 4a the mgo biochars fig 4c d showed in its structure the growth of agglomerates deposited on the surface of the biochars which were likely mgo mg oh 2 formation 46 pinto et al 48 reported the same behavior for a mgo impregnated biochar produced from carrot mgo biochars showed nanostructured clusters flakes of mgo mg oh 2 on the carbon surface fig 4c d which were not present in the unmodified biochar samples in addition the structure of large pores in the cn500 sample seemed to be ruptured by the activation process which resulted in smaller fragments on which deposited agglomerates of mgo mg oh 2 edx results revealed that rn500 rice husk mainly contained si element while cn500 corn cob also contained other minerals such as k ca al and cl with very low contents in addition to si supplementary materials fig s4 with regard to cmgn500 and rmgn500 nanocomposites mg was the most abundant elements and the presence of the other elements si cl was relatively in small quantities confirming the introduction of mgo and or mg oh 2 on biochars surfaces was successful the results of n2 adsorption desorption of different materials are shown in the fig 5 the adsorption desorption curves of rmgn500 cmgn500 and cn500 samples shared a common type v isotherm with h3 hysteresis loop represented for mesoporous material the rn500 sample was type i with h3 hysteresis loop which was characterized by microporous structure the sbet of rn500 rmgn500 cn500 and cmgn500 samples were respectively 263 85 m2 g 196 04 m2 g 7 02 m2 g and 106 71 m2 g the average pore diameters of rn500 fig 5a rmgn500 fig 5b cn500 fig 5c and cmgn500 fig 5d were 5 57 nm 11 34 nm 29 17 nm and 17 50 nm respectively this revealed that biochar produced from rice husk presented higher specific area than that produced from corn cob in addition the incorporation of nano mgo mg oh 2 into biochar made of rice husk led to an increase in diameter of pores but a decrease in surface area this might be linked with the expansion of biochar s pore due to agglomerates of nano mgo mg oh 2 present within the pores of the mgo biochar composites as for the biochar made from corn cob cn500 and its composites cmgn500 the modification of biochar by magnesium led to a significant increase in surface area 7 02 m2 g for cn500 compared with 106 71 m2 g for cmgn500 and to an important decline in pore diameter the average pore diameter of cn500 sample was 29 17 nm compared with 17 50 nm for cmgn500 this could be associated to the fact that biochar was filled with mgo and or mg oh 2 nanoparticles which resulted in a reduction of pore diameter and the high surface areas of mgo and or mg oh 2 nanoparticles could lead to an augmentation of mgo biochar nanocomposites surface isoelectric values of biochar and mgo biochar composites were evaluated to quantify the change in their surface charge as a function of ph the phpzc for rn500 cn500 rmgn500 and cmgn500 were 5 4 8 8 10 2 and 10 6 respectively supplementary materials fig s5 implying that mg biochar composites are negatively charged in environmental water at near neutral ph it is likely that the mgo biochar composites have attained their negative charge from the mgo and mg oh 2 surfaces 36 3 3 adsorption of ammonium and phosphate 3 3 1 comparison of the adsorption capacity of different materials to compare the removal efficiency of materials for the adsorption of ammonium ions and phosphate ions batch experiments were conducted with the same initial concentrations 100 mg l for both nh4 and po4 3 the experimental results are shown in the fig 6 in general the unmodified and modified biochars derived from rice husk presented better adsorption efficiencies compared to the corresponding materials obtained from corn cob regarding the removal of nh4 and po4 3 in addition the chemical modification of biochars by magnesium led to increases in the adsorption efficiency concerning the removal of nh4 the rn500 and rmgn500 materials respectively showed adsorption efficiencies of 66 and 69 while these values for cn500 and cmgn500 were 53 and 55 fig 6 as regards the adsorption of po4 3 biochars modified by magnesium presented much better adsorption efficiency than unmodified biochars for instance the rn500 and cn500 respectively adsorbed 44 and 33 of po4 3 in solutions while these figures for rmgn500 and cmgn500 were 71 and 53 respectively this could be attributed to positive charges of nano mgo mg oh 2 in neutral solutions and or precipitation reaction between mg2 and anion phosphate as the chemical modification of biochars by magnesium presented better adsorption capacity regarding the removal of nh4 and po4 3 from solutions only the results on the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 by modified biochars are presented in the subsequent sections 3 3 2 effect of contact time adsorption kinetics fig 7 shows the effect of contact time to the adsorption of ammonium and phosphate ions it was observed that the removal efficiency increased in correlation with the contact time as regards the adsorption of nh4 the equilibrium time for rmgn500 and cmgn500 were respectively 4 h and 7 h the corresponding removal efficiencies were 17 05 mg g and 15 80 mg g respectively similar trend was observed in the adsorption of po4 3 nanocomposites based on biochar derived from corn cob presented a lower equilibrium time than the ones based on biochar derived from rice husk did 6 h for cmgn500 vs 7 h for rmgn500 the results on equilibrium time in this work were comparable with others previously reported 27 37 the removal efficiency of cmgn500 at equilibrium time was 27 5 mg g while this value for rmgn500 was 35 1 mg g these implied that nanocomposites based on biochar from rice husk presented higher adsorption efficiency than those produced from corn cob to examine the adsorption kinetics of the adsorption processes for the removal of nh4 and po4 3 at 25 c the pseudo first order kinetic the pseudo second order kinetic and the intraparticle diffusion kinetic models were employed the obtained results are presented in table 3 among the models deployed the avrami model fitted the experimental data the best as it presented the highest r2 values and low percentage deviations of q e for instance the adsorption of ammonium by rmgn500 and cmgn500 the r2 values were respectively 0 998 and 0 999 for the avrami model while these values for the pseudo first pseudo second order models and the intra particle diffusion model were in the range of 0 776 0 992 table 3 concerning the adsorption of po4 3 by rmgn500 and cmgn500 materials the r2 values for the avrami model were respectively 0 998 and 0 999 while these figures for the pseudo first pseudo second order models and the intra particle diffusion model were within the range of 0 849 0 998 the percentage deviations of q e in the rage of 6 3 10 5 for the avrami model were slightly higher than those 2 6 6 9 for pseudo second order model but lower than those 7 6 14 9 obtained from the pseudo first order model table 3 these suggest that mechanism changes occur during the adsorption processes which could be attributed to diffusion of adsorbates intra particle diffusion and mass transfer processes 38 39 3 3 3 effect of initial ph of solutions fig 8 shows the impact of the initial ph values on the adsorption efficiency of the mgo biochar nanocomposites with regard to the adsorption of ammonium in solutions it was shown that the adsorption efficiency of mgo biochar nanocomposites quickly increased in correlation with ph values of the examined solutions reached the maximum value at ph 8 q 19 1 mg g and 17 2 mg g for rmgn500 and cmgn500 respectively however the adsorption efficiency of mgo biochar nanocomposites declined when the ph value went beyond 8 especially there was a steep fall in adsorption efficiency for the solutions having ph 10 or higher fig 8 it was noted that the phpzc of rmgn500 and cmgn500 were respectively 10 2 and 10 6 meaning that in the ph 10 solutions the surfaces of rmgn500 and cmgn500 would be positively charged this led to a defavored adsorption of nh4 onto rmgn500 and cmgn500 materials surfaces due to electrostatic repulsive forces in addition there was a competitive adsorption of h in more acidic solutions leading to reductions in the adsorption efficiency of rmgn500 and cmgn500 materials these observations were in agreement with previous reports 9 40 41 when the ph was higher than 8 ammonium ions were converted into nh3 eq which could not be adsorbed onto the adsorbent 40 41 leading to a decline in removal yield as regards the adsorption of po4 3 a similar trend compared to the adsorption of nh4 was observed fig 8 overall the phosphate removal yield gradually increased with an increase in the ph value attained the maximum values at ph 8 q 37 5 mg g and 30 0 mg g for rmgn500 and cmgn500 respectively then declined in the ph 8 there were different factors contributing to these observations 1 in the ph 10 solutions the surfaces of rmgn500 and cmgn500 materials were positively charged leading to electrostatic attrition force between phosphate and the rmgn500 and cmgn500 hence favoring the phosphate adsorption capacity 2 the precipitation between ion mg2 phosphate which was in some cases the dominant mechanism for the removal of phosphate from solutions 42 3 in acidic solution ph up to 2 14 pk a1 h3po4 acid was the most abundant phosphorus species in the solution leading to no interaction with the positive surfaces of the examined materials when the ph was between 2 14 and 7 2 pk a2 7 20 h2po4 anions were predominant resulting in an increase in phosphate adsorption at higher ph values in the range of 7 2 13 2 pk a3 13 2 hpo4 2 anions were mainly present in the solution presented double negative load of these species onto rmgn500 and cmgn500 adsorbents conforming the best adsorption efficiency at ph 8 when ph values increased from 8 to 9 there was a small decline in the adsorption efficiency due to the competitive adsorption between hpo4 2 and oh anions once the ph values were 10 there were not only a higher competitive adsorption of oh anions but also an electrostatic repulsion between hpo4 2 anions and the negative surfaces of rmgn500 and cmgn500 adsorbents similar results were obtained in previous studies 24 43 3 3 4 effect of the initial concentration of pollutants adsorption isotherms the results on the effect of the initial concentrations to the adsorption efficiency are presented in fig 9 the adsorption capacity of both rmgn500 and cmgn500 adsorbents increased with the augmentation of nh4 and po4 3 initial concentrations this observation might be attributed to 1 at low concentrations of nh4 and po4 3 the mass transfer of ions and the adsorbed fraction of ions became low leading to the low adsorption efficiency 2 when the ion concentrations increased the increase in mass transfer of ions resulted in the higher ratio of ion occupied the available adsorption sites on the surface of materials therefore increasing the adsorption yield 44 45 when the ion concentrations were saturated 40 mg l for nh4 and 50 mg l for po4 3 the number of unoccupied active sites decreased leading to a decline in adsorption efficiency the experimental results were then subjected to two adsorption isotherm models langmuir and freundlich for studying the adsorption isotherm the obtained results in fig 9 depicted that both langmuir and freundlich models fitted well the experimental data however langmuir model described the nh4 and po4 3 adsorption processes better than freundlich model this was shaped by the higher coefficient of determination r2 for langmuir model for instance the adsorption of nh4 showed r2 0 988 for rmgn500 and r2 0 968 for cmgn500 langmuir model while those values for freundlich model were r2 0 975 for rmgn500 and r2 0 960 for cmgn500 respectively similarly the adsorption of po4 3 revealed r2 0 988 for rmgn500 and r2 0 975 for cmgn500 langmuir model and r2 0 980 for rmgn500 and r2 0 970 for cmgn500 freundlich model this suggested that the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 on to rmgn500 and cmgn500 was mainly chemisorption with monolayer the nh4 maximum uptake calculated according to langmuir model were 21 32 mg g for rmgn500 and 16 31 mg g for cmgn500 while the maximum uptake of po4 3 were 117 77 mg g and 52 24 mg g for of cmgn450 and rmgn450 respectively it is noted that biochars made of rice husk rn500 rmgn500 always presented better adsorption capacities compared to those made of corn cob cn500 and cmgn500 this could be associated to the larger surface areas of rhn500 and rmgn500 compared to cn500 and cmgn500 as presented in section 3 2 and or the presence of higher nano mgo content in rmgn500 in comparison with cmgn500 which might facilitate the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 on rmgn500 samples finally the main characteristics of mgo biochar composites obtained in this work was tabulated and compared with other works in table 4 it was noted that our obtained biochars presented higher surface areas compared to several other types of biochars except for those produced from reed straw 345 9 m2 g 44 and wheat straw 187 6 m2 g which were produced by several steps including the use of concentrated bases 48 concerning the adsorption of po4 3 in solutions the prepared adsorbents in this work exhibited better adsorption capacity than all almost other similar materials 50 120 mg g vs about 20 60 mg g as regards nh4 adsorption process the adsorption capacity obtained by this work was higher than those observed by adsorbents produced from reed and wheat straws table 4 while it was comparable with the adsorbents produced from corncob around 20 mg g the mgo biochars in this work provides excellent adsorbents for the removal of nh4 and po4 3 from solutions 3 3 5 adsorption thermodynamics the results on thermodynamic parameters calculated from the experimental data obtained at three different temperatures 25 35 and 45 c are tabulated in table 5 the negative g 0 values obtained in this study implied that the adsorption nature was thermodynamically spontaneous for both nh4 and po4 3 adsorption processes onto both types of adsorbents rmgn500 and cmgn500 in addition the absolute value of g 0 slightly increased when the temperature augmented suggesting more adsorbed amount of nh4 and po4 3 onto rmgn500 and cmgn500 at higher temperatures these obtained results were similar with previous reports on the adsorption of ammonium 46 and phosphate 36 on biochars the enthalpy value h 0 was positive indicating the endothermic nature of the adsorption in general the adsorption enthalpy in the range of 2 to 20 kj mol characterizes a physical adsorption all the values of h 0 obtained in this work were 18 844 kj mol for po4 3 adsorption and 8 145 kj mol for nh4 adsorption corresponded to physical adsorption the results obtained in the adsorption kinetics and the adsorption isotherm model sections revealed that chemisorption better descried the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 onto rmgn500 and cmgn500 while the adsorption thermodynamics suggested the physisorption was more representative therefore one could conclude that the adsorption processes of nh4 and po4 3 onto rmgn500 and cmgn500 were both physisorption and chemisorption this could be attributed to the heterogenous surfaces of rmgn500 and cmgn500 nanocomposites as regard the entropy characteristics on the adsorption process s 0 values were positive for all the adsorption processes and received positive values in the range of 66 69 j mol for po4 3 sorption and in the range of 45 49 j mol for nh4 sorption suggesting that there was an increase in the disorder and randomness at rmgn500 and cmgn500 solution interfaces during the sorption the adsorption mechanism for phosphorous removal could be linked to two major pathways 1 electrostatic attraction between anions po4 3 h2po4 and hpo4 2 and positively charged mgo biochars in solutions having ph 10 as presented previously in this work similar results were obtained the works conducted by zhang et al 20 li et al 24 and jiang et al 50 and 2 mgo mg oh 2 on the mgo biochar composites could generate mg2 in solutions which then reacted with phosphate to form mgp precipitates such as mg h2po4 2 mghpo4 and or mg3 po4 2 27 47 48 according the reactions below 13 mgo h 2 o mg oh 2 mg 2 2oh 14 biochar mg 2 po 4 3 biochar mg h 2 po 4 2 mghpo 4 mg 3 po 4 2 the nh4 adsorption mechanism could be attributed to electrostatic interaction as revealed previously and or by ion exchange between nh4 and acidic functional groups phenolic carboxylic and cation mg2 on the surface of mgo biochar nano composites 42 44 gong et al 42 found that mg2 cation exchange was the dominant mechanism for nh4 removal from solutions while hou et al 44 revealed that na k and ca2 ion exchange and acidic function groups such as phenolic oh and carboxyl c o 3 3 6 regeneration of adsorbents the obtained results showed that there was a slight decrease in the adsorption of po4 3 by mgo biochar based nanocomposites after 3 cycles the adsorption efficiencies declined from 91 0 to 80 3 for rmgn500 and from 88 0 to 79 5 for cmgn500 after 3 adsorption desorption cycles fig 10 thus rmgn500 and cmgn500 adsorbents could be effectively reused by using the 0 5 m naoh solution as an eluent to remove phosphate it is noted that the use of 1 m naoh solution for the phosphate desorption resulted in a similar efficiency to that obtained by using 0 5 m naoh solution for the first cycle 91 and slightly better than those in the subsequent cycles supplementary materials fig s6 whereas the use of 0 25 m naoh led to the less effective for the phosphate desorption 0 5 m naoh solution was therefore selected for the desorption and regeneration processes to avoid using naoh concentrated solution the results on nh4 desorption and recyclability of rmgn500 and cmgn500 presented even more stable removal efficiencies around 80 after 3 cycles this confirmed that the ion exchange and electrostatic interaction between nh4 and rmgn500 and cmgn500 were important mechanisms in the nh4 adsorption processes diluted hcl solutions could be used as good agents for the desorption of nh4 from rmgn500 and cmgn500 it is noted that in real water samples the presence of other pollutants such as natural organic matter nom organic pollutants heavy metals other cation anions suspended solids bacteria and so on may have negative impacts on the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents due to competitive adsorption therefore the evaluation of the adsorption efficiency regarding the removal of nh4 and po4 3 in real samples is of great importance and it will be performed in our future works 4 conclusion biochars and mgo biochars based nanocomposites were successfully synthesized at different temperatures from corn cob and rice husk these adsorbents were systematically characterized the results confirmed the presence of both mgo and mg oh 2 with different proportions in the mgo nanocomposites the presence of mgo and mg oh 2 nanoparticles led to changes in biochars surface characteristics surface areas charge and chemical properties which influenced the nh4 and po4 3 adsorption processes both chemisorption and physisorption mechanisms occurred during the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 the adsorption processes were spontaneous endothermic and followed the avrami model which was shaped by changes in mechanism during the adsorption processes this research revealed that the biochars produced from corn cob and rice husk impregnated with magnesium were promising materials for the removal and reuse of ammonium and phosphate data availability all data

13028,the removal of nh4 and po4 3 from water using adsorbents produced from rice husk and corn cob byproducts was examined the synthesis of mgo biochar nanocomposites was conducted by magnesium activation under nitrogen atmosphere at 400 c and 500 c the characterization of different materials was performed using various modern instruments such as xps sem eds xrd ft ir bet the comparison between modified and unmodified biochars for removing nh4 and po4 3 from water and the impact of different parameters on adsorption capacity of obtained materials were also performed the results showed that the activation of biochar by magnesium led to changes in surface areas pore volume surface charge and chemical properties of biochars and to increases in nh4 and po4 3 adsorption capacity the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 onto biochar based nanocomposites followed both chemisorption and physisorption were spontaneous and endothermic the nh4 maximum uptake calculated according to langmuir model were 21 32 mg g for rmgn500 and 16 31 mg g for cmgn500 while the po4 3 maximum uptake were 117 77 mg g and 52 24 mg g for of rmgn500 and cmgn500 respectively the desorption and recyclability of the rmgn500 and cmgn500 were very effective by using 0 5 m naoh solution for po4 3 and diluted hcl solutions for nh4 this approach of synthesizing mgo nanoparticles impregnated in biochar matrix provided new opportunities in developing low cost and highly efficient adsorbent to removal and recovery of nh4 and po4 3 from water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mgo biochar nanocomposites adsorption kinetics thermodynamics recyclability 1 introduction eutrophication is a serious and widespread problem that is particularly pervasive in developing countries eutrophication is caused by excessive nutrient content in surface waters and warm climate resulting in harmful outbreaks of cyanobacteria 1 cyanobacteria outbreaks also known as harmful algal blooms can be particularly harmful to human beings and animals it is estimated that eutrophication problems in coastal areas can cost the us and eu about 100 million and 1 billion each year 2 run off water containing nitrogen and phosphorus often in form of ammonium and phosphate is the main source of nutrient charge to the environment and the main cause of eutrophication 3 4 7 these nutrients can be removed by several techniques including adsorption 8 10 chemical treatment 11 biological treatment 12 13 chemical treatment requires a large amount of chemicals which raises its operation cost and may lead to secondary pollution while biological method is relatively effective but the treatment time is generally quite long and its efficiency in the removal of ammonium and phosphate largely depends on the operating conditions adsorption is the preferred method because of its economic efficiency simplicity and outstanding adsorption capacity of adsorbents it is usually applied in the latest stage of water waste water treatment process for the removal of pollutants with low concentrations and for the removal and recovery of valuable adsorbates precious metals organic solvents and so on a number of adsorbents had been subjected to immediately remove phosphate and ammonium in water including metal metal hydroxides based materials and metal oxide based materials 14 17 modified zeolite 18 biochars and modified biochars 19 22 among these adsorbents modified biochars were promising materials due to their enhanced physiochemical properties such as high surface area high adsorption capacity of targeted molecules and the introduction of new functional groups which further enhance the adsorption capacity of specific contaminants 21 22 in addition modified biochar was fabricated using waste or by products originated from agricultural and or industrial activities which help to reduce the volume of waste by products and valorize them in alleviating the environmental pollution with a reasonable cost therefore application of modified biochar as a low cost adsorbent in the removal of contaminants is one of the most cost effective approaches for removing nutrient from run off waters 23 biochar is a carbon rich material obtained by the pyrolysis of biomass with the absence of oxygen 21 there were various organic wastes that could be used as feedstock to produce biochar such as municipal solid waste and agriculture wastes 21 rice husk and corn cob were the most common agricultural byproducts that could be fed to the production of biochar especially in vietnam 9 however the adsorption capacity of biochars derived from corn cob and rice husk are still limited the corn cob and rice husk biochar should be modified 9 metal oxide modification of biochar is an effective method to change the adsorption behavior of biochar 21 recently magnesium oxide nanoparticle decorated biochar is gaining interest to remove phosphate in water media due to its higher phosphate adsorption capacity than other adsorbents 24 27 the mgo adsorption sites are considered the main reason for phosphate adsorption in aqueous solutions 25 several studies showed that the precipitation of different magnesium phosphates such as mg3 po4 2 mghpo4 mg h2po4 2 are the contributors to phosphate removal 26 the mgo loaded wood waste biochar demonstrated adsorption capacity of 47 5 mg g for n and 116 4 mg g for p 25 zhu et al 27 synthesized mgo biochar by fast pyrolysis of mgcl2 impregnated corn stalks the mgo nanoparticle biochar could remove 99 of p with the initial p concentration of 200 mg l the mgo magnetic biochar was prepared by li et al 26 had maximum phosphate adsorption capacity of 121 25 mg g at ph 4 however there are only few studies on the removal of both ammonium and phosphate by mgo biochar composites for instance li et al 24 developed mgo biochar for the removal of ammonium and phosphate and humate in aqueous solutions and found that mgo biochar made from sugarcane was a good adsorbent that exhibited maximum adsorption capabilities of about 398 mg g for phosphate and 22 mg g for ammonium xu et al 25 revealed that mgo biochars synthesized from wood waste adsorbed ammonium and phosphate very well from urine with high adsorption capacities of 47 5 mgn g and 116 4 mgp g however no previous studies have examined the thermodynamics of ammonium and phosphate adsorption processes and the regeneration and reuse of mgo biochar to reveal the applicability of such an adsorbent in addition to the best of our knowledge there is no report on the presence of different forms of magnesium in mgo biochar which is also an important factor influencing the adsorption capacity of mgo biochar to address the above mentioned gaps this study aims to produce eight types of biochar and biochar composites characterize their surface structure and chemical composition and examine different factors influencing the adsorption capacity of mgo biochar composites regarding the removal of ammonium and phosphate from solutions the adsorption isotherm models kinetics thermodynamics and regeneration and reuse of adsorbents were also studied in this study the mgo biochar was prepared from mgcl2 impregnated rice husk and corn cob the introduction of mgo into biochar matrix is believed to increase the adsorption capacity of biochar by providing mg active sites for the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 especially the strong removal of po4 3 from solutions by precipitation between mg2 and po4 3 26 the obtained materials were characterized by various methods such as x ray diffraction x ray photoelectron spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscope coupled with edx and n2 adsorption desorption technique 2 experimental 2 1 biochar feedstocks and chemicals rice husk and corn cob were collected as agricultural byproducts from the thai nguyen province vietnam they were dried by sunlight for several days and stored in plastic bags prior to the production of biochar rice husk was used without any further processing while corn cob was cut to size of 20 50 mm all chemicals in this study were of analytical reagents from daejung chemicals co south korea or sigma aldrich singapore all solutions were prepared using deionized water 2 2 biochar preparation 2 2 1 production of biochar in nitrogen atmosphere prior to thermal pyrolysis for biochar production rice husk and corn cob were further dried in the oven at 105 c for 24 h a pre weighed amount approximately 30 g of either rice husk or corn cob was added to a ceramic crucible which was then placed in a 3 zones quartz tube furnace model tzf12 carbolite uk the tube furnace was heated to either 400 or 500 c under a nitrogen atmosphere flow rate of 1 l min after 60 min the ceramic crucible was removed from the reaction zone and allowed to cool to room temperature the mass of the residues was weighed for biochar yield evaluation 2 2 2 synthesis of mgo biochars nanocomposites mgo biochar nanocomposite was synthesized using a modified procedure reported in a previous study 20 dried rice husk or corn cob was immersed into mgcl2 solution 3 3 m which was mixed continuously by a magnetic stirrer model ks 260 basic ika italia for 2 h the mixture was then dried at 80 c the dry mixture of agriculture waste and mgcl2 was used to prepare mgo biochar nanocomposite using a 3 zones quartz tube furnace and the same procedure described in section 2 2 1 2 3 material characterization 2 3 1 proximate analysis moisture volatile matter and ash contents of rice husk and corn cob were determined according to the standard method d1762 84 astm 2007 all experiments were performed in triplicate and the same procedure for determining moisture ash and volatile matter contents were applied for corn cob feedstock 2 3 2 surface morphology and analysis methods x ray diffraction xrd spectra of the as synthesized materials were obtained using a bruker axn equipped with a cu ka radiation source k 1 5418 å and operated at a scan rate of 0 02o s 1 over the 2θ range of 10 80 surface morphology of the samples was examined by a hitachi s4700 scanning electron microscope which was coupled with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer for chemical composition analysis a thermo scientific model k alpha xps instrument usa equipped with a monochromated al kα x ray source with a photon energy of 1486 6 ev was used to obtain x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra of the synthesized materials the gaussian multi peak shapes were used to characterize the elemental states of carbon magnesium in the materials a nicolet 380 spectrometer usa was used to obtain fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectra of the synthesized materials where the dried bio char based materials were mixed with the dried kbr in a ratio of 1 30 and ft ir spectra was recorded with the range of wavenumber from 400 to 4000 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 the bet surface area the pore volume and the pore diameter of the obtained materials were determined using the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm using a micromeritics tristar 3000 analyzer usa point of zero charge phpzc of materials was determined by drift method as presented in a previous study 28 the calculation of crystalline particles from xrd data the debye scherrer equation was used as follows 1 d 0 9 λ β cosθ where λ is the x ray wavelength of cu kα radiation source λ 0 15418 nm β in radians is the full width at half maximum fwhm intensity of the diffraction peak located at 2θ and θ the bragg angle 2 4 batch experiments 2 4 1 impact of experimental factors for each adsorption experiment 100 mg of adsorbent was added into an erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml solution of either nh4 or po4 3 at 100 mg l the mixture was then agitated at 150 rpm using a mechanical shaker to examine the effect of contact time on adsorption efficiency of the adsorbents the mixture was sampled at an interval time of 2 h sampled at an interval time of 2 h then filtered through a 0 45 μm filter to determine the remaining concentration of pollutants the ph values of solutions were varied from 2 to 10 to investigate the impact of ph on adsorption efficiency to establish the adsorption isotherms adsorption experiments were conducted with nh4 or po4 3 concentration in the range of 10 100 mg l using the same protocol described above ammonium in the sample was determined according to the nessler standard method 29 phosphate was analyzed by the vanaomolybdophoshoric acid standard method 30 2 4 2 adsorption isotherm modeling the adsorption capacity of the examined materials at time t q t mg g was calculated by 2 q t c 0 c t v m where c 0 mg l and c t mg l are the initial concentrations of nh4 or po4 3 and at time t min respectively v is the volume of nh4 or po4 3 solutions l m is adsorbent mass g langmuir and freundlich are the two most widely used isotherm models for describing the adsorption of pollutants onto biochar based adsorbents the langmuir isotherm is presented as 3 q e q max b c e 1 b c e where c e is the equilibrium solution sorbate concentration mg l b denotes the langmuir bonding term related to the interaction energies l mg q e and q max represent the equilibrium uptake mg g and the langmuir maximum uptake mg g respectively the freundlich isotherm is presented as 4 q e k c e n where c e is the equilibrium solution sorbate concentration mg l q e denotes the equilibrium uptake mg g k and n are respectively the freundlich affinity coefficient ln mg 1 n g and the freundlich linearity constant the langmuir model supposes homogeneous binding sites with equivalent sorption energies and no interaction between adsorbed pollutants while the freundlich is an empirical model related to an exponential distribution of adsorption sites and energies the parameters obtained from the langmuir and freundlich models reveal important information on the surface property and affinity of the adsorbent as well as the sorption mechanism in this work the experimental data was fitted with langmuir and freundlich isotherm models by using originlab software version 9 0 originlab corporation 2 4 3 adsorption kinetics modeling in this study pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and the avrami kinetic models were deployed to examine the adsorption kinetics those models can be written as the following pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and the avrami kinetic models presented in eqs 5 6 7 and 8 respectively 5 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 7 q t k 3 t 1 2 c 8 q t q e 1 e kt n where q e and q t are the adsorption uptake of nh4 and po4 3 at equilibrium and at time t min while k 1 1 min is the adsorption rate constant k 2 g mg min is the rate constant of the second order model k 3 mg g min1 2 is rate constant of the intra particle diffusion model c is the intercept and k and n are respectively the avrami constant and the exponent of time associated with the change in mechanism during the adsorption process these kinetics models were evaluated in terms of the normalized standard deviation q which is calculated as 8 q q e exp q e cal q e exp 100 2 4 4 adsorption thermodynamics modeling thermodynamic characteristics of nh4 and po4 3 adsorption processes on modified biochars were evaluated by thermodynamic parameters which involved in changes in gibbs free energy g enthalpy h and entropy s these parameters can be expressed as follows 9 g 0 r t ln k c 10 k c c a c e c 0 c e c e 11 g 0 h 0 t s 0 12 ln k c s 0 r h 0 rt where r the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t the temperature k k c the distribution coefficient for the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 c0 ca and ce the initial concentration the equilibrium adsorbate concentration on the surface of adsorbent mg l and the equilibrium adsorbate concentration in the solution mg l respectively 2 4 5 regeneration of the adsorbent to generate the adsorbent 0 25 m 0 5 m 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl solutions were used to desorb po4 3 and nh4 respectively the generated adsorbents were then washed with di water to neutral ph confirmed by a ph meter before using for the next adsorption experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 proximate analysis and biochar yield detailed proximate analysis shows that the rice husk and corn cob in this study had low moisture content of 12 5 and 6 9 respectively the volatile matter was about 80 for both rice husk and corn cob table 1 rice husk had higher ash content 14 3 0 5 than corn cob 1 5 0 6 table 1 the higher ash content in rice husk than corn cob and other biomass e g oak wood pine wood and hazelnut shells could be due to the mineral contents in rice husk 31 rice husk also had lower fixed carbon content than corn cob 13 1 1 1 vs 7 3 0 8 biochar yield decreased slightly when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 400 to 500 c table 2 these results are consistent with previous work by ronssee et al 31 who studied the production of biochars from different feedstocks at different conditions such as retention time pyrolysis environment and temperature table 2 also provides the denotation of different biochar materials obtained in this study for further analysis and experiments the appearance of raw materials and products are presented in fig s1 supplementary materials 3 2 surface characteristics of biochar and mgo biochar nanocomposites xrd results confirm the presence of mgo crystalline in the mgo biochar nanocomposite system fig 1 biochars from rice husk and corn cob at different temperatures showed a broadened peak at 23 which is attributed to the crystal plane 002 of cellulose 32 mg in the lattice was in the form of mgo with 2θ peaks of 36 82 42 55 62 08 74 51 and 78 44 corresponding to planes 111 200 220 311 and 222 jcpds card no 75 0447 in fig 1 mg was also in the form of mg oh 2 with the characteristic peaks at 2θ of 18 40 32 71 37 98 50 67 58 51 68 18 72 14 which respectively correspond to planes 001 100 101 102 110 103 201 jcpds card no 00 007 0239 in fig 1 the absence of any unidentified characteristic peaks confirms the high purity of the produced mgo biochar composites results from fig 1 can also be used to calculate the size of mgo particles the calculation based on debye scherrer equation eq 1 showed that mgo particles were within the range of 14 08 nm and 30 91 nm the average crystallite size d calculated from the diffraction peaks was found to be 15 6 nm by using similar approach the mg oh 2 nanoparticles corresponding to planes 001 100 101 102 110 103 201 of mg oh 2 were revealed to range from 17 48 nm to 24 66 nm averaging 21 85 nm and being comparable with the particle sizes of nano mgo the presence of mgo and mg oh 2 in the biochar based composites could be explained by the fact that mg oh 2 formed from precursors mg2 and oh in solutions were annealed at high temperatures 400 and 500 c in this work to from mgo via degradation reaction of mg oh 2 33 the obtained results in this work were comparable with those reported in previous studies 24 32 the panalytical x pert highscore plus version 3 0 5 software was used to determine the proportion of mgo and mg oh 2 crystallization in biochar as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 400 to 500 c the proportion of mg oh 2 decreased while the proportion of mgo increased in the mgo biochar composites from both biomass materials for instance in the corn cob based mgo biochar the proportion of mg oh 2 declined from 61 to 49 whereas those of mgo increased from 39 to 51 when pyrolysis temperature increased from 400 to 500 c supplementary materials fig s2 this could be explained by the degradation of mg oh 2 to form mgo at high temperature 33 the ft ir spectra of four biochars rn400 rn500 cn400 and cn500 and their corresponding composites mgrn400 mgrn500 mgcn400 and mgcn500 are shown in fig 2 the presence of mgo and mg oh 2 in biochars based nanocomposites was also confirmed by ft ir spectrum a sharp and intense peak at 3698 cm 1 corresponded to asymmetric stretching vibrations of oh groups 24 while the wide and strong absorption band at 475 cm 1 was the bending vibration of mgo 25 the peak at 1680 cm 1 was also linked with the stretching vibration of oh groups of cellulose chains the large peak at around 1100 cm 1 corresponded to oc stretching vibrations in cellulose 26 27 and or the sio2 residue after the pyrolysis to produce biochars 34 in addition the vibrations of cc and co in aromatic structures on the surface of biochar were observed at the region of 1560 1575 cm 1 26 27 the surface chemical state of biochar based nanocomposites was analyzed using xps the xps survey spectra of rmgn400 cmgn400 rmgn500 and cmgn500 samples presented in fig 3 and xps spectra of the c 1s o 1s mg 1s and mg 2p regions presented in fig s3 supplementary materials confirmed the presence of mg c o on the surface of biochars for instance the energy binding of mg 1s o 1s and c 1s respectively at around 1303 532 and 284 ev can be assigned to magnesium in mgo mg oh 2 oxygen in the biochar and mgo mg oh 2 and c in the biochar 35 it is noted that the intensity of mg 1s peak in rmgn400 and rmgn500 were relatively higher than the corresponding corn cob biochar based nanocomposites cmgn400 and cmgn500 suggesting that the nanocomposites produced from rice husk as precursor resulted in higher mgo and mg oh 2 proportions than those produced from corn cob this may be linked with the discrepancy in the porosity of the studied materials the surface morphology of biochar and mgo biochar composites was examined by sem method and the chemical composition was analyzed with the aid of edx method the results on surface morphology revealed that the corncob unmodified biochar fig 4b was coarser and more porous than rice husk unmodified biochar fig 4a the mgo biochars fig 4c d showed in its structure the growth of agglomerates deposited on the surface of the biochars which were likely mgo mg oh 2 formation 46 pinto et al 48 reported the same behavior for a mgo impregnated biochar produced from carrot mgo biochars showed nanostructured clusters flakes of mgo mg oh 2 on the carbon surface fig 4c d which were not present in the unmodified biochar samples in addition the structure of large pores in the cn500 sample seemed to be ruptured by the activation process which resulted in smaller fragments on which deposited agglomerates of mgo mg oh 2 edx results revealed that rn500 rice husk mainly contained si element while cn500 corn cob also contained other minerals such as k ca al and cl with very low contents in addition to si supplementary materials fig s4 with regard to cmgn500 and rmgn500 nanocomposites mg was the most abundant elements and the presence of the other elements si cl was relatively in small quantities confirming the introduction of mgo and or mg oh 2 on biochars surfaces was successful the results of n2 adsorption desorption of different materials are shown in the fig 5 the adsorption desorption curves of rmgn500 cmgn500 and cn500 samples shared a common type v isotherm with h3 hysteresis loop represented for mesoporous material the rn500 sample was type i with h3 hysteresis loop which was characterized by microporous structure the sbet of rn500 rmgn500 cn500 and cmgn500 samples were respectively 263 85 m2 g 196 04 m2 g 7 02 m2 g and 106 71 m2 g the average pore diameters of rn500 fig 5a rmgn500 fig 5b cn500 fig 5c and cmgn500 fig 5d were 5 57 nm 11 34 nm 29 17 nm and 17 50 nm respectively this revealed that biochar produced from rice husk presented higher specific area than that produced from corn cob in addition the incorporation of nano mgo mg oh 2 into biochar made of rice husk led to an increase in diameter of pores but a decrease in surface area this might be linked with the expansion of biochar s pore due to agglomerates of nano mgo mg oh 2 present within the pores of the mgo biochar composites as for the biochar made from corn cob cn500 and its composites cmgn500 the modification of biochar by magnesium led to a significant increase in surface area 7 02 m2 g for cn500 compared with 106 71 m2 g for cmgn500 and to an important decline in pore diameter the average pore diameter of cn500 sample was 29 17 nm compared with 17 50 nm for cmgn500 this could be associated to the fact that biochar was filled with mgo and or mg oh 2 nanoparticles which resulted in a reduction of pore diameter and the high surface areas of mgo and or mg oh 2 nanoparticles could lead to an augmentation of mgo biochar nanocomposites surface isoelectric values of biochar and mgo biochar composites were evaluated to quantify the change in their surface charge as a function of ph the phpzc for rn500 cn500 rmgn500 and cmgn500 were 5 4 8 8 10 2 and 10 6 respectively supplementary materials fig s5 implying that mg biochar composites are negatively charged in environmental water at near neutral ph it is likely that the mgo biochar composites have attained their negative charge from the mgo and mg oh 2 surfaces 36 3 3 adsorption of ammonium and phosphate 3 3 1 comparison of the adsorption capacity of different materials to compare the removal efficiency of materials for the adsorption of ammonium ions and phosphate ions batch experiments were conducted with the same initial concentrations 100 mg l for both nh4 and po4 3 the experimental results are shown in the fig 6 in general the unmodified and modified biochars derived from rice husk presented better adsorption efficiencies compared to the corresponding materials obtained from corn cob regarding the removal of nh4 and po4 3 in addition the chemical modification of biochars by magnesium led to increases in the adsorption efficiency concerning the removal of nh4 the rn500 and rmgn500 materials respectively showed adsorption efficiencies of 66 and 69 while these values for cn500 and cmgn500 were 53 and 55 fig 6 as regards the adsorption of po4 3 biochars modified by magnesium presented much better adsorption efficiency than unmodified biochars for instance the rn500 and cn500 respectively adsorbed 44 and 33 of po4 3 in solutions while these figures for rmgn500 and cmgn500 were 71 and 53 respectively this could be attributed to positive charges of nano mgo mg oh 2 in neutral solutions and or precipitation reaction between mg2 and anion phosphate as the chemical modification of biochars by magnesium presented better adsorption capacity regarding the removal of nh4 and po4 3 from solutions only the results on the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 by modified biochars are presented in the subsequent sections 3 3 2 effect of contact time adsorption kinetics fig 7 shows the effect of contact time to the adsorption of ammonium and phosphate ions it was observed that the removal efficiency increased in correlation with the contact time as regards the adsorption of nh4 the equilibrium time for rmgn500 and cmgn500 were respectively 4 h and 7 h the corresponding removal efficiencies were 17 05 mg g and 15 80 mg g respectively similar trend was observed in the adsorption of po4 3 nanocomposites based on biochar derived from corn cob presented a lower equilibrium time than the ones based on biochar derived from rice husk did 6 h for cmgn500 vs 7 h for rmgn500 the results on equilibrium time in this work were comparable with others previously reported 27 37 the removal efficiency of cmgn500 at equilibrium time was 27 5 mg g while this value for rmgn500 was 35 1 mg g these implied that nanocomposites based on biochar from rice husk presented higher adsorption efficiency than those produced from corn cob to examine the adsorption kinetics of the adsorption processes for the removal of nh4 and po4 3 at 25 c the pseudo first order kinetic the pseudo second order kinetic and the intraparticle diffusion kinetic models were employed the obtained results are presented in table 3 among the models deployed the avrami model fitted the experimental data the best as it presented the highest r2 values and low percentage deviations of q e for instance the adsorption of ammonium by rmgn500 and cmgn500 the r2 values were respectively 0 998 and 0 999 for the avrami model while these values for the pseudo first pseudo second order models and the intra particle diffusion model were in the range of 0 776 0 992 table 3 concerning the adsorption of po4 3 by rmgn500 and cmgn500 materials the r2 values for the avrami model were respectively 0 998 and 0 999 while these figures for the pseudo first pseudo second order models and the intra particle diffusion model were within the range of 0 849 0 998 the percentage deviations of q e in the rage of 6 3 10 5 for the avrami model were slightly higher than those 2 6 6 9 for pseudo second order model but lower than those 7 6 14 9 obtained from the pseudo first order model table 3 these suggest that mechanism changes occur during the adsorption processes which could be attributed to diffusion of adsorbates intra particle diffusion and mass transfer processes 38 39 3 3 3 effect of initial ph of solutions fig 8 shows the impact of the initial ph values on the adsorption efficiency of the mgo biochar nanocomposites with regard to the adsorption of ammonium in solutions it was shown that the adsorption efficiency of mgo biochar nanocomposites quickly increased in correlation with ph values of the examined solutions reached the maximum value at ph 8 q 19 1 mg g and 17 2 mg g for rmgn500 and cmgn500 respectively however the adsorption efficiency of mgo biochar nanocomposites declined when the ph value went beyond 8 especially there was a steep fall in adsorption efficiency for the solutions having ph 10 or higher fig 8 it was noted that the phpzc of rmgn500 and cmgn500 were respectively 10 2 and 10 6 meaning that in the ph 10 solutions the surfaces of rmgn500 and cmgn500 would be positively charged this led to a defavored adsorption of nh4 onto rmgn500 and cmgn500 materials surfaces due to electrostatic repulsive forces in addition there was a competitive adsorption of h in more acidic solutions leading to reductions in the adsorption efficiency of rmgn500 and cmgn500 materials these observations were in agreement with previous reports 9 40 41 when the ph was higher than 8 ammonium ions were converted into nh3 eq which could not be adsorbed onto the adsorbent 40 41 leading to a decline in removal yield as regards the adsorption of po4 3 a similar trend compared to the adsorption of nh4 was observed fig 8 overall the phosphate removal yield gradually increased with an increase in the ph value attained the maximum values at ph 8 q 37 5 mg g and 30 0 mg g for rmgn500 and cmgn500 respectively then declined in the ph 8 there were different factors contributing to these observations 1 in the ph 10 solutions the surfaces of rmgn500 and cmgn500 materials were positively charged leading to electrostatic attrition force between phosphate and the rmgn500 and cmgn500 hence favoring the phosphate adsorption capacity 2 the precipitation between ion mg2 phosphate which was in some cases the dominant mechanism for the removal of phosphate from solutions 42 3 in acidic solution ph up to 2 14 pk a1 h3po4 acid was the most abundant phosphorus species in the solution leading to no interaction with the positive surfaces of the examined materials when the ph was between 2 14 and 7 2 pk a2 7 20 h2po4 anions were predominant resulting in an increase in phosphate adsorption at higher ph values in the range of 7 2 13 2 pk a3 13 2 hpo4 2 anions were mainly present in the solution presented double negative load of these species onto rmgn500 and cmgn500 adsorbents conforming the best adsorption efficiency at ph 8 when ph values increased from 8 to 9 there was a small decline in the adsorption efficiency due to the competitive adsorption between hpo4 2 and oh anions once the ph values were 10 there were not only a higher competitive adsorption of oh anions but also an electrostatic repulsion between hpo4 2 anions and the negative surfaces of rmgn500 and cmgn500 adsorbents similar results were obtained in previous studies 24 43 3 3 4 effect of the initial concentration of pollutants adsorption isotherms the results on the effect of the initial concentrations to the adsorption efficiency are presented in fig 9 the adsorption capacity of both rmgn500 and cmgn500 adsorbents increased with the augmentation of nh4 and po4 3 initial concentrations this observation might be attributed to 1 at low concentrations of nh4 and po4 3 the mass transfer of ions and the adsorbed fraction of ions became low leading to the low adsorption efficiency 2 when the ion concentrations increased the increase in mass transfer of ions resulted in the higher ratio of ion occupied the available adsorption sites on the surface of materials therefore increasing the adsorption yield 44 45 when the ion concentrations were saturated 40 mg l for nh4 and 50 mg l for po4 3 the number of unoccupied active sites decreased leading to a decline in adsorption efficiency the experimental results were then subjected to two adsorption isotherm models langmuir and freundlich for studying the adsorption isotherm the obtained results in fig 9 depicted that both langmuir and freundlich models fitted well the experimental data however langmuir model described the nh4 and po4 3 adsorption processes better than freundlich model this was shaped by the higher coefficient of determination r2 for langmuir model for instance the adsorption of nh4 showed r2 0 988 for rmgn500 and r2 0 968 for cmgn500 langmuir model while those values for freundlich model were r2 0 975 for rmgn500 and r2 0 960 for cmgn500 respectively similarly the adsorption of po4 3 revealed r2 0 988 for rmgn500 and r2 0 975 for cmgn500 langmuir model and r2 0 980 for rmgn500 and r2 0 970 for cmgn500 freundlich model this suggested that the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 on to rmgn500 and cmgn500 was mainly chemisorption with monolayer the nh4 maximum uptake calculated according to langmuir model were 21 32 mg g for rmgn500 and 16 31 mg g for cmgn500 while the maximum uptake of po4 3 were 117 77 mg g and 52 24 mg g for of cmgn450 and rmgn450 respectively it is noted that biochars made of rice husk rn500 rmgn500 always presented better adsorption capacities compared to those made of corn cob cn500 and cmgn500 this could be associated to the larger surface areas of rhn500 and rmgn500 compared to cn500 and cmgn500 as presented in section 3 2 and or the presence of higher nano mgo content in rmgn500 in comparison with cmgn500 which might facilitate the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 on rmgn500 samples finally the main characteristics of mgo biochar composites obtained in this work was tabulated and compared with other works in table 4 it was noted that our obtained biochars presented higher surface areas compared to several other types of biochars except for those produced from reed straw 345 9 m2 g 44 and wheat straw 187 6 m2 g which were produced by several steps including the use of concentrated bases 48 concerning the adsorption of po4 3 in solutions the prepared adsorbents in this work exhibited better adsorption capacity than all almost other similar materials 50 120 mg g vs about 20 60 mg g as regards nh4 adsorption process the adsorption capacity obtained by this work was higher than those observed by adsorbents produced from reed and wheat straws table 4 while it was comparable with the adsorbents produced from corncob around 20 mg g the mgo biochars in this work provides excellent adsorbents for the removal of nh4 and po4 3 from solutions 3 3 5 adsorption thermodynamics the results on thermodynamic parameters calculated from the experimental data obtained at three different temperatures 25 35 and 45 c are tabulated in table 5 the negative g 0 values obtained in this study implied that the adsorption nature was thermodynamically spontaneous for both nh4 and po4 3 adsorption processes onto both types of adsorbents rmgn500 and cmgn500 in addition the absolute value of g 0 slightly increased when the temperature augmented suggesting more adsorbed amount of nh4 and po4 3 onto rmgn500 and cmgn500 at higher temperatures these obtained results were similar with previous reports on the adsorption of ammonium 46 and phosphate 36 on biochars the enthalpy value h 0 was positive indicating the endothermic nature of the adsorption in general the adsorption enthalpy in the range of 2 to 20 kj mol characterizes a physical adsorption all the values of h 0 obtained in this work were 18 844 kj mol for po4 3 adsorption and 8 145 kj mol for nh4 adsorption corresponded to physical adsorption the results obtained in the adsorption kinetics and the adsorption isotherm model sections revealed that chemisorption better descried the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 onto rmgn500 and cmgn500 while the adsorption thermodynamics suggested the physisorption was more representative therefore one could conclude that the adsorption processes of nh4 and po4 3 onto rmgn500 and cmgn500 were both physisorption and chemisorption this could be attributed to the heterogenous surfaces of rmgn500 and cmgn500 nanocomposites as regard the entropy characteristics on the adsorption process s 0 values were positive for all the adsorption processes and received positive values in the range of 66 69 j mol for po4 3 sorption and in the range of 45 49 j mol for nh4 sorption suggesting that there was an increase in the disorder and randomness at rmgn500 and cmgn500 solution interfaces during the sorption the adsorption mechanism for phosphorous removal could be linked to two major pathways 1 electrostatic attraction between anions po4 3 h2po4 and hpo4 2 and positively charged mgo biochars in solutions having ph 10 as presented previously in this work similar results were obtained the works conducted by zhang et al 20 li et al 24 and jiang et al 50 and 2 mgo mg oh 2 on the mgo biochar composites could generate mg2 in solutions which then reacted with phosphate to form mgp precipitates such as mg h2po4 2 mghpo4 and or mg3 po4 2 27 47 48 according the reactions below 13 mgo h 2 o mg oh 2 mg 2 2oh 14 biochar mg 2 po 4 3 biochar mg h 2 po 4 2 mghpo 4 mg 3 po 4 2 the nh4 adsorption mechanism could be attributed to electrostatic interaction as revealed previously and or by ion exchange between nh4 and acidic functional groups phenolic carboxylic and cation mg2 on the surface of mgo biochar nano composites 42 44 gong et al 42 found that mg2 cation exchange was the dominant mechanism for nh4 removal from solutions while hou et al 44 revealed that na k and ca2 ion exchange and acidic function groups such as phenolic oh and carboxyl c o 3 3 6 regeneration of adsorbents the obtained results showed that there was a slight decrease in the adsorption of po4 3 by mgo biochar based nanocomposites after 3 cycles the adsorption efficiencies declined from 91 0 to 80 3 for rmgn500 and from 88 0 to 79 5 for cmgn500 after 3 adsorption desorption cycles fig 10 thus rmgn500 and cmgn500 adsorbents could be effectively reused by using the 0 5 m naoh solution as an eluent to remove phosphate it is noted that the use of 1 m naoh solution for the phosphate desorption resulted in a similar efficiency to that obtained by using 0 5 m naoh solution for the first cycle 91 and slightly better than those in the subsequent cycles supplementary materials fig s6 whereas the use of 0 25 m naoh led to the less effective for the phosphate desorption 0 5 m naoh solution was therefore selected for the desorption and regeneration processes to avoid using naoh concentrated solution the results on nh4 desorption and recyclability of rmgn500 and cmgn500 presented even more stable removal efficiencies around 80 after 3 cycles this confirmed that the ion exchange and electrostatic interaction between nh4 and rmgn500 and cmgn500 were important mechanisms in the nh4 adsorption processes diluted hcl solutions could be used as good agents for the desorption of nh4 from rmgn500 and cmgn500 it is noted that in real water samples the presence of other pollutants such as natural organic matter nom organic pollutants heavy metals other cation anions suspended solids bacteria and so on may have negative impacts on the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents due to competitive adsorption therefore the evaluation of the adsorption efficiency regarding the removal of nh4 and po4 3 in real samples is of great importance and it will be performed in our future works 4 conclusion biochars and mgo biochars based nanocomposites were successfully synthesized at different temperatures from corn cob and rice husk these adsorbents were systematically characterized the results confirmed the presence of both mgo and mg oh 2 with different proportions in the mgo nanocomposites the presence of mgo and mg oh 2 nanoparticles led to changes in biochars surface characteristics surface areas charge and chemical properties which influenced the nh4 and po4 3 adsorption processes both chemisorption and physisorption mechanisms occurred during the adsorption of nh4 and po4 3 the adsorption processes were spontaneous endothermic and followed the avrami model which was shaped by changes in mechanism during the adsorption processes this research revealed that the biochars produced from corn cob and rice husk impregnated with magnesium were promising materials for the removal and reuse of ammonium and phosphate data availability all data

13029,coal fired power plants produce a large amount of sulfate laden flue gas desulphurization fgd wastewater while a sustainable amount of incineration ash was produced as solid waste in biomass power plants both fgd wastewater and incineration ash led to serious environmental problems without proper treatment sulfate reduction was an efficient technology for fgd wastewater treatment however the carbon source was insufficient for reducing sulfate in fgd wastewater which needed to be replenished in this study pyrolyzed incineration bottom ash pia was introduced to sulfate reducers for fgd wastewater treatment sulfate reducing activity increased up to 2 9 fold with pia300 incineration ash pyrolyzed under 300 c addition remarkably increasing abundance of clostridium 12 fold and paraclostridium sp 79 fold bacteria were observed in sulfate reducing sludge with pia300 addition pyrolyzed incineration ash not only acted as a carrier for sulfate reducers but also provided additional carbon alkalinity and trace elements fe k ca etc for sulfate reduction incineration ash was partially degraded by sulfate reducing bacteria up to 39 4 meanwhile heavy metals mg al cr co ni cu zn etc leached from ash and existed in fgd wastewater were efficiently co removed 95 100 addition of pia to sulfate reducers led to increased formation of extracellular polymeric substances which might enhance the biotransformation and degradation of organic matters in both ash and fgd wastewater thus a promising fgd wastewater treatment technology was established in this study to achieve

keywords sulfate reduction pyrolyzed incineration ash solid carbon source nutrient elements flue gas desulphurization wastewater 1 introduction fossil fuels are the most important energy suppliers in the world including coal petroleum and natural gas which contributes to over 85 of the energy supply in china 1 coal fired power plants produce a large amount of sulfate and metal laden flue gas desulphurization fgd wastewater during wet desulphurization of flue gas which leads to serious corrosion and pollution 2 although the contribution of fossil fuel to energy supply has decreased remarkably during the past decade considering environmental pollution human health and energy crisis the dominance of fossil fuel on the energy supply will not change in a short time period to increase fgd wastewater treatment efficiency and decrease cooperation cost new technology for fgd wastewater treatment has been established for instance membrane filtration advanced oxidation and evaporation 3 4 moreover sulfate reduction is also a promising technology applied for fgd wastewater treatment which simultaneously removes sulfate metals salts and organic matters efficiently 5 6 heterotrophic sulfate reduction converts sulfate to sulfide with organic matter as electron donor under anaerobic condition which is driven by sulfate reducing bacteria srb the produced sulfide performs as a metal scavenger to precipitate metals during fgd wastewater treatment however organic matter is insufficient for reducing sulfate in fgd wastewater and an additional carbon source is required which increases the operation cost for fgd wastewater treatment 5 6 enhanced bacterial sulfate reduction was achieved with addition of graphene oxide 7 8 which not only plays as carrier for srb but is also directly or indirectly involved in electron transfer during sulfate reduction 7 9 10 however graphene oxide is an expensive nanomaterial which may lead to potential risks to natural ecosystems renewable and sustainable energy sources such as wind solar and biomass power have achieved increasing attention by many countries accounting for 8 15 of global energy supply 11 biomass power plants generate heat and power through incineration of agricultural crop straws manure and forestry tree bark wood residues 12 which achieves the highest emission reduction in comparison with wind and solar power in china 13 moreover the policy of chinese government also plays crucial importance role in developing biomass power which aims to reduce co2 emissions and balances carbon footprint 14 incineration ash is carbon and nutrient rich byproduct in biomass power plants approximately 7 biomass yield which consists of fly and bottom ash due to complete and incomplete combustion respectively the disposal of incineration ash needs to be considered to avoid diffusion into water and air as secondary pollution heavy metals are accumulated in fly ash which was involved in directory of national hazardous wastes in china 15 as a non hazardous waste utilization of bottom ash is cost effective and less adventurous to environment 16 which can be used as an amendment to enhance metal removal 17 and microbial activity 18 19 both aerobic and anaerobic biofilm can growth on the surface of bottom ash 20 21 which might be a potential cheap carrier for growth of microbes than nanomaterials and biochar 7 8 22 due to incomplete combustion a sustainable amount of organic matter is present in bottom ash approximately 50 g toc g ash 21 which suggests bottom ash can provide organic substrate to heterotrophic microbes 23 24 therefore incineration bottom ash might be a potentially cheap material to replace graphene oxide to enhance sulfate reducing activity which aims to provide an additional organic carbon source for sulfate reduction due to presence of biodegradable organic matter bacterial sulfate reduction with incineration bottom ash as an amendment was investigated in this study incineration bottom ash was introduced to sulfate reducing bacteria and sludge as carrier and nutrient sources for fgd wastewater treatment pyrolysis was performed on incineration bottom ash at various temperature to improve the surface composition of incineration ash the surface area pore size distribution zeta potential of raw incineration ash ria and pyrolyzed incineration ash pia were investigated then the effect of pyrolysis on growth and activity of sulfate reducing bacteria were compared in sequencing batch reactors sbrs x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and scanning electron microscopy sem were applied to understand the morphology and composition of incineration ash before and after sulfate reduction microbial communities of sulfate reducing biomass before and after addition of pia were monitored based on 16s rrna gene sequencing moreover to further understand the role of pia during growth and sulfate reducing process of srb nutrient concentrations and organic matter composition in raw fgd wastewater pia300 and effluents of sulfate reduction reactor were evaluated extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by sulfate reducers before and after pia300 addition were compared this study established a promising technology for fgd wastewater treatment with the addition of pyrolyzed incineration ash which achieved simultaneous wastewater reclaim and solid waste utilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 source and pyrolysis of incineration ash the bottom ash used in this study was taken from a full scale biomass power plant in zhanjiang guangdong province china 110 24e 21 35n with a capacity of 2 50 mw which combusted agricultural and forest residues such as straw branch bush tree top and root see supplementary material for details of feeding biomass incineration was performed under 500 c in a circulating fluidized bed combustor hx220 9 81 iv1 western power china with twice fresh air supplies bottom ash was collected from the bottom of combustor which accounted to about 4 of the total ash fly ash bottom ash 96 4 w w the collected bottom ash was sieved through a 180 μm mesh screen which was further used for pyrolysis thermconcept micro x 1400 60 shanghai china pyrolysis was performed individually for 2 h under temperature from 200 to 800 c

h 2 2 fgd wastewater and setup of sbr reactor fgd wastewater was taken from a full scale coal fired power plant in zhanjiang guangdong province china 5 6 chemical precipitation and clarification were performed as pretreatment with reported methods 5 and the resulted supernatant was used for sulfate reduction with cod and sulfate concentration of about 110 and 10 000 mg l respectively concentration of chloride fluoride tn tp ph and ss of fgd wastewater before and after chemical precipitation was shown in table s1 5 sulfate reducing bacteria strain by7 enterococcus avium accession number gdmcc1

a previously established sbr reactor which was feed by srm strain by7 culture 20 ml and sulfate reducing sludge 100 ml were transferred to a series of 1 l sbr reactors for fgd wastewater treatment with and without addition of raw and pyrolyzed incineration ash respectively sbr was maintained under 30 c in water batch influent 0 5 h reaction as required settling 2 h and withdrawal 0 5 h were performed in sequence in the sbr reactor during each cycle di nitrogen gas n2 99 99 was supplied to sbr reactor during reaction stage through a diffuser pore size 0 5 mm 15 ml min from the bottom of the reactor for maintaining anaerobic condition and agitation pre treated fgd wastewater of 100 ml was replaced in each cycle of sbr exchange ratio 10 2 3 experiment procedure pyrolysis of incineration ash was performed under various temperatures from 200 to 800 c which were named as pia200 to pia800 both raw and pyrolyzed incineration ash 200 800 c were introduced to strain by7 sulfate reducing bacteria 0 8 w v to investigate the effect of incineration ash addition on sulfate reduction in sulfate reducing medium then dosage of pia to sulfate reducing bacteria was optimized by introducing various amounts of pia including 0 0 8 1 2 1 6 2 and 3 to understand the role of pia in sulfate reduction the sulfate reducing activity of strain by7 bacteria was compared with c s 2 1 and without additional organic carbon source lactate all biomass was taken for total suspension solid tss analysis at the end of the experiment moreover to further examine the application potential of this technology pia300 was introduced to sulfate reducing sludge for fgd wastewater treatment in sbr sbr pia300 for 28 days with less additional lactate c s 1 1 mol mol in contrast sbr without pia300 was performed as a control for fgd wastewater treatment with an additional carbon source of 1 5 1 as reported 5 pia300 was re filled 0 4 to sbr pia300 every 2 cycles to ensure sufficiently solid carbon source for sulfate reduction sulfate concentration was monitored every day to compare desulfurization of fgd wastewater treatment with and without pia addition 2 4 characterization of incineration ash bet surface and porosity of raw and pyrolyzed incineration ash 200 800 c were calculated by the surface area and porosimetry system micromeritics asap 2460 usa zeta potential of raw

pyrolyzed incineration ash with and without srb were investigated by x ray diffractometer panalytical pw3040 60 netherlands using cu radiation after drying 24 h at 105 c chemical composition and functional groups of ria and pia300 before and after sulfate reduction were analyzed through x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher usa with monochromated al kalph anode functional group of ria and pia300 before and after sulfate reduction were compared with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir tensor ii bruker germany respectively the morphology of srb and incineration ash was visualized with scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss merlin microscope germany sample fixation was performed as previously reported 9 2 5 analytical methods supernatants were applied for analysis after centrifugation 5 min 13 000 rpm sulfate and tss concentrations were measured with the standard method 26 lowry method was applied to quantify protein concentration of srb 27 nutrient concentrations in pre treated fgd wastewater pia leachate and effluents of sbr with and without additional incineration ash were detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 28 all samples applied for icp ms analyses were filtered through 0 4 μm filter pia300 leachate was obtained by introducing 20 ml acetate 0 11 m to 0 5 g pia300 incubation of mixture was performed for 16 h with agitation 250 rpm the resulted supernatant centrifuging for 15 min 5000 rpm was used for icp ms analysis organic matters in pre treated fgd wastewater pia300 and effluent of sbr pia300 reactor were identified by gc ms agilent 7890b 5977 with hp 5 column after dichloromethane extraction which was performed as previously reported 5 liquid samples influent and effluent of 20 ml and ash

the resulted pcr product was sequenced on illumina platform miseq shengong china with reported method 5 the sequences data of all three reactor samples were uploaded to ncbi with accession number of prjna714477 3 results 3 1 raw and pyrolyzed incineration ash incineration bottom ash was produced due to incomplete combustion of agricultural wastes which was carbon rich material pyrolysis was performed to raw incineration bottom ash to improve the surface structure of incineration ash under anaerobic condition nitrogen sorption isotherms and pore size distribution of ria and pia were shown in fig 1a and b respectively nitrogen sorption increased with temperature rising below 400 c which decreased with temperature rising over 400 c after pyrolysis the highest bet surface 7 3 m2 g was achieved in pia400 pia with pyrolysis temperature of 400 c which was 4 2 fold higher than ria 1 7 m2 g pyrolysis contributed to enlarging pore size on the surface of incineration ash the largest pore size increased with temperature rising below 300 c which decreased with temperature rising over 300 c after pyrolysis the largest pore size of 64 nm was achieved in pia300 which accounted to about 30 of total pore area see fig 1b both macropores 50 nm and mesopores 2 50 nm were detected on surface of pia300 pia400 and pia500 while only mesopores were detected in ria pia200 pia600 pia700 and pia800 small mesopores provided active site while macropores contributed to the mass transfer of substances 29 therefore hierarchical pore distribution in pia300 pia400 and pia500 might benefit to bacterial sulfate reduction zeta potential shifted with ph variation in the solution the zeta potential of all tested incineration ash samples were negative when the ph was higher than 6 5 while positive zeta potentials were achieved under acidic conditions ph 6 0 for pia200 pia300 pia400 and pia800 bacterial sulfate reduction for fgd wastewater treatment was mainly taken place under acidic condition with ph of 4 0 6 0 5 thus pia300 might benefit to approaching of sulfate and sulfate reducing bacteria during fgd wastewater treatment since the highest zeta potential was observed by pia300 within ph 4 6 crystalline structure of incineration ash was nearly unaffected by the pyrolysis process below 500 c as shown in fig s1 incineration ash consisted of a group of silica minerals including quartz cristobalite and calcite which agreed with the composition of reported biomass power plant ash 30 31 the diffraction peaks at 2θ 21 0 26 7 35 8 36 7 39 6 40 7 42 4 50 4 55 1 60 0 and 68 3 were identified to be quartz while cristobalite and calcite also showed some clear peaks peaks identified to feldspar were detected when the pyrolyzing temperature was over 500 c which might suggest the formation of feldspar during pyrolysis fig s1 3 2 bacterial sulfate reduction with the addition of incineration ash to further identify the effect of pyrolysis and ash addition on bacterial sulfate reduction sulfate reducing activity of strain by7 bacteria were monitored with and without additional incineration ash as shown in fig 2a sulfate removal rate srr increased after addition of incineration ash and srr with pia was higher than srr with ria the highest srr of 0 71 kg so4 2 m3 d was obtained with addition of pia300 which was 2 1 and 1 5 fold higher than the srr without incineration ash and with ria respectively srr with the addition of pia400 to pia800 showed little difference as shown in fig 2a which was 0 58 0 03 kg so4 2 m3 d 16 lower that with addition of pia300 these results might indicate increasing the temperature for incineration ash pyrolysis was economically inefficient for sulfate reduction since increasing of pyrolyzing temperature led to an increasing of the operation cost growth of strain by7 bacteria with and without addition of incineration ash were presented by protein concentration after 100 h see fig 2b addition of incineration ash enhanced 1 58 to 2 16 times growth of strain by7 bacteria which agreed with previous study on addition of graphene oxide to strain by7 bacteria 9 thus the highest potential sulfate reducing activity was achieved 15 63 mg so4 2 gprot h with addition of pia300 which might attributed to hierarchical pore distribution and positive zeta potential of pia300 moreover sulfate reducing activity with addition of bottom ash might also relate to the dielectricity of bottom ash pyrolysis of bottom ash over 320 c led to dielectric loss because of thermal runaway 32 thus 300 c was probably the optimized temperature for incineration ash pyrolysis as amendment for bacterial sulfate reduction the dosage of pia300 to sulfate reducing bacteria was further optimized see fig 2c enhanced sulfate removal was achieved with pia300 dosages between 0 8 and 1 2 while the highest sulfate removal efficiency of 98 1 was obtained with pia300 dosage of 0 8 however sulfate removal efficiency and rate were remarkably decreased when the pia300 dosage was higher than 1 6 these results might indicate the toxicity of introducing surplus incineration ash to sulfate reducers such as metals and metalloids moreover sulfate was not adsorbed by pia300 fig s2 which indicated the observed sulfate removal by srb with pia300 was mainly attributed by bacterial sulfate reduction therefore pia300 with dosage of 0 8 was introduced to sulfate reducing bacteria as amendment in following study 3 3 composition of ria and pia after sulfate reduction crystalline composition of incineration ash was nearly unaffected by the pyrolysis process below 500 c however different xrd patterns were observed after interaction with srb as shown in fig 3a the xrd pattern indicated diffraction peaks of cristobalite and calcite were no longer observed 30 31 in both ria and pia300 after interaction with srb quartz became the only pre dominate chemical in ria and pia300 after sulfate reduction the interaction between incineration ash and srb was further confirmed by ft ir analysis fig s3 which indicated the differences of functional groups between incineration ash before and after sulfate reduction the peaks at 458 776 and 1046 cm 1 could be assigned to symmetric bending symmetric stretching and asymmetric stretching of sio bend in silica minerals 31 33 respectively which agreed with the xrd pattern the peaks located at 1420 875 and 713 cm 1 might attributed to crystalline carbonate in incineration ash which belonged co asymmetric stretching carbonate out of plane and in plane bending vibrations respectively 30 the peak located at 2510 cm 1 might be associated with bicarbonate groups 34 decreasing of intensity was observed for the peak at 1420 cm 1 in both ria and pia300 with srb which might suggest a deceasing abundance of carbonate in incineration ash after sulfate reduction the absorption band at 3422 cm 1 overlapped with the nh and oh groups while the band at 1637 cm 1 was assigned to amide i 10 the intensity of peaks at 1637 and 3422 cm 1 were increased in incineration ashes with srb which might be related to presence of amines and hydroxyl groups of srbs moreover the peaks at 2850 and 2926 cm 1 were assigned to the accessory organic matter produced during biomass incineration 35 which nearly vanished after pyrolysis process the elements of c n o na mg al si p s cl k ca fe and k were detected in incineration ash by xps survey scanning as listed in tables 1 and s2 with exception of c na and fe decreasing abundance of the remaining elements were observed after pyrolysis process moreover elements of cl k and fe were no longer be detected in ria and pia300 after sulfate reduction fig s4 relative abundance of ca decreased in ria and pia300 with srb which was in good accordance with the deceasing abundance of carbonate in ft ir analysis and the absence of calcite in xrd after sulfate reduction four peaks were used to fit the c 1s spectrum in ria and pia300 fig 4a and b and table 1 including cc 284 9 ev co 288 9 ev cf2 293 1 ev and cf3 296 4 ev 9 36 but only three peaks were required to fit the c 1s spectrum in ria and pia300 with srb fig 4c and d which contributed to cc 284 9 ev co 286 1 ev and co 288 6 ev a decreasing abundance of co in bottom ash was observed after pyrolysis which might indicate partial reduction of bottom ash during the anaerobic pyrolysis process the binding energy of co bond was 0 3 ev lower after introducing srb which probably demonstrated interaction between incineration ash and srb moreover the cf2 and cf3 bonds in incineration ash were no longer detected after interaction with srb the peak of co was most likely contributed by growth of bacteria on surface of ria and pia300 which agreed with co bond in ft ir spectrum the presence of co bond was further confirmed by o 1s spectrum in ria and pia300 with srb while only sio peaks were present in ria and pia300 the peak intensity of co bond was higher up to 20 in pia300 with srb than in ria with srb which demonstrated more bacteria attached on the surface of pia300 than ria a peak of so4 2 at 169 2 ev was present in s 2p core level spectra of all samples 9 which was not increasing abundance in sulfate laden srm srb ria and srb pia300 this result confirmed that sulfate was not adsorbed onto the surface of incineration ash moreover a sn 2 peak at 163 4 ev was detected in srb pia300 which suggested increasing activity of bacterial sulfate reduction with additional pia300 6 p 2p core level spectra involved two peaks in incineration ash including an ordinary po3 4 peak 133 3 ev and an unordinary metal phosphate peak 37 however the peak of metal phosphate was no longer detected in ria and pia300 with srb which double confirmed the interaction between incineration ash and srbs incineration ash might be partially degraded by sulfate reducing bacteria which led to breaking of bonds such as cf2 cf3 ccl feo fes and m p a porous structure was observed on the surface incineration ash after pyrolysis by sem fig 3b and d which was in good accordance with pore size results in fig 1b growth of sulfate reducing bacteria as biofilm on the surface of incineration ash were achieved see fig 3c and e which suggested that incineration ash was performed as carrier for the growth of srb it was visible that more bacteria grew onto the surface of pia300 than ria which agreed with the results of protein quantification during sulfate reduction process fig 2b and the higher intensity of co bond in xps spectra fig 4 3 4 sulfate reduction with pia as carbon source bacterial sulfate reduction by strain by7 bacteria was compared with and without introducing organic carbon source lactate in srm by additional pia300 as an amendment fig 5a organic carbon was an important electron donor for reducing sulfate and simultaneous sulfate and organic carbon removal was obtained by strain by7 bacteria however sulfate reduction could still be observed in pia300 amended system without additional carbon source even if residual organic carbon was not detectable throughout the entire experiment the sulfate removal rate achieved 0 20 kg m3 d by srb with lactate while sulfate removal rate obtained 0 05 kg m3 d by srb without lactate tss was 1 36 0 22 g l in srb without ash while tss was 5 66 0 18 g l in srb without pia300 by taking 0 8 additional pia300 into account tss loss achieved 39 5 after sulfate reduction these results suggested incineration ash might provide additional organic carbon for sulfate reduction when carbon source was insufficient which might be relate to partial degradation of incineration ash by sulfate reducing bacteria 3 5 fgd wastewater treatment through sulfate reduction with pia as amendment reactor operation to further evaluate potential of pia as amendment for future application effect of pia addition on sulfate reducing biomass was investigated sulfate reduction with and without pia300 addition were compared in two parallelly operated sbr reactors for fgd wastewater treatment efficiency of sulfate reduction was monitored for about 28 days bacterial sulfate removal rate in sbr with pia300 was remarkably higher 54 than the sbr without incineration ash as shown in fig 5b which were 0 229 kgso4 2 m3 d and 0 148 kgso4 2 m3 d on average with and without pia300 respectively sulfate removal efficiency achieved up to 96 5 on average in sbr with pia300 in each cycle 4 days meanwhile sulfate removal efficiency was only 81 0 on average in sbr without incineration ash pia300 was refilled 0 4 to sbr every 2 cycles as indicated in fig 5b to replenish solid carbon source but no obvious ash accumulation or inhibitory effect was observed which might indicate balance between incineration ash degradation and replenishment thus bacterial sulfate reduction for fgd wastewater treatment was enhanced with pia300 as amendment the addition of pia300 led to remarkably changes in bacterial community in sulfate reducing enrichment figs 5c and s5 potential sulfate reducing bacteria including geobacter 1 4 acinetobacter 1 2 desulfovibrio 1 1 clostridium 7 1 and paraclostridium 0 03 sp bacteria were identified in the enrichment before pia300 addition increasing abundance of clostridium 12 fold and paraclostridium sp bacteria 79 fold were observed after pia300 addition which became the dominant sulfate reducers in the sbr meanwhile decreased abundance of geobacter and desulfovibrio sp sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfurospirillum sp sulfur oxidizing bacteria were achieved in sbr after pia300 addition clostridium and paraclostridium sp bacteria were able to degrade dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt c14h9cl5 and ciprofloxacin cip c17h18fn3o3 during sulfate reduction respectively 38 39 moreover pre dominance of clostridium and paraclostridium sp bacteria were accorded with ccl and cf bonds breaking in xps analysis which might be relate to degradation of widely applied organochlorine pesticides and organofluorine insecticides in agriculture 40 41 moreover increasing abundance of ethanoligenens sporolactobacillus caproiciproducens and lactococcus sp fermentative bacteria might benefit to degradation of organic matters in incineration ash the concentrations of multiple nutrient elements in fgd wastewater influents pia300 leachate and sbr effluents for fgd wastewater treatment without incineration ash with ria and with pia300 were shown in fig 6 both fgd wastewater and leachate of pia300 were rich in various metals and metalloids including major elements of al ti mn fe sr and ba and trace elements of li be v cr co ni cu zn ga as cd sn sb tl pb and bi nutrients were commonly present in extracted bottom ash but the composition of extracted nutrients might be different among references 18 42 44 which might depend on the source and method for combustion and ph for extraction 45 elements of al fe mn and sr were widely abundant in agricultural bottom ash see table s3 the removal efficiencies of metals and metalloids by srb were in the range of 83 5 to 99 8 nevertheless metal removal efficiencies were slightly increased to 93 5 100 after the addition of ria and pia300 thus metal removal efficiency was not inhibited by addition of incineration ash as shown in fig s6 and table s4 20 24 and 20 organic matter were identified in pre treated fgd wastewater ash leachate and effluents of sbr pia300 respectively which consisted of alkanes esters alcohols organic acids aliphatic hydrocarbons and phenol eleven out of 24 organics in the ash leachate were no longer detected in effluent of sbr after sulfate reduction including cyclohexyl dimethoxymethyl silane c9h20o2si naphthalene c10h8 dimethyl dodecane c14h30 heptamethyl nonane c16h34 7 9 di tert butyl 1oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8dione c18h27o3 octadecane c18h38 carbonic acid decyl tridecyl ester c24h48o3 γ sitosterol c29h50o and 1 iodo dotriacontane c32h65i nevertheless three new organics were most likely produced as metabolic products after bacterial sulfate reduction including methoxy acetic acid c3h6o3 butanoic acid c4h8o2 and dimethyl octane c10h22 these results confirmed our hypothesis that incineration ash provided a biodegradable organic carbon source for sulfate reduction 3 6 effect of pia addition on eps of sulfate reducing bacteria eps produced by sulfate reducing bacteria and enrichments with and without pia300 addition were compared as shown in fig 7a the functional group of eps was identified by ftir as shown in fig 7b intensity of the peaks located at about 1120 cm 1 increased after ash addition which was identified as carbohydrates increasing formation of humic acids proteins and polysaccharides in both strain by7 bacteria 5 8 58 1 and sulfate reducing biomass 11 6 98 7 were observed the results of 3d eem were shown in fig 7c to f which presented eps produced by strain by7 bacteria and sulfate reducing enrichment with stress group and without pia300 control group five peaks could be identified at ex em wavelength of 280 300 a 280 350 b 225 350 c 250 450 d and 450 450 e which indicated presence of tryptophan tryptophan tyrosine humus and fulvic like substances respectively four peaks a b c and d were observed in the by7 bacteria control group while five peaks a b c d and e were obtained in the ash stress group by7 bacteria with pia300 addition similarly only peak a was identified in the enrichment control group while peaks of a b and c were detected in the ash stress group enrichments with pia300 addition increasing intensity of peak a was achieved in both stress groups these results demonstrated increasing production of eps by sulfate reducers after pia300 addition which was important electron carriers during sulfate reduction process 10 4 discussion 4 1 role of pyrolyzed incineration ash during bacterial sulfate reduction incineration bottom ash was produced through incomplete combustion which contained sustainable amount of biodegradable organic matter 23 the pyrolysis process was performed to activate incineration ash which increased pore size and surface area of incineration ash due to escaping of multiple nutrients elements and partial reduction of co in bottom ash enlarged pore size distribution and surface characteristics might benefit to growth of srb and substrate transformation pia300 was introduced to sulfate reducing biosystem in this study which probably played the roles as carriers carbon alkalinity and trace element source first pia300 was used as carrier for immobilizing sulfate reducing bacteria the growth and activity of bacteria both increased after immobilization process 9 44 45 in this study enhanced growth of srb on the surface of incineration ash was observed through sem fig 3 which was further confirmed by protein assay and xps analysis co bond enhanced sulfate reducing activity was achieved after addition of pia300 this result was in good accordance with previous study which reported addition of go as carrier for srb 9 however incineration ash was much cheaper than go as a carrier material enhanced sulfate reducing activity with additional pia300 led to higher metal removal efficiency since sulfide dependent precipitation and co precipitation were the main metal removal pathway during fgd wastewater treatment 5 10 moreover pia300 provided additional organic matters to sulfate reduction process when carbon source was insufficient sulfate reducing bacteria was powerful heterotroph which was able to degrade various organic matters such as benzene toluene sulfamethoxazole and refractory organic matters in fgd wastewater 5 6 48 49 the presence of biodegradable organic matters in bottom ash had been reported 21 23 in this study we confirmed 11 organic matters that present in leachate of pia300 was degraded by sulfate reduction moreover srb might partially decompose pia300 and utilize the resulted carbon matters as electron donors carbon source to reducing sulfate which stimulated growth of refractory organic using sulfate reducers in the enrichment such as clostridium and paraclostridium sp bacteria 38 39 breaking of cf2 cf3 ccl feo fes and m p bonds in incineration ash were observed after sulfate reduction which confirmed partial decomposition of incineration ash moreover sulfate reduction was observed in the incineration ash addition system without additional carbon source even if sulfate reducing rate without carbon source was only 25 of the rate with additional carbon source increasing formation of eps by sulfate reducers with additional pia300 probably benefit to bio transformation 50 and biodegradation of refractory organic matters 5 10 furthermore pia300 might also provide trace elements for the growth of srb the abundance of fe cl k and ca decreased in incineration ash after sulfate reduction which were important trace elements in medium for cultivating srb 9 the iron sulfur containing proteins complex was crucially important for sulfate reducers which was metal active sites for rubredoxin family ferredoxins and hydrogenases 51 cl k and ca were important elements for maintaining osmotic pressure of bacteria decreasing abundance of bicarbonate and carbonate were observed in incineration after sulfate reduction which led to increase of ph in the effluent fig s7 this result suggested bi carbonate present in incineration ash was able to balance the acids produced during sulfate reduction which benefited to decrease the operation cost of fgd wastewater 4 2 economic evaluation of fgd wastewater desulfurization technology through bacterial sulfate reduction with additional pia300 the integrated chemical precipitation and sulfate reduction process was newly developed biotechnology for fgd wastewater treatment which achieved the advantage of simultaneous removal of sulfate metal organic matter and salts with lower operation cost the major operation cost during sulfate reduction of fgd wastewater was the addition of an organic carbon source which was insufficient for reducing sulfate lactate was introduced to fgd wastewater with c s ratio of 1 5 1 5 after the addition of pia300 to srb lactate introduced to fgd wastewater was further decreased to a c s ratio of 1 1 stable sulfate reducing activity was achieved for 30 days in the srb pia300 reactor which suggested organic carbon required during sulfate reduction was partially supplied through the degradation of incineration ash the operation cost for carbon source addition could reduce 33 after introducing pia300 moreover acid was produced during sulfate reducing process which led to decline of ph value from 7 5 to 3 0 during fgd wastewater treatment after addition of pia300 ph value increased to about 4 0 4 5 at the end of each cycle incineration ash provided additional alkalinity carbonate and bicarbonate to balance the acid produced during sulfate reduction incineration ash had been used as an alkaline material to improve soil ph 17 thus addition of pia300 could remarkably decrease the cost for balancing ph in the effluent of sulfate reduction incineration ash was produced during combustion of solid waste agricultural waste and industrial waste both bottom ash and fly ash contained various heavy metals such as al fe mg ca mn and so on 18 42 44 which might lead to soil and water secondary pollution without proper disposal fly ash was developed to be good adsorbent for removing gaseous pollutants including ammonia vocs heavy metals sox and nox due to the high porosity and surface area 35 52 while bottom ash was commonly applied as acid soil and construction amendment 17 as a waste of incineration power plant incineration bottom ash was a cheap material which could be used for road construction after further treatment 53 as far as we know this study is the first tryout for using incineration bottom ash as amendment for bacterial sulfate reduction process pia300 was performed as carrier to enhance sulfate reducing activity which was cost friendly amendment in comparison to nanomaterials go or rgo and biochar 9 10 moreover incineration bottom ash could be utilized by sulfate reducers as carbon and nutrient source meanwhile heavy metals present in incineration ash could be extracted and precipitated during fgd wastewater treatment thus addition of incineration bottom ash not only reduced the cost of additional organic source for fgd wastewater but also achieved simultaneous disposal of incineration bottom ash and fgd wastewater fig s8 which obtained doubled environment benefits 5 conclusion simultaneous disposal of incineration bottom ash and fgd wastewater was achieved in this study by introducing pyrolyzed incineration ash pia to sulfate reducers as amendment pyrolysis improved the pore size and surface area of incineration ash the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria was enhanced after addition of incineration ash growth of clostridium and paraclostridium sp bacteria was stimulated by addition of incineration ash which might be the pre dominate sulfate reducers related to incineration ash decomposition pyrolyzed incineration ash played not only as carrier for sulfate reducing bacteria but also provided additional carbon source alkane and ester and nutrient elements trace elements and alkaline for sulfate reduction heavy metals were efficiently removed 95 100 during sulfate reduction although additional metals were introduced by incineration ash moreover addition of incineration ash led to increasing formation of eps which might subsequently benefit to organic matter degradation thus a promising fgd wastewater recycling technology was established in this study by utilizing incineration ash for sulfate reduction which at least decreased 33 organic carbon cost for fgd wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

13029,coal fired power plants produce a large amount of sulfate laden flue gas desulphurization fgd wastewater while a sustainable amount of incineration ash was produced as solid waste in biomass power plants both fgd wastewater and incineration ash led to serious environmental problems without proper treatment sulfate reduction was an efficient technology for fgd wastewater treatment however the carbon source was insufficient for reducing sulfate in fgd wastewater which needed to be replenished in this study pyrolyzed incineration bottom ash pia was introduced to sulfate reducers for fgd wastewater treatment sulfate reducing activity increased up to 2 9 fold with pia300 incineration ash pyrolyzed under 300 c addition remarkably increasing abundance of clostridium 12 fold and paraclostridium sp 79 fold bacteria were observed in sulfate reducing sludge with pia300 addition pyrolyzed incineration ash not only acted as a carrier for sulfate reducers but also provided additional carbon alkalinity and trace elements fe k ca etc for sulfate reduction incineration ash was partially degraded by sulfate reducing bacteria up to 39 4 meanwhile heavy metals mg al cr co ni cu zn etc leached from ash and existed in fgd wastewater were efficiently co removed 95 100 addition of pia to sulfate reducers led to increased formation of extracellular polymeric substances which might enhance the biotransformation and degradation of organic matters in both ash and fgd wastewater thus a promising fgd wastewater treatment technology was established in this study to achieve simultaneous fgd wastewater reclaim and solid waste utilization graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations fgd flue gas desulphurization pia pyrolyzed incineration bottom ash ria raw

keywords sulfate reduction pyrolyzed incineration ash solid carbon source nutrient elements flue gas desulphurization wastewater 1 introduction fossil fuels are the most important energy suppliers in the world including coal petroleum and natural gas which contributes to over 85 of the energy supply in china 1 coal fired power plants produce a large amount of sulfate and metal laden flue gas desulphurization fgd wastewater during wet desulphurization of flue gas which leads to serious corrosion and pollution 2 although the contribution of fossil fuel to energy supply has decreased remarkably during the past decade considering environmental pollution human health and energy crisis the dominance of fossil fuel on the energy supply will not change in a short time period to increase fgd wastewater treatment efficiency and decrease cooperation cost new technology for fgd wastewater treatment has been established for instance membrane filtration advanced oxidation and evaporation 3 4 moreover sulfate reduction is also a promising technology applied for fgd wastewater treatment which simultaneously removes sulfate metals salts and organic matters efficiently 5 6 heterotrophic sulfate reduction converts sulfate to sulfide with organic matter as electron donor under anaerobic condition which is driven by sulfate reducing bacteria srb the produced sulfide performs as a metal scavenger to precipitate metals during fgd wastewater treatment however organic matter is insufficient for reducing sulfate in fgd wastewater and an additional carbon source is required which increases the operation cost for fgd wastewater treatment 5 6 enhanced bacterial sulfate reduction was achieved with addition of graphene oxide 7 8 which not only plays as carrier for srb but is also directly or indirectly involved in electron transfer during sulfate reduction 7 9 10 however graphene oxide is an expensive nanomaterial which may lead to potential risks to natural ecosystems renewable and sustainable energy sources such as wind solar and biomass power have achieved increasing attention by many countries accounting for 8 15 of global energy supply 11 biomass power plants generate heat and power through incineration of agricultural crop straws manure and forestry tree bark wood residues 12 which achieves the highest emission reduction in comparison with wind and solar power in china 13 moreover the policy of chinese government also plays crucial importance role in developing biomass power which aims to reduce co2 emissions and balances carbon footprint 14 incineration ash is carbon and nutrient rich byproduct in biomass power plants approximately 7 biomass yield which consists of fly and bottom ash due to complete and incomplete combustion respectively the disposal of incineration ash needs to be considered to avoid diffusion into water and air as secondary pollution heavy metals are accumulated in fly ash which was involved in directory of national hazardous wastes in china 15 as a non hazardous waste utilization of bottom ash is cost effective and less adventurous to environment 16 which can be used as an amendment to enhance metal removal 17 and microbial activity 18 19 both aerobic and anaerobic biofilm can growth on the surface of bottom ash 20 21 which might be a potential cheap carrier for growth of microbes than nanomaterials and biochar 7 8 22 due to incomplete combustion a sustainable amount of organic matter is present in bottom ash approximately 50 g toc g ash 21 which suggests bottom ash can provide organic substrate to heterotrophic microbes 23 24 therefore incineration bottom ash might be a potentially cheap material to replace graphene oxide to enhance sulfate reducing activity which aims to provide an additional organic carbon source for sulfate reduction due to presence of biodegradable organic matter bacterial sulfate reduction with incineration bottom ash as an amendment was investigated in this study incineration bottom ash was introduced to sulfate reducing bacteria and sludge as carrier and nutrient sources for fgd wastewater treatment pyrolysis was performed on incineration bottom ash at various temperature to improve the surface composition of incineration ash the surface area pore size distribution zeta potential of raw incineration ash ria and pyrolyzed incineration ash pia were investigated then the effect of pyrolysis on growth and activity of sulfate reducing bacteria were compared in sequencing batch reactors sbrs x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray diffraction xrd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and scanning electron microscopy sem were applied to understand the morphology and composition of incineration ash before and after sulfate reduction microbial communities of sulfate reducing biomass before and after addition of pia were monitored based on 16s rrna gene sequencing moreover to further understand the role of pia during growth and sulfate reducing process of srb nutrient concentrations and organic matter composition in raw fgd wastewater pia300 and effluents of sulfate reduction reactor were evaluated extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by sulfate reducers before and after pia300 addition were compared this study established a promising technology for fgd wastewater treatment with the addition of pyrolyzed incineration ash which achieved simultaneous wastewater reclaim and solid waste utilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 source and pyrolysis of incineration ash the bottom ash used in this study was taken from a full scale biomass power plant in zhanjiang guangdong province china 110 24e 21 35n with a capacity of 2 50 mw which combusted agricultural and forest residues such as straw branch bush tree top and root see supplementary material for details of feeding biomass incineration was performed under 500 c in a circulating fluidized bed combustor hx220 9 81 iv1 western power china with twice fresh air supplies bottom ash was collected from the bottom of combustor which accounted to about 4 of the total ash fly ash bottom ash 96 4 w w the collected bottom ash was

a previously established sbr reactor which was feed by srm strain by7 culture 20 ml and sulfate reducing sludge 100 ml were transferred to a series of 1 l sbr reactors for fgd wastewater treatment

performed in sequence in the sbr reactor during each cycle di nitrogen gas n2 99 99 was supplied to sbr reactor during reaction stage through a diffuser pore size 0 5 mm 15 ml min from the bottom of the reactor for maintaining anaerobic condition and agitation pre treated fgd wastewater of 100 ml was replaced in each cycle of sbr exchange ratio 10 2 3 experiment procedure pyrolysis of incineration ash was performed under various temperatures from 200 to 800 c which were named as pia200 to pia800 both raw and pyrolyzed incineration ash 200 800 c were introduced to strain by7 sulfate reducing bacteria 0 8 w v to investigate the effect of incineration ash addition on sulfate reduction in sulfate reducing medium then dosage of pia to sulfate reducing bacteria was optimized by introducing various amounts of pia including 0 0 8 1 2 1 6 2 and 3 to understand the role of pia in sulfate reduction the sulfate reducing activity of strain by7 bacteria was compared with c s 2 1 and without additional organic carbon source lactate all biomass was taken for total suspension solid tss analysis at the end of the experiment moreover to further examine the application potential of this technology pia300 was introduced to sulfate reducing sludge for fgd wastewater treatment in sbr sbr pia300 for 28 days with less additional lactate c s 1 1 mol mol in contrast sbr without pia300

carbon source for sulfate reduction sulfate concentration was monitored every day to compare desulfurization of fgd wastewater treatment with and without pia addition 2 4 characterization of incineration ash bet surface and porosity of raw and pyrolyzed incineration ash 200 800 c were calculated by the surface area and porosimetry system micromeritics asap 2460 usa zeta potential of raw

the resulted pcr product was sequenced on illumina platform miseq shengong china with reported method 5 the sequences data of all three reactor samples were uploaded to ncbi with accession number of prjna714477 3 results 3 1 raw and pyrolyzed incineration ash incineration bottom ash was produced due to incomplete combustion of agricultural wastes which was carbon rich material pyrolysis was performed to raw incineration bottom ash to improve the surface structure of incineration ash under anaerobic condition nitrogen sorption isotherms and pore size distribution of ria and pia were shown in fig 1a and b respectively nitrogen sorption increased with temperature rising below 400 c which decreased with temperature rising over 400 c after pyrolysis the highest bet surface 7 3 m2 g was achieved in pia400 pia with pyrolysis temperature of 400 c which was 4 2 fold higher than ria 1 7 m2 g pyrolysis contributed to enlarging pore size on the surface of incineration ash the largest pore size increased with temperature rising below 300 c which decreased with temperature rising over 300 c after pyrolysis the largest pore size of 64 nm was achieved in pia300 which accounted to about 30 of total pore area see fig 1b both macropores 50 nm and mesopores 2 50 nm were detected on surface of pia300 pia400 and pia500 while only mesopores were detected in ria pia200 pia600 pia700 and pia800 small mesopores provided active site while macropores contributed to the mass transfer of substances 29 therefore hierarchical pore distribution in pia300 pia400 and pia500 might benefit to bacterial sulfate reduction zeta potential shifted with ph variation in the solution the zeta potential of all tested incineration ash samples were negative when the ph was higher than 6 5 while positive zeta potentials were achieved under acidic conditions ph 6 0 for pia200 pia300 pia400 and pia800 bacterial sulfate reduction for fgd wastewater treatment was mainly taken place under acidic condition with ph of 4 0 6 0 5 thus pia300 might benefit to approaching of sulfate and sulfate reducing bacteria during fgd wastewater treatment since the highest zeta potential was observed by pia300 within ph 4 6 crystalline structure of incineration ash was nearly unaffected by the pyrolysis process below 500 c as shown in fig s1 incineration ash consisted of a group of silica minerals including quartz cristobalite and calcite which agreed with the composition of reported biomass power plant ash 30 31 the diffraction peaks at 2θ 21 0 26 7 35 8 36 7 39 6 40 7 42 4 50 4 55 1 60 0 and 68 3 were identified to be quartz while cristobalite and calcite also showed some clear peaks peaks identified to feldspar were detected when the pyrolyzing temperature was over 500 c which might suggest the formation of feldspar during pyrolysis fig s1 3 2 bacterial sulfate reduction with the addition of incineration ash to further identify the effect of pyrolysis and ash addition on bacterial sulfate reduction sulfate reducing activity of strain by7 bacteria were monitored with and without additional incineration ash as shown in fig 2a sulfate removal rate srr increased after addition of incineration ash and srr with pia was higher than srr with ria the highest srr of 0 71 kg so4 2 m3 d was obtained with addition of pia300 which was 2 1 and 1 5 fold higher than the srr without incineration ash and with ria respectively srr with the addition of pia400 to pia800 showed little difference as shown in fig 2a which was 0 58 0 03 kg so4 2 m3 d 16 lower that with addition of pia300 these results might indicate increasing the temperature for incineration ash pyrolysis was economically inefficient for sulfate reduction since increasing of pyrolyzing temperature led to an increasing of the operation cost growth of strain by7 bacteria with and without addition of incineration ash were presented by protein concentration after 100 h see fig 2b addition of incineration ash enhanced 1 58 to 2 16 times growth of strain by7 bacteria which agreed with previous study on addition of graphene oxide to strain by7 bacteria 9 thus the highest potential sulfate reducing activity was achieved 15 63 mg so4 2 gprot h with addition of pia300 which might attributed to hierarchical pore distribution and positive zeta potential of pia300 moreover sulfate reducing activity with addition of bottom ash might also relate to the dielectricity of bottom ash pyrolysis of bottom ash over 320 c led to dielectric loss because of thermal runaway 32 thus 300 c was probably the optimized temperature for incineration ash pyrolysis as amendment for bacterial sulfate reduction the dosage of pia300 to sulfate reducing bacteria was further optimized see fig 2c enhanced sulfate removal was achieved with pia300 dosages between 0 8 and 1 2 while the highest sulfate removal efficiency of 98 1 was obtained with pia300 dosage of 0 8 however sulfate removal efficiency and rate were remarkably decreased when the pia300 dosage was higher than 1 6 these results might indicate the toxicity of introducing surplus incineration ash to sulfate reducers such as metals and metalloids moreover sulfate was not adsorbed by pia300 fig s2 which indicated the observed sulfate removal by srb with pia300 was mainly attributed by bacterial sulfate reduction therefore pia300 with dosage of 0 8 was introduced to sulfate reducing bacteria as amendment in following study 3 3 composition of ria and pia after sulfate reduction crystalline composition of incineration ash was nearly unaffected by the pyrolysis process below 500 c however different xrd patterns were observed after interaction with srb as shown in fig 3a the xrd pattern indicated diffraction peaks of cristobalite and calcite were no longer observed 30 31 in both ria and pia300 after interaction with srb quartz became the only pre dominate chemical in ria and pia300 after sulfate reduction the interaction between incineration ash and srb was further confirmed by ft ir analysis fig s3 which indicated the differences of functional groups between incineration ash before and after sulfate reduction the peaks at 458 776 and 1046 cm 1 could be assigned to symmetric bending symmetric stretching and asymmetric stretching of sio bend in silica minerals 31 33 respectively which agreed with the xrd pattern the peaks located at 1420 875 and 713 cm 1 might attributed to crystalline carbonate in incineration ash which belonged co asymmetric stretching carbonate out of plane and in plane bending vibrations respectively 30 the peak located at 2510 cm 1 might be associated with bicarbonate groups 34 decreasing of intensity was observed for the peak at 1420 cm 1 in both ria and pia300 with srb which might suggest a deceasing abundance of carbonate in incineration ash after sulfate reduction the absorption band at 3422 cm 1 overlapped with the nh and oh groups while the band at 1637 cm 1 was assigned to amide i 10 the intensity of peaks at 1637 and 3422 cm 1 were increased in incineration ashes with srb which might be related to presence of amines and hydroxyl groups of srbs moreover the peaks at 2850 and 2926 cm 1 were assigned to the accessory organic matter produced during biomass incineration 35 which nearly vanished after pyrolysis process the elements of c n o na mg al si p s cl k ca fe and k were detected in incineration ash by xps survey scanning as listed in tables 1 and s2 with exception of c na and fe decreasing abundance of the remaining elements were observed after pyrolysis process moreover elements of cl k and fe were no longer be detected in ria and pia300 after sulfate reduction fig s4 relative abundance of ca decreased in ria and pia300 with srb which was in good accordance with the deceasing abundance of carbonate in ft ir analysis and the absence of calcite in xrd after sulfate reduction four peaks were used to fit the c 1s spectrum in ria and pia300 fig 4a and b and table 1 including cc 284 9 ev co 288 9 ev cf2 293 1 ev and cf3 296 4 ev 9 36 but only three peaks were required to fit the c 1s spectrum in ria and pia300 with srb fig 4c and d which contributed to cc 284 9 ev co 286 1 ev and co 288 6 ev a decreasing abundance of co in bottom ash was observed after pyrolysis which might indicate partial reduction of bottom ash during the anaerobic pyrolysis process the binding energy of co bond was 0 3 ev lower after introducing srb which probably demonstrated interaction between incineration ash and srb moreover the cf2 and cf3 bonds in incineration ash were no longer detected after interaction with srb the peak of co was most likely contributed by growth of bacteria on surface of ria and pia300 which agreed with co bond in ft ir spectrum the presence of co bond was further confirmed by o 1s spectrum in ria and pia300 with srb while only sio peaks were present in ria and pia300 the peak intensity of co bond was higher up to 20 in pia300 with srb than in ria with srb which demonstrated more bacteria attached on the surface of pia300 than ria a peak of so4 2 at 169 2 ev was present in s 2p core level spectra of all samples 9 which was not increasing abundance in sulfate laden srm srb ria and srb pia300 this result confirmed that sulfate was not adsorbed onto the surface of incineration ash moreover a sn 2 peak at 163 4 ev was detected in srb pia300 which suggested increasing activity of bacterial sulfate reduction with additional pia300 6 p 2p core level spectra involved two peaks in incineration ash including an ordinary po3 4 peak 133 3 ev and an unordinary metal phosphate peak 37 however the peak of metal phosphate was no longer detected in ria and pia300 with srb which double confirmed the interaction between incineration ash and srbs incineration ash might be partially degraded by sulfate reducing bacteria which led to breaking of bonds such as cf2 cf3 ccl feo fes and m p a porous structure was observed on the surface incineration ash after pyrolysis by sem fig 3b and d which was in good accordance with pore size results in fig 1b growth of sulfate reducing bacteria as biofilm on the surface of incineration ash were achieved see fig 3c and e which suggested that incineration ash was performed as carrier for the growth of srb it was visible that more bacteria grew onto the surface of pia300 than ria which agreed with the results of protein quantification during sulfate reduction process fig 2b and the higher intensity of co bond in xps spectra fig 4 3 4 sulfate reduction with pia as carbon source bacterial sulfate reduction by strain by7 bacteria was compared with and without introducing organic carbon source lactate in srm by additional pia300 as an amendment fig 5a organic carbon was an important electron donor for reducing sulfate and simultaneous sulfate and organic carbon removal was obtained by strain by7 bacteria however sulfate reduction could still be observed in pia300 amended system without additional carbon source even if residual organic carbon was not detectable throughout the entire experiment the sulfate removal rate achieved 0 20 kg m3 d by srb with lactate while sulfate removal rate obtained 0 05 kg m3 d by srb without lactate tss was 1 36 0 22 g l in srb without ash while tss was 5 66 0 18 g l in srb without pia300 by taking 0 8 additional pia300 into account tss loss achieved 39 5 after sulfate reduction these results suggested incineration ash might provide additional organic carbon for sulfate reduction when carbon source was insufficient which might be relate to partial degradation of incineration ash by sulfate reducing bacteria 3 5 fgd wastewater treatment through sulfate reduction with pia as amendment reactor operation to further evaluate potential of pia as amendment for future application effect of pia addition on sulfate reducing biomass was investigated sulfate reduction with and without pia300 addition were compared in two parallelly operated sbr reactors for fgd wastewater treatment efficiency of sulfate reduction was monitored for about 28 days bacterial sulfate removal rate in sbr with pia300 was remarkably higher 54 than the sbr without incineration ash as shown in fig 5b which were 0 229 kgso4 2 m3 d and 0 148 kgso4 2 m3 d on average with and without pia300 respectively sulfate removal efficiency achieved up to 96 5 on average in sbr with pia300 in each cycle 4 days meanwhile sulfate removal efficiency was only 81 0 on average in sbr without incineration ash pia300 was refilled 0 4 to sbr every 2 cycles as indicated in fig 5b to replenish solid carbon source but no obvious ash accumulation or inhibitory effect was observed which might indicate balance between incineration ash degradation and replenishment thus bacterial sulfate reduction for fgd wastewater treatment was enhanced with pia300 as amendment the addition of pia300 led to remarkably changes in bacterial community in sulfate reducing enrichment figs 5c and s5 potential sulfate reducing bacteria including geobacter 1 4 acinetobacter 1 2 desulfovibrio 1 1 clostridium 7 1 and paraclostridium 0 03 sp bacteria were identified in the enrichment before pia300 addition increasing abundance of clostridium 12 fold and paraclostridium sp bacteria 79 fold were observed after pia300 addition which became the dominant sulfate reducers in the sbr meanwhile decreased abundance of geobacter and desulfovibrio sp sulfate reducing bacteria and sulfurospirillum sp sulfur oxidizing bacteria were achieved in sbr after pia300 addition clostridium and paraclostridium sp bacteria were able to degrade dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt c14h9cl5 and ciprofloxacin cip c17h18fn3o3 during sulfate reduction respectively 38 39 moreover pre dominance of clostridium and paraclostridium sp bacteria were accorded with ccl and cf bonds breaking in xps analysis which might be relate to degradation of widely applied organochlorine pesticides and organofluorine insecticides in agriculture 40 41 moreover increasing abundance of ethanoligenens sporolactobacillus caproiciproducens and lactococcus sp fermentative bacteria might benefit to degradation of organic matters in incineration ash the concentrations of multiple nutrient elements in fgd wastewater influents pia300 leachate and sbr effluents for fgd wastewater treatment without incineration ash with ria and with pia300 were shown in fig 6 both fgd wastewater and leachate of pia300 were rich in various metals and metalloids including major elements of al ti mn fe sr and ba and trace elements of li be v cr co ni cu zn ga as cd sn sb tl pb and bi nutrients were commonly present in extracted bottom ash but the composition of extracted nutrients might be different among references 18 42 44 which might depend on the source and method for combustion and ph for extraction 45 elements of al fe mn and sr were widely abundant in agricultural bottom ash see table s3 the removal efficiencies of metals and metalloids by srb were in the range of 83 5 to 99 8 nevertheless metal removal efficiencies were slightly increased to 93 5 100 after the addition of ria and pia300 thus metal removal efficiency was not inhibited by addition of incineration ash as shown in fig s6 and table s4 20 24 and 20 organic matter were identified in pre treated fgd wastewater ash leachate and effluents of sbr pia300 respectively which consisted of alkanes esters alcohols organic acids aliphatic hydrocarbons and phenol eleven out of 24 organics in the ash leachate were no longer detected in effluent of sbr after sulfate reduction including cyclohexyl dimethoxymethyl silane c9h20o2si naphthalene c10h8 dimethyl dodecane c14h30 heptamethyl nonane c16h34 7 9 di tert butyl 1oxaspiro 4 5 deca 6 9 diene 2 8dione c18h27o3 octadecane c18h38 carbonic acid decyl tridecyl ester c24h48o3 γ sitosterol c29h50o and 1 iodo dotriacontane c32h65i nevertheless three new organics were most likely produced as metabolic products after bacterial sulfate reduction including methoxy acetic acid c3h6o3 butanoic acid c4h8o2 and dimethyl octane c10h22 these results confirmed our hypothesis that incineration ash provided a biodegradable organic carbon source for sulfate reduction 3 6 effect of pia addition on eps of sulfate reducing bacteria eps produced by sulfate reducing bacteria and enrichments with and without pia300 addition were compared as shown in fig 7a the functional group of eps was identified by ftir as shown in fig 7b intensity of the peaks located at about 1120 cm 1 increased after ash addition which was identified as carbohydrates increasing formation of humic acids proteins and polysaccharides in both strain by7 bacteria 5 8 58 1 and sulfate reducing biomass 11 6 98 7 were observed the results of 3d eem were shown in fig 7c to f which presented eps produced by strain by7 bacteria and sulfate reducing enrichment with stress group and without pia300 control group five peaks could be identified at ex em wavelength of 280 300 a 280 350 b 225 350 c 250 450 d and 450 450 e which indicated presence of tryptophan tryptophan tyrosine humus and fulvic like substances respectively four peaks a b c and d were observed in the by7 bacteria control group while five peaks a b c d and e were obtained in the ash stress group by7 bacteria with pia300 addition similarly only peak a was identified in the enrichment control group while peaks of a b and c were detected in the ash stress group enrichments with pia300 addition increasing intensity of peak a was achieved in both stress groups these results demonstrated increasing production of eps by sulfate reducers after pia300 addition which was important electron carriers during sulfate reduction process 10 4 discussion 4 1 role of pyrolyzed incineration ash during bacterial sulfate reduction incineration bottom ash was produced through incomplete combustion which contained sustainable amount of biodegradable organic matter 23 the pyrolysis process was performed to activate incineration ash which increased pore size and surface area of incineration ash due to escaping of multiple nutrients elements and partial reduction of co in bottom ash enlarged pore size distribution and surface characteristics might benefit to growth of srb and substrate transformation pia300 was introduced to sulfate reducing biosystem in this study which probably played the roles as carriers carbon alkalinity and trace element source first pia300 was used as carrier for immobilizing sulfate reducing bacteria the growth and activity of bacteria both increased after immobilization process 9 44 45 in this study enhanced growth of srb on the surface of incineration ash was observed through sem fig 3 which was further confirmed by protein assay and xps analysis co bond enhanced sulfate reducing activity was achieved after addition of pia300 this result was in good accordance with previous study which reported addition of go as carrier for srb 9 however incineration ash was much cheaper than go as a carrier material enhanced sulfate reducing activity with additional pia300 led to higher metal removal efficiency since sulfide dependent precipitation and co precipitation were the main metal removal pathway during fgd wastewater treatment 5 10 moreover pia300 provided additional organic matters to sulfate reduction process when carbon source was insufficient sulfate reducing bacteria was powerful heterotroph which was able to degrade various organic matters such as benzene toluene sulfamethoxazole and refractory organic matters in fgd wastewater 5 6 48 49 the presence of biodegradable organic matters in bottom ash had been reported 21 23 in this study we confirmed 11 organic matters that present in leachate of pia300 was degraded by sulfate reduction moreover srb might partially decompose pia300 and utilize the resulted carbon matters as electron donors carbon source to reducing sulfate which stimulated growth of refractory organic using sulfate reducers in the enrichment such as clostridium and paraclostridium sp bacteria 38 39 breaking of cf2 cf3 ccl feo fes and m p bonds in incineration ash were observed after sulfate reduction which confirmed partial decomposition of incineration ash moreover sulfate reduction was observed in the incineration ash addition system without additional carbon source even if sulfate reducing rate without carbon source was only 25 of the rate with additional carbon source increasing formation of eps by sulfate reducers with additional pia300 probably benefit to bio transformation 50 and biodegradation of refractory organic matters 5 10 furthermore pia300 might also provide trace elements for the growth of srb the abundance of fe cl k and ca decreased in incineration ash after sulfate reduction which were important trace elements in medium for cultivating srb 9 the iron sulfur containing proteins complex was crucially important for sulfate reducers which was metal active sites for rubredoxin family ferredoxins and hydrogenases 51 cl k and ca were important elements for maintaining osmotic pressure of bacteria decreasing abundance of bicarbonate and carbonate were observed in incineration after sulfate reduction which led to increase of ph in the effluent fig s7 this result suggested bi carbonate present in incineration ash was able to balance the acids produced during sulfate reduction which benefited to decrease the operation cost of fgd wastewater 4 2 economic evaluation of fgd wastewater desulfurization technology through bacterial sulfate reduction with additional pia300 the integrated chemical precipitation and sulfate reduction process was newly developed biotechnology for fgd wastewater treatment which achieved the advantage of simultaneous removal of sulfate metal organic matter and salts with lower operation cost the major operation cost during sulfate reduction of fgd wastewater was the addition of an organic carbon source which was insufficient for reducing sulfate lactate was introduced to fgd wastewater with c s ratio of 1 5 1 5 after the addition of pia300 to srb lactate introduced to fgd wastewater was further decreased to a c s ratio of 1 1 stable sulfate reducing activity was achieved for 30 days in the srb pia300 reactor which suggested organic carbon required during sulfate reduction was partially supplied through the degradation of incineration ash the operation cost for carbon source addition could reduce 33 after introducing pia300 moreover acid was produced during sulfate reducing process which led to decline of ph value from 7 5 to 3 0 during fgd wastewater treatment after addition of pia300 ph value increased to about 4 0 4 5 at the end of each cycle incineration ash provided additional alkalinity carbonate and bicarbonate to balance the acid produced during sulfate reduction incineration ash had been used as an alkaline material to improve soil ph 17 thus addition of pia300 could remarkably decrease the cost for balancing ph in the effluent of sulfate reduction incineration ash was produced during combustion of solid waste agricultural waste and industrial waste both bottom ash and fly ash contained various heavy metals such as al fe mg ca mn and so on 18 42 44 which might lead to soil and water secondary pollution without proper disposal fly ash was developed to be good adsorbent for removing gaseous pollutants including ammonia vocs heavy metals sox and nox due to the high porosity and surface area 35 52 while bottom ash was commonly applied as acid soil and construction amendment 17 as a waste of incineration power plant incineration bottom ash was a cheap material which could be used for road construction after further treatment 53 as far as we know this study is the first tryout for using incineration bottom ash as amendment for bacterial sulfate reduction process pia300 was performed as carrier to enhance sulfate reducing activity which was cost friendly amendment in comparison to nanomaterials go or rgo and biochar 9 10 moreover incineration bottom ash could be utilized by sulfate reducers as carbon and nutrient source meanwhile heavy metals present in incineration ash could be extracted and precipitated during fgd wastewater treatment thus addition of incineration bottom ash not only reduced the cost of additional organic source for fgd wastewater but also achieved simultaneous disposal of incineration bottom ash and fgd wastewater fig s8 which obtained doubled environment benefits 5 conclusion simultaneous disposal of incineration bottom ash and fgd wastewater was achieved in this study by introducing pyrolyzed incineration ash pia to sulfate reducers as amendment pyrolysis improved the pore size and surface area of incineration ash the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria was enhanced after addition of incineration ash growth of clostridium and paraclostridium sp bacteria was stimulated by addition of incineration ash which might be the pre dominate sulfate reducers related to incineration ash decomposition pyrolyzed incineration ash played not only as carrier for sulfate reducing bacteria but also provided additional carbon source alkane and ester and nutrient elements trace elements and alkaline for sulfate reduction heavy metals were efficiently removed 95 100 during sulfate reduction although additional metals were introduced by incineration ash moreover addition of incineration ash led to increasing formation of eps which might subsequently benefit to organic matter degradation thus a promising fgd wastewater recycling technology was established in this study by utilizing incineration ash for sulfate reduction which at least decreased 33 organic carbon cost for fgd wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
