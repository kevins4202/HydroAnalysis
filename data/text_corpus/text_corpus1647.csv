capable of generating high quality calibrated forecasts which are coherent in climatology including seasonality consistent with observations despite only a short period of forecasts being available in this study we post process deterministic precipitation forecasts from the australian bureau of meteorology s australian community climate and earth system simulator g2 version access g2 nwp model to generate calibrated ensemble forecasts across australia we evaluate the effectiveness robustness and computational feasibility of forecast post processing with the scc model at a high spatial resolution across the continental scale new hydrological insights for the region inadequate representation of forecast seasonality in calibration models poses a challenge for the calibration of nwp forecasts through this investigation the statistical assumptions and reparameterization algorithms of the scc model are confirmed to be effective and robust in addressing the challenge calibrated precipitation forecasts could be used to support operational water balance forecasting in australia post processing of nwp precipitation forecasts with the scc model will also benefit a broad range of forecast users in australia by providing accurate skillful and reliable ensemble forecasts computation strategies adopted in this study will help develop effective procedures for future post processing of nwp forecasts with sophisticated calibration models at a large spatial scale keywords post processing seasonally coherent calibration forecast evaluation large scale application 1 introduction reliable prediction of future weather conditions is critical for effective planning and management of a variety of social and economic activities particularly in regions with a highly variable weather system in recent decades numerical weather prediction nwp models have been developed and widely implemented to forecast how weather processes will develop in the near future bi et al 2013 buizza et al 2005 nwp precipitation forecasts have been increasingly used to inform decision making related to water resource management perera et al 2014 and to help formulate mitigation measures for natural hazards herman and schumacher 2018 huang and thatcher 2017 lee et al 2011 leutbecher and palmer 2008 however errors from observations used for model parameterization limitations in nwp models representation of physical processes of the atmosphere data assimilation and initialization of key variables usually lead to systematic errors in raw forecasts bowler et al 2008 buizza 2018 lorenz 1993 nipen and stull 2011 zappa et al 2010 post processing of raw forecasts with statistical models is a necessary step in using nwp forecasts glahn and lowry 1972 hamill and colucci 1998 mert et al 2020 vannitsem et al 2018 a plethora of post processing models with divergent complexities and statistical basis have been developed to calibrate raw nwp forecasts li et al 2017a wilks 2018 computationally efficient approaches such as the rank histogram recalibration method hamill and colucci 1998 and the quantile mapping method gudmundsson et al 2012 have advantages in the easiness and low computation cost for implementation but may not ensure reliability and skills in calibrated forecasts zhao et al 2017 a more popular group of post processing models is based on regression models in this group the model output statistics mos s procedure glahn and lowry 1972 in characterizing errors of past forecasts and applying the error characteristics to correct future forecasts has been widely adopted in the development of more complex post processing models applequist et al 2015 wilks 2018 through linking predictors and predictands with fitted linear or non linear models regression based models have been found to be effective in improving raw forecasts using a few parameters gneiting et al 2005 verkade et al 2013 wilks 2006 another group of post processing models is based on models of the joint probability of forecasts and observations krzysztofowicz and herr 2001 wang et al 2009 after establishing the joint probability models conditional distributions of observations y given forecasts x can be obtained the conditional distributions can be applied to new forecasts to produce calibrated forecasts shrestha et al 2015 in addition data driven model techniques such as machine learning models are increasingly used in forecast post processing recently mert et al 2020 previous comparisons suggest that the performance of these models varied with study areas nwp models and choice of evaluation metrics wilks 2018 and there is no conclusion regarding which group of post processing models has the best performance however it has been reported that calibration models using conditional distributions have the advantage of using long historical observations in forecast post processing li et al 2017a wilks 2018 effective post processing of raw forecasts aims to provide calibrated forecasts that are unbiased reliable in ensemble spread as skillful as possible and no worse than the climatology reference forecasts shrestha et al 2013 verkade et al 2013 wang et al 2019a williams et al 2014 in addition calibrated forecasts should be coherent in climatology including seasonality consistent with observations scheuerer and hamill 2015 stauffer et al 2017a wang et al 2019a seasonal variation of precipitation has not been explicitly or implicitly represented in some calibration models without accounting for seasonality calibrated forecasts could be inconsistent with observations in temporal patterns especially in regions where precipitation shows strong seasonality and when skills of raw forecasts are low wang et al 2019a achieving the aims of effective forecast calibration has been challenged by the availability of raw forecasts when long archived forecasts being available calibration methods such as quantile mapping or the standardized anomaly model output statistics samos could be adopted to improve the representation of climatology in calibrated forecasts scheuerer and hamill 2015 stauffer et al 2017b however due to the high computational costs and frequent model upgrades newly operationalized nwp models with changed error characteristics usually do not produce hindcasts kane et al 2008 instead new nwp models often only archive a short period of experimental forecasts when they are officially operationalized puri et al 2013 a common practice to deal with this challenge is to directly use the short archived raw forecasts and observation of the same period to build up statistical connections between raw forecasts and observations robertson et al 2013 however the sampling errors in model parameter inference with such a short period of data are often significant resulting in calibrated forecasts which may demonstrate inconsistencies with observed climatology wang et al 2019a to address these challenges we developed the seasonally coherent calibration scc model wang et al 2019a this model calibrates nwp forecasts based on conditional distributions of a bivariate model sophisticated model algorithms and a sensible reparameterization strategy in scc have allowed for seasonal variation in calibrated forecasts to better represent temporal patterns of precipitation even when only a short period of raw forecasts are available for model fitting the model represents a significant advancement in modeling strategies for post processing of nwp forecasts a preliminary test demonstrated the strength of scc in reducing bias and improving skills of raw forecasts wang et al 2019a the effectiveness and robustness of the scc model for general applications across a broad range of climate conditions and geophysical settings remain unclear as a result a large scale model application and performance evaluation are needed to better examine whether the scc model is robust enough to achieve post processing aims mentioned previously continental scale post processing of nwp or general circulation model gcm forecasts at high spatial resolutions are being increasingly performed in europe and north america gascón et al 2019 hamill et al 2017 previous precipitation forecast post processing studies in australia are mainly conducted at the site or river basin scale to support streamflow forecasting for gauged basins schepen et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 as the need for water forecasting for ungauged regions is growing in australia it is also necessary to expand the post processing to a broader spatial scale forecast calibration will benefit water forecasting across large spatial scales by providing high quality weather inputs in addition as computational resources are becoming increasingly accessible it is critical to develop procedures to enable the utilization of supercomputing techniques for improving computation efficiencies of post processing as a result there is a need to evaluate the computational feasibility of post processing with sophisticated models like scc for the application at large spatial scales in this study we apply the scc model to post process precipitation forecasts from the australian bureau of meteorology s australian community climate and earth system simulator g2 version access g2 nwp model across australia it should be noted that in addition to calibrating raw forecasts for each grid cell of the study area separately the spatial and temporal structures in calibrated forecasts should be built using techniques such as the schaake shuffle method clark et al 2004 shrestha et al 2013 the combination of forecast calibration and construction of spatial and temporal structures will generate calibrated forecasts directly usable for forecast users this study is mainly focused on the forecast calibration and the reconstruction of spatial temporal coherence in calibrated ensemble forecasts will be presented in a separate investigation the objectives of this study are to 1 apply a grid cell by grid cell calibration procedure to deterministic forecasts to generate reasonably calibrated gridded ensemble forecasts 2 evaluate the performance and robustness of scc at the continental scale 3 investigate the computational feasibility and efficiency of applying scc at a high spatial resolution across a large domain 2 methods 2 1 raw forecasts and observations raw precipitation forecasts calibrated in this study are from the australian community climate and earth system simulator g2 version access g2 model developed by the australian bureau of meteorology this model started to produce weather forecasts on march 18th 2016 with four runs starting at the coordinated universal time utc of 0000 utc 0600 utc 1200 utc and 1800 utc of each day access g2 produces hourly precipitation predictions for 240 h in the future across the globe with a grid spacing of 0 35 longitude by 0 23 latitude in this study forecast calibration and evaluation are focused on the period of 4 2016 3 2019 the observations used for calibration are the australian water availability project awap gridded precipitation data jones et al 2014 2007 this dataset has been developed through a model data fusion method which http www csiro au awap generates continental scale gridded data with a spatial resolution of 0 05 x 0 05 approximately 5 km based on site scale observations across australia in this study awap data of 4 1999 3 2019 is used for model fitting and the period of 4 2016 3 2019 is used for model performance evaluation we sum hourly raw forecasts on the awap grid 38 25 km spacing over the 24 h period and apply bilinear interpolation to generate the interpolated forecasts at the resolution of the awap data 5 km spath 1993 2 2 post processing of nwp forecasts with scc the scc model is composed of four key components including 1 a joint probability model which links observations and raw forecasts 2 derivation of the observed long term climatology to establish the seasonal patterns in scc 3 reparameterization for the reduction of parameter numbers to work with limited raw forecasts and 4 application of the model to generate calibrated forecasts the statistical basis assumptions and formulas of the scc model have been introduced in detail in our site scale investigation wang et al 2019a here we further explain how the calibration is conducted to convert deterministic raw forecasts to calibrated ensemble forecasts across australia post processing with the scc model is applied to each grid cell and lead time separately the calibration starts with data transformation using the log sinh transformation wang et al 2012 the effectiveness of the log sinh method in transforming precipitation data in australia has been validated robertson et al 2013 we apply the log sinh transformation to both observations and forecasts figs s1 and s2 details of the log sinh transformation are presented in the supplementary material we use the 20 year daily observations and the 3 year forecasts to estimate transformation parameters for observations and forecasts respectively second we build up a bivariate normal bn distribution for the transformed data based on the joint probability theory we assume that transformed forecasts f t and observed precipitation o t are drawn from this bn distribution 1 f t o t bn f t o t μ f m t σ f 2 m t μ o m t σ o 2 m t ρ m t where m t returns month k 1 12 for day t μ f m t a n d σ f m t are the mean and standard deviation of the marginal distribution of f t for the month of m t μ o m t a n d σ o m t are the mean and standard deviation of the marginal distribution of o t in the month of m t ρ m t is the correlation between f t and o t for month m t the model is parameterized at the monthly resolution and therefore the daily precipitations within the same month of the year share common parameter values the two variables f t a n d o t of the bivariate normal distribution are expected to be continuous however precipitation is discontinuous in nature as a result we need to find a way to build up a continuous distribution that allows for negative values and left censors the distribution at a censoring threshold scheuerer and hamill 2015 to do this we set a censoring threshold and treated values below this threshold as censored data for censored data we resample their values from negative infinity to the percent point function of the censoring threshold this treatment allows us to convert discontinuous data to a continuous distribution in this study we set 0 2 mm day and 0 01 mm day as the censoring thresholds for observed precipitation and forecasts respectively we use 0 2 mm day as the threshold for observation because this is the minimum value that could be measured in the field for forecasts we choose a lower threshold of 0 01 mm day because gridded forecasts represent average rainfall over a large spatial extent 38 km 25 km for this study therefore for such a large region average rainfall forecasts lower than the minimum measurable amount is likely to result in measurable rainfall 0 2 mm day at some specific locations within that grid cell considering the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation robertson et al 2013 shrestha et al 2013 thanks to the availability of long term awap data we are able to calculate μ o m t a n d σ o m t directly based on the 20 year observations 4 1999 3 2019 using the maximum likelihood method wang et al 2019a specifically μ o m t a n d σ o m t are estimated based on daily data of 20 months the same month k k 1 12 in each of the 20 year however for the short archived access g2 forecasts we are not able to confidently estimate the mean μ f m t and standard deviation σ f m t to solve this problem we employ a sensible reparameterization by assuming that the mean and standard deviation of raw forecasts are linearly correlated with those of the observations 2 μ f k a b μ o k 3 σ f k c d σ o k 4 ρ k r where k is a month ranging from 1 to 12 a b c and d are parameters characterizing the linear relationships ρ k denotes the correlation coefficient between raw forecasts and observations for each month r is the correlation coefficient between raw forecasts and observations in the transformed space parameter inference for a b c d and r is based on the maximum likelihood estimation using forecasts and observations during 4 2016 3 2019 maximum likelihood functions were introduced in detail in our site scale investigation wang et al 2019a we set parameters b c d and r to be larger than zero in the estimation of parameter values positive b will ensure a positive correlation coefficient between the mean of forecasts and observations positive c and d are to generate non negative standard deviation of forecasts positive r is to ensure that calibrated forecasts would have skills at least as good as ensemble climatology reference forecasts once we obtain values of a b c d and r we estimate the mean μ f k and standard deviation σ f k for forecasts using the above linear functions the correlation coefficient r obtained in this step is used to evaluate the underlying skills of raw forecasts in section 3 1 fig 1 with the established bivariate distribution and associated parameters we are able to establish a conditional distribution for the observations o t when new raw forecasts f t are provided we then draw 100 random samples from the conditional distribution of o t to produce an ensemble which is then treated as the calibrated ensemble forecasts for the corresponding deterministic raw forecast finally we back transform the calibrated forecasts from the previous step to their original space 2 3 evaluation of scc performance in this study we adopt a leave one month out cross validation strategy to evaluate the performance of scc from 4 2016 to 3 2019 specifically we leave out one of the 36 months during the validation period 4 2016 to 3 2019 in observations the same month in the 20 year observations 4 1999 to 3 2019 and the same month in the forecast and use the remaining months to optimize scc parameters in cross validation for the inference of transformation parameters for observations 19 years and 11 months of daily observation are used for the inference of transformation parameters for forecasts 35 months were used for μ o k a n d σ o k 19 months same month k k 1 12 in each of the 19 years excluding the left out month of daily data are used for the left out month but for the other months we still use 20 months same month k k 1 12 in each of the 20 years for the estimation of a b c d r μ f k and σ f k we use the 35 months of the 3 year observations and forecasts which are not left out once the parameters are estimated we then treat raw forecasts of the left out month as new raw forecasts and calibrate these raw forecasts to produce ensemble calibrated forecasts the cross validation is conducted for each of the 36 months to generate calibrated forecasts for the evaluation period 4 2016 to 3 2019 this cross validation strategy ensures that calibrated forecasts are generated based on raw forecasts which are not used in model fitting in addition we also generate ensemble climatology reference forecasts through randomly sampling values from observed climatology of each month to form a reference for performance evaluation the calibrated forecasts are evaluated according to four criteria including 1 bias in the magnitude and frequency of precipitation 2 reliability 3 skills relatives to the ensemble climatology reference forecasts and 4 seasonality 2 3 1 evaluation of bias in raw and calibrated forecasts we first evaluate the forecast accuracy of precipitation by calculating bias in average precipitation and wet days in the raw and calibrated forecasts relative to awap data using the following equation 5 b i a s 1 t t 1 t x t y t where bias refers to bias in average precipitation mm day or wet days t is total days during the 3 year validation period 4 2016 3 2019 x t is daily precipitation mm day or wet days during the 3 year period in forecasts and y t is the corresponding observations of the same period for calibrated ensemble forecasts we use the ensemble mean for the calculation of bias for wet day calculation we use 0 2 mm day as the threshold to distinguish between wet and dry days for the deterministic raw forecasts and observations the ratio of wet days is calculated as the fraction of days with precipitation larger than the threshold over the 3 year evaluation period 4 2016 to 3 2019 for the calibrated ensemble forecasts we first calculate the ratio of wet days over the 100 ensemble members for each day this ratio indicates the possibility of a specific day being a wet day ratios for all days during the study period are summed up and then divided by total days during 4 2016 3 2019 to obtain the average wet days for calibrated ensemble forecasts 2 3 2 reliability we first evaluate the reliability of calibrated forecasts using the reliability diagram hartmann et al 2002 the diagram is to assess how well the predicted probabilities of an event correspond to their observed frequencies to create the diagrams we convert the calibrated ensemble forecasts to forecast probabilities of exceeding three thresholds the 80th 90th and 95th percentiles of observations we pool forecasts of different grid cells months and lead times together to calculate the forecast probability we group the predicted probabilities into 10 bins ranging from 0 0 1 to 0 9 1 and compare them with the observed relative frequency in the reliability diagram perfectly reliable forecasts will demonstrate a curve along the diagonal a plotted curve above the diagonal indicates dry bias probabilities are too high and vice versa one important advantage of scc is the capability of converting deterministic raw forecasts to ensemble forecasts with the ensemble spread representing forecast uncertainty the reliability of ensemble forecasts refers to the consistency between forecast distributions and the frequency of associated events in observations reliable ensemble spread is a critical feature of high quality forecasts reliable ensemble distributions not too narrow or too wide will help avoid aggressive or overly conservative decisions in using forecasts to further evaluate the reliability of calibrated forecasts we calculate the probability integral transform pit value using the following equation 6 π t f t x y t where f t x is the cumulative density function of the ensemble forecast and y t is the observation for reliable forecasts π t follows a uniform distribution to demonstrate the spatial patterns of reliability of calibrated forecasts across australia we then calculate an alpha index α to summarize the reliability in each grid cell using the following equation renard et al 2010 7 α 1 2 n t 1 n π t t n 1 where π t is the sorted π t t 1 2 n in ascending order and n is the total number of days this index represents the total deviation of calibrated forecasts from the corresponding uniform quantile perfectly reliable forecasts should have an α index of 1 and forecasts with no reliability would have an α index of 0 2 3 3 skills of the raw and calibrated forecasts we use the continuous ranked probability score crps skill score to measure skills in the raw and calibrated forecasts relative to ensemble climatology reference forecasts this score generalizes absolute errors in forecasts and thus could provide a direct comparison of deterministic and probabilistic forecasts grimit et al 2006 crps has been widely used to measure forecasting skills of probabilistic forecasts that exhibit predictive cumulative distribution functions hersbach 2000 wang et al 2019a specifically crps is calculated using the following equation 8 c r p s t f t x h x y t 2 d x 9 c r p s 1 n t 1 n c r p s t where f t x is the cumulative density function of an ensemble forecast and y t is the observation at time t h is the heaviside step function h 1 if x y t 0 and h 0 otherwise the overbar represents averaging across the n days for deterministic forecasts crps is reduced to absolute errors following the derivation of crps values for the raw calibrated and ensemble climatology reference forecasts we further calculate the crps skill score c r p s s s using the following equation 10 c r p s s s c r p s r e f e r e n c e c r p s f o r e c a s t s c r p s r e f e r e n c e 100 where c r p s r e f e r e n c e is the crps value of ensemble climatology reference forecasts c r p s f o r e c a s t s refers to crps value of raw or calibrated forecasts here c r p s s s measures the difference between crps values of forecasts and those of ensemble climatology forecasts positive skill scores indicate better skills than the ensemble climatology reference forecasts and vice versa 2 3 4 seasonality to evaluate whether post processing with scc achieves the objective of this study in reasonably building seasonality in calibrated forecasts we examine seasonal patterns of average precipitation and wet days in raw and calibrated forecasts and compare them with the long term observations specifically we first calculate average precipitation and wet days of the raw and calibrated forecasts as well in the 3 year 4 2016 3 2019 and 20 year 4 1999 3 2019 observations at the seasonal scale then we calculate anomalies of the two variables in raw forecasts calibrated forecasts and the 3 year observations relative to the 20 year observations for all seasons these anomalies would help evaluate whether forecasted wet and dry seasons and spatial extents of wet and dry regions are consistent with the observed long term climatology or not we also calculate the anomalies in the 3 year observations to examine whether forecasts are consistent with the observations of the same period in seasonal variability we analyze the seasonality of forecasts in lead times 1 and 9 in the main text and present the remaining 7 lead times in the supplementary material 2 4 computation of the calibration the computation of the forecast post processing at the continental scale is intensive the calibration is conducted across 281 655 grid cells in australia we use the supercomputer gadi managed by the national computational infrastructure nci for the computation and the normal queue of nci to run our computation jobs nodes used in our computation have two 24 core intel xeon scalable cascade lake processors and 192 gigabytes of memory the walltime limit for computational jobs submitted to the normal queue is 48 h to make the calibration computationally feasible we divide the calibration into three steps including 1 parameter inference 2 forecast generation and evaluation and 3 test post processing of new raw forecasts in the operational context parameter inference is the most computationally demanding step to improve the speed of this step and to meet the 48 h walltime limit we divide the awap domain 681 row and 841 columns with a spatial resolution of 0 05 into 31 zones with each zone covering 22 rows of grid cells in the awap domain we submit one computation job for each zone for parameter inference after we obtain parameters for each zone we combine them together to obtain the parameters across australia calibrated parameters from step 1 are used for forecast generation in steps 2 and 3 for steps 2 and 3 we use a single job for each step to produce calibrated forecasts we adopt the open multi processing openmp algorithms to parallel these computation tasks we evaluate the speedup efficiency and scalability of the code speedup is defined as the ratio of the total central processing unit cpu runtime over the walltime of the model run efficiency is defined as the ratio of speedup over cpu numbers we demonstrate the scalability of the code by running the calibration over different numbers of grid cells for step 1 since this is the most computationally demanding step of the computation the parallel algorithms adopted in steps 2 and 3 are the same as that of step 1 3 results 3 1 underlying skills of raw forecasts plots of the correlation coefficient r between transformed raw forecasts and observations show that raw forecasts reasonably represent precipitation variability at short lead times but demonstrate much lower skills at long lead times fig 1 for the first three lead times r values in most grid cells are over 0 6 except for areas near the state border between western australia and northern territory where r values are generally below 0 2 the skills of raw forecasts decline quickly with increases in lead time for days 4 7 ahead grid cells with r values lower than 0 4 cover large areas in northern and western australia for the last two lead times days 8 and 9 ahead r values are mainly lower than 0 2 in most parts of australia 3 2 accuracy of raw and calibrated forecasts the raw forecasts demonstrate large biases across australia figs 2 and s3 in coastal areas of australia raw forecasts generally underpredict precipitation whereas raw forecasts mainly show wet biases in the inland areas of australia the spatial patterns of bias in the raw forecast are similar across all nine lead times fig 2 through the scc calibration biases in calibrated forecasts are substantially reduced to values close to zero grid cells with remaining bias in calibrated forecasts are mainly scattered in the northern parts of australia since the 20 year observations are used to establish the bivariate normal distribution eq 1 calibrated forecasts would tend to gradually approach the climatology of the 20 year data particularly for the less skillful forecasts at long lead times as a result biases in calibrated forecasts partially reflect the deviation of the 3 year observations 4 2016 3 2019 from the 20 year climatology 4 1999 3 2019 we further evaluate the prediction of wet days by raw and calibrated forecasts figs 3 and s4 raw forecasts substantially overpredict wet days across most parts of australia by over 10 fig 3 in coastal regions of victoria queensland tasmania and western australia raw forecasts predict fewer wet days than awap data the biases in wet days in raw forecasts are persistent across the nine lead times the calibration significantly corrects biases in wet days in raw forecasts particularly for overpredictions in central australia as indicated in fig 3 calibrated forecasts show biases in wet days close to zero in most parts of australia 3 3 reliability and skills of forecasts three reliability diagrams of the calibrated forecasts are shown in fig 4 at the low threshold of 80th percentile of observations the observed relative frequency and forecast probability mostly follow the 1 1 line indicating consistency between the two at the higher thresholds of 90th and 95th percentiles forecast probabilities in the high range tend to moderately overshoot and therefore are positively biased the calibrated forecasts demonstrate reliable uncertainty spread across all the nine lead times figs 5 and s5 with α index over 0 95 covering most parts of australia the high reliability indicates the reasonable representation of uncertainties in future precipitation and suggests that the distribution of calibrated ensemble forecasts are neither too narrow nor too wide fig 5 skills in forecasts are also substantially enhanced through the scc calibration raw forecasts are more skillful than ensemble climatology reference forecasts in eastern parts of australia for day 1 ahead figs 6 and s6 however large areas of central australia show negative skill scores in raw forecasts even at short lead times skills of raw forecasts decline quickly and become worse than the ensemble climatology reference forecasts at long lead times days 6 9 ahead in most parts of australia for all lead times calibrated forecasts markedly outperform the raw forecasts in almost all grid cells in the calibrated forecasts most grid cells for days 1 3 ahead demonstrate crps skill scores larger than 25 although scores of the calibrated forecasts decrease with lead time they remain above zero for all lead times clearly showing skills at least as good as the ensemble climatology reference forecasts 3 4 precipitation seasonality in raw and calibrated forecasts the scc calibration improves precipitation seasonality in forecasts shown by a comparison between precipitation anomalies in forecasts and the 3 year observations anomalies are relative to the 20 year observations fig 7 the anomalies demonstrate large discrepancies in seasonal precipitation between raw forecasts and the 20 year observations particularly in summer autumn and spring specifically raw forecasts largely underpredict summer precipitation in coastal areas of the northern territory queensland and new south wales but overpredict summer precipitation in western parts of australia figs 7 and s7 in autumn raw forecasts demonstrate significant dry biases in coastal regions of the northern territory winter precipitation in raw forecasts is comparable with the 20 year average except for coastal regions of victoria and tasmania in spring raw forecasts show wet biases in most parts of australia the anomalies of raw forecasts for all seasons differ markedly from that of the 3 year observations demonstrating misrepresentations of precipitation seasonality raw forecasts for lead times 2 8 not shown in fig 7 also present similar anomalies indicating persistent deficiencies across all lead times in raw forecasts fig s7 anomalies of calibrated forecasts for days 1 and 9 ahead fig 7 and for other lead times fig s8 are smaller than those of the raw forecasts the anomalies of calibrated forecasts are generally consistent with the 3 year observations in different seasons at short lead times figs 7 and s8 indicating improved representations of precipitation seasonality through the scc calibration for example calibrated forecasts for day 1 ahead present spatial patterns similar to the 3 year observations in summer when the raw forecasts demonstrate large inconsistencies the calibrated forecasts for day 1 ahead agree well with the 3 year observations in predicting lower summer precipitation in northeastern parts of australia and higher precipitation in western parts of the country relative to the 20 year observations for the other three seasons spatial patterns of precipitation anomalies in calibrated forecasts for day 1 ahead resemble those of the 3 year observations anomalies of seasonal precipitation gradually get closer to zero at longer lead times figs 7 and s8 demonstrating the capability of scc in pushing calibrated forecasts to match that of the observed climatology when raw forecasts lack skills anomalies of raw forecasts demonstrate substantially overpredicted wet days relative to the 20 year climatology particularly in summer autumn and spring fig 8 specifically wet days of raw forecasts in summer are approximately 20 higher than the observed climatology in autumn and spring the anomalies of raw forecasts range from around 5 20 in most parts of australia the raw forecasts have similar winter wet days compared to the 20 year climatology figs 8 and s9 seasonal patterns of wet days are markedly improved through the scc calibration overpredictions in summer autumn and spring are effectively reduced by scc spatial patterns of anomalies in calibrated forecasts match the 3 year observations much better than the raw forecasts for all four seasons the comparison clearly suggests that when raw forecasts have skills calibrated forecasts generally match the 3 year observations whereas for long lead times when skills are low scc provides calibrated forecasts similar to the 20 year climatology figs 8 and s10 3 5 computation feasibility and efficiency the post processing of access g2 forecasts with scc across australia at a high spatial resolution is successfully conducted scc performs parameter inference and forecast generation smoothly across different climate zones at the continental scale computation of the scc calibration is intensive as a result of the complex model algorithms the sophisticated leave one month out cross validation strategy and a large number of computation units table 1 speedup and efficiency of the two computation steps 1 and 2 show that the computation has been successfully paralleled figs 9 and 10 speedup of the two steps increases quickly with more cpus and eventually the speedup reaches 42 78 for the job processing 17 376 grid cells in step 1 when 48 cpus are used and the speedup is 45 87 for step 2 when 48 cpus are used high speedup suggests small portions of serial fraction in the codes since computation for different grid cells is independent and could be pleasingly paralleled although the computation efficiency decreases with the cpu numbers it remains above 0 8 when processing a large number of grid cells in steps 1 and 2 more importantly computation efficiency for step 1 increases with the increase of grid cell numbers suggesting the high scalability of the computation fig 9 one reason for the high computation cost of this study is the cross validation strategy adopting the leave one month out cross validation strategy allows for a rigorous evaluation of scc performance by conducting model fitting and parameter inference repeatedly for each of the 36 months during the 4 2016 3 2019 period when the scc model is implemented to calibrate real time new forecasts in the operational context the computation cost will be significantly lower table 1 4 discussion 4 1 robustness of scc calibration in post processing short archived forecasts decent performances across different climate zones and geographical settings verify the soundness of the scc s statistical basis and algorithms in reparameterization the scc calibration clearly outperforms the raw forecasts in providing predictions with low biases reliable ensemble forecasts generated by scc provided forecast users with valuable uncertainty information not available in the deterministic raw forecasts compared with previous investigations scc shows the capability of improving forecasting skills to a level which is at least as good as other post processing of precipitation forecasts robertson et al 2013 wang et al 2019b reasonable seasonal patterns consistent with the observed climatology are also successfully established in calibrated forecasts by scc consequently our results show that despite the low availability of raw forecasts for model fitting the challenges associated with short archived nwp forecasts have been successfully addressed by scc the aims for effective calibration have been successfully achieved we conclude that the statistical basis and assumptions of scc are robust and the model algorithms are effective in post processing short archived nwp precipitation forecasts 4 2 calibration of nwp forecasts at the continental scale and important implications numerical weather predictions are playing increasingly important roles in water resource management hope et al 2015 planning of farming activities perera et al 2014 and management of natural hazards hopson and webster 2009 which rely on skillful and reliable forecasts needs for reliable future precipitation information have been increasing in recent decades calibrated forecasts will provide valuable information to the management of variable water resources barros and bowden 2008 improvements to the accuracy and skills of raw forecasts will help constrain uncertainties in hydrological forecasting which requires high quality precipitation inputs rasouli et al 2012 high quality precipitation forecasts will also be useful for improving water use efficiency in regions performing irrigated farming perera et al 2016 through the adoption of parallel algorithms we have achieved high computational efficiency in scc calibration against high resolution observations at the continental scale this investigation confirms the computational feasibility of applying scc for post processing of nwp forecasts at a fine spatial resolution across australia the post processing strategy of separating parameter inference step 1 in table 1 with the generation of forecasts step 2 in table 1 and the adoption of parallel algorithms could be used by future computation demanding post processing of nwp forecasts this comprehensive evaluation extends our previous site scale investigation to a broader scale and provides important implications for improving the access g2 weather forecasting and the awap data in the future we observed persistent dry bias in the coastal areas of australia across the nine lead times suggesting that deficiencies in nwp parameterization of physical processes controlling weather dynamics or data assimilation could be further enhanced to improve the quality of raw forecasts consequently improving representations of physical processes or parameterization particularly in regions showing persistent biases figs 2 and 3 is essential for upgrading the access g2 model for improving nwp forecasts in australia milton and wilson 1996 in addition uncertainties in awap data in central australia where observations are scarce may be responsible for the wet bias in raw forecasts figs 2 and 3 the quality of calibrated forecasts heavily relies on the quality of the observations low quality of observations results in low correlation coefficients between observations and raw forecasts fig 1 calibrated forecasts in these regions generally approach the ensemble climatology reference forecasts future development of awap data should enhance data interpolation in regions with limited observations 4 3 future work in this study the scc model is applied to each grid cell and lead time separately to generate ensemble forecasts as a result the spatial correlations among adjacent grid cells and the temporal correlations among the nine lead times are not explicitly considered to construct the correlations our future work will order the ensemble members for the different lead times and locations to generate reasonable spatial and temporal patterns the widely used schaake shuffle method will be adopted for this purpose clark et al 2004 tang et al 2020 in addition we assume that the observed climatology is stationary over the past 20 years in estimating scc parameters however increasing evidence is showing that precipitation demonstrates significant temporal trends taschetto and england 2009 the assumption of unchanged climatology over time will not capture the climate change impacts on precipitation to address this challenge we recently developed a new post processing model to build up the temporal trends in calibrated seasonal forecasts of temperature shao et al 2020 we will test the model in post processing of daily precipitation forecasts in the future in this study we use a simple interpolation method to match the different spatial resolutions between observation and forecasts in the future more sophisticated remapping methods such as the conservative remapping methods jones 1999 could be adopted to investigate the impacts of grid cell regridding on forecast calibration future improvement of the scc model will also benefit from a thorough comparison with other sophisticated post processing models dabernig et al 2017 scheuerer and buermann 2014 the scc calibrated forecasts are shown to be reliable when evaluated on all events figs 4 and 5 however for larger precipitation events the calibrated forecasts tend to be moderately biased in the positive li et al 2019 fig 5 showed that similar tendencies occur with several forecast calibration models in a further study that focused on the bayesian joint probability bjp model which is the foundation model for the scc li et al 2020 suggested that the correlation between observations and forecasts should be lower for larger precipitation events and therefore the use of a constant correlation is responsible for the positive bias in forecasting larger events they showed that the problem can be overcome by adopting a variable correlation relationship that is the correlation is a function of forecast magnitude this could be an avenue for future research to improve the scc model this work is especially timely as water balance forecasts are in growing demand li et al 2017b wang and robertson 2011 one potential application of scc is to post process access g2 precipitation forecasts for driving the australian water resource assessment awra model to conduct operational water balance forecasting across australia we are confident that scc will help reduce uncertainties in awra based water forecasting by providing high quality precipitation inputs this current study presents a benchmark for future post processing of other nwp models of the access family such as the access g3 model and other nwp models with limited archived forecasts although the model has been developed and evaluated in australia this method could be easily adapted to other regions in this study we applied scc calibration on precipitation forecasts however the model algorithms are designed to be variable independent and thus could potentially be used for the calibration of other climatic variables such as temperature and evapotranspiration 5 conclusions post processing of nwp forecasts faces challenges in providing bias free reliable and skillful calibrated forecasts which are consistent with observed climatology particularly when the availability of archived nwp data for establishing statistical calibration models is low in recognition of these challenges we developed the scc model which is capable of overcoming multiple constraints simultaneously to evaluate the feasibility and performance of scc over large domains we apply the model to post process precipitation forecasts from access g2 across australia at a fine spatial resolution 5 km with the support of the nci supercomputer the scc calibration was conducted successfully and calibrated forecasts were found to outperform raw forecasts in terms of accuracy skills and representation of seasonality in addition the scc model converts deterministic forecasts to ensemble forecasts which will allow forecast users to evaluate uncertainty range and to consider alternative management practices when using forecasts for decision making this continental scale application has validated statistical assumptions and reparameterization algorithms in scc the scc model could be easily adapted to post processing of other nwp models and could be particularly useful for the newly operationalized models with limited archived forecasts the methodology is also applicable to other nwp variables such as temperature and evapotranspiration forecast post processing with scc will benefit a broad range of forecast users

8235,study region australia study focus we developed the seasonally coherent calibration scc model to post process precipitation forecasts from numerical weather prediction nwp models the scc model is capable of generating high quality calibrated forecasts which are coherent in climatology including seasonality consistent with observations despite only a short period of forecasts being available in

forecast users in australia by providing accurate skillful and reliable ensemble forecasts computation strategies adopted in this study will help develop effective procedures for future post processing of nwp forecasts with sophisticated calibration models at a large spatial scale keywords post processing seasonally coherent calibration forecast evaluation large scale application 1 introduction reliable prediction of future weather conditions is critical for effective planning and management of a variety of social and economic activities particularly in regions with a highly variable weather system in recent decades numerical weather prediction nwp models have been developed and widely implemented to forecast how weather processes will develop in the near future bi et al 2013 buizza et al 2005 nwp precipitation forecasts have been increasingly used to inform decision making related to water resource management perera et al 2014 and to help formulate mitigation measures for natural hazards herman and schumacher 2018 huang and thatcher 2017 lee et al 2011 leutbecher and palmer 2008 however errors from observations used for model parameterization limitations in nwp models representation of physical processes of the atmosphere data assimilation and initialization of key variables usually lead to systematic errors in raw forecasts bowler et al 2008 buizza 2018 lorenz 1993 nipen and stull 2011 zappa et al 2010 post processing of raw forecasts with statistical models is a necessary step in using nwp forecasts glahn and lowry 1972 hamill and colucci 1998 mert et al 2020 vannitsem et al 2018 a plethora of post processing models with divergent complexities and statistical basis have been developed to calibrate raw nwp forecasts li et al 2017a wilks 2018 computationally efficient approaches such as the rank histogram recalibration method hamill and colucci 1998 and the quantile mapping method gudmundsson et al 2012 have advantages in the easiness and low computation cost for implementation but may not ensure reliability and skills in calibrated forecasts zhao et al 2017 a more popular group of post processing models is based on regression models in this group the model output statistics mos s procedure glahn and lowry 1972 in characterizing errors of past forecasts and applying the error characteristics to correct future forecasts has been widely adopted in the development of more complex post processing models applequist et al 2015 wilks 2018 through linking predictors and predictands with fitted linear or non linear models regression based models have been found to be effective in improving raw forecasts using a few parameters gneiting et al 2005 verkade et al 2013 wilks 2006 another group of post processing models is based on models of the joint probability of forecasts and observations krzysztofowicz and herr 2001 wang et al 2009 after establishing the joint probability models conditional distributions of observations y given forecasts x can be obtained the conditional distributions can be applied to new forecasts to produce calibrated forecasts shrestha et al 2015 in addition data driven model techniques such as machine learning models are increasingly used in forecast post processing recently mert et al 2020 previous comparisons suggest that the performance of these models varied with study areas nwp models and choice of evaluation metrics wilks 2018 and there is no conclusion regarding which group of post processing models has the best performance however it has been reported that calibration models using conditional distributions have the advantage of using long historical observations in forecast post processing li et al 2017a wilks 2018 effective post processing of raw forecasts aims to provide calibrated forecasts that are unbiased reliable in ensemble spread as skillful as possible and no worse than the climatology reference forecasts shrestha et al 2013 verkade et al 2013 wang et al 2019a williams et al 2014 in addition calibrated forecasts should be coherent in climatology including seasonality consistent with observations scheuerer and hamill 2015 stauffer et al 2017a wang et al 2019a seasonal variation of precipitation has not been explicitly or implicitly represented in some calibration models without accounting for seasonality calibrated forecasts could be inconsistent with observations in temporal patterns especially in regions where precipitation shows strong seasonality and when skills of raw forecasts are low wang et al 2019a achieving the aims of effective forecast calibration has been challenged by the availability of raw forecasts when long archived forecasts being available calibration methods such as quantile mapping or the standardized anomaly model output statistics samos could be adopted to improve the representation of climatology in calibrated forecasts scheuerer and hamill 2015 stauffer et al 2017b however due to the high computational costs and frequent model upgrades newly operationalized nwp models with changed error characteristics usually do not produce hindcasts kane et al 2008 instead new nwp models often only archive a short period of experimental forecasts when they are officially operationalized puri et al 2013 a common practice to deal with this challenge is to directly use the short archived raw forecasts and observation of the same period to build up statistical connections between raw forecasts and observations robertson et al 2013 however the sampling errors in model parameter inference with such a short period of data are often significant resulting in calibrated forecasts which may demonstrate inconsistencies with observed climatology wang et al 2019a to address these challenges we developed the seasonally coherent calibration scc model wang et al 2019a this model calibrates nwp forecasts based on conditional distributions of a bivariate model sophisticated model algorithms and a sensible reparameterization strategy in scc have allowed for seasonal variation in calibrated forecasts to better represent temporal patterns of precipitation even when only a short period of raw forecasts are available for model fitting the model represents a significant advancement in modeling strategies for post processing of nwp forecasts a preliminary test demonstrated the strength of scc in reducing bias and improving skills of raw forecasts wang et al 2019a the effectiveness and robustness of the scc model for general applications across a broad range of climate conditions and geophysical settings remain unclear as a result a large scale model application and performance evaluation are needed to better examine whether the scc model is robust enough to achieve post processing aims mentioned previously continental scale post processing of nwp or general circulation model gcm forecasts at high spatial resolutions are being increasingly performed in europe and north america gascón et al 2019 hamill et al 2017 previous precipitation forecast post processing studies in australia are mainly conducted at the site or river basin scale to support streamflow forecasting for gauged basins schepen et al 2018 zhao et al 2016 as the need for water forecasting for ungauged regions is growing in australia it is also necessary to expand the post processing to a broader spatial scale forecast calibration will benefit water forecasting across large spatial scales by providing high quality weather inputs in addition as computational resources are becoming increasingly accessible it is critical to develop procedures to enable the utilization of supercomputing techniques for improving computation efficiencies of post processing as a result there is a need to evaluate the computational feasibility of post processing with sophisticated models like scc for the application at large spatial scales in this study we apply the scc model to post process precipitation forecasts from the australian bureau of meteorology s australian community climate and earth system simulator g2 version access g2 nwp model across australia it should be noted that in addition to calibrating raw forecasts for each grid cell of the study area separately the spatial and temporal structures in calibrated forecasts should be built using techniques such as the schaake shuffle method clark et al 2004 shrestha et al 2013 the combination of forecast calibration and construction of spatial and temporal structures will generate calibrated forecasts directly usable for forecast users this study is mainly focused on the forecast calibration and the reconstruction of spatial temporal coherence in calibrated ensemble forecasts will be presented in a separate investigation the objectives of this study are to 1 apply a grid cell by grid cell calibration procedure to deterministic forecasts to generate reasonably calibrated gridded ensemble forecasts 2 evaluate the performance and robustness of scc at the continental scale 3 investigate the computational feasibility and efficiency of applying scc at a high spatial resolution across a large domain 2 methods 2 1 raw forecasts and observations raw precipitation forecasts calibrated in this study are from the australian community climate and earth system simulator g2 version access g2 model developed by the australian bureau of meteorology this model started to produce weather forecasts on march 18th 2016 with four runs starting at the coordinated universal time utc of 0000 utc 0600 utc 1200 utc and 1800 utc of each day access g2 produces hourly precipitation predictions for 240 h in the future across the globe with a grid spacing of 0 35 longitude by 0 23 latitude in this study forecast calibration and evaluation are focused on the period of 4 2016 3 2019 the observations used for calibration are the australian water availability project awap gridded precipitation data jones et al 2014 2007 this dataset has been developed through a model data fusion method which http www csiro au awap generates continental scale gridded data with a spatial resolution of 0 05 x 0 05 approximately 5 km based on site scale observations across australia in this study awap data of 4 1999 3 2019 is used for model fitting and the period of 4 2016 3 2019 is used for model performance evaluation we sum hourly raw forecasts on the awap grid 38 25 km spacing over the 24 h period and apply bilinear interpolation to generate the interpolated forecasts at the resolution of the awap data 5 km spath 1993 2 2 post processing of nwp forecasts with scc the scc model is composed of four key components including 1 a joint probability model which links observations and raw forecasts 2 derivation of the observed long term climatology to establish the seasonal patterns in scc 3 reparameterization for the reduction of parameter numbers to work with limited raw forecasts and 4 application of the model to generate calibrated forecasts the statistical basis assumptions and formulas of the scc model have been introduced in detail in our site scale investigation wang et al 2019a here we further explain how the calibration is conducted to convert deterministic raw forecasts to calibrated ensemble forecasts across australia post processing with the scc model is applied to each grid cell and lead time separately the calibration starts with data transformation using the log sinh transformation wang et al 2012 the effectiveness of the log sinh method in transforming precipitation data in australia has been validated robertson et al 2013 we apply the log sinh transformation to both observations and forecasts figs s1 and s2 details of the log sinh transformation are presented in the supplementary material we use the 20 year daily observations and the 3 year forecasts to estimate transformation parameters for observations and forecasts respectively second we build up a bivariate normal bn distribution for the transformed data based on the joint probability theory we assume that transformed forecasts f t and observed precipitation o t are drawn from this bn distribution 1 f t o t bn f t o t μ f m t σ f 2 m t μ o m t σ o 2 m t ρ m t where m t returns month k 1 12 for day t μ f m t a n d σ f m t are the mean and standard deviation of the marginal distribution of f t for the month of m t μ o m t a n d σ o m t are the mean and standard deviation of the marginal distribution of o t in the month of m t ρ m t is the correlation between f t and o t for month m t the model is parameterized at the monthly resolution and therefore the daily precipitations within the same month of the year share common parameter values the two variables f t a n d o t of the bivariate normal distribution are expected to be continuous however precipitation is discontinuous in nature as a result we need to find a way to build up a continuous distribution that allows for negative values and left censors the distribution at a censoring threshold scheuerer and hamill 2015 to do this we set a censoring threshold and treated values below this threshold as censored data for censored data we resample their values from negative infinity to the percent point function of the censoring threshold this treatment allows us to convert discontinuous data to a continuous distribution in this study we set 0 2 mm day and 0 01 mm day as the censoring thresholds for observed precipitation and forecasts respectively we use 0 2 mm day as the threshold for observation because this is the minimum value that could be measured in the field for forecasts we choose a lower threshold of 0 01 mm day because gridded forecasts represent average rainfall over a large spatial extent 38 km 25 km for this study therefore for such a large region average rainfall forecasts lower than the minimum measurable amount is likely to result in measurable rainfall 0 2 mm day at some specific locations within that grid cell considering the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation robertson et al 2013 shrestha et al 2013 thanks to the availability of long term awap data we are able to calculate μ o m t a n d σ o m t directly based on the 20 year observations 4 1999 3 2019 using the maximum likelihood method wang et al 2019a specifically μ o m t a n d σ o m t are estimated based on daily data of 20 months the same month k k 1 12 in each of the 20 year however for the short archived access g2 forecasts we are not able to confidently estimate the mean μ f m t and standard deviation σ f m t to solve this problem we employ a sensible reparameterization by assuming that the mean and standard deviation of raw forecasts are linearly correlated with those of the observations 2 μ f k a b μ o k 3 σ f k c d σ o k 4 ρ k r where k is a month ranging from 1 to 12 a b c and d are parameters characterizing the linear relationships ρ k denotes the correlation coefficient between raw forecasts and observations for each month r is the correlation coefficient between raw forecasts and observations in the transformed space parameter inference for a b c d and r is based on the maximum likelihood estimation using forecasts and observations during 4 2016 3 2019 maximum likelihood functions were introduced in detail in our site scale investigation wang et al 2019a we set parameters b c d and r to be larger than zero in the estimation of parameter values positive b will ensure a positive correlation coefficient between the mean of forecasts and observations positive c and d are to generate non negative standard deviation of forecasts positive r is to ensure that calibrated forecasts would have skills at least as good as ensemble climatology reference forecasts once we obtain values of a b c d and r we estimate the mean μ f k and standard deviation σ f k for forecasts using the above linear functions the correlation coefficient r obtained in this step is used to evaluate the underlying skills of raw forecasts in section 3 1 fig 1 with the established bivariate distribution and associated parameters we are able to establish a conditional distribution for the observations o t when new raw forecasts f t are provided we then draw 100 random samples from the conditional distribution of o t to produce an ensemble which is then treated as the calibrated ensemble forecasts for the corresponding deterministic raw forecast finally we back transform the calibrated forecasts from the previous step to their original space 2 3 evaluation of scc performance in this study we adopt a leave one month out cross validation strategy to evaluate the performance of scc from 4 2016 to 3 2019 specifically we leave out one of the 36 months during the validation period 4 2016 to 3 2019 in observations the same month in the 20 year observations 4 1999 to 3 2019 and the same month in the forecast and use the remaining months to optimize scc parameters in cross validation for the inference of transformation parameters for observations 19 years and 11 months of daily observation are used for the inference of transformation parameters for forecasts 35 months were used for μ o k a n d σ o k 19 months same month k k 1 12 in each of the 19 years excluding the left out month of daily data are used for the left out month but for the other months we still use 20 months same month k k 1 12 in each of the 20 years for the estimation of a b c d r μ f k and σ f k we use the 35 months of the 3 year observations and forecasts which are not left out once the parameters are estimated we then treat raw forecasts of the left out month as new raw forecasts and calibrate these raw forecasts to produce ensemble calibrated forecasts the cross validation is conducted for each of the 36 months to generate calibrated forecasts for the evaluation period 4 2016 to 3 2019 this cross validation strategy ensures that calibrated forecasts are generated based on raw forecasts which are not used in model fitting in addition we also generate ensemble climatology reference forecasts through randomly sampling values from observed climatology of each month to form a reference for performance evaluation the calibrated forecasts are evaluated according to four criteria including 1 bias in the magnitude and frequency of precipitation 2 reliability 3 skills relatives to the ensemble climatology reference forecasts and 4 seasonality 2 3 1 evaluation of bias in raw and calibrated forecasts we first evaluate the forecast accuracy of precipitation by calculating bias in average precipitation and wet days in the raw and calibrated forecasts relative to awap data using the following equation 5 b i a s 1 t t 1 t x t y t where bias refers to bias in average precipitation mm day or wet days t is total days during the 3 year validation period 4 2016 3 2019 x t is daily precipitation mm day or wet days during the 3 year period in forecasts and y t is the corresponding observations of the same period for calibrated ensemble forecasts we use the ensemble mean for the calculation of bias for wet day calculation we use 0 2 mm day as the threshold to distinguish between wet and dry days for the deterministic raw forecasts and observations the ratio of wet days is calculated as the fraction of days with precipitation larger than the threshold over the 3 year evaluation period 4 2016 to 3 2019 for the calibrated ensemble forecasts we first calculate the ratio of wet days over the 100 ensemble members for each day this ratio indicates the possibility of a specific day being a wet day ratios for all days during the study period are summed up and then divided by total days during 4 2016 3 2019 to obtain the average wet days for calibrated ensemble forecasts 2 3 2 reliability we first evaluate the reliability of calibrated forecasts using the reliability diagram hartmann et al 2002 the diagram is to assess how well the predicted probabilities of an event correspond to their observed frequencies to create the diagrams we convert the calibrated ensemble forecasts to forecast probabilities of exceeding three thresholds the 80th 90th and 95th percentiles of observations we pool forecasts of different grid cells months and lead times together to calculate the forecast probability we group the predicted probabilities into 10 bins ranging from 0 0 1 to 0 9 1 and compare them with the observed relative frequency in the reliability diagram perfectly reliable forecasts will demonstrate a curve along the diagonal a plotted curve above the diagonal indicates dry bias probabilities are too high and vice versa one important advantage of scc is the capability of converting deterministic raw forecasts to ensemble forecasts with the ensemble spread representing forecast uncertainty the reliability of ensemble forecasts refers to the consistency between forecast distributions and the frequency of associated events in observations reliable ensemble spread is a critical feature of high quality forecasts reliable ensemble distributions not too narrow or too wide will help avoid aggressive or overly conservative decisions in using forecasts to further evaluate the reliability of calibrated forecasts we calculate the probability integral transform pit value using the following equation 6 π t f t x y t where f t x is the cumulative density function of the ensemble forecast and y t is the observation for reliable forecasts π t follows a uniform distribution to demonstrate the spatial patterns of reliability of calibrated forecasts across australia we then calculate an alpha index α to summarize the reliability in each grid cell using the following equation renard et al 2010 7 α 1 2 n t 1 n π t t n 1 where π t is the sorted π t t 1 2 n in ascending order and n is the total number of days this index represents the total deviation of calibrated forecasts from the corresponding uniform quantile perfectly reliable forecasts should have an α index of 1 and forecasts with no reliability would have an α index of 0 2 3 3 skills of the raw and calibrated forecasts we use the continuous ranked probability score crps skill score to measure skills in the raw and calibrated forecasts relative to ensemble climatology reference forecasts this score generalizes absolute errors in forecasts and thus could provide a direct comparison of deterministic and probabilistic forecasts grimit et al 2006 crps has been widely used to measure forecasting skills of probabilistic forecasts that exhibit predictive cumulative distribution functions hersbach 2000 wang et al 2019a specifically crps is calculated using the following equation 8 c r p s t f t x h x y t 2 d x 9 c r p s 1 n t 1 n c r p s t where f t x is the cumulative density function of an ensemble forecast and y t is the observation at time t h is the heaviside step function h 1 if x y t 0 and h 0 otherwise the overbar represents averaging across the n days for deterministic forecasts crps is reduced to absolute errors following the derivation of crps values for the raw calibrated and ensemble climatology reference forecasts we further calculate the crps skill score c r p s s s using the following equation 10 c r p s s s c r p s r e f e r e n c e c r p s f o r e c a s t s c r p s r e f e r e n c e 100 where c r p s r e f e r e n c e is the crps value of ensemble climatology reference forecasts c r p s f o r e c a s t s refers to crps value of raw or calibrated forecasts here c r p s s s measures the difference between crps values of forecasts and those of ensemble climatology forecasts positive skill scores indicate better skills than the ensemble climatology reference forecasts and vice versa 2 3 4 seasonality to evaluate whether post processing with scc achieves the objective of this study in reasonably building seasonality in calibrated forecasts we examine seasonal patterns of average precipitation and wet days in raw and calibrated forecasts and compare them with the long term observations specifically we first calculate average precipitation and wet days of the raw and calibrated forecasts as well in the 3 year 4 2016 3 2019 and 20 year 4 1999 3 2019 observations at the seasonal scale then we calculate anomalies of the two variables in raw forecasts calibrated forecasts and the 3 year observations relative to the 20 year observations for all seasons these anomalies would help evaluate whether forecasted wet and dry seasons and spatial extents of wet and dry regions are consistent with the observed long term climatology or not we also calculate the anomalies in the 3 year observations to examine whether forecasts are consistent with the observations of the same period in seasonal variability we analyze the seasonality of forecasts in lead times 1 and 9 in the main text and present the remaining 7 lead times in the supplementary material 2 4 computation of the calibration the computation of the forecast post processing at the continental scale is intensive the calibration is conducted across 281 655 grid cells in australia we use the supercomputer gadi managed by the national computational infrastructure nci for the computation and the normal queue of nci to run our computation jobs nodes used in our computation have two 24 core intel xeon scalable cascade lake processors and 192 gigabytes of memory the walltime limit for computational jobs submitted to the normal queue is 48 h to make the calibration computationally feasible we divide the calibration into three steps including 1 parameter inference 2 forecast generation and evaluation and 3 test post processing of new raw forecasts in the operational context parameter inference is the most computationally demanding step to improve the speed of this step and to meet the 48 h walltime limit we divide the awap domain 681 row and 841 columns with a spatial resolution of 0 05 into 31 zones with each zone covering 22 rows of grid cells in the awap domain we submit one computation job for each zone for parameter inference after we obtain parameters for each zone we combine them together to obtain the parameters across australia calibrated parameters from step 1 are used for forecast generation in steps 2 and 3 for steps 2 and 3 we use a single job for each step to produce calibrated forecasts we adopt the open multi processing openmp algorithms to parallel these computation tasks we evaluate the speedup efficiency and scalability of the code speedup is defined as the ratio of the total central processing unit cpu runtime over the walltime of the model run efficiency is defined as the ratio of speedup over cpu numbers we demonstrate the scalability of the code by running the calibration over different numbers of grid cells for step 1 since this is the most computationally demanding step of the computation the parallel algorithms adopted in steps 2 and 3 are the same as that of step 1 3 results 3 1 underlying skills of raw forecasts plots of the correlation coefficient r between transformed raw forecasts and observations show that raw forecasts reasonably represent precipitation variability at short lead times but demonstrate much lower skills at long lead times fig 1 for the first three lead times r values in most grid cells are over 0 6 except for areas near the state border between western australia and northern territory where r values are generally below 0 2 the skills of raw forecasts decline quickly with increases in lead time for days 4 7 ahead grid cells with r values lower than 0 4 cover large areas in northern and western australia for the last two lead times days 8 and 9 ahead r values are mainly lower than 0 2 in most parts of australia 3 2 accuracy of raw and calibrated forecasts the raw forecasts demonstrate large biases across australia figs 2 and s3 in coastal areas of australia raw forecasts generally underpredict precipitation whereas raw forecasts mainly show wet biases in the inland areas of australia the spatial patterns of bias in the raw forecast are similar across all nine lead times fig 2 through the scc calibration biases in calibrated forecasts are substantially reduced to values close to zero grid cells with remaining bias in calibrated forecasts are mainly scattered in the northern parts of australia since the 20 year observations are used to establish the bivariate normal distribution eq 1 calibrated forecasts would tend to gradually approach the climatology of the 20 year data particularly for the less skillful forecasts at long lead times as a result biases in calibrated forecasts partially reflect the deviation of the 3 year observations 4 2016 3 2019 from the 20 year climatology 4 1999 3 2019 we further evaluate the prediction of wet days by raw and calibrated forecasts figs 3 and s4 raw forecasts substantially overpredict wet days across most parts of australia by over 10 fig 3 in coastal regions of victoria queensland tasmania and western australia raw forecasts predict fewer wet days than awap data the biases in wet days in raw forecasts are persistent across the nine lead times the calibration significantly corrects biases in wet days in raw forecasts particularly for overpredictions in central australia as indicated in fig 3 calibrated forecasts show biases in wet days close to zero in most parts of australia 3 3 reliability and skills of forecasts three reliability diagrams of the calibrated forecasts are shown in fig 4 at the low threshold of 80th percentile of observations the observed relative frequency and forecast probability mostly follow the 1 1 line indicating consistency between the two at the higher thresholds of 90th and 95th percentiles forecast probabilities in the high range tend to moderately overshoot and therefore are positively biased the calibrated forecasts demonstrate reliable uncertainty spread across all the nine lead times figs 5 and s5 with α index over 0 95 covering most parts of australia the high reliability indicates the reasonable representation of uncertainties in future precipitation and suggests that the distribution of calibrated ensemble forecasts are neither too narrow nor too wide fig 5 skills in forecasts are also substantially enhanced through the scc calibration raw forecasts are more skillful than ensemble climatology reference forecasts in eastern parts of australia for day 1 ahead figs 6 and s6 however large areas of central australia show negative skill scores in raw forecasts even at short lead times skills of raw forecasts decline quickly and become worse than the ensemble climatology reference forecasts at long lead times days 6 9 ahead in most parts of australia for all lead times calibrated forecasts markedly outperform the raw forecasts in almost all grid cells in the calibrated forecasts most grid cells for days 1 3 ahead demonstrate crps skill scores larger than 25 although scores of the calibrated forecasts decrease with lead time they remain above zero for all lead times clearly showing skills at least as good as the ensemble climatology reference forecasts 3 4 precipitation seasonality in raw and calibrated forecasts the scc calibration improves precipitation seasonality in forecasts shown by a comparison between precipitation anomalies in forecasts and the 3 year observations anomalies are relative to the 20 year observations fig 7 the anomalies demonstrate large discrepancies in seasonal precipitation between raw forecasts and the 20 year observations particularly in summer autumn and spring specifically raw forecasts largely underpredict summer precipitation in coastal areas of the northern territory queensland and new south wales but overpredict summer precipitation in western parts of australia figs 7 and s7 in autumn raw forecasts demonstrate significant dry biases in coastal regions of the northern territory winter precipitation in raw forecasts is comparable with the 20 year average except for coastal regions of victoria and tasmania in spring raw forecasts show wet biases in most parts of australia the anomalies of raw forecasts for all seasons differ markedly from that of the 3 year observations demonstrating misrepresentations of precipitation seasonality raw forecasts for lead times 2 8 not shown in fig 7 also present similar anomalies indicating persistent deficiencies across all lead times in raw forecasts fig s7 anomalies of calibrated forecasts for days 1 and 9 ahead fig 7 and for other lead times fig s8 are smaller than those of the raw forecasts the anomalies of calibrated forecasts are generally consistent with the 3 year observations in different seasons at short lead times figs 7 and s8 indicating improved representations of precipitation seasonality through the scc calibration for example calibrated forecasts for day 1 ahead present spatial patterns similar to the 3 year observations in summer when the raw forecasts demonstrate large inconsistencies the calibrated forecasts for day 1 ahead agree well with the 3 year observations in predicting lower summer precipitation in northeastern parts of australia and higher precipitation in western parts of the country relative to the 20 year observations for the other three seasons spatial patterns of precipitation anomalies in calibrated forecasts for day 1 ahead resemble those of the 3 year observations anomalies of seasonal precipitation gradually get closer to zero at longer lead times figs 7 and s8 demonstrating the capability of scc in pushing calibrated forecasts to match that of the observed climatology when raw forecasts lack skills anomalies of raw forecasts demonstrate substantially overpredicted wet days relative to the 20 year climatology particularly in summer autumn and spring fig 8 specifically wet days of raw forecasts in summer are approximately 20 higher than the observed climatology in autumn and spring the anomalies of raw forecasts range from around 5 20 in most parts of australia the raw forecasts have similar winter wet days compared to the 20 year climatology figs 8 and s9 seasonal patterns of wet days are markedly improved through the scc calibration overpredictions in summer autumn and spring are effectively reduced by scc spatial patterns of anomalies in calibrated forecasts match the 3 year observations much better than the raw forecasts for all four seasons the comparison clearly suggests that when raw forecasts have skills calibrated forecasts generally match the 3 year observations whereas for long lead times when skills are low scc provides calibrated forecasts similar to the 20 year climatology figs 8 and s10 3 5 computation feasibility and efficiency the post processing of access g2 forecasts with scc across australia at a high spatial resolution is successfully conducted scc performs parameter inference and forecast generation smoothly across different climate zones at the continental scale computation of the scc calibration is intensive as a result of the complex model algorithms the sophisticated leave one month out cross validation strategy and a large number of computation units table 1 speedup and efficiency of the two computation steps 1 and 2 show that the computation has been successfully paralleled figs 9 and 10 speedup of the two steps increases quickly with more cpus and eventually the speedup reaches 42 78 for the job processing 17 376 grid cells in step 1 when 48 cpus are used and the speedup is 45 87 for step 2 when 48 cpus are used high speedup suggests small portions of serial fraction in the codes since computation for different grid cells is independent and could be pleasingly paralleled although the computation efficiency decreases with the cpu numbers it remains above 0 8 when processing a large number of grid cells in steps 1 and 2 more importantly computation efficiency for step 1 increases with the increase of grid cell numbers suggesting the high scalability of the computation fig 9 one reason for the high computation cost of this study is the cross validation strategy adopting the leave one month out cross validation strategy allows for a rigorous evaluation of scc performance by conducting model fitting and parameter inference repeatedly for each of the 36 months during the 4 2016 3 2019 period when the scc model is implemented to calibrate real time new forecasts in the operational context the computation cost will be significantly lower table 1 4 discussion 4 1 robustness of scc calibration in post processing short archived forecasts decent performances across different climate zones and geographical settings verify the soundness of the scc s statistical basis and algorithms in reparameterization the scc calibration clearly outperforms the raw forecasts in providing predictions with low biases reliable ensemble forecasts generated by scc provided forecast users with valuable uncertainty information not available in the deterministic raw forecasts compared with previous investigations scc shows the capability of improving forecasting skills to a level which is at least as good as other post processing of precipitation forecasts robertson et al 2013 wang et al 2019b reasonable seasonal patterns consistent with the observed climatology are also successfully established in calibrated forecasts by scc consequently our results show that despite the low availability of raw forecasts for model fitting the challenges associated with short archived nwp forecasts have been successfully addressed by scc the aims for effective calibration have been successfully achieved we conclude that the statistical basis and assumptions of scc are robust and the model algorithms are effective in post processing short archived nwp precipitation forecasts 4 2 calibration of nwp forecasts at the continental scale and important implications numerical weather predictions are playing increasingly important roles in water resource management hope et al 2015 planning of farming activities perera et al 2014 and management of natural hazards hopson and webster 2009 which rely on skillful and reliable forecasts needs for reliable future precipitation information have been increasing in recent decades calibrated forecasts will provide valuable information to the management of variable water resources barros and bowden 2008 improvements to the accuracy and skills of raw forecasts will help constrain uncertainties in hydrological forecasting which requires high quality precipitation inputs rasouli et al 2012 high quality precipitation forecasts will also be useful for improving water use efficiency in regions performing irrigated farming perera et al 2016 through the adoption of parallel algorithms we have achieved high computational efficiency in scc calibration against high resolution observations at the continental scale this investigation confirms the computational feasibility of applying scc for post processing of nwp forecasts at a fine spatial resolution across australia the post processing strategy of separating parameter inference step 1 in table 1 with the generation of forecasts step 2 in table 1 and the adoption of parallel algorithms could be used by future computation demanding post processing of nwp forecasts this comprehensive evaluation extends our previous site scale investigation to a broader scale and provides important implications for improving the access g2 weather forecasting and the awap data in the future we observed persistent dry bias in the coastal areas of australia across the nine lead times suggesting that deficiencies in nwp parameterization of physical processes controlling weather dynamics or data assimilation could be further enhanced to improve the quality of raw forecasts consequently improving representations of physical processes or parameterization particularly in regions showing persistent biases figs 2 and 3 is essential for upgrading the access g2 model for improving nwp forecasts in australia milton and wilson 1996 in addition uncertainties in awap data in central australia where observations are scarce may be responsible for the wet bias in raw forecasts figs 2 and 3 the quality of calibrated forecasts heavily relies on the quality of the observations low quality of observations results in low correlation coefficients between observations and raw forecasts fig 1 calibrated forecasts in these regions generally approach the ensemble climatology reference forecasts future development of awap data should enhance data interpolation in regions with limited observations 4 3 future work in this study the scc model is applied to each grid cell and lead time separately to generate ensemble forecasts as a result the spatial correlations among adjacent grid cells and the temporal correlations among the nine lead times are not explicitly considered to construct the correlations our future work will order the ensemble members for the different lead times and locations to generate reasonable spatial and temporal patterns the widely used schaake shuffle method will be adopted for this purpose clark et al 2004 tang et al 2020 in addition we assume that the observed climatology is stationary over the past 20 years in estimating scc parameters however increasing evidence is showing that precipitation demonstrates significant temporal trends taschetto and england 2009 the assumption of unchanged climatology over time will not capture the climate change impacts on precipitation to address this challenge we recently developed a new post processing model to build up the temporal trends in calibrated seasonal forecasts of temperature shao et al 2020 we will test the model in post processing of daily precipitation forecasts in the future in this study we use a simple interpolation method to match the different spatial resolutions between observation and forecasts in the future more sophisticated remapping methods such as the conservative remapping methods jones 1999 could be adopted to investigate the impacts of grid cell regridding on forecast calibration future improvement of the scc model will also benefit from a thorough comparison with other sophisticated post processing models dabernig et al 2017 scheuerer and buermann 2014 the scc calibrated forecasts are shown to be reliable when evaluated on all events figs 4 and 5 however for larger precipitation events the calibrated forecasts tend to be moderately biased in the positive li et al 2019 fig 5 showed that similar tendencies occur with several forecast calibration models in a further study that focused on the bayesian joint probability bjp model which is the foundation model for the scc li et al 2020 suggested that the correlation between observations and forecasts should be lower for larger precipitation events and therefore the use of a constant correlation is responsible for the positive bias in forecasting larger events they showed that the problem can be overcome by adopting a variable correlation relationship that is the correlation is a function of forecast magnitude this could be an avenue for future research to improve the scc model this work is especially timely as water balance forecasts are in growing demand li et al 2017b wang and robertson 2011 one potential application of scc is to post process access g2 precipitation forecasts for driving the australian water resource assessment awra model to conduct operational water balance forecasting across australia we are confident that scc will help reduce uncertainties in awra based water forecasting by providing high quality precipitation inputs this current study presents a benchmark for future post processing of other nwp models of the access family such as the access g3 model and other nwp models with limited archived forecasts although the model has been developed and evaluated in australia this method could be easily adapted to other regions in this study we applied scc calibration on precipitation forecasts however the model algorithms are designed to be variable independent and thus could potentially be used for the calibration of other climatic variables such as temperature and evapotranspiration 5 conclusions post processing of nwp forecasts faces challenges in providing bias free reliable and skillful calibrated forecasts which are consistent with observed climatology particularly when the availability of archived nwp data for establishing statistical calibration models is low in recognition of these challenges we developed the scc model which is capable of overcoming multiple constraints simultaneously to evaluate the feasibility and performance of scc over large domains we apply the model to post process precipitation forecasts from access g2 across australia at a fine spatial resolution 5 km with the support of the nci supercomputer the scc calibration was conducted successfully and calibrated forecasts were found to outperform raw forecasts in terms of accuracy skills and representation of seasonality in addition the scc model converts deterministic forecasts to ensemble forecasts which will allow forecast users to evaluate uncertainty range and to consider alternative management practices when using forecasts for decision making this continental scale application has validated statistical assumptions and reparameterization algorithms in scc the scc model could be easily adapted to post processing of other nwp models and could be particularly useful for the newly operationalized models with limited archived forecasts the methodology is also applicable to other nwp variables such as temperature and evapotranspiration forecast post processing with scc will benefit a broad range of forecast users

8236,long term sustainable water resources management requires comprehensive assessment of all water cycle components the combined calibration of surface water sw and groundwater gw parameters is one of the biggest challenges in simulating sw gw interactions swat modflow has improved our ability to simulate sw and gw interactions however there remain challenges associated with i understanding what parameters most influence model outputs and ii properly calibrating the gw related components of the water cycle as represented within swat modflow in this paper we applied swat modflow to the 1452 km2 shiraz catchment located in southwestern iran for the period 2003 2019 a comprehensive sensitivity analysis sa of both sw and gw parameters was conducted to determine what controls runoff and gw level in the study catchment the sa reveals that the curve number cn2 and gw hydraulic conductivity k parameters have the most significant impact on runoff and gw level simulation this work also presents a gw calibrator gwcal tool along with a demonstration of how gwcal improves the performance of swat modflow in the shiraz catchment as a result of the insights gained from the sa keywords surface water groundwater modeling swat modflow calibration sensitivity analysis regional modeling 1 introduction hydrological models have been used to evaluate water availability and determine appropriate water management policies for a long time these models are divided into three main categories i hydrological models which simulate runoff such as hbv bergstrom and forsman 1973 bergstrom 1992 sac sma burnash et al 1973 topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 vic liang et al 1994 hec hms william et al 1995 u s army corps of engineers 2016 swat arnold et al 1998 swim krysanova et al 2000 and watergap verzano 2009 ii hydrogeological models which simulate gw systems such as modflow harbaugh 2005 microfem diodato 2000 zoomq3d jackson 2001 svflux thode and fredlund 2013 fehm zyvoloski et al 2015 and iii physically based integrated surface subsurface hydrological models isshm which solve the governing surface and subsurface flow equations simultaneously furman 2008 popular isshm codes include integrated hydrology model inhm vanderkwaak 1999 modhms hydrogeologic inc 2003 parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 and hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 detailed studies of isshm internal flow dynamics are usually undertaken at scales of less than 0 5 km2 e g ebel and loague 2006 ebel and loague 2006 regional scale surface subsurface applications of isshms e g li et al 2008 are less common because of the large volume of data required to parameterize and evaluate the models sebben et al 2013 paniconi and putti 2015 reviewed developments of physically based hydrological models over the past 50 years maxwell et al 2014 has provided a comparison between different coupled hydrological models the soil water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed catchment scale sw model that can simulate surface runoff swat has been shown to perform well in streamflow simulation in a wide range of watersheds and has been tested in many regions conditions and time scales gassman et al 2007 although swat has been one of the most widely used hydrological models it has limited capability in simulating the gw system neitsch et al 2011 in swat gw is represented by a lumped module which is divided into shallow and deep gw both the shallow and the deep aquifer may contribute to streamflow as baseflow through a linear reservoir approximation ignoring distributed parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k and storage coefficients s kim et al 2008 this simplification of gw dynamics results in a mischaracterisation of gw resources especially when streamflow is strongly dependent on gw discharge gassman et al 2007 in fact swat compares shallow aquifer depth with a threshold to estimate the river recharge and it is not capable of considering the river bottom elevation and aquifer depth to properly simulate recharge gassman et al 2007 kim et al 2008 arnold et al 2013 gayathri et al 2015 aliyari et al 2019 modflow is a fully distributed three dimensional gw standard model which simulates gw flow modflow is the most popular gw model and has been successfully used in many global and regional studies harbaugh et al 2000 harbaugh 2005 jafari et al 2016a 2016b de graaf et al 2017 deb et al 2019b although modflow is the most popular gw model it has considerable limitations in simulating surface and subsurface processes of land atmosphere interactions agricultural management practices unsaturated zone flow uzf and surface runoff and does not directly account for hydrologic processes that occur in the root zone lachaal et al 2012 surinaidu et al 2014 consequently modflow lacks the ability to consider the difference in recharge rates as a result of changes in precipitation and infiltration from the river infiltration varies due to land use irrigation and agronomic practices implemented on the surface domain guzman et al 2015 several attempts have been made to address the above mentioned shortcomings by linking swat with modflow to simulate sw gw interactions e g kim et al 2008 guzman et al 2015 izady et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 deb et al 2019a 2019b abbas et al 2018 gao et al 2019 chunn et al 2019 molina navarro et al 2019 sith et al 2019 aliyari et al 2019 bailey et al 2016 developed a new coupled swat modflow model that geographically locates and integrates hydrologic response units hrus in swat sub basin with the spatially gridded modflow model this model has been tested against observed stream flow and water table elevation in a catchment area in the united state of america usa in swat modflow deep percolation from swat is passed to the grid cells of modflow as recharge and modflow calculated sw gw interaction fluxes are passed to the stream channels of swat hence the model accounts for two way interactions between sw and gw which enables better representation and understanding of the spatial temporal patterns of sw gw interactions bailey et al 2016 swat modflow has been applied to different catchments in the usa abbas et al 2018 gao et al 2019 canada chunn et al 2019 denmark molina navarro et al 2019 iran semiromi and koch 2019 and japan sith et al 2019 swatmod prep was introduced by bailey et al 2017 as a graphical user interface for coupled swat modflow and it was applied in little river experimental watershed georgia in order to apply swat modflow in large scale catchments aliyari et al 2019 improved the linkage between modflow pumping cells and swat hrus for irrigation this modification accounts for spatially variable recharge which in turn is affected by dynamic land use and land management practices when calibrating swat modflow it is essential to know which gw parameters could impact runoff simulation results from swat and which sw parameters could impact gw level results from modflow previous research has shown that a sensitivity analysis sa is required to determine which parameters control runoff and gw level and how sw and gw parameters impact each other guo and su 2019 jiang et al 2018 in order to obtain meaningful results from the sa a well calibrated swat modflow model is required however it is challenging especially with manual calibration to obtain optimal parameter values when concurrently simulating sw and gw after linking in swat modflow the ultimate aim of this research is to obtain insights about what controls runoff and gw level in a semi arid area this is done by conducting a comprehensive sa to determine the effect of both swat parameters and modflow parameters on the results of the swat modflow simulation a new gw calibrator tool gwcal is developed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the manual calibration process and to obtain more realistic results from swat modflow and the sa gwcal is applied to the latest version of swat modflow for a catchment in shiraz iran where sw gw interaction is high to demonstrate how gwcal improves the efficiency effectiveness of the calibration process 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 geography and climate the shiraz watershed covers an area of 1452 km2 in southwestern iran fig 1 the elevation in shiraz catchment ranges from 1436 to 2991 m above mean sea level with an average of 1830 m fig 1 the shiraz catchment has mountains covering approximately 800 km2 of the total catchment area annual long term average temperature in the study area is 17 9⁰c with 2550 mm average potential evaporation and 361 5 mm annual long term average precipitation in this area precipitation mainly occurs during december to march fars regional water authority 2015 2 1 2 hydrology the khoshk river is the major stream in shiraz catchment originating in the northwest of the basin it crosses the alluvial aquifer and shiraz city discharges into mahrloo lake the river discharge is heavily affected by the wet season stream gauges are located at the lower end of azam and khoshk sub watershed eini et al 2019 fig 2 shows the river network and location of sub basins stream gauges and weather stations in the study area the land cover in the shiraz catchment is dominated by intensive irrigated agriculture and other land use includes wetland pasture and urban areas fig 3 the main crops include spring and winter wheat almond and pomegranate gardens fars regional water authority 2015 soils are heterogeneous and erosive with fine sandy loam in the eastern part fine sandy loams and loamy soils in the north central and south central portions of the watershed and silt loams in the western portion fars regional water authority 2015 2 1 3 hydrogeology the shiraz aquifer is mainly an unconfined aquifer constituted of fine sandy clay and loamy soils in the north west and central portions of the watershed shiraz aquifer average thickness is approximately 30 m based on results of pumping tests the transmissivity range varies between 100 to 200 m2 d whereas the average specific yield is around 0 05 unit in the shiraz aquifer gw depth varies from between 3 35 metres below ground level mbgl the maximum gw depth is in west and north of aquifer where gw depth level is 35 m the minimum gw depth is towards the east and south part of the aquifer where gw depth reaches to less than 3 m depth general gw flow direction is from the north west toward the south east fars regional water authority 2015 available information from groundwater and stream observation networks indicate there is interaction between the aquifer and river mainly in the south east part of aquifer fars regional water authority 2016 geologically the study area is comprised of stratigraphic units of precambrian rocks to quaternary deposits and tectonically northern altitudes of shiraz plain are placed in the zagros tectonic zone moreover the tectonic structure of the aquifer including folds and faults are mainly extended from north to south and from north west to south east this aquifer is considered as the main source of water for irrigation domestic and public supply because of streamflow depletion and reduced base flow according to the latest water budget reports in 2019 1802 production bores are extracting 189 million cubic meter mcm of water from the aquifer in addition 122 drinking water 48 industrial usage and 1632 irrigation pumping bores are placed on agricultural land 2 2 data collection in order to apply the swat modflow model in the study area a range of meteorological hydrological and hydrogeological data were collected and interpreted from various sources table 1 rainfall temperature and evaporation data was collected from four stations in the catchment fig 2 data from two runoff gauges of khosk river and azam river have been used rainfall data was available for the entire simulation period of 2003 2019 iran water resources management 2020 gw level data were available from an existing network of gw monitoring bores in the study area gw is used for agriculture potable and industrial use fars regional water authority 2015 2 3 model setup 2 3 1 surface water simulation to simulate sw system in the study area swat was used swat was built for the entire watershed shown in fig 2 swat simulation is based on conceptual units of homogeneous land use management slope and soil characteristics that extend below the surface to a soil profile depth called hrus arnold et al 1998 arcswat was used as the computer interface to develop the swat model in the study area the main input data for swat includes slope soil data and land use the national elevation dataset from the iranian ministry of energy have been used to develop the slope map with grid size 15 15 m the food and agriculture organization fao soil dataset and united state geological survey usgs global land use with 1 1 km raster layer were used to obtain soil and land use types in the study area respectively table 2 required meteorological inputs such as precipitation wind relative humidity maximum and minimum air temperatures and solar radiation from the meteorological organization of iran for four weather stations have been employed as model inputs fig 2 the spatial interpolation of the meteorological data was done via simple kriging sk method sk is a linear unbiased method to estimate the value of regionalized variables at an unsampled location based on the available data sun et al 2009 the swat model was built with the total of 32 sub basins and 188 hrus sub basin areas ranged from approximately 1 2 7 1 km2 2 3 2 groundwater simulation although swat is commonly used in simulating watershed hydrological systems it has limited capability in simulating gw systems in this study the latest three dimensional gw standard model modflow newton raphson formulation modflow was used to simulate gw flow modflow is a physically based and fully distributed model that solves the gw flow differential equation in 3d using the finite difference approach niswonger et al 2011 modflow was built and applied only for the aquifer subsection see fig 1 and gw modelling area was gridded to 183 171 cells with 300 m 300 m dimension in order to link swat and modflow the following packages were used nam input and output files of model dis boundary condition bas initial head condition rch gw recharge ghb general head boundary obs observation bores upw aquifer hydrodynamic parameters including k and s nwt solves the gw flow and wel pumping production bores 2 3 3 sw gw interaction simulation swat has limited capability in simulating the heterogeneity of the gw system and applying the distribution of k s and gw level sun et al 2016 nguyen and dietrich 2018 in this study the interaction between river and aquifer is simulated with the revised version of integrated swat modflow code developed by aliyari et al 2019 the swat modflow code used in this study was first developed by bailey et al 2016 by combining the updated swat 2012 model revision 591 with modflow this code spatially represents feedback fluxes within the surface and gw domains in this code swat simulates land surface processes crop growth in stream processes and soil zone processes whereas modflow simulates three dimensional gw flow and all associated sources and sinks e g gw recharge pumping discharge to tile drains and interaction with stream network both modelling codes are combined into a single fortran code as an executable this code pass deep percolation from hrus into the grid cells of modflow as gw recharge then it passes sw gw interaction fluxes from modflow into the stream channels in swat in order to simulate the interaction between sw gw the package of river in modflow is used this package is capable of calculating the volumetric flow of exchanged water qleak l3 t between river and aquifer based on darcy s equation as shown in eq 1 1 q l e a k k b e d l s t r p s t r h s t r h g w z b e d where kbed is the river bed hydraulic conductivity l t lstr is river length l pstr is the wetted perimeter of the river l hstr is river stage l hgw is the hydraulic head of gw l and zbed is the river bed thickness l if gw recharges the river i e gw hydraulic head hgw is above the river stage hstr qleak will be negative and if river recharges the aquifer qleak will be positive the required input for recharge package in modflow is the swat output of deep percolation from hrus data from swat is passed to modflow grids according to the percent area of the dhru disaggregated hru contained within the grid cell for use by the recharge package in modflow bailey et al 2016 in the version of swat modflow applied in this research modflow pumping cells are linked to swat hrus which allow for the application to basin scale agro urban watershed systems like shiraz this version is capable of simulating sw gw interactions as well as management schemes that transfer water between the domains in semi arid heavily managed agro urban large river basins fig 4 shows the river cells blue cells and the aquifer cells simulated with modflow green cells the simulation strategy is represented in fig 5 in the first step the required information is collected from different sources to setup the sw and gw model and then the two codes are joined using aliyari et al 2019 linkage codes in the second step the swat modflow model is calibrated using gwcal after calibrating swat modflow a comprehensive sa is conducted to identify the most important parameters 2 3 4 calibration of swat modflow calibration of swat is performed at two outlets associated with the two branches of rivers for the periods of 2003 2019 on a daily time step with three years for a warm up period that allows the model to stabilize for further simulations to perform successful calibration the sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 approach abbaspour et al 2015 with swat calibration uncertainty procedure swat cup was used the sufi 2 is a semi automated approach that makes the calibration process easier to carry out within the reliable time bounds semiromi and koch 2019 the calibration and validation of the model within swat cup was conducted considering 24 hydrologic key parameters based on detailed previous literature sources abbaspour 2015 each swat parameter was set to default lower and upper values table 3 as suggested by the swat expert group and the best fitted parameter values obtained from swat cup were incorporated into the database for stream discharge simulations swat model performance was evaluated previously using a range of different parameters including p factor r factor nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 nagelkerke 1991 and percentage of bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 root mean square method rmse was only used to evaluate modflow gw level was manually calibrated with gwcal and five different groups of k and s values were generated in the modeling area the model was manually calibrated based on gw level data from observation bores the gw monitoring network and pumping bore locations are shown in fig 6 the gwcal code developed in this research was used to calibrate gw parameters in swat modflow gwcal is written in visual basic for applications vba and linked to the swat modflow model to allow calibration of gw parameters in swat modflow the main process of the gwcal is represented in fig 7 and the gwcal interface is illustrated in fig 8 each time that gw parameters are calibrated in this interface the corresponding files in swat modflow are replaced with the new input data in the first step the results of the coupled swat modflow model are considered as initial values in various zones of the aquifer multiple polygons in the next step the calibrated values from polygons in arcgis format were changed to raster following that the raster files of k and s were converted to ascii file as modflow input upw package in swat modflow finally the model was run using the calibrated gw values after calibration the model output is represented in the gw head in each observation bore the gwcal code is capable of presenting the results of gw model performances from swat modflow after each run by comparing the model performance rmse from the last run with the previous run the user would be able to track changes in the model performance result and improve the result the gwcal main process commands are as below see fig 7 for further details 1 zone command when the user changes modflow parameters such as k and s in each zone in the main window gwcal creates corresponding k and s in that particular zone in the text format 2 raster command create raster data from new s and k in arcgis 3 ascii command convert raster data from new raster data to ascii 4 upw command set up upw package and create swat modflow input file in upw format from ascii data 5 run command run swat modflow automatically with new parameters 6 clear data command remove all previous run data from corresponding swat modflow folder 7 obs command import simulated data at observed location from modflow package 8 mon command convert daily data to monthly average as the observed values are monthly 9 results command 1 refresh the result and represent gw level in each bore against the previous run which is similar to what pmwin and gms do 2 calculate rmse and r2 for each observation bore as well as overall and represented simulated result of gw level as underestimated negative and overestimated positive for each bore red circles in fig 8 and whole aquifer as total and 3 create plots from simulated and observed gw level automatically over the simulation period the swat result is then extracted and represented alongside the modflow result to give the modeler a good understanding of whether the model performance is improving or not for both sw and gw 2 4 local sensitivity analysis sa sa determines the relative change in model output values given changes in model input values cacuci et al 2005 local sa of swat modflow was conducted by manually adjusting model parameter values to test their impact on model outputs of river runoff and gw level to determine the nature of different parameters contribution to the model result model parameters were manually changed and river runoff and gw level result changes were assessed this sa shows whether an increase in parameter values results in an increase or decrease in river runoff and gw level table 4 shows the parameters chosen for sa the key steps involved in the sa were 1 choosing parameters and output variables in order to conduct sa parameters related to sw unsaturated zone and saturated zone were selected as follows group 1 sw related parameters including cn lat time alpha bf slsubbsn group 2 unsaturated zone related parameters including sol crk sol awc sol bd group 3 saturated zone gw related parameters including gw delay s and k 1 determination of the value ranges the default values of each selected parameters were changed manually by 25 50 75 150 200 and 400 3 result 3 1 swat modflow performance for surface water the swat modflow results for runoff simulation at two points chenar sokhteh outlet 19 and chenar khoshk outlet 16 are presented in fig 9 table 5 shows that the swat modflow model performed well in simulating runoff in both outlets based on the guidelines in moriasi et al 2007 while the results generally show good agreement some differences are also evident e g the 2008 flood is underestimated the differences between simulated and observed values mostly occur at times of peak runoff and this is due to swat s inherent limitation in simulating floods based on yu et al 2018 this is due to the fact that swat is a long term yield model and daily time steps limit swat model application in event based flood simulation the calibrated swat modflow values are listed in table 6 it is interesting to note that the sub basin cn2 parameters which are related to sw are close to their original reference values in swat while parameters related to saturated zone and gw are not close to their original values in swat this highlights a limitation of swat in simulating the gw related components in the water cycle 3 2 swat modflow performance for groundwater as outlined in section 2 3 2 the modflow model was calibrated using observation bores water budget results and two stream gauges after linking modflow with swat the gw parameters were calibrated using gwcal the gw level calculated by swat modflow and observed gw level values in some piezometers are shown in fig 10 table 7 shows the swat modflow performance at gw bores table 8 outlines the swat modflow water balance result based on the swat modflow result a considerable percent 65 of estimated rainfall 225 5 mcm is evaporated of the remaining water 80 mcm around 30 24 7 mcm contributes to runoff and 70 58 3 mcm goes into gw system the initial and calibrated distribution maps for k and s all extracted from gwcal are presented in fig 11 these maps provide insight about the aquifer hydraulic parameters all around the model domain based on the result interaction between river and aquifer in the north of the shiraz basin is lower than it is in the south 3 3 local sensitivity analysis sa the results of the sa in group 1 parameters related to sw cn2 lat time alpha bf slsubbs group 2 parameters related to unsaturated zone sol crk sol awc sol bd and group 3 parameters related to saturated zone k s gw delay on river runoff and gw level are represented in fig 12 based on sa result k and s parameters had the most significant influence on the model outputs in gw level while cn2 sol bd and sol crk parameters had the biggest impact on river runoff alpha bf lat time gw delay and slsubbsn parameters have no significant effect in the river runoff and the gw level result of swat modflow the largest changes in river runoff were associated with changes in the cn2 parameter a cn2 decline of 25 resulted in a 15 change in river runoff and a cn2 increase of 400 resulted in 24 increase in runoff however the 25 400 cn2 changes will only change gw level up to 5 lat time from sw parameters had the least impact on the model result in both river runoff and gw level fig 12 slsbbsn and alphabf change by 25 and 400 had less than 2 effect on the model results parameters from group 2 related to unsaturated zone have more impact on river runoff than gw level based on fig 12 decrease and increase in sol bd result in less than 5 changes in gw level and 10 18 change in river runoff changes in parameters related to the saturated zone k and s had the most impact on gw level fig 12 the 25 decrease and 400 increase in k parameter resulted in 15 and 20 change in gw level respectively and up to 10 in river runoff the changes in s had similar impact on gw level the 25 decline and 400 increase will cause 10 and 15 changes in gw level and up to 7 on river runoff 4 discussion this research provides insights into the parameters that control runoff and gw level in a semi arid area these insights were gained via a comprehensive sa that explored the sensitivity of swat modflow sw and gw parameters the results of the sa deomstrate that gw related parameters hydraulic conductivity k and storage coefficients s have impact on gw level as well as runoff this shows the importance of considering gw in hydrological simulations moreover the results show except cn other parameters related to the surface water did not have a significant impact on gw level or runoff however curve number cn2 from sw parameters and moist bulk density sol bd and crack volume potential of soil sol crk from unsaturated zone had the most impact on runoff this is an important finding because in the standalone swat model unsaturated zone parameters have been found to have considerable impact on runoff e g abbaspour 2015 overall the results of the sa conducted in this research shows that cn2 from swat k and s from modflow have the largest impact on both runoff and gw level and control the model result in this study the calibration of swat and modflow parameters were conducted using gwcal which is a tool developed to facilitate and visualize the manual calibration of modflow parameters along with swatcup for swat parameters calibration after linking in summary the advantage of using the gwcal tool are i facilitation of the calibration process of modflow parameters ii improved efficiency of the process of swat modflow calibration and iii improvement in the performance of the swat modflow model in gw simulation the results demonstrate that the coupled swat modflow performance improves when gwcal is used the calibrated values of parameters related to sw gw interaction with gwcal were considerably different to their default values in standalone swat which represent an inherent limitation of swat in simulating gw based on this research r2 and nse for swat and rmse for modflow change considerably after linking the two together in swat modflow indeed calibrated values in the standalone swat and modflow models are totally different to the calibrated values in swat modflow the results are consistent with previous research such as the swat modflow application in north denmark in the odderbak basin molina navarro et al 2019 molina navarro et al 2019 also stated that swat modflow demonstrated better results compared to swat semiromi and koch 2019 calibrated swat and modflow separately and linked together for the gharehso basin in iran and again found that the linked version performed better than swat in isolation it should further be noted that coupled models like swat modflow have an increased number of parameters therefore applying coupled models like swat modflow requires the relevant input data and this will limit the application of swat modflow in areas that lack sw or gw data 5 conclusion sw gw interactions were studied for shiraz basin in iran using swat modflow the sw and gw parameters have been calibrated and validated using two variables of river runoff and gw level the swat modflow calibrated values are considerably different to standalone swat in the sw parameters and standalone modflow in the gw parameters this difference is the result of the exchange happening between sw and gw based on the result the calibration of sw parameters along with gw parameters in swat modflow significantly influenced the outputs of the model these results also demonstrate that the gwcal tool developed to enable the manual calibration of modflow and swat improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the calibration process which ultimately leads to improved performance of swat modflow this sensitivity analysis showed that curve number cn2 gw hydraulic conductivity k and storage coefficients s are the most influential parameters on gw level and runoff in the study catchment this highlights that it is critical to consider and account for gw when conducting regional scale hydrological simulations the results also demonstrate that properly calibrating both sw and gw components of the water cycle is critical the approach developed in this research could be applied in other basins future work should be conducted to determine if automatic calibration of gw parameters can further accelerate and or improve the calibration of swat modflow author statement tina jafari conceptualization methodology analysis

8236,long term sustainable water resources management requires comprehensive assessment of all water cycle components the combined calibration of surface water sw and groundwater gw parameters is one of the biggest challenges in simulating sw gw interactions swat modflow has improved our ability to simulate sw and gw interactions however there remain challenges associated with i understanding what parameters most influence model outputs and ii properly calibrating the gw related components of the water cycle as represented within swat modflow in this paper we applied swat modflow to the 1452 km2 shiraz catchment located in southwestern iran for the period 2003 2019 a comprehensive sensitivity analysis sa of both sw and gw parameters was conducted to determine what controls runoff and gw level in the study catchment the sa reveals that the curve number cn2 and gw hydraulic conductivity k parameters have the most significant impact on runoff and gw level simulation this work also presents a gw calibrator gwcal tool along with a demonstration of how gwcal improves the performance of swat modflow in the shiraz catchment as a result of the insights gained from the sa keywords surface water groundwater modeling swat modflow calibration sensitivity analysis regional modeling 1 introduction hydrological models have been used to evaluate water availability and determine appropriate water management policies for a long time these models are divided into three main categories i hydrological models which simulate runoff such as hbv bergstrom and forsman 1973 bergstrom 1992 sac sma burnash et al 1973 topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 vic liang et al 1994 hec hms william et al 1995 u s army corps of engineers 2016 swat arnold et al 1998 swim krysanova et al 2000 and watergap verzano 2009 ii hydrogeological models which simulate gw systems such as modflow harbaugh 2005 microfem diodato 2000 zoomq3d jackson 2001 svflux thode and fredlund 2013 fehm zyvoloski et al 2015 and iii physically based integrated surface subsurface hydrological models isshm which solve the governing surface and subsurface flow equations simultaneously furman 2008 popular isshm codes include integrated hydrology model inhm vanderkwaak 1999 modhms hydrogeologic inc 2003 parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 and hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 detailed studies of isshm internal flow dynamics are usually undertaken at scales of less than 0 5 km2 e g ebel and loague 2006 ebel and loague 2006 regional scale surface subsurface applications of isshms e g li et al 2008 are less common because of the large volume of data required to parameterize and evaluate the models sebben et al 2013 paniconi and putti 2015 reviewed developments of physically based hydrological models over the past 50 years maxwell et al 2014 has provided a comparison between different coupled hydrological models the soil water assessment tool swat is a semi distributed catchment scale sw model that can simulate surface runoff swat has been shown to perform well in streamflow simulation in a wide range of watersheds and has been tested in many regions conditions and time scales gassman et al 2007 although swat has been one of the most widely used hydrological models it has limited capability in simulating the gw system neitsch et al 2011 in swat gw is represented by a lumped module which is divided into shallow and deep gw both the shallow and the deep aquifer may contribute to streamflow as baseflow through a linear reservoir approximation ignoring distributed parameters such as hydraulic conductivity k and storage coefficients s kim et al 2008 this simplification of gw dynamics results in a mischaracterisation of gw resources especially when streamflow is strongly dependent on gw discharge gassman et al 2007 in fact swat compares shallow aquifer depth with a threshold to estimate the river recharge and it is not capable of considering the river bottom elevation and aquifer depth to properly simulate recharge gassman et al 2007 kim et al 2008 arnold et al 2013 gayathri et al 2015 aliyari et al 2019 modflow is a fully distributed three dimensional gw standard model which simulates gw flow modflow is the most popular gw model and has been successfully used in many global and regional studies harbaugh et al 2000 harbaugh 2005 jafari et al 2016a 2016b de graaf et al 2017 deb et al 2019b although modflow is the most popular gw model it has considerable limitations in simulating surface and subsurface processes of land atmosphere interactions agricultural management practices unsaturated zone flow uzf and surface runoff and does not directly account for hydrologic processes that occur in the root zone lachaal et al 2012 surinaidu et al 2014 consequently modflow lacks the ability to consider the difference in recharge rates as a result of changes in precipitation and infiltration from the river infiltration varies due to land use irrigation and agronomic practices implemented on the surface domain guzman et al 2015 several attempts have been made to address the above mentioned shortcomings by linking swat with modflow to simulate sw gw interactions e g kim et al 2008 guzman et al 2015 izady et al 2015 bailey et al 2016 deb et al 2019a 2019b abbas et al 2018 gao et al 2019 chunn et al 2019 molina navarro et al 2019 sith et al 2019 aliyari et al 2019 bailey et al 2016 developed a new coupled swat modflow model that geographically locates and integrates hydrologic response units hrus in swat sub basin with the spatially gridded modflow model this model has been tested against observed stream flow and water table elevation in a catchment area in the united state of america usa in swat modflow deep percolation from swat is passed to the grid cells of modflow as recharge and modflow calculated sw gw interaction fluxes are passed to the stream channels of swat hence the model accounts for two way interactions between sw and gw which enables better representation and understanding of the spatial temporal patterns of sw gw interactions bailey et al 2016 swat modflow has been applied to different catchments in the usa abbas et al 2018 gao et al 2019 canada chunn et al 2019 denmark molina navarro et al 2019 iran semiromi and koch 2019 and japan sith et al 2019 swatmod prep was introduced by bailey et al 2017 as a graphical user interface for coupled swat modflow and it was applied in little river experimental watershed georgia in order to apply swat modflow in large scale catchments aliyari et al 2019 improved the linkage between modflow pumping cells and swat hrus for irrigation this modification accounts for spatially variable recharge which in turn is affected by dynamic land use and land management practices when calibrating swat modflow it is essential to know which gw parameters could impact runoff simulation results from swat and which sw parameters could impact gw level results from modflow previous research has shown that a sensitivity analysis sa is required to determine which parameters control runoff and gw level and how sw and gw parameters impact each other guo and su 2019 jiang et al 2018 in order to obtain meaningful results from the sa a well calibrated swat modflow model is required however it is challenging especially with manual calibration to obtain optimal parameter values when concurrently simulating sw and gw after linking in swat modflow the ultimate aim of this research is to obtain insights about what controls runoff and gw level in a semi arid area this is done by conducting a comprehensive sa to determine the effect of both swat parameters and modflow parameters on the results of the swat modflow simulation a new gw calibrator tool gwcal is developed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the manual calibration process and to obtain more realistic results from swat modflow and the sa gwcal is applied to the latest version of swat modflow for a catchment in shiraz iran where sw gw interaction is high to demonstrate how gwcal improves the efficiency effectiveness of the calibration process 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 geography and climate the shiraz watershed covers an area of 1452 km2 in southwestern iran fig 1 the elevation in shiraz catchment ranges from 1436 to 2991 m above mean sea level with an average of 1830 m fig 1 the shiraz catchment has mountains covering approximately 800 km2 of the total catchment area annual long term average temperature in the study area is 17 9⁰c with 2550 mm average potential evaporation and 361 5 mm annual long term average precipitation in this area precipitation mainly occurs during december to march fars regional water authority 2015 2 1 2 hydrology the khoshk river is the major stream in shiraz catchment originating in the northwest of the basin it crosses the alluvial aquifer and shiraz city discharges into mahrloo lake the river discharge is heavily affected by the wet season stream gauges are located at the lower end of azam and khoshk sub watershed eini et al 2019 fig 2 shows the river network and location of sub basins stream gauges and weather stations in the study area the land cover in the shiraz catchment is dominated by intensive irrigated agriculture and other land use includes wetland pasture and urban areas fig 3 the main crops include spring and winter wheat almond and pomegranate gardens fars regional water authority 2015 soils are heterogeneous and erosive with fine sandy loam in the eastern part fine sandy loams and loamy soils in the north central and south central portions of the watershed and silt loams in the western portion fars regional water authority 2015 2 1 3 hydrogeology the shiraz aquifer is mainly an unconfined aquifer constituted of fine sandy clay and loamy soils in the north west and central portions of the watershed shiraz aquifer average thickness is approximately 30 m based on results of pumping tests the transmissivity range varies between 100 to 200 m2 d whereas the average specific yield is around 0 05 unit in the shiraz aquifer gw depth varies from between 3 35 metres below ground level mbgl the maximum gw depth is in west and north of aquifer where gw depth level is 35 m the minimum gw depth is towards the east and south part of the aquifer where gw depth reaches to less than 3 m depth general gw flow direction is from the north west toward the south east fars regional water authority 2015 available information from groundwater and stream observation networks indicate there is interaction between the aquifer and river mainly in the south east part of aquifer fars regional water authority 2016 geologically the study area is comprised of stratigraphic units of precambrian rocks to quaternary deposits and tectonically northern altitudes of shiraz plain are placed in the zagros tectonic zone moreover the tectonic structure of the aquifer including folds and faults are mainly extended from north to south and from north west to south east this aquifer is considered as the main source of water for irrigation domestic and public supply because of streamflow depletion and reduced base flow according to the latest water budget reports in 2019 1802 production bores are extracting 189 million cubic meter mcm of water from the aquifer in addition 122 drinking water 48 industrial usage and 1632 irrigation pumping bores are placed on agricultural land 2 2 data collection in order to apply the swat modflow model in the study area a range of meteorological hydrological and hydrogeological data were collected and interpreted from various sources table 1 rainfall temperature and evaporation data was collected from four stations in the catchment fig 2 data from two runoff gauges of khosk river and azam river have been used rainfall data was available for the entire simulation period of 2003 2019 iran water resources management 2020 gw level data were available from an existing network of gw monitoring bores in the study area gw is used for agriculture potable and industrial use fars regional water authority 2015 2 3 model setup 2 3 1 surface water simulation to simulate sw system in the study area swat was used swat was built for the entire watershed shown in fig 2 swat simulation is based on conceptual units of homogeneous land use management slope and soil characteristics that extend below the surface to a soil profile depth called hrus arnold et al 1998 arcswat was used as the computer interface to develop the swat model in the study area the main input data for swat includes slope soil data and land use the national elevation dataset from the iranian ministry of energy have been used to develop the slope map with grid size 15 15 m the food and agriculture organization fao soil dataset and united state geological survey usgs global land use with 1 1 km raster layer were used to obtain soil and land use types in the study area respectively table 2 required meteorological inputs such as precipitation wind relative humidity maximum and minimum air temperatures and solar radiation from the meteorological organization of iran for four weather stations have been employed as model inputs fig 2 the spatial interpolation of the meteorological data was done via simple kriging sk method sk is a linear unbiased method to estimate the value of regionalized variables at an unsampled location based on the available data sun et al 2009 the swat model was built with the total of 32 sub basins and 188 hrus sub basin areas ranged from approximately 1 2 7 1 km2 2 3 2 groundwater simulation although swat is commonly used in simulating watershed hydrological systems it has limited capability in simulating gw systems in this study the latest three dimensional gw standard model modflow newton raphson formulation modflow was used to simulate gw flow modflow is a physically based and fully distributed model that solves the gw flow differential equation in 3d using the finite difference approach niswonger et al 2011 modflow was built and applied only for the aquifer subsection see fig 1 and gw modelling area was gridded to 183 171 cells with 300 m 300 m dimension in order to link swat and modflow the following packages were used nam input and output files of model dis boundary condition bas initial head condition rch gw recharge ghb general head boundary obs observation bores upw aquifer hydrodynamic parameters including k and s nwt solves the gw flow and wel pumping production bores 2 3 3 sw gw interaction simulation swat has limited capability in simulating the heterogeneity of the gw system and applying the distribution of k s and gw level sun et al 2016 nguyen and dietrich 2018 in this study the interaction between river and aquifer is simulated with the revised version of integrated swat modflow code developed by aliyari et al 2019 the swat modflow code used in this study was first developed by bailey et al 2016 by combining the updated swat 2012 model revision 591 with modflow this code spatially represents feedback fluxes within the surface and gw domains in this code swat simulates land surface processes crop growth in stream processes and soil zone processes whereas modflow simulates three dimensional gw flow and all associated sources and sinks e g gw recharge pumping discharge to tile drains and interaction with stream network both modelling codes are combined into a single fortran code as an executable this code pass deep percolation from hrus into the grid cells of modflow as gw recharge then it passes sw gw interaction fluxes from modflow into the stream channels in swat in order to simulate the interaction between sw gw the package of river in modflow is used this package is capable of calculating the volumetric flow of exchanged water qleak l3 t between river and aquifer based on darcy s equation as shown in eq 1 1 q l e a k k b e d l s t r p s t r h s t r h g w z b e d where kbed is the river bed hydraulic conductivity l t lstr is river length l pstr is the wetted perimeter of the river l hstr is river stage l hgw is the hydraulic head of gw l and zbed is the river bed thickness l if gw recharges the river i e gw hydraulic head hgw is above the river stage hstr qleak will be negative and if river recharges the aquifer qleak will be positive the required input for recharge package in modflow is the swat output of deep percolation from hrus data from swat is passed to modflow grids according to the percent area of the dhru disaggregated hru contained within the grid cell for use by the recharge package in modflow bailey et al 2016 in the version of swat modflow applied in this research modflow pumping cells are linked to swat hrus which allow for the application to basin scale agro urban watershed systems like shiraz this version is capable of simulating sw gw interactions as well as management schemes that transfer water between the domains in semi arid heavily managed agro urban large river basins fig 4 shows the river cells blue cells and the aquifer cells simulated with modflow green cells the simulation strategy is represented in fig 5 in the first step the required information is collected from different sources to setup the sw and gw model and then the two codes are joined using aliyari et al 2019 linkage codes in the second step the swat modflow model is calibrated using gwcal after calibrating swat modflow a comprehensive sa is conducted to identify the most important parameters 2 3 4 calibration of swat modflow calibration of swat is performed at two outlets associated with the two branches of rivers for the periods of 2003 2019 on a daily time step with three years for a warm up period that allows the model to stabilize for further simulations to perform successful calibration the sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 approach abbaspour et al 2015 with swat calibration uncertainty procedure swat cup was used the sufi 2 is a semi automated approach that makes the calibration process easier to carry out within the reliable time bounds semiromi and koch 2019 the calibration and validation of the model within swat cup was conducted considering 24 hydrologic key parameters based on detailed previous literature sources abbaspour 2015 each swat parameter was set to default lower and upper values table 3 as suggested by the swat expert group and the best fitted parameter values obtained from swat cup were incorporated into the database for stream discharge simulations swat model performance was evaluated previously using a range of different parameters including p factor r factor nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient of determination r2 nagelkerke 1991 and percentage of bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 root mean square method rmse was only used to evaluate modflow gw level was manually calibrated with gwcal and five different groups of k and s values were generated in the modeling area the model was manually calibrated based on gw level data from observation bores the gw monitoring network and pumping bore locations are shown in fig 6 the gwcal code developed in this research was used to calibrate gw parameters in swat modflow gwcal is written in visual basic for applications vba and linked to the swat modflow model to allow calibration of gw parameters in swat modflow the main process of the gwcal is represented in fig 7 and the gwcal interface is illustrated in fig 8 each time that gw parameters are calibrated in this interface the corresponding files in swat modflow are replaced with the new input data in the first step the results of the coupled swat modflow model are considered as initial values in various zones of the aquifer multiple polygons in the next step the calibrated values from polygons in arcgis format were changed to raster following that the raster files of k and s were converted to ascii file as modflow input upw package in swat modflow finally the model was run using the calibrated gw values after calibration the model output is represented in the gw head in each observation bore the gwcal code is capable of presenting the results of gw model performances from swat modflow after each run by comparing the model performance rmse from the last run with the previous run the user would be able to track changes in the model performance result and improve the result the gwcal main process commands are as below see fig 7 for further details 1 zone command when the user changes modflow parameters such as k and s in each zone in the main window gwcal creates corresponding k and s in that particular zone in the text format 2 raster command create raster data from new s and k in arcgis 3 ascii command convert raster data from new raster data to ascii 4 upw command set up upw package and create swat modflow input file in upw format from ascii data 5 run command run swat modflow automatically with new parameters 6 clear data command remove all previous run data from corresponding swat modflow folder 7 obs command import simulated data at observed location from modflow package 8 mon command convert daily data to monthly average as the observed values are monthly 9 results command 1 refresh the result and represent gw level in each bore against the previous run which is similar to what pmwin and gms do 2 calculate rmse and r2 for each observation bore as well as overall and represented simulated result of gw level as underestimated negative and overestimated positive for each bore red circles in fig 8 and whole aquifer as total and 3 create plots from simulated and observed gw level automatically over the simulation period the swat result is then extracted and represented alongside the modflow result to give the modeler a good understanding of whether the model performance is improving or not for both sw and gw 2 4 local sensitivity analysis sa sa determines the relative change in model output values given changes in model input values cacuci et al 2005 local sa of swat modflow was conducted by manually adjusting model parameter values to test their impact on model outputs of river runoff and gw level to determine the nature of different parameters contribution to the model result model parameters were manually changed and river runoff and gw level result changes were assessed this sa shows whether an increase in parameter values results in an increase or decrease in river runoff and gw level table 4 shows the parameters chosen for sa the key steps involved in the sa were 1 choosing parameters and output variables in order to conduct sa parameters related to sw unsaturated zone and saturated zone were selected as follows group 1 sw related parameters including cn lat time alpha bf slsubbsn group 2 unsaturated zone related parameters including sol crk sol awc sol bd group 3 saturated zone gw related parameters including gw delay s and k 1 determination of the value ranges the default values of each selected parameters were changed manually by 25 50 75 150 200 and 400 3 result 3 1 swat modflow performance for surface water the swat modflow results for runoff simulation at two points chenar sokhteh outlet 19 and chenar khoshk outlet 16 are presented in fig 9 table 5 shows that the swat modflow model performed well in simulating runoff in both outlets based on the guidelines in moriasi et al 2007 while the results generally show good agreement some differences are also evident e g the 2008 flood is underestimated the differences between simulated and observed values mostly occur at times of peak runoff and this is due to swat s inherent limitation in simulating floods based on yu et al 2018 this is due to the fact that swat is a long term yield model and daily time steps limit swat model application in event based flood simulation the calibrated swat modflow values are listed in table 6 it is interesting to note that the sub basin cn2 parameters which are related to sw are close to their original reference values in swat while parameters related to saturated zone and gw are not close to their original values in swat this highlights a limitation of swat in simulating the gw related components in the water cycle 3 2 swat modflow performance for groundwater as outlined in section 2 3 2 the modflow model was calibrated using observation bores water budget results and two stream gauges after linking modflow with swat the gw parameters were calibrated using gwcal the gw level calculated by swat modflow and observed gw level values in some piezometers are shown in fig 10 table 7 shows the swat modflow performance at gw bores table 8 outlines the swat modflow water balance result based on the swat modflow result a considerable percent 65 of estimated rainfall 225 5 mcm is evaporated of the remaining water 80 mcm around 30 24 7 mcm contributes to runoff and 70 58 3 mcm goes into gw system the initial and calibrated distribution maps for k and s all extracted from gwcal are presented in fig 11 these maps provide insight about the aquifer hydraulic parameters all around the model domain based on the result interaction between river and aquifer in the north of the shiraz basin is lower than it is in the south 3 3 local sensitivity analysis sa the results of the sa in group 1 parameters related to sw cn2 lat time alpha bf slsubbs group 2 parameters related to unsaturated zone sol crk sol awc sol bd and group 3 parameters related to saturated zone k s gw delay on river runoff and gw level are represented in fig 12 based on sa result k and s parameters had the most significant influence on the model outputs in gw level while cn2 sol bd and sol crk parameters had the biggest impact on river runoff alpha bf lat time gw delay and slsubbsn parameters have no significant effect in the river runoff and the gw level result of swat modflow the largest changes in river runoff were associated with changes in the cn2 parameter a cn2 decline of 25 resulted in a 15 change in river runoff and a cn2 increase of 400 resulted in 24 increase in runoff however the 25 400 cn2 changes will only change gw level up to 5 lat time from sw parameters had the least impact on the model result in both river runoff and gw level fig 12 slsbbsn and alphabf change by 25 and 400 had less than 2 effect on the model results parameters from group 2 related to unsaturated zone have more impact on river runoff than gw level based on fig 12 decrease and increase in sol bd result in less than 5 changes in gw level and 10 18 change in river runoff changes in parameters related to the saturated zone k and s had the most impact on gw level fig 12 the 25 decrease and 400 increase in k parameter resulted in 15 and 20 change in gw level respectively and up to 10 in river runoff the changes in s had similar impact on gw level the 25 decline and 400 increase will cause 10 and 15 changes in gw level and up to 7 on river runoff 4 discussion this research provides insights into the parameters that control runoff and gw level in a semi arid area these insights were gained via a comprehensive sa that explored the sensitivity of swat modflow sw and gw parameters the results of the sa deomstrate that gw related parameters hydraulic conductivity k and storage coefficients s have impact on gw level as well as runoff this shows the importance of considering gw in hydrological simulations moreover the results show except cn other parameters related to the surface water did not have a significant impact on gw level or runoff however curve number cn2 from sw parameters and moist bulk density sol bd and crack volume potential of soil sol crk from unsaturated zone had the most impact on runoff this is an important finding because in the standalone swat model unsaturated zone parameters have been found to have considerable impact on runoff e g abbaspour 2015 overall the results of the sa conducted in this research shows that cn2 from swat k and s from modflow have the largest impact on both runoff and gw level and control the model result in this study the calibration of swat and modflow parameters were conducted using gwcal which is a tool developed to facilitate and visualize the manual calibration of modflow parameters along with swatcup for swat parameters calibration after linking in summary the advantage of using the gwcal tool are i facilitation of the calibration process of modflow parameters ii improved efficiency of the process of swat modflow calibration and iii improvement in the performance of the swat modflow model in gw simulation the results demonstrate that the coupled swat modflow performance improves when gwcal is used the calibrated values of parameters related to sw gw interaction with gwcal were considerably different to their default values in standalone swat which represent an inherent limitation of swat in simulating gw based on this research r2 and nse for swat and rmse for modflow change considerably after linking the two together in swat modflow indeed calibrated values in the standalone swat and modflow models are totally different to the calibrated values in swat modflow the results are consistent with previous research such as the swat modflow application in north denmark in the odderbak basin molina navarro et al 2019 molina navarro et al 2019 also stated that swat modflow demonstrated better results compared to swat semiromi and koch 2019 calibrated swat and modflow separately and linked together for the gharehso basin in iran and again found that the linked version performed better than swat in isolation it should further be noted that coupled models like swat modflow have an increased number of parameters therefore applying coupled models like swat modflow requires the relevant input data and this will limit the application of swat modflow in areas that lack sw or gw data 5 conclusion sw gw interactions were studied for shiraz basin in iran using swat modflow the sw and gw parameters have been calibrated and validated using two variables of river runoff and gw level the swat modflow calibrated values are considerably different to standalone swat in the sw parameters and standalone modflow in the gw parameters this difference is the result of the exchange happening between sw and gw based on the result the calibration of sw parameters along with gw parameters in swat modflow significantly influenced the outputs of the model these results also demonstrate that the gwcal tool developed to enable the manual calibration of modflow and swat improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the calibration process which ultimately leads to improved performance of swat modflow this sensitivity analysis showed that curve number cn2 gw hydraulic conductivity k and storage coefficients s are the most influential parameters on gw level and runoff in the study catchment this highlights that it is critical to consider and account for gw when conducting regional scale hydrological simulations the results also demonstrate that properly calibrating both sw and gw components of the water cycle is critical the approach developed in this research could be applied in other basins future work should be conducted to determine if automatic calibration of gw parameters can further accelerate and or improve the calibration of swat modflow author statement tina jafari conceptualization methodology analysis

8237,study region the ethiopian rift valley lakes basin is found in the main ethiopian rift valley system study focus understanding the hydrological impact of el niño southern oscillation enso is of a paramount importance for society since it substantially affects the environmental and socio economic conditions the relation between enso indicators soi mei and niño3 4 and streamflow magnitude was statistically evaluated with partial correlation cross correlation extreme streamflow indices and streamflow deficits to provide empirical evidence on how enso phases la niña and el niño affect streamflow variability trends of streamflow and enso indicators were tested using the non parametric mann kendall test new hydrological insights for the region our findings indicate that the partial correlation between the catchment area and enso effect on streamflow were not statistically significant at p 0 05 after removing the south north gradient the direction of the enso effect is spatially inconsistent since el niño la niña causes positive deviation in some catchments and negative deviation for other catchments though statistically insignificant reduced flow is detected for many catchments during el niño years for most catchment the extreme high flow has a larger magnitude during la niña than el niño whereas the extreme low flow has a larger magnitude during el niño than la niña years overall the relationship between enso and streamflow of the study area is found spatially inconsistent and statistically insignificant for most catchments keywords enso el niño la niña hydrology streamflow variability rift valley lakes basin 1 introduction el niño southern oscillation enso is a global climate phenomenon that has profound influence on various natural processes ward et al 2014 marti et al 2010 it causes a great socio economic and environmental impact by affecting hydro climatic conditions these impacts are mostly associated to drought and flooding events during opposite enso phases known as el niño warm phase and la niña cold phase at different geographic locations with considerable negative consequences gleick 2014 zaroug et al 2014 liu et al 2014 siderius et al 2018 foley et al 2002 broṅṅimann 2007 two of the strongest ever recorded el niño years are in 1982 83 and 2015 16 nobre et al 2019 the 1982 83 enso event caused extremely dry conditions drought that claimed millions of lives worldwide and loss of more than 8 billion dollars in ethiopia goddard and dilley 2005 ryu et al 2010 camilloni and barros 2003 recently around 24 million people in the horn of africa and more than 9 7 million people in ethiopia faced food shortage due to el niño induced droughts in 2015 16 nobre et al 2019 generally enso effects on rainfall can have the same direction of signal within a region or the signal shows at least some regional gradient chiew and mcmahon 2002 however this is not always true and complicated due to the nonlinearity of climate response as shown by hoerling et al 1997 in locations where el niño is associated with higher than usual rainfall values la niña is very often but not always associated with lower than usual rainfall values davey et al 2014 this is due to synoptic or large scale circulation of enso rainfall teleconnection at regional scale overall el niño events mainly decrease while la niña events increase the precipitation streamflow over china ouyang et al 2014 lee and julien 2017 reported that streamflow deficit during autumn season in el niño period and streamflow excess during la niña period in south korea in contrast kalaycı et al 2004 found wetter conditions during el niño events and drier conditions during la niña events over turkey similarly results obtained for the south eastern united states show el niño years tend to be wet and la niña years tend to be dry wang and asefa 2017 in ethiopia el niño phases of enso are generally associated with lower streamflow and la niña phases are associated with higher streamflow although this is not always the case zaroug et al 2014 abtew et al 2009 extremely dry years in blue nile of ethiopia are most likely associated with el niño events while extremely wet years are associated with la niña events abtew et al 2009 this is also supported by zaroug et al 2014 who reported that 83 of the el niño events in blue nile resulted in drought whereas 67 of the occurrence of extreme flood events were caused when the el niño event is followed by the la niña event this was confirmed by other authors amarasekera et al 1997 wang and eltahir 1999 siam and eltahir 2017 the relationships between enso and streamflow are not necessarily consistent at fine spatial scales such as among individual watersheds within the same region rice and emanuel 2017 although strong and regionally consistent enso streamflow teleconnection is identified for other regions weaker signals are identified in some parts of africa and north america chiew and mcmahon 2002 the regional inconsistency of enso impact on streamflow can be explained by two factors first enso effects are only one of the many aspects of the climate system affecting the rainfall amount and distribution e g kiem and verdon kidd 2009 gleixner et al 2017 worku and sahile 2018 wooldridge et al 2001 showed that the strength of the enso rainfall relation can even vary within relatively small catchment of 1300 km2 indicating that topographic controls may affect enso influences on rainfall totals and intensities curry and zwiers 2018 found only 16 of the variance in annual streamflow peaks was explained by enso second enso signals are propagated through watersheds as rainfall is converted to streamflow as a result the streamflow response to enso signal is often lagged by few months as compared to the timing of the precipitation response to the signal chiew et al 1998 sharda et al 2012 this phase lag can be mainly caused by the storage characteristics hydrological memory of the catchments which can modulate the enso impacts chen and kumar 2002 more specifically rice and emanuel 2017 reported that the watershed characteristics like precipitation timing and phase forest cover and interactions between topography and geomorphology have significant influence on the relationship between streamflow and enso their study illustrated how and why hydrologic response to enso differs among watersheds within a region the magnitude of enso effects on extreme high and low streamflow can be substantial however most of the previous investigations focused only on the effects of enso on mean streamflow of rivers with only researchers addressed effects on extreme flows zhang et al 2007 pyrce 2004 misir et al 2013 ruigar and golian 2015 however enso effects can be greater on peak flows than on streamflow volumes ward et al 2010 and the effects on low and peak flows can be highly variable in space mosley 2000 studies that investigated factors affecting the direction and magnitude of enso effects are limited the effect of enso events on streamflow may depend on catchment size keener et al 2010 dettinger et al 2004 reported clear influence of enso on streamflow of small catchment whereas mckerchar and pearson 1994 reported stronger relationship between the two variables in larger catchments than smaller ones further study is required to enhance our understanding about the catchment size influence on the linkage between streamflow variability and enso most previous studies focused on the relationship between enso and the rainfall in different parts of ethiopia taye et al 2020 eden et al 2014 gleixner et al 2017 however studies that address how catchment characteristics influence the enso streamflow relation are limited and very rare hence this study may provide the basic information on the linkage between enso and streamflow in varying catchment sizes for ethiopia case studies of enso influences on streamflow are mostly limited to the blue nile river basin additional studies are required to thoroughly understand and quantify the spatio temporal dependency of enso interlink with streamflow in the country in this study we aim to provide evidence on the link between enso and streamflow characteristics at various catchment sizes in the ethiopian rift valley lakes basin which will be an addition to the limited scientific literature on the topic findings of enso influence on streamflow may contribute to water resources management particularly on extreme events risk management and adaptation strategies the findings can be useful for reservoir operation irrigation management and flood and drought management 2 study area rift valley lakes basin which has a drainage area of 53 000 km2 is among the twelve river basins in ethiopia it is found in the main ethiopian rift valley system located in the southern part of the country fig 1 the basin is located between 36 65 39 41 e longitude and 4 37 8 43 n latitude it consists of four main sub basins ziway shala hawassa abaya chamo and chew bahir for this study we selected eleven catchments with long term streamflow measurements namely dedeba meki and katar catchments from ziway shala sub basin tikurwuha catchment from hawassa sub basin and aposto kola bedessa hare kulfo lake abaya and billate from abaya chamo sub basin fig 1 the study area consists of eight lakes and diverse topographic features the terrain elevation of the basin ranges between 480 m a s l at the lower rift floor to 4112 m a s l at the top of mountains the climate of the basin ranges from semi arid at the lower rift floor to humid and temperate at high mountains its annual average rainfall ranges from 492 mm to 2582 mm with the total mean of 1079 mm jica 2012 the basin receives bimodal rainfall pattern the main rains occur in june to october whereas the small rains occur from march to may but the seasons vary in the sub basins the mean annual minimum and maximum temperature of the basin range between 12 3 c 27 1 c the mean temperature of the basin is 19 6 c the basin s climate indicates high variability in temperature and rainfall characteristics which affect water resources in terms of quantity and distribution table 1 such variability has great consequence in the basin as it is characterised by high population growth rapid industrial and urban expansion excessive water abstraction siltation and sedimentation of lakes and environmental degradation 3 data sets and methods 3 1 data sets streamflow data for eighteen gauging stations was collected from the ministry of water irrigation and energy mowie of ethiopia for the study area however data from only eleven of these gauging stations was used for further analysis since their data is relatively complete homogeneous and covers long period in average 25 years table 1 here stations that contain only missed data for 2 1 billate to 14 tikurwuha of the time are considered to provide complete time series data whereas stations that contain missed data for 15 of the time are excluded from further analysis in this study the stations that are selected for further analysis are aposto kola bedessa lake abaya station near to arba minchi hare near to arba minchi kulfo at sikela billate at alaba kulito dedeba near to kuyera tikurwuha at hawassa bridge meki and katar fig 1 table 1 water levels at all stations are measured by using staff gauge the staff gauge is graduated in units of centimeter cm with long markers every 10 cm and short markers every 1 cm water level is recorded manually twice per day at 6 00 am and 6 00 pm the two measurements are averaged to obtain the daily average water level this water level is converted to discharge data using stage discharge relationship rating curve of the site by the responsible government body at the ministry of water irrigation and energy of ethiopia in addition to this data enso indicators soi niño3 4 and mei data were obtained from the climate research unit cru noaa www cpc ncep noaa gov data indices and climate diagnostics center http www cdc noaa gov kew mei to investigate the enso interlink with streamflow of the basin 3 2 enso indicators enso events can be defined by indices that indicate the warmth and coolness of equatorial pacific sea surface temperature ssts and the gradient in sea level pressure slp across the differences at tropical pacific ocean gutierrez and dracup 2001 hanley et al 2003 we selected three indices among many indices used in literature to define enso events these are the southern oscillation index soi niño3 4 ssts and multivariate enso index mei the three indices have opposite estimation valuing system for different phases of enso i e the sst anomalies are positive and soi is negative during el niño events these indices received wide application in climate studies in ethiopia abtew et al 2009 seleshi and zanke 2004 and outside ethiopia hanley et al 2003 kennedy et al 2009 lü et al 2011 however there is no consensus in the selection of enso indices in literature to evaluate their influence on hydro climatic variables hanley et al 2003 soi is a measure of the difference in mean sea level air pressure at tahiti in the southeastern pacific and darwin in the northern australia to the west of the pacific ocean power and kociuba 2011 soi values averaged over five consecutive months that are greater or equal to 0 5 indicate a la niña episode the values less than or equal to 0 5 indicate an el niño episode and the values between 0 5 and 0 5 indicate normal years ropelewski and halpert 1996 kiem and franks 2001 niño3 4 index measures the area averaged sea surface temperature over the equatorial pacific ocean 5 n 5 s and 170 120 w and is an appropriate proxy for pacific mean equatorial sst the values of niño3 4 index averaged over three consecutive months which are less than or equal to 0 5 indicate la niña phase whereas values greater or equal to 0 5 indicate el niño phase neutral phase is when the three months average niño3 4 index is in between 0 5 and 0 5 c chen and lee 2016 mei is computed based on the six different parameters which are sea level pressure sea surface temperature zonal and meridional component of surface wind surface air temperature and total cloudiness fraction of the sky it has advantages over the two indices soi and niño3 4 since it considers slp and ssts measures the values of mei index averaged over two consecutive months which are less than or equal to 0 5 indicate la nina phase whereas the value greater than or equal to 0 5 indicate the el nino phases of enso and the value in between 0 5 and 0 5 is neutral period 3 3 homogeneity test checking the quality of streamflow data is a prerequisite for using these data for further hydrological analysis we conducted homogeneity test on streamflow data of eleven catchments by using buishand method buishand 1982 before evaluating the streamflow enso linkage in the basin inhomogeneity in the hydro climate data is due to influence from non climate factors such as changes in gauging station location instrumentation and time of the measurement guentchev et al 2010 among the eleven stations the four gauging stations aposto billate tikurwuha and kulfo have inhomogeneous data since the homogeneity test result shows break points or inconsistency the time series of these data was divided into two i e before and after the breaking point in this study the streamflow data of the four catchments which is collected before the break points or estimated change points were used for evaluation of the streamflow enso linkage whereas the data for the period after the change point were not used at all for further analysis for example billate has streamflow data from 1971 to 2007 but the break point or estimated change point is 2004 thus we considered the data from 1971 to 2004 for trend analysis while ignoring the 2005 2007 data table 1 shows the data statistics for the time period over which the data of the eleven stations passed the homogeneity test 3 4 methods of analysis a set of statistics was used to evaluate the relationship between enso indicators and streamflow these statistics include simple and cross correlation with a set of lag times partial correlation extreme streamflow values q95 and q5 and streamflow deficit analysis for different enso phases moreover wilcoxon rank sum test was used to determine whether the average streamflow which was recorded during la niña period was statistically different from the average streamflow during el niño periods at α 0 05 significance level and also the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test the statistical significance of the deviation of el niño and la niña period streamflow record to those of normal period on seasonal and annual basis the correlation between streamflow and enso indices soi and niño3 4 was estimated at different timescales monthly seasonal and annual the analysis was done for three local seasons bega ndjf representing the dry season belg mam representing small rains and kiremt jjaso representing main rains where the abbreviations within the open brackets consist of the first letter of respective months the daily time series of each season was analyzed to estimate magnitudes of the mean and extreme seasonal streamflow for each analysis year seasonal mean streamflow and extreme streamflow values were estimated from the seasonal time series over the analysis period spearman s formula was used to calculate correlation between seasonal streamflow and enso indices 1 ρ 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where ρ spearman s rank correlation coefficient di the difference between the two ranks of each observation and n number of observations cross correlations for multiple lag times were estimated for monthly streamflow amount and soi and monthly streamflow amount and niño3 4 values for various lag times the lag time extends from lag 0 no lag to lag 12 12 months lag this helps to understand the time difference between occurrence of enso phase and the time at which impacts on the streamflow is detected the partial correlation was used to analyze the relation between catchment area and enso effect by removing the latitude or north south gradient effect enso effect was represented by the deviation of streamflow of the el niño and la niña periods from that of the normal period the equation for the partiarl correlation coefficient reads as follows 2 r y x w r x y r x w r y w 1 r x w 2 1 r y w 2 where r x y is the correlation coefficients between enso x variable and catchment area y variable r x w represents the correlation coefficient between enso and the controlling variable w here latitude and r y w refers to the correlation between catchment area and the controlling variable respectively we defined low medium and high flows as the streamflow that has 95 50 and 5 q95 q50 q5 probability of exceedance respectively pyrce 2004 institute of hydrology 1980 these flow indices provide information relevant to streamflow ecology and help to understand the major climate or non climatic impacts that influence the extreme and normal conditions the available data length ranges from 21 years at tikurwuha to 44 years at lake abaya station table 1 the data from the different stations covers different length of observation period for instance the existing data for the billate station cover the period from 1971 to 2004 whereas that for hare covers 1980 2007 q95 is commonly used as an indicator for low flow the minimum flow to protect the river system and to maintain the natural monthly seasonal variations zelenhasic and salvai 1987 as such we estimated the streamflow deficit by specifying q95 as the threshold value the streamflow magnitude below this threshold value was assumed to indicate streamflow deficit and hence drought the deficit was used here to determine the magnitude duration and severity of drought during enso episodes normal el niño and la niña trends of streamflow at eleven gauging stations and the enso indicators soi niño3 4 and mei was detected by using the non parametric mann kendall test on monthly seasonal and annual basis hu et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 this help to detect the trend association between the streamflow data and enso indicators in the basin all gauging stations and enso indicators data covered from 1980 to 2004 was used to trend analysis 4 results 4 1 streamflow characteristics the streamflow hydrograph of the study area has two maxima with a major peak in between august and october and a minor peak in may fig 2 all rivers are perennials as their streamflow is always above zero in general the inter annual variability of streamflow is very high at most of the gauged catchments here we provide examples for three catchments which are found in the gidabo sub basin for detail discussion aposto station records show that the study area experienced major wet years in 1977 1983 and 1996 fig 3 the driest years were 1999 2002 and 2003 the streamflow declined in the period from 1987 to 1991 and the flow recovered in the following years however the largest decline in streamflow was observed in early 2000s and the flow has not fully recovered afterwards annual variation of the streamflow at kola and bedessa catchment is slightly like that of aposto however the difference between the flow of the two stations kola and bedessa and aposto has significantly reduced since early 2000s the main causes for the decline in flow at aposto since 2000s may be due to irrigation expansion like daggy irrigation project which irrigates 1000 ha of land coffee processing factories flour factories and plantation of exotic tree species which consumes high amount of water like eucalyptus tree personal communication with experts this was supported by the homogeneity test of streamflow data of aposto the aposto streamflow data is inhomogeneous which shows break points in 1998 that coincides with irrigation infrastructure expansion in the catchment 4 2 enso effect on seasonal and annual mean flows the monthly stream flows were divided in to three periods that coincide with the three phases of enso these are el niño la niña and normal periods the study area experienced 11 el niño years 13 la niña years and 21 normal years table 2 the highest flow recorded years are 1983 1988 1996 and 1998 whereas the lowest flow recorded years in most catchments are 1984 1986 and 1991 in general all extreme flow conditions are not merely associated with enso events in the basin i e every highest and lowest flows were not detected only in enso events the direction of streamflow deviation from normal years during el niño and la niña years varies from catchment to catchment in annual basis the la niña period has positive deviation of streamflow from normal period in six of eleven catchments whereas the el niño period has negative deviation from normal period in eight of eleven catchments fig 4 both enso phases have shown negative deviation from normal period in three catchments meki dedeba and aposto in general el niño has shown negative streamflow deviation from that of normal period in more catchments than the la niña period in the basin but the deviation was not statistically significant in dry season or bega ndjf la niña period has shown positive deviation of streamflow from normal period for eight of eleven catchments whereas the el niño period has shown negative deviation of streamflow from normal in five catchments both enso events have led to positive deviation of streamflow from streamflow of normal period at kola dedeba and bedessa catchments overall the deviation of streamflow from normal period in both positive and negative directions is statistically insignificant at α 0 05 in the basin fig 4 however the enso phases have shown relatively regular pattern in the main rainy season jjaso except aposto catchment la niña period has shown positive deviation of streamflow from normal period whereas el niño has shown negative deviation in all catchments in the small rainy season or belg mam the direction of the streamflow deviation from that of the normal is similar for most catchments both enso phases result in reduction of streamflow in the small rainy season for seven of the eleven catchments la niña has shown statistically significant effect on mam streamflow in only two dedeba and katar of eleven catchments fig 4 the wilcoxon rank sum test indicates that the streamflow at the eleven catchments mostly shows statistically insignificant difference between el niño and la niña periods at p 0 05 table 3 4 3 lagged effect of enso on streamflow we considered two months from wet seasons may from small rainy season and august from the main rainy season and one month january from dry seasons to evaluate the lag time effects of enso on the streamflow of the basin the correlation between enso and streamflow of january is weak to moderate in the catchments at lag times from 0 to 12 months fig 5 note that lag 0 refers to the correlation between soi and streamflow in january lag 4 refers to the correlation between soi of september in the previous year and streamflow of january in the year under consideration and lag 12 refers to the correlation between soi of january in the previous year and streamflow of january in the current year under consideration overall the correlation relation between enso and streamflow is relatively stronger for small catchments than the large catchments however there is no clear trend between the strength of enso streamflow relation and catchment area in january also the correlation was found statistically insignificant for most catchments with exceptions of bedessa and kola catchments for lag 0 aposto and bedessa catchments for lag 8 and aposto catchment for lag 12 fig 5 similarly the correlation between enso and streamflow of may minor rainy period is statistically significant for four of the eleven catchments dedeba bedessa aposto and meki for instance at meki the correlation of streamflow with enso events in lag 0 reaches 0 62 significant correlation was found only for aposto catchment at lag 4 months whereas the relations at lag 8 and lag 12 are statistically insignificant for all catchments fig 6 in the august main rainy season the correlation between enso and streamflow is statistically significant at lag 0 for four catchments kola aposto katar and meki at lag 4 and lag 8 the significant correlation was observed at hare and katar catchments whereas lag 12 is statistically insignificant for all catchments fig 7 in general the correlation between enso and streamflow during dry and wet seasons does not indicate the clear enso influence variation with the catchment area in the basin in the ndjf or dry season the lag 0 correlation shows a negative relation indicating that there is an opposite relationship between the dry season streamflow and enso indicators table 4 however the relationship is not statistically significant at most stations except at aposto and lake abaya stations in the mam or short rainy season the correlation shows both negative opposite relationship between seasonal streamflow and soi indicator in the study area again the relationship is found statistically insignificant at most stations except at kola and kulfo stations however the correlation between the wet season jjaso seasonal streamflow and enso indicator was found positive at most stations the relationship was statistically significant only at tikurwuha kulfo and katar stations meanwhile the correlation between the annual streamflow and enso indicator has shown significant lag 0 correlation only at kulfo and meki stations whereas the direction of the relationship is inconsistent we also analyzed the lagged correlation for seasonal and annual time scales but preferred not to include it in the main document since results do not show better relation than lagged zero correlation partial correlation coefficients between catchment area and deviation of streamflow from normal period by removing the latitude effect are presented in table 5 before removing the effect of south north gradient the correlation between the effect of enso and catchment area is very weak to moderate and statistically insignificant for all ranges of flows for low flows q95 the effect moderately decreases correlation 0 4 with catchment area during la niña period but there is no clear trend for el niño for high flow q5 the effect decreases with catchment size for both enso phases though the correlation is again statistically insignificant after removing the effect of south north latitude the partial correlation between catchment area and deviation of extreme streamflow from normal period has the same direction during el niño and la niña period however the partial correlation was found statistically not significant at α 0 05 this indicates that both latitude and catchment area are not the only dominant factors controlling the effect of enso on streamflow extremes in the study area partial correlation coefficients between latitude and deviation of streamflow from normal period by removing the effect of catchment area shows not statistically significant relation or effect 4 4 enso effects on low and high flows the low medium and high streamflow magnitudes are also presented as the percentage difference between el niño and la niña phases with the normal phases table 6 we used the average streamflow of the normal years as reference to indicate whether the two enso phases lead to increased or decreased flow magnitudes both phases of enso resulted in reduction of low flow q95 in most catchments of the study area relatively the highest enso deviation of low streamflow from the normal period was observed at lake abaya kulfo and meki catchments but the deviation is not statistically significant the highest impact of enso on low flows was observed for kulfo catchment for which el niño led to reduction while la niña caused increment of the low flow in medium flow q50 the mixed results are obtained for the direction of enso i e el niño has shown positive deviation from that of normal period for six of the eleven catchments and la niña indicated negative deviation at eight catchments for the high flows q5 el niño has shown negative deviation of streamflow from normal periods at most catchments except lake abaya dedeba and hare whereas la niña experienced positive deviation in most catchments table 6 the differences in extreme flow conditions to different enso phases are varying between the catchments which designates the response difference of each catchment to the enso effect 4 5 streamflow deficit and enso fig 8 shows the streamflow deficit against its duration for the eleven catchments the y axis represents streamflow deficit which was constructed as the difference between q95 of the entire analysis period and actual streamflow of specific periods el niño la niña or normal period the number of occurrence days per year of a streamflow deficit above certain magnitude is shown along the x axis here we considered only deficit flow that lasts for consecutive three and more than three days in the specific enso and normal years based on this the eleven catchments have shown variable length of duration in streamflow deficit at kola bedessa hare and dedeba catchments streamflow deficit has longest duration and less magnitude during the normal years meanwhile la niña phases caused shortest deficit duration than el niño phases fig 8a b e g at kola the flow deficit magnitude is lowest during el niño whereas at bedessa the flow deficit magnitude is lowest during la niña period the magnitude of streamflow deficit increased when its duration increased in both catchments long duration of zero flows was attained during el niño phases with greater probability of occurrence compared to normal and la niña phases in kola bedessa lake abaya and kulfo catchments 4 6 trends of streamflow and enso indicators trend analysis was used to show the relationship between the streamflow data trend and enso soi niño3 4 and mei indicators the temporal trend is not statistically significant for the monthly as well as annual streamflow of six catchments hare aposto dedeba kola lake abaya and tikurwuha meki and bedessa experienced significant gradual change trend in their streamflow only in one of the dry months which are november and january respectively results of the trend test are shown for three catchments in table 7 in ndjf bega season the streamflow of kulfo showed significantly decreasing trend which is also the same for its monthly streamflow in december november may and july however billate experienced significant increments of its streamflow in january and february the niño3 4 and soi index showed increasing trend from 1980 to 2004 on monthly seasonal and annual basis however the trends for the enso indicators was not statistically significant at p 0 05 5 discussion our findings indicate that most of the catchments experience streamflow deficit during el niño period and streamflow excess during la niña period even though the deficit excess was not statistically significant this is similar with the findings for the blue nile basin zaroug et al 2014 abtew et al 2009 and some basins outside ethiopia gutierrez and dracup 2001 kennedy et al 2009 lee and julien 2017 peng et al 2018 however these findings are different from other studies due to the geographic location and catchment characteristics keener et al 2010 dettinger et al 2004 mckerchar and pearson 1994 rice and emanuel 2017 in our study area every high and low flows were not merely associated with the el niño and la niña periods table 2 hence other external forces e g other climate conditions land use and land cover dynamics and water abstraction might have also influenced the streamflow besides rainfall influenced by enso future studies can investigate the relative contribution of such factors on streamflow of the study area moreover the influence of enso on streamflow is not statistically significant for most of our catchments this is in contrast with studies conducted in blue nile basin that showed significant influence of enso on streamflow e g abtew et al 2009 others reported the influence of enso on streamflow without indicating the statistical significance level e g zaroug et al 2014 generally el niño phases are associated with low flow and la niña phases with high flow in ethiopian river basins degefu and bewket 2017 zaroug et al 2014 the magnitude and direction of impacts of enso on streamflow varies among the catchments of our study area despite the small distance between the locations of these catchments for example bedessa hare kulfo lake abaya billate and tikurwuha catchments have shown positive deviation in la niña years and negative deviation during el niño years the impact of la niña was found statistically significant for the small rainy season belg at two dedeba and katar of the eleven catchments however the difference between el niño and la niña period flows are not statistically significant in all eleven catchments our findings suggest that the enso influence on streamflow is not clearly affected by catchment size area and south north gradient latitude this finding contradicts the dettinger et al 2004 report who found that the influence of enso was very strong in small catchments than large catchment and mckerchar and pearson 1994 found that large catchments are more vulnerable to enso phases presence of lagged relation between cause and effect provides important information to water resources planning and operation based on the forecasted enso events the lagged correlation between enso indicators and streamflow of the basin indicated weak to strong correlation for different lag periods the lagged effect of enso on monthly streamflow was detected for some catchments but not for most catchments this finding was similar with the findings of amarasekera et al 1997 mosley 2000 and camilloni and barros 2003 most of the previous studies have reported strong correlation of streamflow and enso indicators at lag of 1 and 2 months cahoon 2003 emerton et al 2017 sharda et al 2012 which support our findings not shown in some catchments in general the lagged relation between enso and streamflow can be useful for proper forecasting and early warning this could help to operate and plan agricultural water use like irrigation based on the forecasted enso conditions of the basin since the dam stores water during the expected dry period and release the abundance water during the expected la niña or wet periods ward et al 2010 mondal et al 2011 sharda et al 2012 land use land cover lulc change can have a great impact on the enso streamflow relationship for instance the forest cover increase in the basin enhances the water holding capacity and reducing the amplification of watershed scale hydrological response to enso streamflow relationship rice and emanuel 2017 lulc causes eco hydrological change which may increase or decrease the climate change shock absorption capacity depending on the land cover and water management practices regulation structures like dam impound water on the reservoir which stays for long period the low flow maintains nearly constant during the el nino and la nina period in the basin as compared with the basin without any regulation structure hence future study should focus on the enso streamflow linkage before and after regulation structure to further determine the influence of regulation structures on the enso streamflow relationship ethiopian rainfall has heterogeneous characteristics which depends on the movement of inter tropical convergence zone itcz on the equator the movement of itcz determines the distribution and magnitude of the seasonal rainfall within the region segele et al 2009 moreover the large scale phenomena like enso affects the rainfall characteristics in different parts of the country most previous studies focused on the large scale effects of atmospheric circulation on the rainfall of the country for the summer season seleshi and zanke 2004 korecha and barnston 2007 gleixner et al 2017 and a few studies addressed the local level effects of atmospheric circulation e g geopotential height wind velocity and rapid warming segele et al 2009 taye et al 2020 this indicates that further investigation is needed to determine the level of enso influence on the precipitation at local level which has substantial effect on streamflow conditions and subsequent water management implications this study provides information on the local level effects of the enso on streamflow conditions for the varying catchment size from water management perspective a separate study is needed to further evaluate how atmospheric circulation can influence the relationship between enso and streamflow for catchments across ethiopia 6 conclusion we evaluated streamflow variability and its linkage with enso events in the ethiopian rift valley lakes basin the following conclusions are drawn based on our findings overall el niño causes water deficit whereas la niña causes excess water in most catchments however the relationship between enso and streamflow of the study area is not statistically significant an exception is that the impact of la niña was found statistically significant for the small rainy season belg at two of the eleven catchments the time lagged effect of enso on monthly streamflow was detected for some catchments in january bedessa and kola may dedeba bedessa aposto and meki and august kola aposto and meki in general although there are some effects of enso on streamflow variability it is not to the level we expected the effect is spatially inconsistent and statistically insignificant our findings also show that the enso streamflow relationship is not affected by catchment size and does not show any south north along the latitude gradient the changes seen in the streamflow are possibly linked with human interventions and possible modulation of climate by local factors such as topography or the lakes in

8237,study region the ethiopian rift valley lakes basin is found in the main ethiopian rift valley system study focus understanding the hydrological impact of el niño southern oscillation enso is of a paramount importance for society since it substantially affects the environmental and socio economic conditions the relation between enso indicators soi mei and niño3 4 and streamflow magnitude was statistically evaluated with partial correlation cross correlation extreme streamflow indices and streamflow deficits to provide empirical evidence on how enso phases la niña and el niño affect streamflow variability trends of streamflow and enso indicators were tested using the non parametric mann kendall test new hydrological insights for the region our findings indicate that the partial correlation between the catchment area and enso effect on streamflow were not statistically significant at p 0 05 after removing the south north gradient the direction of the enso effect is spatially inconsistent since el niño la niña causes positive deviation in some catchments and negative deviation for other catchments though statistically insignificant reduced flow is detected for many catchments during el niño years for most catchment the extreme high flow has a larger magnitude during la niña than el niño whereas the extreme low flow has a larger magnitude during el niño than la niña years overall the relationship between enso and streamflow of the study area is found spatially inconsistent and statistically insignificant for most catchments keywords enso el niño la niña hydrology streamflow variability rift valley lakes basin 1 introduction el niño southern oscillation enso is a global climate phenomenon that has profound influence on various natural processes ward et al 2014 marti et al 2010 it causes a great socio economic and environmental impact by affecting hydro climatic conditions these impacts are mostly associated to drought and flooding events during opposite enso phases known as el niño warm phase and la niña cold phase at different geographic locations with considerable negative consequences gleick 2014 zaroug et al 2014 liu et al 2014 siderius et al 2018 foley et al 2002 broṅṅimann 2007 two of the strongest ever recorded el niño years are in 1982 83 and 2015 16 nobre et al 2019 the 1982 83 enso event caused extremely dry conditions drought that claimed millions of lives worldwide and loss of more than 8 billion dollars in ethiopia goddard and dilley 2005 ryu et al 2010 camilloni and barros 2003 recently around 24 million people in the horn of africa and more than 9 7 million people in ethiopia faced food shortage due to el niño induced droughts in 2015 16 nobre et al 2019 generally enso effects on rainfall can have the same direction of signal within a region or the signal shows at least some regional gradient chiew and mcmahon 2002 however this is not always true and complicated due to the nonlinearity of climate response as shown by hoerling et al 1997 in locations where el niño is associated with higher than usual rainfall values la niña is very often but not always associated with lower than usual rainfall values davey et al 2014 this is due to synoptic or large scale circulation of enso rainfall teleconnection at regional scale overall el niño events mainly decrease while la niña events increase the precipitation streamflow over china ouyang et al 2014 lee and julien 2017 reported that streamflow deficit during autumn season in el niño period and streamflow excess during la niña period in south korea in contrast kalaycı et al 2004 found wetter conditions during el niño events and drier conditions during la niña events over turkey similarly results obtained for the south eastern united states show el niño years tend to be wet and la niña years tend to be dry wang and asefa 2017 in ethiopia el niño phases of enso are generally associated with lower streamflow and la niña phases are associated with higher streamflow although this is not always the case zaroug et al 2014 abtew et al 2009 extremely dry years in blue nile of ethiopia are most likely associated with el niño events while extremely wet years are associated with la niña events abtew et al 2009 this is also supported by zaroug et al 2014 who reported that 83 of the el niño events in blue nile resulted in drought whereas 67 of the occurrence of extreme flood events were caused when the el niño event is followed by the la niña event this was confirmed by other authors amarasekera et al 1997 wang and eltahir 1999 siam and eltahir 2017 the relationships between enso and streamflow are not necessarily consistent at fine spatial scales such as among individual watersheds within the same region rice and emanuel 2017 although strong and regionally consistent enso streamflow teleconnection is identified for other regions weaker signals are identified in some parts of africa and north america chiew and mcmahon 2002 the regional inconsistency of enso impact on streamflow can be explained by two factors first enso effects are only one of the many aspects of the climate system affecting the rainfall amount and distribution e g kiem and verdon kidd 2009 gleixner et al 2017 worku and sahile 2018 wooldridge et al 2001 showed that the strength of the enso rainfall relation can even vary within relatively small catchment of 1300 km2 indicating that topographic controls may affect enso influences on rainfall totals and intensities curry and zwiers 2018 found only 16 of the variance in annual streamflow peaks was explained by enso second enso signals are propagated through watersheds as rainfall is converted to streamflow as a result the streamflow response to enso signal is often lagged by few months as compared to the timing of the precipitation response to the signal chiew et al 1998 sharda et al 2012 this phase lag can be mainly caused by the storage characteristics hydrological memory of the catchments which can modulate the enso impacts chen and kumar 2002 more specifically rice and emanuel 2017 reported that the watershed characteristics like precipitation timing and phase forest cover and interactions between topography and geomorphology have significant influence on the relationship between streamflow and enso their study illustrated how and why hydrologic response to enso differs among watersheds within a region the magnitude of enso effects on extreme high and low streamflow can be substantial however most of the previous investigations focused only on the effects of enso on mean streamflow of rivers with only researchers addressed effects on extreme flows zhang et al 2007 pyrce 2004 misir et al 2013 ruigar and golian 2015 however enso effects can be greater on peak flows than on streamflow volumes ward et al 2010 and the effects on low and peak flows can be highly variable in space mosley 2000 studies that investigated factors affecting the direction and magnitude of enso effects are limited the effect of enso events on streamflow may depend on catchment size keener et al 2010 dettinger et al 2004 reported clear influence of enso on streamflow of small catchment whereas mckerchar and pearson 1994 reported stronger relationship between the two variables in larger catchments than smaller ones further study is required to enhance our understanding about the catchment size influence on the linkage between streamflow variability and enso most previous studies focused on the relationship between enso and the rainfall in different parts of ethiopia taye et al 2020 eden et al 2014 gleixner et al 2017 however studies that address how catchment characteristics influence the enso streamflow relation are limited and very rare hence this study may provide the basic information on the linkage between enso and streamflow in varying catchment sizes for ethiopia case studies of enso influences on streamflow are mostly limited to the blue nile river basin additional studies are required to thoroughly understand and quantify the spatio temporal dependency of enso interlink with streamflow in the country in this study we aim to provide evidence on the link between enso and streamflow characteristics at various catchment sizes in the ethiopian rift valley lakes basin which will be an addition to the limited scientific literature on the topic findings of enso influence on streamflow may contribute to water resources management particularly on extreme events risk management and adaptation strategies the findings can be useful for reservoir operation irrigation management and flood and drought management 2 study area rift valley lakes basin which has a drainage area of 53 000 km2 is among the twelve river basins in ethiopia it is found in the main ethiopian rift valley system located in the southern part of the country fig 1 the basin is located between 36 65 39 41 e longitude and 4 37 8 43 n latitude it consists of four main sub basins ziway shala hawassa abaya chamo and chew bahir for this study we selected eleven catchments with long term streamflow measurements namely dedeba meki and katar catchments from ziway shala sub basin tikurwuha catchment from hawassa sub basin and aposto kola bedessa hare kulfo lake abaya and billate from abaya chamo sub basin fig 1 the study area consists of eight lakes and diverse topographic features the terrain elevation of the basin ranges between 480 m a s l at the lower rift floor to 4112 m a s l at the top of mountains the climate of the basin ranges from semi arid at the lower rift floor to humid and temperate at high mountains its annual average rainfall ranges from 492 mm to 2582 mm with the total mean of 1079 mm jica 2012 the basin receives bimodal rainfall pattern the main rains occur in june to october whereas the small rains occur from march to may but the seasons vary in the sub basins the mean annual minimum and maximum temperature of the basin range between 12 3 c 27 1 c the mean temperature of the basin is 19 6 c the basin s climate indicates high variability in temperature and rainfall characteristics which affect water resources in terms of quantity and distribution table 1 such variability has great consequence in the basin as it is characterised by high population growth rapid industrial and urban expansion excessive water abstraction siltation and sedimentation of lakes and environmental degradation 3 data sets and methods 3 1 data sets streamflow data for eighteen gauging stations was collected from the ministry of water irrigation and energy mowie of ethiopia for the study area however data from only eleven of these gauging stations was used for further analysis since their data is relatively complete homogeneous and covers long period in average 25 years table 1 here stations that contain only missed data for 2 1 billate to 14 tikurwuha of the time are considered to provide complete time series data whereas stations that contain missed data for 15 of the time are excluded from further analysis in this study the stations that are selected for further analysis are aposto kola bedessa lake abaya station near to arba minchi hare near to arba minchi kulfo at sikela billate at alaba kulito dedeba near to kuyera tikurwuha at hawassa bridge meki and katar fig 1 table 1 water levels at all stations are measured by using staff gauge the staff gauge is graduated in units of centimeter cm with long markers every 10 cm and short markers every 1 cm water level is recorded manually twice per day at 6 00 am and 6 00 pm the two measurements are averaged to obtain the daily average water level this water level is converted to discharge data using stage discharge relationship rating curve of the site by the responsible government body at the ministry of water irrigation and energy of ethiopia in addition to this data enso indicators soi niño3 4 and mei data were obtained from the climate research unit cru noaa www cpc ncep noaa gov data indices and climate diagnostics center http www cdc noaa gov kew mei to investigate the enso interlink with streamflow of the basin 3 2 enso indicators enso events can be defined by indices that indicate the warmth and coolness of equatorial pacific sea surface temperature ssts and the gradient in sea level pressure slp across the differences at tropical pacific ocean gutierrez and dracup 2001 hanley et al 2003 we selected three indices among many indices used in literature to define enso events these are the southern oscillation index soi niño3 4 ssts and multivariate enso index mei the three indices have opposite estimation valuing system for different phases of enso i e the sst anomalies are positive and soi is negative during el niño events these indices received wide application in climate studies in ethiopia abtew et al 2009 seleshi and zanke 2004 and outside ethiopia hanley et al 2003 kennedy et al 2009 lü et al 2011 however there is no consensus in the selection of enso indices in literature to evaluate their influence on hydro climatic variables hanley et al 2003 soi is a measure of the difference in mean sea level air pressure at tahiti in the southeastern pacific and darwin in the northern australia to the west of the pacific ocean power and kociuba 2011 soi values averaged over five consecutive months that are greater or equal to 0 5 indicate a la niña episode the values less than or equal to 0 5 indicate an el niño episode and the values between 0 5 and 0 5 indicate normal years ropelewski and halpert 1996 kiem and franks 2001 niño3 4 index measures the area averaged sea surface temperature over the equatorial pacific ocean 5 n 5 s and 170 120 w and is an appropriate proxy for pacific mean equatorial sst the values of niño3 4 index averaged over three consecutive months which are less than or equal to 0 5 indicate la niña phase whereas values greater or equal to 0 5 indicate el niño phase neutral phase is when the three months average niño3 4 index is in between 0 5 and 0 5 c chen and lee 2016 mei is computed based on the six different parameters which are sea level pressure sea surface temperature zonal and meridional component of surface wind surface air temperature and total cloudiness fraction of the sky it has advantages over the two indices soi and niño3 4 since it considers slp and ssts measures the values of mei index averaged over two consecutive months which are less than or equal to 0 5 indicate la nina phase whereas the value greater than or equal to 0 5 indicate the el nino phases of enso and the value in between 0 5 and 0 5 is neutral period 3 3 homogeneity test checking the quality of streamflow data is a prerequisite for using these data for further hydrological analysis we conducted homogeneity test on streamflow data of eleven catchments by using buishand method buishand 1982 before evaluating the streamflow enso linkage in the basin inhomogeneity in the hydro climate data is due to influence from non climate factors such as changes in gauging station location instrumentation and time of the measurement guentchev et al 2010 among the eleven stations the four gauging stations aposto billate tikurwuha and kulfo have inhomogeneous data since the homogeneity test result shows break points or inconsistency the time series of these data was divided into two i e before and after the breaking point in this study the streamflow data of the four catchments which is collected before the break points or estimated change points were used for evaluation of the streamflow enso linkage whereas the data for the period after the change point were not used at all for further analysis for example billate has streamflow data from 1971 to 2007 but the break point or estimated change point is 2004 thus we considered the data from 1971 to 2004 for trend analysis while ignoring the 2005 2007 data table 1 shows the data statistics for the time period over which the data of the eleven stations passed the homogeneity test 3 4 methods of analysis a set of statistics was used to evaluate the relationship between enso indicators and streamflow these statistics include simple and cross correlation with a set of lag times partial correlation extreme streamflow values q95 and q5 and streamflow deficit analysis for different enso phases moreover wilcoxon rank sum test was used to determine whether the average streamflow which was recorded during la niña period was statistically different from the average streamflow during el niño periods at α 0 05 significance level and also the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test the statistical significance of the deviation of el niño and la niña period streamflow record to those of normal period on seasonal and annual basis the correlation between streamflow and enso indices soi and niño3 4 was estimated at different timescales monthly seasonal and annual the analysis was done for three local seasons bega ndjf representing the dry season belg mam representing small rains and kiremt jjaso representing main rains where the abbreviations within the open brackets consist of the first letter of respective months the daily time series of each season was analyzed to estimate magnitudes of the mean and extreme seasonal streamflow for each analysis year seasonal mean streamflow and extreme streamflow values were estimated from the seasonal time series over the analysis period spearman s formula was used to calculate correlation between seasonal streamflow and enso indices 1 ρ 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 where ρ spearman s rank correlation coefficient di the difference between the two ranks of each observation and n number of observations cross correlations for multiple lag times were estimated for monthly streamflow amount and soi and monthly streamflow amount and niño3 4 values for various lag times the lag time extends from lag 0 no lag to lag 12 12 months lag this helps to understand the time difference between occurrence of enso phase and the time at which impacts on the streamflow is detected the partial correlation was used to analyze the relation between catchment area and enso effect by removing the latitude or north south gradient effect enso effect was represented by the deviation of streamflow of the el niño and la niña periods from that of the normal period the equation for the partiarl correlation coefficient reads as follows 2 r y x w r x y r x w r y w 1 r x w 2 1 r y w 2 where r x y is the correlation coefficients between enso x variable and catchment area y variable r x w represents the correlation coefficient between enso and the controlling variable w here latitude and r y w refers to the correlation between catchment area and the controlling variable respectively we defined low medium and high flows as the streamflow that has 95 50 and 5 q95 q50 q5 probability of exceedance respectively pyrce 2004 institute of hydrology 1980 these flow indices provide information relevant to streamflow ecology and help to understand the major climate or non climatic impacts that influence the extreme and normal conditions the available data length ranges from 21 years at tikurwuha to 44 years at lake abaya station table 1 the data from the different stations covers different length of observation period for instance the existing data for the billate station cover the period from 1971 to 2004 whereas that for hare covers 1980 2007 q95 is commonly used as an indicator for low flow the minimum flow to protect the river system and to maintain the natural monthly seasonal variations zelenhasic and salvai 1987 as such we estimated the streamflow deficit by specifying q95 as the threshold value the streamflow magnitude below this threshold value was assumed to indicate streamflow deficit and hence drought the deficit was used here to determine the magnitude duration and severity of drought during enso episodes normal el niño and la niña trends of streamflow at eleven gauging stations and the enso indicators soi niño3 4 and mei was detected by using the non parametric mann kendall test on monthly seasonal and annual basis hu et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 this help to detect the trend association between the streamflow data and enso indicators in the basin all gauging stations and enso indicators data covered from 1980 to 2004 was used to trend analysis 4 results 4 1 streamflow characteristics the streamflow hydrograph of the study area has two maxima with a major peak in between august and october and a minor peak in may fig 2 all rivers are perennials as their streamflow is always above zero in general the inter annual variability of streamflow is very high at most of the gauged catchments here we provide examples for three catchments which are found in the gidabo sub basin for detail discussion aposto station records show that the study area experienced major wet years in 1977 1983 and 1996 fig 3 the driest years were 1999 2002 and 2003 the streamflow declined in the period from 1987 to 1991 and the flow recovered in the following years however the largest decline in streamflow was observed in early 2000s and the flow has not fully recovered afterwards annual variation of the streamflow at kola and bedessa catchment is slightly like that of aposto however the difference between the flow of the two stations kola and bedessa and aposto has significantly reduced since early 2000s the main causes for the decline in flow at aposto since 2000s may be due to irrigation expansion like daggy irrigation project which irrigates 1000 ha of land coffee processing factories flour factories and plantation of exotic tree species which consumes high amount of water like eucalyptus tree personal communication with experts this was supported by the homogeneity test of streamflow data of aposto the aposto streamflow data is inhomogeneous which shows break points in 1998 that coincides with irrigation infrastructure expansion in the catchment 4 2 enso effect on seasonal and annual mean flows the monthly stream flows were divided in to three periods that coincide with the three phases of enso these are el niño la niña and normal periods the study area experienced 11 el niño years 13 la niña years and 21 normal years table 2 the highest flow recorded years are 1983 1988 1996 and 1998 whereas the lowest flow recorded years in most catchments are 1984 1986 and 1991 in general all extreme flow conditions are not merely associated with enso events in the basin i e every highest and lowest flows were not detected only in enso events the direction of streamflow deviation from normal years during el niño and la niña years varies from catchment to catchment in annual basis the la niña period has positive deviation of streamflow from normal period in six of eleven catchments whereas the el niño period has negative deviation from normal period in eight of eleven catchments fig 4 both enso phases have shown negative deviation from normal period in three catchments meki dedeba and aposto in general el niño has shown negative streamflow deviation from that of normal period in more catchments than the la niña period in the basin but the deviation was not statistically significant in dry season or bega ndjf la niña period has shown positive deviation of streamflow from normal period for eight of eleven catchments whereas the el niño period has shown negative deviation of streamflow from normal in five catchments both enso events have led to positive deviation of streamflow from streamflow of normal period at kola dedeba and bedessa catchments overall the deviation of streamflow from normal period in both positive and negative directions is statistically insignificant at α 0 05 in the basin fig 4 however the enso phases have shown relatively regular pattern in the main rainy season jjaso except aposto catchment la niña period has shown positive deviation of streamflow from normal period whereas el niño has shown negative deviation in all catchments in the small rainy season or belg mam the direction of the streamflow deviation from that of the normal is similar for most catchments both enso phases result in reduction of streamflow in the small rainy season for seven of the eleven catchments la niña has shown statistically significant effect on mam streamflow in only two dedeba and katar of eleven catchments fig 4 the wilcoxon rank sum test indicates that the streamflow at the eleven catchments mostly shows statistically insignificant difference between el niño and la niña periods at p 0 05 table 3 4 3 lagged effect of enso on streamflow we considered two months from wet seasons may from small rainy season and august from the main rainy season and one month january from dry seasons to evaluate the lag time effects of enso on the streamflow of the basin the correlation between enso and streamflow of january is weak to moderate in the catchments at lag times from 0 to 12 months fig 5 note that lag 0 refers to the correlation between soi and streamflow in january lag 4 refers to the correlation between soi of september in the previous year and streamflow of january in the year under consideration and lag 12 refers to the correlation between soi of january in the previous year and streamflow of january in the current year under consideration overall the correlation relation between enso and streamflow is relatively stronger for small catchments than the large catchments however there is no clear trend between the strength of enso streamflow relation and catchment area in january also the correlation was found statistically insignificant for most catchments with exceptions of bedessa and kola catchments for lag 0 aposto and bedessa catchments for lag 8 and aposto catchment for lag 12 fig 5 similarly the correlation between enso and streamflow of may minor rainy period is statistically significant for four of the eleven catchments dedeba bedessa aposto and meki for instance at meki the correlation of streamflow with enso events in lag 0 reaches 0 62 significant correlation was found only for aposto catchment at lag 4 months whereas the relations at lag 8 and lag 12 are statistically insignificant for all catchments fig 6 in the august main rainy season the correlation between enso and streamflow is statistically significant at lag 0 for four catchments kola aposto katar and meki at lag 4 and lag 8 the significant correlation was observed at hare and katar catchments whereas lag 12 is statistically insignificant for all catchments fig 7 in general the correlation between enso and streamflow during dry and wet seasons does not indicate the clear enso influence variation with the catchment area in the basin in the ndjf or dry season the lag 0 correlation shows a negative relation indicating that there is an opposite relationship between the dry season streamflow and enso indicators table 4 however the relationship is not statistically significant at most stations except at aposto and lake abaya stations in the mam or short rainy season the correlation shows both negative opposite relationship between seasonal streamflow and soi indicator in the study area again the relationship is found statistically insignificant at most stations except at kola and kulfo stations however the correlation between the wet season jjaso seasonal streamflow and enso indicator was found positive at most stations the relationship was statistically significant only at tikurwuha kulfo and katar stations meanwhile the correlation between the annual streamflow and enso indicator has shown significant lag 0 correlation only at kulfo and meki stations whereas the direction of the relationship is inconsistent we also analyzed the lagged correlation for seasonal and annual time scales but preferred not to include it in the main document since results do not show better relation than lagged zero correlation partial correlation coefficients between catchment area and deviation of streamflow from normal period by removing the latitude effect are presented in table 5 before removing the effect of south north gradient the correlation between the effect of enso and catchment area is very weak to moderate and statistically insignificant for all ranges of flows for low flows q95 the effect moderately decreases correlation 0 4 with catchment area during la niña period but there is no clear trend for el niño for high flow q5 the effect decreases with catchment size for both enso phases though the correlation is again statistically insignificant after removing the effect of south north latitude the partial correlation between catchment area and deviation of extreme streamflow from normal period has the same direction during el niño and la niña period however the partial correlation was found statistically not significant at α 0 05 this indicates that both latitude and catchment area are not the only dominant factors controlling the effect of enso on streamflow extremes in the study area partial correlation coefficients between latitude and deviation of streamflow from normal period by removing the effect of catchment area shows not statistically significant relation or effect 4 4 enso effects on low and high flows the low medium and high streamflow magnitudes are also presented as the percentage difference between el niño and la niña phases with the normal phases table 6 we used the average streamflow of the normal years as reference to indicate whether the two enso phases lead to increased or decreased flow magnitudes both phases of enso resulted in reduction of low flow q95 in most catchments of the study area relatively the highest enso deviation of low streamflow from the normal period was observed at lake abaya kulfo and meki catchments but the deviation is not statistically significant the highest impact of enso on low flows was observed for kulfo catchment for which el niño led to reduction while la niña caused increment of the low flow in medium flow q50 the mixed results are obtained for the direction of enso i e el niño has shown positive deviation from that of normal period for six of the eleven catchments and la niña indicated negative deviation at eight catchments for the high flows q5 el niño has shown negative deviation of streamflow from normal periods at most catchments except lake abaya dedeba and hare whereas la niña experienced positive deviation in most catchments table 6 the differences in extreme flow conditions to different enso phases are varying between the catchments which designates the response difference of each catchment to the enso effect 4 5 streamflow deficit and enso fig 8 shows the streamflow deficit against its duration for the eleven catchments the y axis represents streamflow deficit which was constructed as the difference between q95 of the entire analysis period and actual streamflow of specific periods el niño la niña or normal period the number of occurrence days per year of a streamflow deficit above certain magnitude is shown along the x axis here we considered only deficit flow that lasts for consecutive three and more than three days in the specific enso and normal years based on this the eleven catchments have shown variable length of duration in streamflow deficit at kola bedessa hare and dedeba catchments streamflow deficit has longest duration and less magnitude during the normal years meanwhile la niña phases caused shortest deficit duration than el niño phases fig 8a b e g at kola the flow deficit magnitude is lowest during el niño whereas at bedessa the flow deficit magnitude is lowest during la niña period the magnitude of streamflow deficit increased when its duration increased in both catchments long duration of zero flows was attained during el niño phases with greater probability of occurrence compared to normal and la niña phases in kola bedessa lake abaya and kulfo catchments 4 6 trends of streamflow and enso indicators trend analysis was used to show the relationship between the streamflow data trend and enso soi niño3 4 and mei indicators the temporal trend is not statistically significant for the monthly as well as annual streamflow of six catchments hare aposto dedeba kola lake abaya and tikurwuha meki and bedessa experienced significant gradual change trend in their streamflow only in one of the dry months which are november and january respectively results of the trend test are shown for three catchments in table 7 in ndjf bega season the streamflow of kulfo showed significantly decreasing trend which is also the same for its monthly streamflow in december november may and july however billate experienced significant increments of its streamflow in january and february the niño3 4 and soi index showed increasing trend from 1980 to 2004 on monthly seasonal and annual basis however the trends for the enso indicators was not statistically significant at p 0 05 5 discussion our findings indicate that most of the catchments experience streamflow deficit during el niño period and streamflow excess during la niña period even though the deficit excess was not statistically significant this is similar with the findings for the blue nile basin zaroug et al 2014 abtew et al 2009 and some basins outside ethiopia gutierrez and dracup 2001 kennedy et al 2009 lee and julien 2017 peng et al 2018 however these findings are different from other studies due to the geographic location and catchment characteristics keener et al 2010 dettinger et al 2004 mckerchar and pearson 1994 rice and emanuel 2017 in our study area every high and low flows were not merely associated with the el niño and la niña periods table 2 hence other external forces e g other climate conditions land use and land cover dynamics and water abstraction might have also influenced the streamflow besides rainfall influenced by enso future studies can investigate the relative contribution of such factors on streamflow of the study area moreover the influence of enso on streamflow is not statistically significant for most of our catchments this is in contrast with studies conducted in blue nile basin that showed significant influence of enso on streamflow e g abtew et al 2009 others reported the influence of enso on streamflow without indicating the statistical significance level e g zaroug et al 2014 generally el niño phases are associated with low flow and la niña phases with high flow in ethiopian river basins degefu and bewket 2017 zaroug et al 2014 the magnitude and direction of impacts of enso on streamflow varies among the catchments of our study area despite the small distance between the locations of these catchments for example bedessa hare kulfo lake abaya billate and tikurwuha catchments have shown positive deviation in la niña years and negative deviation during el niño years the impact of la niña was found statistically significant for the small rainy season belg at two dedeba and katar of the eleven catchments however the difference between el niño and la niña period flows are not statistically significant in all eleven catchments our findings suggest that the enso influence on streamflow is not clearly affected by catchment size area and south north gradient latitude this finding contradicts the dettinger et al 2004 report who found that the influence of enso was very strong in small catchments than large catchment and mckerchar and pearson 1994 found that large catchments are more vulnerable to enso phases presence of lagged relation between cause and effect provides important information to water resources planning and operation based on the forecasted enso events the lagged correlation between enso indicators and streamflow of the basin indicated weak to strong correlation for different lag periods the lagged effect of enso on monthly streamflow was detected for some catchments but not for most catchments this finding was similar with the findings of amarasekera et al 1997 mosley 2000 and camilloni and barros 2003 most of the previous studies have reported strong correlation of streamflow and enso indicators at lag of 1 and 2 months cahoon 2003 emerton et al 2017 sharda et al 2012 which support our findings not shown in some catchments in general the lagged relation between enso and streamflow can be useful for proper forecasting and early warning this could help to operate and plan agricultural water use like irrigation based on the forecasted enso conditions of the basin since the dam stores water during the expected dry period and release the abundance water during the expected la niña or wet periods ward et al 2010 mondal et al 2011 sharda et al 2012 land use land cover lulc change can have a great impact on the enso streamflow relationship for instance the forest cover increase in the basin enhances the water holding capacity and reducing the amplification of watershed scale hydrological response to enso streamflow relationship rice and emanuel 2017 lulc causes eco hydrological change which may increase or decrease the climate change shock absorption capacity depending on the land cover and water management practices regulation structures like dam impound water on the reservoir which stays for long period the low flow maintains nearly constant during the el nino and la nina period in the basin as compared with the basin without any regulation structure hence future study should focus on the enso streamflow linkage before and after regulation structure to further determine the influence of regulation structures on the enso streamflow relationship ethiopian rainfall has heterogeneous characteristics which depends on the movement of inter tropical convergence zone itcz on the equator the movement of itcz determines the distribution and magnitude of the seasonal rainfall within the region segele et al 2009 moreover the large scale phenomena like enso affects the rainfall characteristics in different parts of the country most previous studies focused on the large scale effects of atmospheric circulation on the rainfall of the country for the summer season seleshi and zanke 2004 korecha and barnston 2007 gleixner et al 2017 and a few studies addressed the local level effects of atmospheric circulation e g geopotential height wind velocity and rapid warming segele et al 2009 taye et al 2020 this indicates that further investigation is needed to determine the level of enso influence on the precipitation at local level which has substantial effect on streamflow conditions and subsequent water management implications this study provides information on the local level effects of the enso on streamflow conditions for the varying catchment size from water management perspective a separate study is needed to further evaluate how atmospheric circulation can influence the relationship between enso and streamflow for catchments across ethiopia 6 conclusion we evaluated streamflow variability and its linkage with enso events in the ethiopian rift valley lakes basin the following conclusions are drawn based on our findings overall el niño causes water deficit whereas la niña causes excess water in most catchments however the relationship between enso and streamflow of the study area is not statistically significant an exception is that the impact of la niña was found statistically significant for the small rainy season belg at two of the eleven catchments the time lagged effect of enso on monthly streamflow was detected for some catchments in january bedessa and kola may dedeba bedessa aposto and meki and august kola aposto and meki in general although there are some effects of enso on streamflow variability it is not to the level we expected the effect is spatially inconsistent and statistically insignificant our findings also show that the enso streamflow relationship is not affected by catchment size and does not show any south north along the latitude gradient the changes seen in the streamflow are possibly linked with human interventions and possible modulation of climate by local factors such as topography or the lakes in

8238,study region chari logone river basin lake chad basin study focus the objective of this study was to better understand the hydrological functioning of the chari logone basin under the effect of the high variability of rainfall which has affected the sahel during the last sixty years the study is based on hydro climatic data for the period between 1960 and 2015 obtained from the national and international institutions this work based on the following steps 1 average hydrological balances were estimated for different geographical areas to identify the most productive parts of the basin 2 the rainfall runoff relation was compared for the wettest and driest decades of the study period to identify the areas that contribute most to the amplification of the hydrological response to variations in rainfall 3 the long term period stability of the rainfall runoff relation was evaluated for climatic conditions close to the average situation in order to detect potential evidence of the anthropogenic impact new hydrologic insights for the region during the period 1960 2015 the average water flow in the chari logone basin 42 mm year represented only 5 of precipitation between the two climatically most contrasted wet 1960 1971 and dry 1982 1997 periods the average flow differed by 75 against a decrease of 15 of precipitation our hydroclimatic data show no clearly detectable evidence of an anthropogenic impact responsible for a decrease in flows or a modification of the hydrological regime in the chari logone basin keywords lake chad chari logone hydrological climate and variability 1 introduction since the middle of the last century the lake chad basin has experienced a high variability in rainfall fourissala and gormo 2012 lavergne 2017 with consequently a huge variability in the level and extent of lake chad olivry et al 1996 lemoalle et al 2012 after a wet phase between the 1950s and the 1960s lake chad experienced dramatic dry conditions which decreased the extent of the lake by over tenfold since the beginning of the 1990s rainfall has slowly increased affected by a strong interannual variability inducing a recovery of the lake pham duc et al 2020 whereas climate changes are thought to be one of the main factors explaining the variability of the level of the lake the impact of the increase in human activities is still debated coe and foley 2001 gao et al 2011 zhu et al 2019a 2019b while human activities have had an undeniable impact on the runoff and flow of rivers in the sahelo sudanian region it is rather through the change in land use linked to deforestation and land clearing leblanc et al 2006 descroix et al 2009 most often resulting in an increase in flows despite the overall decrease in precipitation in the sahelian zone and a more contrasted response in the sudanian zone descroix et al 2009 gal et al 2017 the decrease in precipitation observed throughout the sahel region during the 1970s and the 1980s is undeniable and it is important to provide quantitative information on the response of flows within the lake chad basin to these variations in precipitation in order to estimate the respective roles of human activities and climate change based on the analysis of hydroclimatic data series an initial quantification suggested that when the rainfall in the basin varies by 10 the flow of the chari varies by around 30 descroix et al 2009 lemoalle et al 2012 gal et al 2017 other studies have sought to assess this relationship using rainfall runoff modeling vuillaume 1981 ardoin bardin et al 2009 gonçalvès et al 2020 one of the major difficulties encountered by this work remains the limited and incomplete nature of long term hydro climatic data in the region in addition the logistical and technical constraints and the sahelian context make it difficult to establish or update robust gauging curves therefore it is important to take into account the unavoidable uncertainties associated with river discharge data a robust quantification of the relationship between climate variability and runoff within the chari logone basin as well as the associated uncertainties remains necessary zhu et al 2019a 2019b conducted a study to assess the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability on water loss from the flow of the chari logone river using a conceptual and statistical approach mahmood and jia 2019 used a hydrological approach to determine hydro climatic changes in the active parts of the lake chad basin using an analysis of trends and causes of the decline in stream flow to lake chad due to human interventions and climate variability some of these studies point to the preponderant impact of human activities and in particular an increase in abstraction mainly for irrigation purposes compared to that of climate variability to explain the overall drop in lake level observed in recent decades however this work assumes more than the existence of a significant increase in water withdrawals in the chari logone basin a rainfall runoff model calibrated in humid climatic conditions is difficult to transpose to different climatic conditions given the importance of climatic and hydrological variations in this system a thorough analysis of the data is essential central questions that we must adress here are is the hydrological variability of lake chad and its chari logone system attributable to climate change and or human activities has this hydrological variability led to a change in the behavior and functioning of the chari le logone system the objective of this work was to better understand the sensitivity of the hydrological functioning of the chari logone basin to rainfall fluctuations and to identify the potential impact of anthropogenic factors the analysis of the relationship between the rainfall drought observed since 1970 and the hydrological drought in recent decades is a key element in assessing the vulnerability of the water resource within the chari logone basin but also throughout the region and the sub regions whose economy depends largely on lake chad and these variations like most lakes located in a hydrologically closed drainage system the fluctuation of lake chad is directly related to the influx of rivers which varies according to the hydrological water budget in the basin the various studies carried out on the hydrological balance of lake chad olivry et al 1996 bader et al 2011 bouchez et al 2016 have shown that its water comes mainly from the chari logone system more than 82 supplemented by direct precipitation 14 on the lake and less significant contributions from el beid yaéré outlet and komadougu yobe lemoalle et al 2012 lake chad is therefore highly dependent on water fluxes in the chari logone basin located in the southern part of the lake chad basin which constitutes the main hydrologically active area of the basin bouchez et al 2019 gonçalvès et al 2020 a detailed understanding of the variability of lake chad requires understanding the response of flows within the chari logone basin to variations in precipitation this is essential for estimating the respective roles of climate change and human activities in the recent and future evolution of lake chad the analysis of spatial and temporal variations of the water balance in the chari logone basin presented herein followed different steps 1 average hydrological balances were estimated for different geographical areas to identify the most productive parts of the basin in terms of surface runoff and the potential groundwater recharge areas the spatial analysis was based on different sub basins treated separately for upper catchment and downstream areas 2 the rainfall runoff relation was compared for the wettest and driest decades of the study period to identify the areas that contribute most to the amplification of the hydrological response to variations in rainfall 3 the long term period stability of the rainfall runoff relation was evaluated for climatic conditions close to the average situation in order to detect potential evidence of the anthropogenic impact for this purpose reference sub basins were determined and associated spatial precipitation and runoff estimated the reference periods were defined and the water balance parameters to be used for the analysis were identified 2 study area description 2 1 geological context the chari logone basin bcl is the hydrologically active part of the lake chad basin it covers an area of 613 000 km2 and its borders are surrounded by a set of mountain ranges guera north ouaddaï east central african south and adamaoua south west ranges fig 1 the geological formations consist mainly of the outcropping precambrian basement mainly represented by granites and metamorphic rocks and the sedimentary series of the tertiary sandstone formation of the continental terminal and of the quaternary fluvial or fluvio lacustrine formations louis 1970 the quaternary and the continental terminal are the main sedimentary aquifer systems in the area schneider and wolf 1992 groundwater also circulates in the hard rocks of the precambrian basement supporting the base flow in the upper part of the chari logone bouchez et al 2019 gonçalves et al 2020 2 2 climate and hydrology the climate of the chari logone basin is characterized by the confluence of two air masses the dry northeastern harmattan of continental origin and the humid southwestern monsoon of oceanic origin the basin is contrasted from the sudanese climate in the south to the semi arid climate in the north the climate is tropical with two seasons a dry season and a wet season the rainy season begins in may and ends in october and most of the precipitation falls in july and august annual precipitation was 970 mm and 550 mm respectively in sarh and n djamena between 1984 and 2014 evaporation rates show a strong seasonal cycle following the air temperature cycle mahamat nour 2019 the chari and the logone are the two main rivers in the chari logone basin the chari originates in the central african republic at an altitude of between 500 and 600 m the logone starts on the adamawa plateau in cameroon with an altitude ranging from 305 to 835 m cabot 1965 gac 1980 the confluence of the chari and logone rivers is located in n djamena 110 km upstream from lake chad fig 1 the chari logone receives groundwater from the upper basin of the precambrian basement gonçalvès et al 2020 while in the lower part water from the chari logone flows from the river to the quaternary aquifer bouchez et al 2019 flood prone areas give rise to rich ecosystems supporting biodiversity and key economic activities such as fishing breeding and agriculture in addition to regional importance these flood zones are of international importance in ecology botany zoology hydrology and are recognized as ramsar sites vassolo et al 2016 at the height of the discharge the logone and the chari flood the surrounding plains with their discharges olivry et al 1996 nkiaka et al 2018 the flood plains of the chari logone basin are of particular importance in contributing to the renewal of groundwater in the basin seeber et al 2014 recent studies by lcbc bgr vassolo et al 2016 showed that aquifer recharge comes from stagnant water in floodplains they also play an important role in the hydrological balance of the chari logone basin in particular by constituting large areas of evaporation and having a potential impact on water chemistry lienou 2007 delclaux et al 2011 seeber et al 2014 lemoalle et al 2014 the precipitation over these flooded plains does not compensate for the net loss by evaporation the area of the flood plains is variable and depends on the amount of rainfall that has fallen on the basin jung et al 2011 vassolo et al 2016 the main flood plains of the chari logone basin are fig 1 the yaeré plain the yaeré is a floodplain in northern cameroon this plain is flooded by rains and overflows from the logone the accumulated water is taken up by the evapotranspiration effect the average extent of flooded surface between 2000 and 2014 was 2767 km2 vassolo et al 2016 the massenya plain the bahr erguig partially silted up is a defluent that occasionally feeds the floodplain of massenya the salamat plain am timan the bahr salamat sub basin forms more or less temporary marshes and floods a depression 20 km long in wet periods the floodplains of salamat are very largely flooded with the exception of the sandy ridges the logone loses water along its right bank from ba illi to bongor towards the large plain drained by the ba illi and other secondary depressions fig 1 further north at bongor the logone loses water through its left bank towards the yaéré bouchardeau and lefevre 1957 3 data acquisition 3 1 precipitation several types of precipitation datasets are available for the lake chad basin the chari logone basin is shared between 4 countries cameroon the central african republic sudan and chad the acquisition and management of rainfall data on each national territory are managed by the relevant services of each country in chad the general directorate of national meteorology dgmn of the ministry of civil aviation and meteorology is in charge of all available stations and datasets in the country most of these stations were installed during the colonial period by researchers from the overseas scientific and technical research office orstom an organization now replaced by the ird research institute for development and the agency for the safety of air navigation in africa and madagascar asecna they are still mostly functional despite some periods of interruption linked in particular to the civil war in chad and the sub region at the end of the 1980s the climate division of the dgmn provided us with monthly data from 1960 to 2015 at 12 meteorological stations rainfall within and around the chari logone basin a systematic quality control was carried out on the raw data to remove or correct obvious outliers we were unable to obtain data from the national networks of the cameroonian central african and sudanese parts the database was completed with monthly interannual averages obtained from two monographs published by the orstom institute providing information on the chari basin billon et al 1968 with 74 precipitation stations covering periods of 6 27 years between 1940 and 1967 and on the logone basin cabot 1965 with 27 stations covering 4 22 years between 1934 and 1956 a total of 89 referenced stations were available since 12 stations were referred to in common by the two monographs we also used reanalysis data from the climate research unit cru university of east anglia norwich uk and the uk department for environment transport and regions these are interpolated with actual monthly precipitation since 1900 at a grid resolution of 0 5 in latitude and longitude the method of processing precipitation in grids is described in the work of hulme et al 1995 and jones and hulme 1996 data for version cru ts 4 02 are available on the website https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg described by harris et al 2014 these data were used for comparison with our interpolated and reconstructed data and therefore for validation our method of processing precipitation data 3 2 river discharge a large hydrometric database is available at the lcbc lake chad basin commission these data which initially come from the chadian national network of the water resources department dre were processed within the framework of the integrated management program of transboundary basin resources in africa lake chad basin component chenevey 2011 the main activities of the project were to collect hydrometeorological data improve the measurement network and to correct the gaps efstratiadis et al 2013 the origin of the data their processing the types of models the input and calibration parameters as well as the reconstruction method are all detailed in a report by the lcbc and the 9th fed european development fund verdonck 2011 this database includes monthly river discharges from 30 hydrometric stations of the chari logone basin covering different periods between 1950 and 2007 based on the quantity of data 8 stations were selected and used in the present study table 1 for the period 2000 2016 we obtained from the dre daily river discharge data for five stations table 1 two on the chari 3 and 7bis stations two on the logone stations 4 and 6bis and one on the chari logone 8 3 3 data quality and reconstruction of missing flow data a systematic data quality verification was performed on the raw data to ensure the reliability of the series it is important to note that observations were interrupted on most of the measuring stations during 1980 and 1981 during the period of civil war except on the stations of mailao logone gana and moundou after the measurement interruption most of the stations were put back into service the limnimetric scales were repositioned when necessary and for each station a new gauging curve was established an exhaustive comparison of the gauging curves before and after this interruption was performed by nelngar 1989 in addition the careful time series analysis evidenced an overall shift between the data from the maïlao station and those from n djamena tp fig 2 as the n djamena tp station is believed not to have undergone any scale modification or derating after years of disruption this suggests an inconsistency at the maïlao station the latter was not interrupted but underwent a displacement of scale indeed despite the continuous record at the maïlao station a 1 meter scale shift was performed in 1985 as reported by nelngar 1989 followed by the establishment of a new gauging curve the two gauging curves for the maïlao station are parallel to each other but the offset is slightly less than 1 m the comparison of flows at maïlao and n djamena tp shows two robust and parallel linear correlations based on the difference in the y intercept the offset is estimated to be around 100 m3 s to understand whether the shift is explained by an underestimation of river discharge values at maïlao before 1985 or if recent flows are overestimated we compared the monthly data from maïlao with the daily data from the chagoua station located 59 km downstream from maïlao for the chari for the common period from 2000 to 2007 the two datasets were found to be consistent except during the low water period based on this criterion we conclude that there was an underestimation of 100 m3 s for the maïlao data before 1985 this underestimation was taken into account in our analysis many gaps remain in addition to the 1980 1981 war period where possible we have reconstructed the data in order to make the best use of the information available without introducing too much uncertainty for the monthly data a normalized average flow regime was established based on a coefficient ki calculated for a month i from the monthly interannual average 1950 2007 1 k i q i q m a x where qi is the interannual average flow of month i and qmax the interannual maximum flow value for the month of october except for the maximum flood period september october and november the missing data corresponding to the month i of a given year n were replaced by 2 q i n k i q m a x n this method makes it possible not to eliminate incomplete years when the gaps correspond to periods of low water which have little impact on the robustness of the annual average for the daily time step missing data were replaced when corresponding to a period of unequivocal variation in flows either ascending or descending by assuming a continuous and linear variation in flows linear interpolation in this way was used to fill some gaps in the daily flow series period 2000 2016 the percentages of missing data are displayed in table 1 with an evaluation of discharge uncertainties based on the analysis of gauging curves and all available information 4 method 4 1 delineation of sub basins based on available river discharge time series eight sub basins were delineated fig 3 the srtm topo 30 data were used for the dem and the delimitation of sub basins with the qgis 3 4 5 software these contours are similar to the limits of the sub basins identified in the monographs by billon et al 1968 and cabot 1965 the main characteristics of these zones are described in table 2 it should be noted that a large part of the zone is flat and the surfaces of the flood zones can overflow into neighboring basins see description of the floodplains in section 2 2 4 2 spatial precipitation estimates as described previously 12 precipitation time series were available in the chadian part of the chari logone basin between 1950 and 2015 therefore the spatial distribution of precipitation was more robustly estimated from the dense data network available for the average 1940 1960 period billon et al 1968 cabot 1965 which also included the 12 stations available between 1950 and 2015 the spatial interpolation was performed using a kriging method nkiaka et al 2017 mahamat nour et al 2019 kriging interpolation of precipitation data from rainfall measurement stations is carried out using the gstat package of the r software semi variograms constructed with raw data show no range when no still is identifiable it is recommended to work on the residuals goovaerts 2000 snepvangers et al 2003 which represent the difference between the variable and a surface for example a plane determined by the adjustment of the data considered by a least squares method séraphin 2016 thus this method makes it possible to subtract the linear trends from the rainfall data which result from the latitudinal or continental effects in order to interpret only the purely stochastic signal i e the local variations in rainfall for the analysis of the anisotropy of the rainfall distribution we established the directional variograms in the four directions 0 45 90 and 135 examination of the variogram surface of the residuals obtained from rainfall data shows still thus making it possible to adjust classical variogram models the models and parameters used are given in table 3 the interpolation was done on 89 rainfall stations and the mesh chosen was a regular grid with a 0 1 spacing the average 1940 1960 precipitation was determined as a reference value for each sub basin i from the interpolated map pi ref then the average precipitation of a given year n was compared to the reference period using a coefficient kn defined as follows 3 k n p n p r e f where pn and pref correspond to the annual average rainfall at the 12 stations for the year n and the reference period 1940 1960 respectively finally assuming a stable spatial distribution of precipitation over time the variations of spatial precipitation over a sub basin i during the year n were calculated for 1960 2015 with 4 p i n k n p i r e f 4 3 determination of reference periods the definition of reference periods was based on the standardized index of annual river discharge measured at the outlet of the chari logone basin station 8 which is a robust integrator of the water balance at the catchment scale the standardized index mckee et al 1993 provides the deviation from a long term average and can be translated into wet or dry episodes when the index is greater than 0 5 or lower than 0 5 following the criteria proposed by balme et al 2006 the standardized index was calculated for hydrological years may to april over the 1950 2015 period following 5 i d i d σ with d i the average discharge for year i d the interannual mean σ the standard deviation of the interannual discharge the interannual variability of flows in the chari logone basin shows the non stationarity of the hydrometric evolution from 1950 to 2015 with a general downward trend since the 1950s followed by a slight increase since 1998 the chari logone discharge temporal evolution is consistent with what has been observed in most of the work on the evolution of the level of lake chad bader et al 2011 lemoalle et al 2012 bouchez et al 2016 ndehedehe et al 2016 pham duc et al 2020 and the rainfall regime in the african sub region hubert et al 1989 koumassi 2014 mahé et al 2013 mahé and olivry 1995 nkiaka et al 2017 paturel et al 1995 vissin 2007 taking into account the temporal coverage of precipitation data from 1960 and the availability of monthly discharge data for the 8 reference sub watersheds until 2007 we chose the following reference periods fig 4 wet period p1 from 1960 to 1971 corresponding to successive years represented by positive indices 8 out of 12 years have indices greater than 0 5 with an average of 1 07 intermediate period p2 from 1972 to 1979 comprising 8 consecutive years with a zero average index although with substantial interannual variations dry period p3 from 1982 to 1997 characterized by globally negative indices 13 out of 15 years have indices less than 0 5 with an average of 1 03 period p4 from 1998 to 2007 can be considered as an intermediate period of 10 years with an average index of 0 33 the indices are distributed evenly on either side of the zero on the x axis 4 4 water balance analysis the annual water balance of a sub basin can be written as follows 6 p et q with p the precipitation q the total flow r q a mm year a is the area et and the evapotranspiration for the upstream sub basins moundou manda sahr q q out while for intermediate sub basins which already receive flow from upstream the value of q can be negative in the case of the salamat basin which is a non permanent tributary of the chari river characterized by an unstable riverbed no gauging station exists nevertheless the net flow was estimated as a difference between the total chari discharge upstream stations 2 and 3 and downstream station 5 of the mouth of the bahr salamat into the chari river when calculated from several stations the uncertainty on the net flow was estimated from the combined uncertainties of all the stations used our analysis was based on the comparison of water slide q a flow coefficient q p and flow deficits p q which corresponds to the sum of the losses by evapotranspiration and infiltration et i in addition the time variations of the rainfall flow relation will be discussed on the basis of a runoff elasticity to rainfall coefficient to evaluate the amplified response of runoff to the variations of precipitation the coefficient is defined as follows sankarasubramanian et al 2001 chiew et al 2006 7 ε δ q q δ p p 5 results and discussion 5 1 spatial variations in the chari logone basin 5 1 1 precipitation the analysis of fig 5 shows that the distribution of average precipitation 1940 1960 follows a south north gradient typical of the sudano sahelian region the highest values are recorded at the southwestern part of the catchment and correspond to the direction of the monsoon flow into the basin combined with a slight orographic effect 1000 m altitude on average rainfall amounts vary from 800 to 1600 mm year in sudanese regions which are more humid in the southwest and from 200 to 800 mm year in the sahelian regions the minimum occurring in the northeast part of the catchment corresponding to the upper salamat sub basin 5 1 2 upper catchments water balance for the whole catchment the discharge represents only 5 of precipitation however the runoff ratios and flow deficits present particularly contrasted values table 4 most of the chari logone flow 92 in n djamena tp is recorded in the 3 main upper catchments manda 38 moudou 35 and sahr 19 see fig 3 for locations among them the highest runoff ratio 0 24 is found in the moundou basin and the lowest in the sahr basin 0 03 therefore although it includes the source region of the chari and the upstream part of the eponymous river the sahr basin corresponds to a strongly arid context and weakly contributes to the chari logone flow the mean hydrological regime of the chari logone river fig 6 shows that the river discharge presents a one month delay compared to the sum of the 3 main upper catchment contributions the rise of the discharge curve is faster for the moundou basin followed by the manda and then the sahr basins fig 6 the contribution of the salamat basin is intermittent and poorly determined because of the cumulated uncertainties associated to the indirect estimate the bahr salamat basin located in the sahelian belt is almost endorheic and water is mainly lost by evaporation in temporally flooded areas fig 1 except during humid periods which will be discussed later its average contribution can be considered as negligible compared to that of the other 3 upper basins it is interesting to note that there is a significant difference in the runoff values between the neighboring moundou and manda sub basins this difference cannot be attributed to climate since annual precipitation is similar the flow coefficients are very different 24 and 11 for the upstream logone upper logone and the bahr sara respectively this difference could be explained by the geological context moundou is made up of approximately 90 of basement while manda is shared between basement and the outcrop of the continental terminal ct 26 of the surface of this sub basin fig 1 it is therefore possible that a higher recharge in the ct gonçalvès et al 2020 and therefore a larger contribution to river baseflow than in the moundou sub basin could explain the lower discharge value of the moundou sub basin 5 1 3 water balance in the downstream sub basins downstream to these upper catchments the net flow acquired in the laï basin is largely compensated by the deficit observed in the yaéré flood zone fig 7 the massenya basin in the downstream part of the chari has a slightly negative average balance although associated to a large uncertainty during the maximum flood the chari and the logone overflow of the plain bongor ba illi between bousso and bongor and feeds the wide yaéré floodplains the water losses affecting the logone in the yaéré floodplains are probably due mainly to evaporation and some infiltration they are not proportional to the surface drained because the flow is concentrated in the bed of the chari and logone rivers especially during the dry season however compared to the total area of the sub basin they represent a negative flux of 127 mm year or p q of 965 mm year a more detailed analysis of the evaporation and infiltration rates in the yaéré could be carried out from a precise estimate of the flooded areas and their seasonal variations but the interannual variation of the flooded sectors is large and makes an analysis over the period considered difficult 5 2 comparison between the wet and dry periods 5 2 1 comparison of water balance results during the wet period p1 the global basin of the chari logone provided 1243 m3 s q 64 mm year while it decreased to 563 m3 s 29 mm year during the dry period p3 table 5 this difference δ q q 0 75 corresponds to a lower precipitation variation δ p p 0 155 the variation in precipitation is therefore amplified by a factor ε 4 9 thus significantly greater than the factor 3 proposed by lemoalle et al 2012 the upper logone basin at moundou is the least sensitive to rainfall variations ε 3 0 while the sahr basin which is less productive is the most sensitive ε 6 4 the manda basin shows an intermediate dependency ε 4 4 the propagation of these sensitivities from these upstream areas to the chari logone as a whole is linked to the contributions of the sub basins to the total flow of the chari logone for the logone the upper basin provides the whole flow and therefore controls the sensitivity of the logone river at its mouth with the chari ε 3 0 the contributions of the two downstream sectors intermediate laï and yaéré sub basins offset each other and do not contribute to the sensitivity of the system indeed while the contribution of intermediate logone decreased during the dry period this decrease was largely compensated by the less negative balance of yaéré which is probably explained by a smaller extension of flooded areas subject to evaporation and water infiltration within the chari river ε 5 6 for the entire chari at maïlao the combined sensitivities of the upstream chari and the bahr sara explain the overall strong sensitivity of this river the two basins located in the sahelian part bahr salamat and massenya do not contribute enough to the flow to have a significant influence on the sensitivity of the chari for these downstream basins it is also impossible to achieve a robust determination of their sensitivity to climatic variations because the uncertainties on their respective flow and runoff are too large the bahr salamat basin in particular is intermittent and although its contribution seems to have decreased from 49 to 17 m3 s between the wet and dry periods it has only a slight influence on the overall flow variations 5 2 2 comparison of hydrological regimes the average seasonal patterns of the chari logone show that the difference in the annual water levels is explained by a flood that is more intense but also longer for the wet period than for the dry period fig 8 this difference in behavior is observed for both the chari and the logone the delimitation of the various sub basins is subject to uncertainties as the very low relief of the downstream part of the basin and the formation of seasonal flooding zones can lead to seasonal exchanges between sub basins during wet years during the maximum flood the waters of the chari and logone can overflow of the bongor ba illi between bousso and bongor passing through the ba illi bed which feeds the great yaéré in addition the first geographic observers tilho 1928 bouchardeau and lefevre 1957 rodier 1966 reported that there was an exchange between the logone basin and that of bénoué that is to say a capture water from logone near eré between laï and bongor via the mayo kebbi a tributary of the benoué and sub tributary of the niger an evaluation of these transfers rodier 1966 showed that they occur mainly during strong floods for example in 1954 and that even in this case they represent less than 10 of the annual water layer of the logone under the hydrological conditions of our study these transfers are negligible 5 3 long term stability of the rainfall runoff relation during intermediate climatic periods 5 3 1 evolution of average water balances the comparison of the two intermediate periods p2 and p4 shows fairly similar average situations with however a difference of 2 and 4 respectively for precipitation and runoff table 6 in both cases there is significant interannual variability with an alternation of very dry and very wet years hydrological indices less than 0 5 and greater than 0 5 fig 4 but period p2 follows a very wet period whereas period p4 follows a very dry period which potentially influences groundwater reservoirs despite this there is no noticeable difference in the flows nor in the hydrological regimes within chari logone there is a slight difference in contribution between chari 7 and logone 3 the manda basin presents a slightly positive difference and is therefore more consistent with that of the entire chari however given the questions raised above on the stability of the rating curves in particular before and after the interruption of measurements in 1980 81 these small differences cannot be interpreted the rainfall runoff relationship did not change significantly between the two intermediate climatic conditions consequently anthropogenic influence has no detectable impact on the flows the very large amplitude of variation observed for annual flows results only from an amplification of the variations in precipitation this amplification is high because of the spatial contrasts and the role of arid sub basins these data therefore contradict the studies recently published by zhu et al 2019a 2019b who assessed the total water loss caused by climate variability and human activities these authors proposed that the losses were 16 76 km3 including the relative contribution of climate 26 83 and human activity 73 17 their work was based on models however essentially calibrated in a humid period and applied without the transferability of their parameters to a drier context having been established 5 3 2 comparison between individual years in order to further explore the question of a potential anthropogenic impact it is interesting to compare hydrologically similar years chosen in different reference periods the choice was based on the standardized flow rate indices thus we identified five years that have indices close to zero fig 4 these years and their indices are 1965 0 06 1976 0 03 1988 0 01 2003 0 01 and 2010 0 09 for these 5 years slight differences appeared in the onset intensity and duration of the flood fig 9 several factors can explain these differences the influence of the dry or wet context of previous years which could have an influence on runoff the hydrological regime of year n 1 which influences the value of the starting low of year n and of course the start of the rainy season prior to the flood and during the flood onset parallel trends the river discharge seems to be controlled by the flood intensity of the preceding year for example the year 1964 was very wet index 1 57 and the flood in 1965 started earlier than in other years conversely the years 1988 and 2010 which followed dry preceding years indices 1 84 and 1 19 displayed delayed flood onsets the regime of 2010 was prolonged more in time the highest peak of the flood was observed in 1988 for the year 1988 precipitation begins later however it is high during the season but recedes earlier than the other 5 years used for comparison this could be the explanation for the later rise and fall of the discharge curve as well as the higher maximum of 1988 in conclusion it seems that the previous low n 1 flow determines the rise of the flood n and the intensity of precipitation determines the total height of the flood the comparison of the different terms of the water balance over the five years studied table 7 shows that there is no observable change in the response of flows to precipitation 6 synthesis of discussion a detailed analysis of all the available gauging curves was carried out as well as a critical verification of the time series in order to estimate the uncertainties on the flow rates these substantial uncertainties represent at least 10 of the flow values the magnitude of these uncertainties requires careful interpretation of the comparisons of flows between stations and makes the estimates of the hydrological balances of the downstream sub watersheds in particular those of bahr salamat and massenya which are almost zero very poorly constrained on the other hand the comparison made between different time windows is much more robust subject to careful verification of the continuity of the calibrations in fact all hydrological observations were interrupted between 1980 and 1981 and we have shown that this period corresponds to a clear shift in the flows measured at the maïlao station all these elements are taken into account in our analyses our analysis highlights significant spatial contrasts in the flow of water and the hydrological contributions of the various sub basins of the chari logone the first contrast being between the chari and the logone rivers the main tributary the chari contributes 65 to the flow of the chari logone river system however this proportion is low in view of the size of its basin which represents 83 of the whole basin the detailed analysis of the seven sub basins shows that the flow of the chari logone comes mainly from the bahr sara basin 38 mainly located in the central african republic from the logone upstream of moundou 35 mainly located in cameroon and the upstream chari basin 19 mainly located in the central african republic and sudan the contrasts between the water heights flowing from these 3 upstream sub basins are significant although subject to similar climates the bahr sara has a water flow 135 mm year that is twice as low as that of the upstream logone 305 mm year which highlights the role of geology and the existence of a significant recharge over the continental terminal outcrops in the bahr sara sub basin gonçalvès et al 2020 this recharge also occurs in the upstream chari sub basin and combined with the influence of a sahelian type climate throughout its northeastern part explains the very low flow of water 29 mm year the bahr salamat sub basin mainly located in chad but also extending to sudan in its upstream part contributes only very slightly to the supply of the flow of the chari logone 7 15 although this sub basin represents 33 of the entire chari logone basin in this sub basin located entirely in a sahelian climate the flows are temporary and difficult to gauge the significant uncertainty in this estimate stems from the lack of a gauging station and an indirect estimate of the flows nevertheless it is important to stress that this highlights that a significant part of the chari logone basin is not hydrologically active and is related to the endorheic context bouchez et al 2019 the temporal variations of the flows were considerable during the period 1960 2015 they are characterized by a general downward trend responsible for a dramatic reduction in the extension of lake chad this discharge decrease in the chari logone basin is observed in several basins of tropical africa olivry 1993 mahé and olivry 1995 paturel et al 1995 vissin et al 2007 there is a close relationship between rainfall variability and flow variability mahé et al 2005 koumassi 2014 this relationship is nonlinear because the relative decrease in runoff is greater than that in rainfall lemoalle et al 2012 showed that the decrease in rainfall of about 10 led to a 30 drop in flows for the chari logone our analysis allows a more detailed and complete assessment of this relationship than what has been reported so far in the literature there is a rainfall difference of 15 5 over the entire chari logone basin between a wet 1960 1971 and dry 1982 1997 sub period this rainfall difference led to a difference in flow of 75 on average over the entire chari logone basin 47 in the upstream logone basin 69 in the bahr sara basin and 100 in the chari upstream the chari logone sub basins have elasticity coefficients of 6 4 4 4 and 3 0 respectively for chari upstream bahr sara and logone upstream recent publications claim that abstraction and anthropogenic activities are mainly responsible for the decrease in flow in the chari logone basin gao et al 2011 tellrowaï et al 2012 zhu et al 2019a 2019b mahmood and jia 2019 mahmood et al 2020 however these studies are based on models essentially calibrated in a humid period and applied without the transferability of their parameters to a drier context having been established in order to shed objective light on this question we compared hydrologically intermediate situations between the wet period and the dry period and distributed at different times of the period 1960 2015 the first comparison is based on the interannual average conditions of two periods 1972 1979 and 1998 2007 for which the average flow rate is similar it appears that the corresponding average climatic conditions were also similar the second comparison is based on individual years also chosen on the criterion of an intermediate hydrological situation between wet and dry but distributed in different average climatic contexts a comparison of the five selected years distributed between 1964 and 2010 shows that there has been no observable change in the response of flows to precipitation the slight differences in runoff coefficients are explained by the influence of year n 1 which determines the low water flow at the start of the season and the base flow of the rising flood the analysis of hydro climatic data therefore shows no evidence of an anthropogenic impact that would lead to a decrease in flows or a modification of the hydrological regime in the chari logone basin between 1964 and 2010 it is nevertheless clear that water withdrawals in the chari logone basin are occurring coe and foley 2001 world bank 2002 united nations environmental programme unep 2004 tellrowaï et al 2012 the contribution of the chari logone waters to lake chad is 26 km3 on an interannual average 1960 2015 the total withdrawal for irrigation is estimated at 1 8 km3 year in the basin and the lake lemoalle et al 2014 however our results show that the order of magnitude of this withdrawal remains moderate and that its influence is not detected in the hydrological balances of the various sub basins except for a few uncertainties finally our analysis also made it possible to hydrologically situate the recent period from 2013 to 2015 the annual average precipitation for the recent period 2013 2015 is only slightly different from the interannual average period of 1960 2015 on the other hand the flow monitoring is variable the apparent temporal decrease in flows from the upstream chari and also the entire chari could be due in particular to the great uncertainties in the estimation of average precipitation and the absence of vegetation cover in the chari basin 7 conclusion we have synthesized and analyzed all the available hydroclimatic data for the chari logone basin during the period 1960 2015 in order to characterize the spatial contrasts the temporal variations and the respective sensitivities of the various sub watersheds to climatic variations the average flow of the chari logone during the period 1960 2015 was 823 m3 s or a water height of 42 mm year which represents 5 of precipitation in the watershed this very low discharge ratio makes it highly sensitive to variations in precipitation our hydroclimatic

8238,study region chari logone river basin lake chad basin study focus the objective of this study was to better understand the hydrological functioning of the chari logone basin under the effect of the high variability of rainfall which has affected the sahel during the last sixty years the study is based on hydro climatic data for the period between 1960 and 2015 obtained from the national and international institutions this work based on the following steps 1 average hydrological balances were estimated for different geographical areas to identify the most productive parts of the basin 2 the rainfall runoff relation was compared for the wettest and driest decades of the study period to identify the areas that contribute most to the amplification of the hydrological response to variations in rainfall 3 the long term period stability of the rainfall runoff relation was evaluated for climatic conditions close to the average situation in order to detect potential evidence of the anthropogenic impact new hydrologic insights for the region during the period 1960 2015 the average water flow in the chari logone basin 42 mm year represented only 5 of precipitation between the two climatically most contrasted wet 1960 1971 and dry 1982 1997 periods the average flow differed by 75 against a decrease of 15 of precipitation our hydroclimatic data show no clearly detectable evidence of an anthropogenic impact responsible for a decrease in flows or a modification of the hydrological regime in the chari logone basin keywords lake chad chari logone hydrological climate and variability 1 introduction since the middle of the last century the lake chad basin has experienced a high variability in rainfall fourissala and gormo 2012 lavergne 2017 with consequently a huge variability in the level and extent of lake chad olivry et al 1996 lemoalle et al 2012 after a wet phase between the 1950s and the 1960s lake chad experienced dramatic dry conditions which decreased the extent of the lake by over tenfold since the beginning of the 1990s rainfall has slowly increased affected by a strong interannual variability inducing a recovery of the lake pham duc et al 2020 whereas climate changes are thought to be one of the main factors explaining the variability of the level of the lake the impact of the increase in human activities is still debated coe and foley 2001 gao et al 2011 zhu et al 2019a 2019b while human activities have had an undeniable impact on the runoff and flow of rivers in the sahelo sudanian region it is rather through the change in land use linked to deforestation and land clearing leblanc et al 2006 descroix et al 2009 most often resulting in an increase in flows despite the overall decrease in precipitation in the sahelian zone and a more contrasted response in the sudanian zone descroix et al 2009 gal et al 2017 the decrease in precipitation observed throughout the sahel region during the 1970s and the 1980s is undeniable and it is important to provide quantitative information on the response of flows within the lake chad basin to these variations in precipitation in order to estimate the respective roles of human activities and climate change based on the analysis of hydroclimatic data series an initial quantification suggested that when the rainfall in the basin varies by 10 the flow of the chari varies by around 30 descroix et al 2009 lemoalle et al 2012 gal et al 2017 other studies have sought to assess this relationship using rainfall runoff modeling vuillaume 1981 ardoin bardin et al 2009 gonçalvès et al 2020 one of the major difficulties encountered by this work remains the limited and incomplete nature of long term hydro climatic data in the region in addition the logistical and technical constraints and the sahelian context make it difficult to establish or update robust gauging curves therefore it is important to take into account the unavoidable uncertainties associated with river discharge data a robust quantification of the relationship between climate variability and runoff within the chari logone basin as well as the associated uncertainties remains necessary zhu et al 2019a 2019b conducted a study to assess the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability on water loss from the flow of the chari logone river using a conceptual and statistical approach mahmood and jia 2019 used a hydrological approach to determine hydro climatic changes in the active parts of the lake chad basin using an analysis of trends and causes of the decline in stream flow to lake chad due to human interventions and climate variability some of these studies point to the preponderant impact of human activities and in particular an increase in abstraction mainly for irrigation purposes compared to that of climate variability to explain the overall drop in lake level observed in recent decades however this work assumes more than the existence of a significant increase in water withdrawals in the chari logone basin a rainfall runoff model calibrated in humid climatic conditions is difficult to transpose to different climatic conditions given the importance of climatic and hydrological variations in this system a thorough analysis of the data is essential central questions that we must adress here are is the hydrological variability of lake chad and its chari logone system attributable to climate change and or human activities has this hydrological variability led to a change in the behavior and functioning of the chari le logone system the objective of this work was to better understand the sensitivity of the hydrological functioning of the chari logone basin to rainfall fluctuations and to identify the potential impact of anthropogenic factors the analysis of the relationship between the rainfall drought observed since 1970 and the hydrological drought in recent decades is a key element in assessing the vulnerability of the water resource within the chari logone basin but also throughout the region and the sub regions whose economy depends largely on lake chad and these variations like most lakes located in a hydrologically closed drainage system the fluctuation of lake chad is directly related to the influx of rivers which varies according to the hydrological water budget in the basin the various studies carried out on the hydrological balance of lake chad olivry et al 1996 bader et al 2011 bouchez et al 2016 have shown that its water comes mainly from the chari logone system more than 82 supplemented by direct precipitation 14 on the lake and less significant contributions from el beid yaéré outlet and komadougu yobe lemoalle et al 2012 lake chad is therefore highly dependent on water fluxes in the chari logone basin located in the southern part of the lake chad basin which constitutes the main hydrologically active area of the basin bouchez et al 2019 gonçalvès et al 2020 a detailed understanding of the variability of lake chad requires understanding the response of flows within the chari logone basin to variations in precipitation this is essential for estimating the respective roles of climate change and human activities in the recent and future evolution of lake chad the analysis of spatial and temporal variations of the water balance in the chari logone basin presented herein followed different steps 1 average hydrological balances were estimated for different geographical areas to identify the most productive parts of the basin in terms of surface runoff and the potential groundwater recharge areas the spatial analysis was based on different sub basins treated separately for upper catchment and downstream areas 2 the rainfall runoff relation was compared for the wettest and driest decades of the study period to identify the areas that contribute most to the amplification of the hydrological response to variations in rainfall 3 the long term period stability of the rainfall runoff relation was evaluated for climatic conditions close to the average situation in order to detect potential evidence of the anthropogenic impact for this purpose reference sub basins were determined and associated spatial precipitation and runoff estimated the reference periods were defined and the water balance parameters to be used for the analysis were identified 2 study area description 2 1 geological context the chari logone basin bcl is the hydrologically active part of the lake chad basin it covers an area of 613 000 km2 and its borders are surrounded by a set of mountain ranges guera north ouaddaï east central african south and adamaoua south west ranges fig 1 the geological formations consist mainly of the outcropping precambrian basement mainly represented by granites and metamorphic rocks and the sedimentary series of the tertiary sandstone formation of the continental terminal and of the quaternary fluvial or fluvio lacustrine formations louis 1970 the quaternary and the continental terminal are the main sedimentary aquifer systems in the area schneider and wolf 1992 groundwater also circulates in the hard rocks of the precambrian basement supporting the base flow in the upper part of the chari logone bouchez et al 2019 gonçalves et al 2020 2 2 climate and hydrology the climate of the chari logone basin is characterized by the confluence of two air masses the dry northeastern harmattan of continental origin and the humid southwestern monsoon of oceanic origin the basin is contrasted from the sudanese climate in the south to the semi arid climate in the north the climate is tropical with two seasons a dry season and a wet season the rainy season begins in may and ends in october and most of the precipitation falls in july and august annual precipitation was 970 mm and 550 mm respectively in sarh and n djamena between 1984 and 2014 evaporation rates show a strong seasonal cycle following the air temperature cycle mahamat nour 2019 the chari and the logone are the two main rivers in the chari logone basin the chari originates in the central african republic at an altitude of between 500 and 600 m the logone starts on the adamawa plateau in cameroon with an altitude ranging from 305 to 835 m cabot 1965 gac 1980 the confluence of the chari and logone rivers is located in n djamena 110 km upstream from lake chad fig 1 the chari logone receives groundwater from the upper basin of the precambrian basement gonçalvès et al 2020 while in the lower part water from the chari logone flows from the river to the quaternary aquifer bouchez et al 2019 flood prone areas give rise to rich ecosystems supporting biodiversity and key economic activities such as fishing breeding and agriculture in addition to regional importance these flood zones are of international importance in ecology botany zoology hydrology and are recognized as ramsar sites vassolo et al 2016 at the height of the discharge the logone and the chari flood the surrounding plains with their discharges olivry et al 1996 nkiaka et al 2018 the flood plains of the chari logone basin are of particular importance in contributing to the renewal of groundwater in the basin seeber et al 2014 recent studies by lcbc bgr vassolo et al 2016 showed that aquifer recharge comes from stagnant water in floodplains they also play an important role in the hydrological balance of the chari logone basin in particular by constituting large areas of evaporation and having a potential impact on water chemistry lienou 2007 delclaux et al 2011 seeber et al 2014 lemoalle et al 2014 the precipitation over these flooded plains does not compensate for the net loss by evaporation the area of the flood plains is variable and depends on the amount of rainfall that has fallen on the basin jung et al 2011 vassolo et al 2016 the main flood plains of the chari logone basin are fig 1 the yaeré plain the yaeré is a floodplain in northern cameroon this plain is flooded by rains and overflows from the logone the accumulated water is taken up by the evapotranspiration effect the average extent of flooded surface between 2000 and 2014 was 2767 km2 vassolo et al 2016 the massenya plain the bahr erguig partially silted up is a defluent that occasionally feeds the floodplain of massenya the salamat plain am timan the bahr salamat sub basin forms more or less temporary marshes and floods a depression 20 km long in wet periods the floodplains of salamat are very largely flooded with the exception of the sandy ridges the logone loses water along its right bank from ba illi to bongor towards the large plain drained by the ba illi and other secondary depressions fig 1 further north at bongor the logone loses water through its left bank towards the yaéré bouchardeau and lefevre 1957 3 data acquisition 3 1 precipitation several types of precipitation datasets are available for the lake chad basin the chari logone basin is shared between 4 countries cameroon the central african republic sudan and chad the acquisition and management of rainfall data on each national territory are managed by the relevant services of each country in chad the general directorate of national meteorology dgmn of the ministry of civil aviation and meteorology is in charge of all available stations and datasets in the country most of these stations were installed during the colonial period by researchers from the overseas scientific and technical research office orstom an organization now replaced by the ird research institute for development and the agency for the safety of air navigation in africa and madagascar asecna they are still mostly functional despite some periods of interruption linked in particular to the civil war in chad and the sub region at the end of the 1980s the climate division of the dgmn provided us with monthly data from 1960 to 2015 at 12 meteorological stations rainfall within and around the chari logone basin a systematic quality control was carried out on the raw data to remove or correct obvious outliers we were unable to obtain data from the national networks of the cameroonian central african and sudanese parts the database was completed with monthly interannual averages obtained from two monographs published by the orstom institute providing information on the chari basin billon et al 1968 with 74 precipitation stations covering periods of 6 27 years between 1940 and 1967 and on the logone basin cabot 1965 with 27 stations covering 4 22 years between 1934 and 1956 a total of 89 referenced stations were available since 12 stations were referred to in common by the two monographs we also used reanalysis data from the climate research unit cru university of east anglia norwich uk and the uk department for environment transport and regions these are interpolated with actual monthly precipitation since 1900 at a grid resolution of 0 5 in latitude and longitude the method of processing precipitation in grids is described in the work of hulme et al 1995 and jones and hulme 1996 data for version cru ts 4 02 are available on the website https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg described by harris et al 2014 these data were used for comparison with our interpolated and reconstructed data and therefore for validation our method of processing precipitation data 3 2 river discharge a large hydrometric database is available at the lcbc lake chad basin commission these data which initially come from the chadian national network of the water resources department dre were processed within the framework of the integrated management program of transboundary basin resources in africa lake chad basin component chenevey 2011 the main activities of the project were to collect hydrometeorological data improve the measurement network and to correct the gaps efstratiadis et al 2013 the origin of the data their processing the types of models the input and calibration parameters as well as the reconstruction method are all detailed in a report by the lcbc and the 9th fed european development fund verdonck 2011 this database includes monthly river discharges from 30 hydrometric stations of the chari logone basin covering different periods between 1950 and 2007 based on the quantity of data 8 stations were selected and used in the present study table 1 for the period 2000 2016 we obtained from the dre daily river discharge data for five stations table 1 two on the chari 3 and 7bis stations two on the logone stations 4 and 6bis and one on the chari logone 8 3 3 data quality and reconstruction of missing flow data a systematic data quality verification was performed on the raw data to ensure the reliability of the series it is important to note that observations were interrupted on most of the measuring stations during 1980 and 1981 during the period of civil war except on the stations of mailao logone gana and moundou after the measurement interruption most of the stations were put back into service the limnimetric scales were repositioned when necessary and for each station a new gauging curve was established an exhaustive comparison of the gauging curves before and after this interruption was performed by nelngar 1989 in addition the careful time series analysis evidenced an overall shift between the data from the maïlao station and those from n djamena tp fig 2 as the n djamena tp station is believed not to have undergone any scale modification or derating after years of disruption this suggests an inconsistency at the maïlao station the latter was not interrupted but underwent a displacement of scale indeed despite the continuous record at the maïlao station a 1 meter scale shift was performed in 1985 as reported by nelngar 1989 followed by the establishment of a new gauging curve the two gauging curves for the maïlao station are parallel to each other but the offset is slightly less than 1 m the comparison of flows at maïlao and n djamena tp shows two robust and parallel linear correlations based on the difference in the y intercept the offset is estimated to be around 100 m3 s to understand whether the shift is explained by an underestimation of river discharge values at maïlao before 1985 or if recent flows are overestimated we compared the monthly data from maïlao with the daily data from the chagoua station located 59 km downstream from maïlao for the chari for the common period from 2000 to 2007 the two datasets were found to be consistent except during the low water period based on this criterion we conclude that there was an underestimation of 100 m3 s for the maïlao data before 1985 this underestimation was taken into account in our analysis many gaps remain in addition to the 1980 1981 war period where possible we have reconstructed the data in order to make the best use of the information available without introducing too much uncertainty for the monthly data a normalized average flow regime was established based on a coefficient ki calculated for a month i from the monthly interannual average 1950 2007 1 k i q i q m a x where qi is the interannual average flow of month i and qmax the interannual maximum flow value for the month of october except for the maximum flood period september october and november the missing data corresponding to the month i of a given year n were replaced by 2 q i n k i q m a x n this method makes it possible not to eliminate incomplete years when the gaps correspond to periods of low water which have little impact on the robustness of the annual average for the daily time step missing data were replaced when corresponding to a period of unequivocal variation in flows either ascending or descending by assuming a continuous and linear variation in flows linear interpolation in this way was used to fill some gaps in the daily flow series period 2000 2016 the percentages of missing data are displayed in table 1 with an evaluation of discharge uncertainties based on the analysis of gauging curves and all available information 4 method 4 1 delineation of sub basins based on available river discharge time series eight sub basins were delineated fig 3 the srtm topo 30 data were used for the dem and the delimitation of sub basins with the qgis 3 4 5 software these contours are similar to the limits of the sub basins identified in the monographs by billon et al 1968 and cabot 1965 the main characteristics of these zones are described in table 2 it should be noted that a large part of the zone is flat and the surfaces of the flood zones can overflow into neighboring basins see description of the floodplains in section 2 2 4 2 spatial precipitation estimates as described previously 12 precipitation time series were available in the chadian part of the chari logone basin between 1950 and 2015 therefore the spatial distribution of precipitation was more robustly estimated from the dense data network available for the average 1940 1960 period billon et al 1968 cabot 1965 which also included the 12 stations available between 1950 and 2015 the spatial interpolation was performed using a kriging method nkiaka et al 2017 mahamat nour et al 2019 kriging interpolation of precipitation data from rainfall measurement stations is carried out using the gstat package of the r software semi variograms constructed with raw data show no range when no still is identifiable it is recommended to work on the residuals goovaerts 2000 snepvangers et al 2003 which represent the difference between the variable and a surface for example a plane determined by the adjustment of the data considered by a least squares method séraphin 2016 thus this method makes it possible to subtract the linear trends from the rainfall data which result from the latitudinal or continental effects in order to interpret only the purely stochastic signal i e the local variations in rainfall for the analysis of the anisotropy of the rainfall distribution we established the directional variograms in the four directions 0 45 90 and 135 examination of the variogram surface of the residuals obtained from rainfall data shows still thus making it possible to adjust classical variogram models the models and parameters used are given in table 3 the interpolation was done on 89 rainfall stations and the mesh chosen was a regular grid with a 0 1 spacing the average 1940 1960 precipitation was determined as a reference value for each sub basin i from the interpolated map pi ref then the average precipitation of a given year n was compared to the reference period using a coefficient kn defined as follows 3 k n p n p r e f where pn and pref correspond to the annual average rainfall at the 12 stations for the year n and the reference period 1940 1960 respectively finally assuming a stable spatial distribution of precipitation over time the variations of spatial precipitation over a sub basin i during the year n were calculated for 1960 2015 with 4 p i n k n p i r e f 4 3 determination of reference periods the definition of reference periods was based on the standardized index of annual river discharge measured at the outlet of the chari logone basin station 8 which is a robust integrator of the water balance at the catchment scale the standardized index mckee et al 1993 provides the deviation from a long term average and can be translated into wet or dry episodes when the index is greater than 0 5 or lower than 0 5 following the criteria proposed by balme et al 2006 the standardized index was calculated for hydrological years may to april over the 1950 2015 period following 5 i d i d σ with d i the average discharge for year i d the interannual mean σ the standard deviation of the interannual discharge the interannual variability of flows in the chari logone basin shows the non stationarity of the hydrometric evolution from 1950 to 2015 with a general downward trend since the 1950s followed by a slight increase since 1998 the chari logone discharge temporal evolution is consistent with what has been observed in most of the work on the evolution of the level of lake chad bader et al 2011 lemoalle et al 2012 bouchez et al 2016 ndehedehe et al 2016 pham duc et al 2020 and the rainfall regime in the african sub region hubert et al 1989 koumassi 2014 mahé et al 2013 mahé and olivry 1995 nkiaka et al 2017 paturel et al 1995 vissin 2007 taking into account the temporal coverage of precipitation data from 1960 and the availability of monthly discharge data for the 8 reference sub watersheds until 2007 we chose the following reference periods fig 4 wet period p1 from 1960 to 1971 corresponding to successive years represented by positive indices 8 out of 12 years have indices greater than 0 5 with an average of 1 07 intermediate period p2 from 1972 to 1979 comprising 8 consecutive years with a zero average index although with substantial interannual variations dry period p3 from 1982 to 1997 characterized by globally negative indices 13 out of 15 years have indices less than 0 5 with an average of 1 03 period p4 from 1998 to 2007 can be considered as an intermediate period of 10 years with an average index of 0 33 the indices are distributed evenly on either side of the zero on the x axis 4 4 water balance analysis the annual water balance of a sub basin can be written as follows 6 p et q with p the precipitation q the total flow r q a mm year a is the area et and the evapotranspiration for the upstream sub basins moundou manda sahr q q out while for intermediate sub basins which already receive flow from upstream the value of q can be negative in the case of the salamat basin which is a non permanent tributary of the chari river characterized by an unstable riverbed no gauging station exists nevertheless the net flow was estimated as a difference between the total chari discharge upstream stations 2 and 3 and downstream station 5 of the mouth of the bahr salamat into the chari river when calculated from several stations the uncertainty on the net flow was estimated from the combined uncertainties of all the stations used our analysis was based on the comparison of water slide q a flow coefficient q p and flow deficits p q which corresponds to the sum of the losses by evapotranspiration and infiltration et i in addition the time variations of the rainfall flow relation will be discussed on the basis of a runoff elasticity to rainfall coefficient to evaluate the amplified response of runoff to the variations of precipitation the coefficient is defined as follows sankarasubramanian et al 2001 chiew et al 2006 7 ε δ q q δ p p 5 results and discussion 5 1 spatial variations in the chari logone basin 5 1 1 precipitation the analysis of fig 5 shows that the distribution of average precipitation 1940 1960 follows a south north gradient typical of the sudano sahelian region the highest values are recorded at the southwestern part of the catchment and correspond to the direction of the monsoon flow into the basin combined with a slight orographic effect 1000 m altitude on average rainfall amounts vary from 800 to 1600 mm year in sudanese regions which are more humid in the southwest and from 200 to 800 mm year in the sahelian regions the minimum occurring in the northeast part of the catchment corresponding to the upper salamat sub basin 5 1 2 upper catchments water balance for the whole catchment the discharge represents only 5 of precipitation however the runoff ratios and flow deficits present particularly contrasted values table 4 most of the chari logone flow 92 in n djamena tp is recorded in the 3 main upper catchments manda 38 moudou 35 and sahr 19 see fig 3 for locations among them the highest runoff ratio 0 24 is found in the moundou basin and the lowest in the sahr basin 0 03 therefore although it includes the source region of the chari and the upstream part of the eponymous river the sahr basin corresponds to a strongly arid context and weakly contributes to the chari logone flow the mean hydrological regime of the chari logone river fig 6 shows that the river discharge presents a one month delay compared to the sum of the 3 main upper catchment contributions the rise of the discharge curve is faster for the moundou basin followed by the manda and then the sahr basins fig 6 the contribution of the salamat basin is intermittent and poorly determined because of the cumulated uncertainties associated to the indirect estimate the bahr salamat basin located in the sahelian belt is almost endorheic and water is mainly lost by evaporation in temporally flooded areas fig 1 except during humid periods which will be discussed later its average contribution can be considered as negligible compared to that of the other 3 upper basins it is interesting to note that there is a significant difference in the runoff values between the neighboring moundou and manda sub basins this difference cannot be attributed to climate since annual precipitation is similar the flow coefficients are very different 24 and 11 for the upstream logone upper logone and the bahr sara respectively this difference could be explained by the geological context moundou is made up of approximately 90 of basement while manda is shared between basement and the outcrop of the continental terminal ct 26 of the surface of this sub basin fig 1 it is therefore possible that a higher recharge in the ct gonçalvès et al 2020 and therefore a larger contribution to river baseflow than in the moundou sub basin could explain the lower discharge value of the moundou sub basin 5 1 3 water balance in the downstream sub basins downstream to these upper catchments the net flow acquired in the laï basin is largely compensated by the deficit observed in the yaéré flood zone fig 7 the massenya basin in the downstream part of the chari has a slightly negative average balance although associated to a large uncertainty during the maximum flood the chari and the logone overflow of the plain bongor ba illi between bousso and bongor and feeds the wide yaéré floodplains the water losses affecting the logone in the yaéré floodplains are probably due mainly to evaporation and some infiltration they are not proportional to the surface drained because the flow is concentrated in the bed of the chari and logone rivers especially during the dry season however compared to the total area of the sub basin they represent a negative flux of 127 mm year or p q of 965 mm year a more detailed analysis of the evaporation and infiltration rates in the yaéré could be carried out from a precise estimate of the flooded areas and their seasonal variations but the interannual variation of the flooded sectors is large and makes an analysis over the period considered difficult 5 2 comparison between the wet and dry periods 5 2 1 comparison of water balance results during the wet period p1 the global basin of the chari logone provided 1243 m3 s q 64 mm year while it decreased to 563 m3 s 29 mm year during the dry period p3 table 5 this difference δ q q 0 75 corresponds to a lower precipitation variation δ p p 0 155 the variation in precipitation is therefore amplified by a factor ε 4 9 thus significantly greater than the factor 3 proposed by lemoalle et al 2012 the upper logone basin at moundou is the least sensitive to rainfall variations ε 3 0 while the sahr basin which is less productive is the most sensitive ε 6 4 the manda basin shows an intermediate dependency ε 4 4 the propagation of these sensitivities from these upstream areas to the chari logone as a whole is linked to the contributions of the sub basins to the total flow of the chari logone for the logone the upper basin provides the whole flow and therefore controls the sensitivity of the logone river at its mouth with the chari ε 3 0 the contributions of the two downstream sectors intermediate laï and yaéré sub basins offset each other and do not contribute to the sensitivity of the system indeed while the contribution of intermediate logone decreased during the dry period this decrease was largely compensated by the less negative balance of yaéré which is probably explained by a smaller extension of flooded areas subject to evaporation and water infiltration within the chari river ε 5 6 for the entire chari at maïlao the combined sensitivities of the upstream chari and the bahr sara explain the overall strong sensitivity of this river the two basins located in the sahelian part bahr salamat and massenya do not contribute enough to the flow to have a significant influence on the sensitivity of the chari for these downstream basins it is also impossible to achieve a robust determination of their sensitivity to climatic variations because the uncertainties on their respective flow and runoff are too large the bahr salamat basin in particular is intermittent and although its contribution seems to have decreased from 49 to 17 m3 s between the wet and dry periods it has only a slight influence on the overall flow variations 5 2 2 comparison of hydrological regimes the average seasonal patterns of the chari logone show that the difference in the annual water levels is explained by a flood that is more intense but also longer for the wet period than for the dry period fig 8 this difference in behavior is observed for both the chari and the logone the delimitation of the various sub basins is subject to uncertainties as the very low relief of the downstream part of the basin and the formation of seasonal flooding zones can lead to seasonal exchanges between sub basins during wet years during the maximum flood the waters of the chari and logone can overflow of the bongor ba illi between bousso and bongor passing through the ba illi bed which feeds the great yaéré in addition the first geographic observers tilho 1928 bouchardeau and lefevre 1957 rodier 1966 reported that there was an exchange between the logone basin and that of bénoué that is to say a capture water from logone near eré between laï and bongor via the mayo kebbi a tributary of the benoué and sub tributary of the niger an evaluation of these transfers rodier 1966 showed that they occur mainly during strong floods for example in 1954 and that even in this case they represent less than 10 of the annual water layer of the logone under the hydrological conditions of our study these transfers are negligible 5 3 long term stability of the rainfall runoff relation during intermediate climatic periods 5 3 1 evolution of average water balances the comparison of the two intermediate periods p2 and p4 shows fairly similar average situations with however a difference of 2 and 4 respectively for precipitation and runoff table 6 in both cases there is significant interannual variability with an alternation of very dry and very wet years hydrological indices less than 0 5 and greater than 0 5 fig 4 but period p2 follows a very wet period whereas period p4 follows a very dry period which potentially influences groundwater reservoirs despite this there is no noticeable difference in the flows nor in the hydrological regimes within chari logone there is a slight difference in contribution between chari 7 and logone 3 the manda basin presents a slightly positive difference and is therefore more consistent with that of the entire chari however given the questions raised above on the stability of the rating curves in particular before and after the interruption of measurements in 1980 81 these small differences cannot be interpreted the rainfall runoff relationship did not change significantly between the two intermediate climatic conditions consequently anthropogenic influence has no detectable impact on the flows the very large amplitude of variation observed for annual flows results only from an amplification of the variations in precipitation this amplification is high because of the spatial contrasts and the role of arid sub basins these data therefore contradict the studies recently published by zhu et al 2019a 2019b who assessed the total water loss caused by climate variability and human activities these authors proposed that the losses were 16 76 km3 including the relative contribution of climate 26 83 and human activity 73 17 their work was based on models however essentially calibrated in a humid period and applied without the transferability of their parameters to a drier context having been established 5 3 2 comparison between individual years in order to further explore the question of a potential anthropogenic impact it is interesting to compare hydrologically similar years chosen in different reference periods the choice was based on the standardized flow rate indices thus we identified five years that have indices close to zero fig 4 these years and their indices are 1965 0 06 1976 0 03 1988 0 01 2003 0 01 and 2010 0 09 for these 5 years slight differences appeared in the onset intensity and duration of the flood fig 9 several factors can explain these differences the influence of the dry or wet context of previous years which could have an influence on runoff the hydrological regime of year n 1 which influences the value of the starting low of year n and of course the start of the rainy season prior to the flood and during the flood onset parallel trends the river discharge seems to be controlled by the flood intensity of the preceding year for example the year 1964 was very wet index 1 57 and the flood in 1965 started earlier than in other years conversely the years 1988 and 2010 which followed dry preceding years indices 1 84 and 1 19 displayed delayed flood onsets the regime of 2010 was prolonged more in time the highest peak of the flood was observed in 1988 for the year 1988 precipitation begins later however it is high during the season but recedes earlier than the other 5 years used for comparison this could be the explanation for the later rise and fall of the discharge curve as well as the higher maximum of 1988 in conclusion it seems that the previous low n 1 flow determines the rise of the flood n and the intensity of precipitation determines the total height of the flood the comparison of the different terms of the water balance over the five years studied table 7 shows that there is no observable change in the response of flows to precipitation 6 synthesis of discussion a detailed analysis of all the available gauging curves was carried out as well as a critical verification of the time series in order to estimate the uncertainties on the flow rates these substantial uncertainties represent at least 10 of the flow values the magnitude of these uncertainties requires careful interpretation of the comparisons of flows between stations and makes the estimates of the hydrological balances of the downstream sub watersheds in particular those of bahr salamat and massenya which are almost zero very poorly constrained on the other hand the comparison made between different time windows is much more robust subject to careful verification of the continuity of the calibrations in fact all hydrological observations were interrupted between 1980 and 1981 and we have shown that this period corresponds to a clear shift in the flows measured at the maïlao station all these elements are taken into account in our analyses our analysis highlights significant spatial contrasts in the flow of water and the hydrological contributions of the various sub basins of the chari logone the first contrast being between the chari and the logone rivers the main tributary the chari contributes 65 to the flow of the chari logone river system however this proportion is low in view of the size of its basin which represents 83 of the whole basin the detailed analysis of the seven sub basins shows that the flow of the chari logone comes mainly from the bahr sara basin 38 mainly located in the central african republic from the logone upstream of moundou 35 mainly located in cameroon and the upstream chari basin 19 mainly located in the central african republic and sudan the contrasts between the water heights flowing from these 3 upstream sub basins are significant although subject to similar climates the bahr sara has a water flow 135 mm year that is twice as low as that of the upstream logone 305 mm year which highlights the role of geology and the existence of a significant recharge over the continental terminal outcrops in the bahr sara sub basin gonçalvès et al 2020 this recharge also occurs in the upstream chari sub basin and combined with the influence of a sahelian type climate throughout its northeastern part explains the very low flow of water 29 mm year the bahr salamat sub basin mainly located in chad but also extending to sudan in its upstream part contributes only very slightly to the supply of the flow of the chari logone 7 15 although this sub basin represents 33 of the entire chari logone basin in this sub basin located entirely in a sahelian climate the flows are temporary and difficult to gauge the significant uncertainty in this estimate stems from the lack of a gauging station and an indirect estimate of the flows nevertheless it is important to stress that this highlights that a significant part of the chari logone basin is not hydrologically active and is related to the endorheic context bouchez et al 2019 the temporal variations of the flows were considerable during the period 1960 2015 they are characterized by a general downward trend responsible for a dramatic reduction in the extension of lake chad this discharge decrease in the chari logone basin is observed in several basins of tropical africa olivry 1993 mahé and olivry 1995 paturel et al 1995 vissin et al 2007 there is a close relationship between rainfall variability and flow variability mahé et al 2005 koumassi 2014 this relationship is nonlinear because the relative decrease in runoff is greater than that in rainfall lemoalle et al 2012 showed that the decrease in rainfall of about 10 led to a 30 drop in flows for the chari logone our analysis allows a more detailed and complete assessment of this relationship than what has been reported so far in the literature there is a rainfall difference of 15 5 over the entire chari logone basin between a wet 1960 1971 and dry 1982 1997 sub period this rainfall difference led to a difference in flow of 75 on average over the entire chari logone basin 47 in the upstream logone basin 69 in the bahr sara basin and 100 in the chari upstream the chari logone sub basins have elasticity coefficients of 6 4 4 4 and 3 0 respectively for chari upstream bahr sara and logone upstream recent publications claim that abstraction and anthropogenic activities are mainly responsible for the decrease in flow in the chari logone basin gao et al 2011 tellrowaï et al 2012 zhu et al 2019a 2019b mahmood and jia 2019 mahmood et al 2020 however these studies are based on models essentially calibrated in a humid period and applied without the transferability of their parameters to a drier context having been established in order to shed objective light on this question we compared hydrologically intermediate situations between the wet period and the dry period and distributed at different times of the period 1960 2015 the first comparison is based on the interannual average conditions of two periods 1972 1979 and 1998 2007 for which the average flow rate is similar it appears that the corresponding average climatic conditions were also similar the second comparison is based on individual years also chosen on the criterion of an intermediate hydrological situation between wet and dry but distributed in different average climatic contexts a comparison of the five selected years distributed between 1964 and 2010 shows that there has been no observable change in the response of flows to precipitation the slight differences in runoff coefficients are explained by the influence of year n 1 which determines the low water flow at the start of the season and the base flow of the rising flood the analysis of hydro climatic data therefore shows no evidence of an anthropogenic impact that would lead to a decrease in flows or a modification of the hydrological regime in the chari logone basin between 1964 and 2010 it is nevertheless clear that water withdrawals in the chari logone basin are occurring coe and foley 2001 world bank 2002 united nations environmental programme unep 2004 tellrowaï et al 2012 the contribution of the chari logone waters to lake chad is 26 km3 on an interannual average 1960 2015 the total withdrawal for irrigation is estimated at 1 8 km3 year in the basin and the lake lemoalle et al 2014 however our results show that the order of magnitude of this withdrawal remains moderate and that its influence is not detected in the hydrological balances of the various sub basins except for a few uncertainties finally our analysis also made it possible to hydrologically situate the recent period from 2013 to 2015 the annual average precipitation for the recent period 2013 2015 is only slightly different from the interannual average period of 1960 2015 on the other hand the flow monitoring is variable the apparent temporal decrease in flows from the upstream chari and also the entire chari could be due in particular to the great uncertainties in the estimation of average precipitation and the absence of vegetation cover in the chari basin 7 conclusion we have synthesized and analyzed all the available hydroclimatic data for the chari logone basin during the period 1960 2015 in order to characterize the spatial contrasts the temporal variations and the respective sensitivities of the various sub watersheds to climatic variations the average flow of the chari logone during the period 1960 2015 was 823 m3 s or a water height of 42 mm year which represents 5 of precipitation in the watershed this very low discharge ratio makes it highly sensitive to variations in precipitation our hydroclimatic

their spatial coverage for use in such hydrological models as the soil and water assessment tool swat to overcome this limitation swat includes a weather generator algorithm that can complete this data based on long term weather statistics this work presents a newly developed weather statistics dataset for peninsular spain pswg calculated from national gridded datasets according to the swat model format pswg provides a higher resolution that stands as a compelling alternative to the statistics calculated from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr that are available on the swat website new hydrological insights for the region the dataset has been evaluated using pswg and cfsr datasets for different data availability scenarios to reconstruct weather series in three watersheds with contrasting weather climates results underscore the superiority of the pswg dataset in reconstructing missing data for hydrological simulations this approach provides a strong alternative for swat applications in peninsular spain and the applied methodology can be replicated in other countries that dispose of high resolution gridded rainfall and temperature datasets keywords weather

model is an eco hydrological public domain model with a physical and semi distributed base which works in a daily time step and has been widely applied in hydrological and environmental studies due to its capacity to simulate different hydrological processes arnold et al 1998 swat is the most widely used watershed scale water quality model in the world tan et al 2020 and its use in spain is also widespread over the last 3 years we find numerous studies in spanish watersheds related to the study of hydrological and water quality processes jimeno sáez et al 2018 malik et al 2020 rivas tabares

for hydrological modelling is time consuming and susceptible to errors abbaspour et al 2019 swat developers to help swat users have included on their website swat 2020 the option to download global weather daily data precipitation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 in swat file format for a given location and time period in addition swat also provides a database file that includes all weather statistical data needed for the operation of the wgen the time saving nature of this database means that it is extensively used by swat users ghimire et al 2019 cfsr weather data have also been used to force swat for several different watersheds around the world and many recent studies agree on the weak performance in the simulation of daily and monthly streamflows duan et al 2019 gao et al 2018 meng et al 2019 roth and lemann 2016 tan et al 2017 thom et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 several studies have recently evaluated the performance of different weather generators for hydrological modelling with the swat model alodah and seidou 2019 evaluated five different weather generators concluding that the wgen called mulgets chen et al 2014 showed the best performance chen et al 2019 adjusted the daily rainfall ad temperature time series generated by mulgets using monthly and annual climate time series generated by a first order linear autoregressive model dai and qin 2019 assessed the effectiveness of a multi site stochastic wgen on hydrological responses in the red deer river watershed canada the results indicated that multi site generators were capable of better representing the monthly streamflow variability yang et al 2020 integrated an hourly wgen with an hourly swat model whose performance indicated that it could reasonably characterise the main monthly daily and hourly rainfall features however to our knowledge only ghimire et al 2019 have dealt with the influence of the input data used to calculate the statistics required for the application of the swat wgen for hydrological simulations they developed a comprehensive dataset for the asia pacific region that clearly enhanced the widespread use of cfsr data among the swat community in europe and therefore in spain there is no previous precedent so the development of the dataset presented in this study can help to a more accurate simulation of the hydrological processes in peninsular spain in recent years two high resolution gridded datasets have been developed in spain that can be very useful in hydrological modelling the spain02 project herrera et al 2016 includes daily rainfall and maximum and minimum temperature data covering peninsular spain and at a resolution of 0 1 10 km from 1950 to 2015 this project has been successfully applied in the modelling of different spanish basins baena ruiz et al 2020 pérez sánchez et al 2020 pulido velazquez et al 2018b 2018a rupérez moreno et al 2017 senent aparicio et al 2018a 2017 more recently the spanish national meteorological agency aemet developed a high resolution 5 km precipitation peral garcía et al 2017 and temperature gridded dataset amblar francés et al 2020 for the period of 1951 to the present over spain the spain02 and aemet grids were generated by interpolation of observed data recent studies compared different gridded rainfall products over peninsular spain and concluded that the national aemet gridded dataset was superior to the other rainfall remote sensing products senent aparicio et al 2018b these results suggest that the aemet dataset may be a better alternative for the estimation of precipitation statistics needed for the swat wgen file thus the aim of our work is threefold 1 to develop an accurate meteorological dataset ready for use in the swat model that combines rainfall and temperature weather statistics from aemet and other weather statistics related with the wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity from cfsr hereinafter called peninsular spain weather generator dataset pswg 2 to calculate all statistics that are needed to run swat wgen throughout peninsular spain and 3 to assess the performance of the statistics computed using the pswg dataset over the existing cfsr dataset in a streamflow simulation for different weather conditions in peninsular spain 2 materials and methods fig 1 shows the general approach taken to obtain the pswg dataset the following sections elaborate on the independent data sources used as inputs how these inputs were combined and the methods used to calculate all the statistics included in the pswg dataset in greater detail step 3 in fig 1 shows the evaluation and impact of using pswg data in a flow simulation with the swat model 2 1 extraction and combination of daily weather data to generate the pswg dataset 2 1 1 input daily weather data the various data sources used as input data are presented in table 1 daily precipitation for the period 1951 2019 was obtained from the aemet gridded dataset v2 with a 5 km resolution peral garcía et al 2017 this dataset was developed on the basis of over 2300 rainfall stations and is available in netcdf format at the aemet climate services website aemet 2020 related to humidity wind speed and solar radiation these weather variables were extracted from cfsr saha et al 2010 this global reanalysis dataset is extensively used as source of meteorological data and is offered free access on the official website of the swat model swat 2020 in swat ready format this interpolated dataset was created by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and is based on hourly forecasts derived using from satellite product information and the global weather station network cfsr datasets are available from 1979 to 2013 with a resolution of 38 km 2 1 2 combination of datasets before calculating wgen statistics it was necessary to extract the information for each of the grid centres of aemet s 5 km grid matlab scripts were used to extract this information matlab version r2013b and to extract spain02 temperature data cfsr data were directly downloaded for each of the grid centres from the swat website to assign temperature wind speed solar radiation and humidity values to the 5 km grid arcgis was used to identify the nearest spain02 and cfsr station for each aemet centre final datasets were imported into a postgressql postgresql 2020 database designed to provide faster data analysis in further analysis the database scheme has a table for each station with such properties as coordinates and elevation there is also a table for each weather variable temperature precipitation wind etc which save in each row the related measures e g temperature table has max and min date and station from the database we can easily select the common period 1979 2013 to analyse in this work this period of time 35 years is sufficiently long given that according to swat input output documentation arnold et al 2012 more than 20 years of data are needed to calculate the statistical data needed to represent daily weather data 2 2 calculation of the wgen statistics swat includes a built in wgen developed by sharpley and williams 1990 to generate weather data that is not available or to complete gaps in observed measurements this wgen requires monthly parameters of skewness standard deviation and average rainfall maximum half hour rainfall for each month probability of occurrence of dry or wet days mean and standard deviation of temperatures solar radiation and wind speed wgen first independently determines the day s precipitation a first order markov chain is used to determine whether the day is dry or wet which means that it takes into account the previous day s wet or dry condition schuol and abbaspour 2007 for each wet day an exponential or skewed distribution is applied to generate the rainfall volume then maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and relative humidity are generated based on the presence or lack of rain for the day wind speed is generated on an independent basis details of wgen equations are provided in swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 we use python to obtain the data from the database and to get the wgen parameter of the analysis the numpy van der walt et al 2011 python package provides 47 power mathematical functions to obtain skewness standard deviations and means from a dataset as some wgen parameters represent monthly statistics among the selected years the data frame must be grouped before applying the functions the code below summarizes this part 1 df pds read sql select station date daily accumulated from precipitation where station 1 and date between 1 1 1979 and 31 12 2013 order by date asc dbconnection 2 df date pds to datetime df date format y m d 3 df index df date 4 df month df index month 5 analysis df month daily accumulated 6 bymonth analisis groupby month 7 d pcpstd bymonth std 8 d pcpskw bymonth skew line 1 creates a data frame with the precipitation for station 1 between 1979 and 2013 lines 2 4 define the data frame indexes in this case date is important as we are working with time series moreover the month index is important to group the values by month and then apply functions to them such as mean std skew see lines 5 6 d is a final data frame that contains the final necessary wgen statistics as the result of these processes this d data frame allows future exports for example to microsoft access this process is like other monthly statistics such as wind speed dew point and solar radiation to obtain the occurrences of wet or dry days we use python pandas library which can manage data frame information using the shift data frame function a value can be compared with the previous or next one in a temporal series in this way the auxiliary information can be obtained i e wet days followed by dry wet days needed for pr w1 and pr w2 to get the number of wet or dry days in a month we apply the code explained before to group the data by month then count the days with zero precipitation as dry and wet in other cases as mentioned in the swat input output documentation arnold et al 2012 the maximum rainfall of 30 min in the whole registration period for each month rainhhmx is a difficult parameter to obtain as it is unusual to dispose of data on a sub daily scale for large scale watersheds the cfsr database available on the swat website and the swat weather database software essenfelder 2018 also available on the swat website to create your own wgen file estimate rainhhmx as the average of a third of the maximum recorded daily rainfall for that month in our study rainhhmx was derived from the study of moncho et al 2009 in this work the sub daily data from 64 rainfall stations located throughout peninsular spain were analyzed to determine the idf curves and they concluded that the idf curves of any station can be obtained from the following equation 1 i t p i t 0 p 0 p p 0 0 24 t t 0 n m e d where i t p is the maximum mean intensity based on the duration t and the return period p i t 0 p 0 is the baseline intensity the exponent n m e d is characteristic of the local meteorology and i t p was estimated for all rainfall stations used in the study therefore using the equation above and the n m e d coefficients estimated in moncho et al 2009 rainhhmx was assessed in four stages 1 extraction of the maximum daily intensity i 24 35 from aemet dataset 1979 2013 for the 64 rainfall stations and calculation of the maximum half hour rainfall i 0 5 35 based on eq 1 using r script 2 estimation of the torrentiality index as the relation between i 0 5 35 and i 24 35 and spatial representation of this index using arcgis 10 2 3 application of the kriging technique to obtain torrentiality index values at a 5 km resolution fig 2 the kriging method has strong theoretical support tabios and salas 1985 and according to li and heap 2011 it performs better than non geostatistical methods ordinary kriging and hypothetical spherical variogram solana gutiérrez and merino de miguel 2011 options from arcgis were used in this study finally 4 rainhhmx was estimated by using an r script to extract i 24 35 per month throughout peninsular spain and multiplying these values by the corresponding torrentiality index 2 3 performance evaluation of the wgen statistics obtained from the pswg dataset 2 3 1 study area and data sources because of its complex orography and geographical location between the subtropical zone and the european mild zone peninsular spain presents a vast range of climatic variability senent aparicio et al 2018b including some of the most arid european areas in the southeast and the rainiest areas in the north pérez sánchez et al 2019 in this study the basins were selected to consider the main climatic zones found in peninsular spain following the köppen geiger climate grading system kottek et al 2006 as shown in fig 3 labrada river basin lrb is situated at the north of the miño sil basin nw spain and the weather in this area is a warm summer mediterranean csb climate which is characterized by cool to mild and wet winters and warm and dry summers magasca river basin mrb is a tributary of the almonte river and is part of the tagus river network the climate in the mrb is a hot summer mediterranean csa climate which is dominant in peninsular spain aemet 2011 with monthly mean temperatures ranging from 7 4 c in january to 25 0 c in july finally ega river basin erb falls within a warm temperature humid climate characterized by warm summers cfb with monthly mean temperatures ranging from 3 1 c in february to 18 5 c in august based on the unesco classification limits of the aridity index nastos et al 2013 mrb lrb and erb can be classified as semi arid humid and sub humid basins respectively table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the watersheds used for the technical validation of the dataset version 1 8 of the qgis interface for swat qswat dile et al 2016 was used to build the model with freely available information the input data for the swat model in this study include topography land use soil and discharge data the digital elevation model dem at 30 m spatial resolution was obtained from the national geographic institute of spain soil data was extracted from the harmonized world soil database hwsd developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and containing 16 000 mapping units with two different soil layers 0 300 mm and 300 1 000 mm deep nachtergaele et al 2010 land cover maps were derived from corine land cover and surface slope type was classified into three classes 2 2 8 8 according to the fao criteria for preparation of soil degradation maps slopes below 8 lead to rill and interrill erosion and when slopes are above 8 gully erosion takes place molina navarro et al 2014 land cover on the lrb consists of shrublands 34 agricultural areas 24 and forest 19 while the major land cover in the mrb is grassland 25 followed by cropland grassland mosaics 19 erb is a mostly forest dominated area which covers about 68 of the basin and 18 is covered by agricultural areas rainfall and temperature data were obtained for lrb erb and mrb from meteogalicia https www meteogalicia gal euskalmet https www euskalmet euskadi eus and redarex http redarexplus gobex es websites respectively data on streamflows were available from the website of the spanish centre for hydrographic studies cedex https ceh cedex es anuarioaforos default asp where data are updated to september 2017 2 3 2 swat model calibration for dataset evaluation the time period october 2011 september 2017 was selected due to the common availability of streamflow data in the three watersheds a three year warm up period was selected to achieve a steady state for the swat model using our previous experience in similar watersheds ten commonly used flow calibration parameters and their ranges were chosen incorporating aspects of surface runoff groundwater and soil data automatic monthly calibration was performed in the ega and mrb by means of the swat cup software abbaspour 2007 and one of the algorithms which it provides the sequential uncertainty adjustment sufi 2 nse was used as the objective function and 2000 simulations were run in the case of lrb parameter calibration was not necessary because a previously calibrated model in this basin was used to simulate the initial scenario jimeno sáez et al 2018 the list of the adjusted swat parameters showing the range of variation and the final values obtained after the calibration process is given in table 3 2 3 3 validation approach after the calibration process we compared monthly flow simulations in the lrb mrb and erb based on different precipitation data availability scenarios for each of the scenarios a certain percentage of precipitation data has been eliminated from 10 to 60 and the gaps generated have been filled independently with both the pswg dataset and the cfsr dataset the monthly scale has been used for validation as at daily scale wgen can estimate unrealistic daily values whereas at monthly scale the generated values are reasonable for water resources planning studies bae et al 2011 2 3 4 performance evaluation criteria we assessed and compared swat outputs based on four statistical evaluation criteria including the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse percent bias pbias the standard deviation ratio of observed data rsr and kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge which are the most commonly applied in hydrological research jimeno sáez et al 2018 according to moriasi et al 2007 the model performance is considered satisfactory when the pbias is in the range of 25 nse is above 0 5 and rsr is below 0 7 a kge performance above 0 5 is considered satisfactory brighenti et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation comparison prior to the analysis of the performance of the statistics generated by pswg and cfsr in the simulation of flows the observed data have been compared on a monthly scale with the data derived from pswg and cfsr the aim of this comparison is to evaluate the quality of the datasets against the historical rainfall data observed in the 5 rainfall stations where the data were used marco da curra and guitiriz mirador in lrb madroñera and navarrete in erb herrera in mrb allowing a better understanding of the deviations related to the flow simulation the monthly distribution and seasonality have been analyzed fig 4 for the common time period 2007 2013 when rainfall data was available from all data sources observed pswg and cfsr firstly we have used violin plots to simultaneously visualize data distribution and probability density combining boxplots with a kernel density diagram no significant differences are detected in the prediction of the median white point in graphs while the shape of the density distribution has a clearly more accurate fit using the aemet data especially if we examine the navarrete and herrera stations overall the violin plots indicated superior model performance for the aemet data which fitted closely with the observations in contrast to the cfsr data moreover the scatterplots of the aemet and cfsr monthly rainfall versus observed data are also presented the scatterplots indicate that the aemet data seems to fit better on all stations this fact is confirmed from the values of the coefficient of determination r2 obtained based on aemet data r2 values in marco da curra guitiriz madroñera navarrete y herrera rainfall stations were 0 97 0 89 0 94 0 92 and 0 85 respectively while using cfsr dataset r2 values were 0 81 0 81 0 80 0 52 and 0 44 respectively finally mean monthly rainfall pattern was analyzed at the same stations the monthly rainfall patterns are similar being july and august the driest months and concentrating the rainfall between the months of november and january similar to the conclusions obtained through the violin and scatter plots aemet s rainfall estimates are closer to the observed data for example it can be noted that in navarrete station the rainfall is underestimated by cfsr during the rainiest months while in guitiriz or madroñera it is overestimated similar conclusions were obtained in the work published by senent aparicio et al 2018b where precipitation data from aemet s 5 km grid was compared with additional gridded datasets cfsr trmm mswep and persiann over peninsular spain the ability to detect daily precipitation events was also assessed by estimating three categorical statistics the probability of detection pod which represents the ratio of rainy days that were correctly predicted a perfect pod estimation is equal to 1 the false alarm ratio far which measures precipitation detections that did not actually occur i e precipitation that was detected by the precipitation product but not by the rain gauges the value of this ratio varies between 0 and 1 being 0 the optimal value the critical success index csi considers both situations and is based on pod and far being 1 the optimal value to measure the accuracy of the rainfall datasets in terms of precipitation amount and timing patterns six additional indicators were employed 1 correlation coefficient cc 2 root mean square error rmse 3 mean error me 4 relative bias bias 5 total number of days in which rainfall exceeds 1 pd1 or 6 10 mm pd10 the results shown in table 4 indicates that aemet was in better agreement with local stations with high precipitation detection ability compared with the cfsr dataset as can be drawn from the indicators related to the number of rainy days both aemet and cfsr tend to overestimate the number of rainy days however aemet performs better than cfsr in terms of the number of days with heavy rainfall events 10 mm threshold 3 2 temperature comparison similarly to the previous section the observed temperature have been also compared on a monthly scale with the data derived from pswg and cfsr fig 5 similar performances are observed at the marco da curra and guitiriz mirador stations both aemet and cfsr overestimate temperatures in the summer months while in the winter months aemet temperatures are more in accordance with observed temperatures at the station located in the mrb madroñera both datasets fit the observed values adequately however the shape of the density distribution presents a more accurate fit using the aemet data finally the two weather stations used in erb show different trends on the one hand the navarrete station shows a good fit regardless of the data set used on the other hand at the herrera station both aemet and cfsr overestimate the temperature values which can be explained by the location of the station in a high mountain area with steep slopes in the surroundings 3 3 pswg performance evaluation in this section performance of the pswg and cfsr datasets was compared using six different scenarios where missing rates from 10 to 60 were applied and missing data were filled in using both datasets finally we compared swat model outputs from these scenarios with model results using complete historical data as shown in table 4 the pswg dataset clearly outperforms cfsr especially when missing rates exceed 50 when the missing rate was gradually increased nse pbias rsr and kge exhibited the same worsening trends in wetter climate basins model results for even higher missing rates 60 are acceptable with nse values above 0 5 pbias below 25 and rsr below 0 70 in the case of erb the results obtained with the pswg and cfsr datasets are very similar however in the case of lrb the results obtained with pswg are higher than those of cfsr and this difference becomes more pronounced as the missing rate increases in the case of the mrb which is characterized by its semi arid climate the relative superiority of the pswg dataset is also evident here however model performance worsens significantly as the missing rates increase and the pswg dataset results are not acceptable for missing rates above 30 these results can be explained by the pluviometric regime characteristic of semi arid mediterranean climates which are characterized by episodes of heavy rainfall characterized by short and very intense rainfall which cause large floods with a markedly torrential character senent aparicio et al 2016 pérez sánchez et al 2019 indicated based on the application of six hydrological models in sixteen different basins over peninsular spain that the climatic characteristics of the watershed are the most important factor in a hydrological model s performance in addition the effectiveness of the cfsr dataset in this watershed is much lower than that of the pswg dataset in mrb cfsr data significantly increases the simulated water volume as the missing rate increases fig 6 resulting in increasing pbias that can double simulated water volumes compared with observed ones for scenarios with a higher missing rate 60 these results were expected based on previous findings that indicated a global trend in cfsr data to generally overestimate both rainfall and the number of rainy days dhanesh et al 2020 in case studies where the initial pbias is positive and therefore the total volume generated is underestimated the cfsr dataset allows for acceptable data generation however in such basins as mrb where the initial pbias is 22 65 use of the cfsr dataset causes an important worsening of the model performance table 5 4 conclusions meteorological data are the main drivers of hydrological modelling however available meteorological data can have gaps in the data series and often have limited spatial coverage for use in hydrological models such as the swat model to address this limitation swat includes a weather data generator algorithm that can complete these data based on long term weather statistics this work presents a set of weather statistics data pswg calculated for the whole peninsular spain that provides a higher resolution than the statistics calculated from cfsr available on the swat website pswg dataset has been tested in three different basins under the most representative climatic conditions of the peninsular spain showing an improvement in the monthly flow simulation a clear limitation of this work is that daily data on relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed from cfsr are available until july 2014 so the statistics have been calculated for the common period 1979 2013 however the satellite datasets continue to improve so the authors encourage the need for further studies using different satellite data products as well as the use of a larger number of test basins for verification considering the climatic diversity that characterizes peninsular spain to ensure a broader impact from this work s results all weather datasets generated in this study were made available online to promote other swat modelling approaches in peninsular spain as stated in abbaspour et al 2019 data preparation is extremely time consuming and susceptible to errors resulting in much of the research time being spent on data processing instead of output analysis the pswg dataset is archived for long term storage on the swat model website https swat tamu edu data and consists of two wgen database files in microsoft access and sqlite file format that can be used in swat and swat respectively swat is a renovated version of the swat model aimed at solving previous weaknesses and improving the spatial representation of processes interactions bieger et al 2017 that uses the sqlite database engine for data storage besides aemet gridded precipitation and temperature data are available in ready to use swat format at the same url credit authorship contribution statement javier senent

8239,study region peninsular spain study focus weather data are the key drivers of hydrological modelling however available weather data can present gaps in data sequences and are often limited in their spatial coverage for use in such hydrological models as the soil and water assessment tool swat to overcome this limitation swat includes a weather generator algorithm that can complete this data based on long term weather statistics this work presents a newly developed weather statistics dataset for peninsular spain pswg calculated from national gridded datasets according to the swat model format pswg provides a higher resolution that stands as a compelling alternative to the statistics calculated from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr that are available on the swat website new hydrological insights for the region the dataset has been evaluated using pswg and cfsr datasets for different data availability scenarios to reconstruct weather series in three watersheds with contrasting weather climates results underscore the superiority of the pswg dataset in reconstructing missing data for hydrological simulations this approach provides a strong alternative for swat applications in peninsular spain and the applied methodology can be replicated in other countries that dispose of high resolution gridded rainfall and temperature datasets keywords weather generator cfsr swat peninsular spain 1 introduction meteorological data is crucial in the application of hydrological models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat white et al 2017 the swat model is an eco hydrological public domain model with a physical and semi distributed base which works in a daily time step and has been widely applied in hydrological and environmental studies due to its capacity to simulate different hydrological processes arnold et al 1998 swat is the most widely used watershed scale water quality model in the world tan et al 2020 and its use in spain is also widespread over the last 3 years we find numerous studies in spanish watersheds related to the study of hydrological and water quality processes jimeno sáez et al 2018 malik et al 2020 rivas tabares et al 2019 senent aparicio et al 2020 2019 the impact of climate change meaurio et al 2017 pérez sánchez et al 2020 senent aparicio et al 2017 or the impact of human pressures on water resources cánovas et al 2018 essenfelder et al 2018 jodar abellan et al 2019 lópez ballesteros et al 2019 peraza castro et al 2018 salmoral et al 2017 senent aparicio et al 2018a observed weather data are often inadequate in terms of completeness length and spatial coverage which accounts for the need to use weather generators that solve this problem by generating data with the same statistical properties as the observed data vesely et al 2019 swat includes a weather generator module wgen that can fill in missing weather data and simulate weather parameters for which observed data are not available richardson 1981 this wgen requires monthly parameters of rainfall average standard deviation skewness sequences of wet or dry days temperature maximum minimum dew point wind speed and solar radiation neitsch et al 2011 as do other weather generators wgen depends strongly on rainfall data as half of the wgen required statistics are related to rainfall obtaining and processing meteorological data for hydrological modelling is time consuming and susceptible to errors abbaspour et al 2019 swat developers to help swat users have included on their website swat 2020 the option to download global weather daily data precipitation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 in swat file format for a given location and time period in addition swat also provides a database file that includes all weather statistical data needed for the operation of the wgen the time saving nature of this database means that it is extensively used by swat users ghimire et al 2019 cfsr weather data have also been used to force swat for several different watersheds around the world and many recent studies agree on the weak performance in the simulation of daily and monthly streamflows duan et al 2019 gao et al 2018 meng et al 2019 roth and lemann 2016 tan et al 2017 thom et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 several studies have recently evaluated the performance of different weather generators for hydrological modelling with the swat model alodah and seidou 2019 evaluated five different weather generators concluding that the wgen called mulgets chen et al 2014 showed the best performance chen et al 2019 adjusted the daily rainfall ad temperature time series generated by mulgets using monthly and annual climate time series generated by a first order linear autoregressive model dai and qin 2019 assessed the effectiveness of a multi site stochastic wgen on hydrological responses in the red deer river watershed canada the results indicated that multi site generators were capable of better representing the monthly streamflow variability yang et al 2020 integrated an hourly wgen with an hourly swat model whose performance indicated that it could reasonably characterise the main monthly daily and hourly rainfall features however to our knowledge only ghimire et al 2019 have dealt with the influence of the input data used to calculate the statistics required for the application of the swat wgen for hydrological simulations they developed a comprehensive dataset for the asia pacific region that clearly enhanced the widespread use of cfsr data among the swat community in europe and therefore in spain there is no previous precedent so the development of the dataset presented in this study can help to a more accurate simulation of the hydrological processes in peninsular spain in recent years two high resolution gridded datasets have been developed in spain that can be very useful in hydrological modelling the spain02 project herrera et al 2016 includes daily rainfall and maximum and minimum temperature data covering peninsular spain and at a resolution of 0 1 10 km from 1950 to 2015 this project has been successfully applied in the modelling of different spanish basins baena ruiz et al 2020 pérez sánchez et al 2020 pulido velazquez et al 2018b 2018a rupérez moreno et al 2017 senent aparicio et al 2018a 2017 more recently the spanish national meteorological agency aemet developed a high resolution 5 km precipitation peral garcía et al 2017 and temperature gridded dataset amblar francés et al 2020 for the period of 1951 to the present over spain the spain02 and aemet grids were generated by interpolation of observed data recent studies compared different gridded rainfall products over peninsular spain and concluded that the national aemet gridded dataset was superior to the other rainfall remote sensing products senent aparicio et al 2018b these results suggest that the aemet dataset may be a better alternative for the estimation of precipitation statistics needed for the swat wgen file thus the aim of our work is threefold 1 to develop an accurate meteorological dataset ready for use in the swat model that combines rainfall and temperature weather statistics from aemet and other weather statistics related with the wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity from cfsr hereinafter called peninsular spain weather generator dataset pswg 2 to calculate all statistics that are needed to run swat wgen throughout peninsular spain and 3 to assess the performance of the statistics computed using the pswg dataset over the existing cfsr dataset in a streamflow simulation for different weather conditions in peninsular spain 2 materials and methods fig 1 shows the general approach taken to obtain the pswg dataset the following sections elaborate on the independent data sources used as inputs how these inputs were combined and the methods used to calculate all the statistics included in the pswg dataset in greater detail step 3 in fig 1 shows the evaluation and impact of using pswg data in a flow simulation with the swat model 2 1 extraction and combination of daily weather data to generate the pswg dataset 2 1 1 input daily weather data the various data sources used as input data are presented in table 1 daily precipitation for the period 1951 2019 was obtained from the aemet gridded dataset v2 with a 5 km resolution peral garcía et al 2017 this dataset was developed on the basis of over 2300 rainfall stations and is available in netcdf format at the aemet climate services website aemet 2020 related to humidity wind speed and solar radiation these weather variables were extracted from cfsr saha et al 2010 this global reanalysis dataset is extensively used as source of meteorological data and is offered free access on the official website of the swat model swat 2020 in swat ready format this interpolated dataset was created by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and is based on hourly forecasts derived using from satellite product information and the global weather station network cfsr datasets are available from 1979 to 2013 with a resolution of 38 km 2 1 2 combination of datasets before calculating wgen statistics it was necessary to extract the information for each of the grid centres of aemet s 5 km grid matlab scripts were used to extract this information matlab version r2013b and to extract spain02 temperature data cfsr data were directly downloaded for each of the grid centres from the swat website to assign temperature wind speed solar radiation and humidity values to the 5 km grid arcgis was used to identify the nearest spain02 and cfsr station for each aemet centre final datasets were imported into a postgressql postgresql 2020 database designed to provide faster data analysis in further analysis the database scheme has a table for each station with such properties as coordinates and elevation there is also a table for each weather variable temperature precipitation wind etc which save in each row the related measures e g temperature table has max and min date and station from the database we can easily select the common period 1979 2013 to analyse in this work this period of time 35 years is sufficiently long given that according to swat input output documentation arnold et al 2012 more than 20 years of data are needed to calculate the statistical data needed to represent daily weather data 2 2 calculation of the wgen statistics swat includes a built in wgen developed by sharpley and williams 1990 to generate weather data that is not available or to complete gaps in observed measurements this wgen requires monthly parameters of skewness standard deviation and average rainfall maximum half hour rainfall for each month probability of occurrence of dry or wet days mean and standard deviation of temperatures solar radiation and wind speed wgen first independently determines the day s precipitation a first order markov chain is used to determine whether the day is dry or wet which means that it takes into account the previous day s wet or dry condition schuol and abbaspour 2007 for each wet day an exponential or skewed distribution is applied to generate the rainfall volume then maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and relative humidity are generated based on the presence or lack of rain for the day wind speed is generated on an independent basis details of wgen equations are provided in swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 we use python to obtain the data from the database and to get the wgen parameter of the analysis the numpy van der walt et al 2011 python package provides 47 power mathematical functions to obtain skewness standard deviations and means from a dataset as some wgen parameters represent monthly statistics among the selected years the data frame must be grouped before applying the functions the code below summarizes this part 1 df pds read sql select station date daily accumulated from precipitation where station 1 and date between 1 1 1979 and 31 12 2013 order by date asc dbconnection 2 df date pds to datetime df date format y m d 3 df index df date 4 df month df index month 5 analysis df month daily accumulated 6

indexes in this case date is important as we are working with time series moreover the month index is important to group the values by month and then apply functions to them such as mean std skew see lines 5 6 d is a final data frame that contains the final necessary wgen statistics as the result of these processes this d data frame allows future exports for example to microsoft access this process is like other monthly statistics such as wind speed dew point and solar radiation to obtain the occurrences of wet or dry days we use python pandas library which can manage data frame information using the shift data frame function a value can be compared with the previous or next one in a temporal series in this way the auxiliary information can be obtained i e wet days followed by dry wet days needed for pr w1 and pr w2 to get the number of wet or dry days in a month we apply the code explained before to group the data by month then count the days with zero precipitation as dry and wet in other cases as mentioned in the swat input output documentation arnold et al 2012 the maximum rainfall of 30 min in the whole registration period for each month rainhhmx is a difficult parameter to obtain as it is unusual to dispose of data on a sub daily scale for large scale watersheds the cfsr database available on the swat website and the swat weather database software essenfelder 2018 also available on the swat website to create your own wgen file estimate rainhhmx as the average of a third of the maximum recorded daily rainfall for that month in our study rainhhmx was derived from the study of moncho et al 2009 in this work the sub daily data from 64 rainfall stations located throughout peninsular spain were analyzed to determine the idf curves and they concluded that the idf curves of any station can be obtained from the following equation 1 i t p i t 0 p 0 p p 0 0 24 t t 0 n m e d where i t p is the maximum mean intensity based on the duration t and the return period p i t 0 p 0 is the baseline intensity the exponent n m e d is characteristic of the local meteorology and i t p was estimated for all rainfall stations used in the study therefore using the equation above and the n m e d coefficients estimated in moncho et al 2009 rainhhmx was assessed in four stages 1 extraction of the maximum daily intensity i 24 35 from aemet dataset 1979 2013 for the 64 rainfall stations and calculation of the maximum half hour rainfall i 0 5 35 based on eq 1 using r script 2 estimation of the torrentiality index as the relation between i 0 5 35 and i 24 35 and spatial representation of this index using arcgis 10 2 3 application of the kriging technique to obtain torrentiality index values at a 5 km resolution fig 2 the kriging method has strong theoretical support tabios and salas 1985 and according to li and heap 2011 it performs better than non geostatistical methods ordinary kriging and hypothetical spherical variogram solana gutiérrez and merino de miguel 2011 options from arcgis were used in this study finally 4 rainhhmx was estimated by using an r script to extract i 24 35 per month throughout peninsular spain and multiplying these values by the corresponding torrentiality index 2 3 performance evaluation of the wgen statistics obtained from the pswg dataset 2 3 1 study area and data sources because of its complex orography and geographical location between the subtropical zone and the european mild zone peninsular spain presents a vast range of climatic variability senent aparicio et al 2018b including some of the most arid european areas in the southeast and the rainiest areas in the north pérez sánchez et al 2019 in this study the basins were selected to consider the main climatic zones found in peninsular spain following the köppen geiger climate grading system kottek et al 2006 as shown in fig 3 labrada river basin lrb is situated at the north of the miño sil basin nw spain and the weather in this area is a warm summer mediterranean csb climate which is characterized by cool to mild and wet winters and warm and dry summers magasca river basin mrb is a tributary of the almonte river and is part of the tagus river network the climate in the mrb is a hot summer mediterranean csa climate which is dominant in peninsular spain aemet 2011 with monthly mean temperatures ranging from 7 4 c in january to 25 0 c in july finally ega river basin erb falls within a warm temperature humid climate characterized by warm summers cfb with monthly mean temperatures ranging from 3 1 c in february to 18 5 c in august based on the unesco classification limits of the aridity index nastos et al 2013 mrb lrb and erb can be classified as semi arid humid and sub humid basins respectively table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the watersheds used for the technical validation of the dataset version 1 8 of the qgis interface for swat qswat dile et al 2016 was used to build the model with freely available information the input data for the swat model in this study include topography land use soil and discharge data the digital elevation model dem at 30 m spatial resolution was obtained from the national geographic institute of spain soil data was extracted from the harmonized world soil database hwsd developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and containing 16 000 mapping units with two different soil layers 0 300 mm and 300 1 000 mm deep nachtergaele et al 2010 land cover maps were derived from corine land cover and surface slope type was classified into three classes 2 2 8 8 according to the fao criteria for preparation of soil degradation maps slopes below 8 lead to rill and interrill erosion and when slopes are above 8 gully erosion takes place molina navarro et al 2014 land cover on the lrb consists of shrublands 34 agricultural areas 24 and forest 19 while the major land cover in the mrb is grassland 25 followed by cropland grassland mosaics 19 erb is a mostly forest dominated area which covers about 68 of the basin and 18 is covered by agricultural areas rainfall and temperature data were obtained for lrb erb and mrb from meteogalicia https www meteogalicia gal euskalmet https www euskalmet euskadi eus and redarex http redarexplus gobex es websites respectively data on streamflows were available from the website of the spanish centre for hydrographic studies cedex https ceh cedex es anuarioaforos default asp where data are updated to september 2017 2 3 2 swat model calibration for dataset evaluation the time period october 2011 september 2017 was selected due to the common availability of streamflow data in the three watersheds a three year warm up period was selected to achieve a steady state for the swat model using our previous experience in similar watersheds ten commonly used flow calibration parameters and their ranges were chosen incorporating aspects of surface runoff groundwater and soil data automatic monthly calibration was performed in the ega and mrb by means of the swat cup software abbaspour 2007 and one of the algorithms which it provides the sequential uncertainty adjustment sufi 2 nse was used as the objective function and 2000 simulations were run in the case of lrb parameter calibration was not necessary because a previously calibrated model in this basin was used to simulate the initial scenario jimeno sáez et al 2018 the list of the adjusted swat parameters showing the range of variation and the final values obtained after the calibration process is given in table 3 2 3 3 validation approach after the calibration process we compared monthly flow simulations in the lrb mrb and erb based on different precipitation data availability scenarios for each of the scenarios a certain percentage of precipitation data has been eliminated from 10 to 60 and the gaps generated have been filled independently with both the pswg dataset and the cfsr dataset the monthly scale has been used for validation as at daily scale wgen can estimate unrealistic daily values whereas at monthly scale the generated values are reasonable for water resources planning studies bae et al 2011 2 3 4 performance evaluation criteria we assessed and compared swat outputs based on four statistical evaluation criteria including the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse percent bias pbias the standard deviation ratio of observed data rsr and kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge which are the most commonly applied in hydrological research jimeno sáez et al 2018 according to moriasi et al 2007 the model performance is considered satisfactory when the pbias is in the range of 25 nse is above 0 5 and rsr is below 0 7 a kge performance above 0 5 is considered satisfactory brighenti et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 precipitation comparison prior to the analysis of the performance of the statistics generated by pswg and cfsr in the simulation of flows the observed data have been compared on a monthly scale with the data derived from pswg and cfsr the aim of this comparison is to evaluate the quality of the datasets against the historical rainfall data observed in the 5 rainfall stations where the data were used marco da curra and guitiriz mirador in lrb madroñera and navarrete in erb herrera in mrb allowing a better understanding of the deviations related to the flow simulation the monthly distribution and seasonality have been analyzed fig 4 for the common time period 2007 2013 when rainfall data was available from all data sources observed pswg and cfsr firstly we have used violin plots to simultaneously visualize data distribution and probability density combining boxplots with a kernel density diagram no significant differences are detected in the prediction of the median white point in graphs while the shape of the density distribution has a clearly more accurate fit using the aemet data especially if we examine the navarrete and herrera stations overall the violin plots indicated superior model performance for the aemet data which fitted closely with the observations in contrast to the cfsr data moreover the scatterplots of the aemet and cfsr monthly rainfall versus observed data are also presented the scatterplots indicate that the aemet data seems to fit better on all stations this fact is confirmed from the values of the coefficient of determination r2 obtained based on aemet data r2 values in marco da curra guitiriz madroñera navarrete y herrera rainfall stations were 0 97 0 89 0 94 0 92 and 0 85 respectively while using cfsr dataset r2 values were 0 81 0 81 0 80 0 52 and 0 44 respectively finally mean monthly rainfall pattern was analyzed at the same stations the monthly rainfall patterns are similar being july and august the driest months and concentrating the rainfall between the months of november and january similar to the conclusions obtained through the violin and scatter plots aemet s rainfall estimates are closer to the observed data for example it can be noted that in navarrete station the rainfall is underestimated by cfsr during the rainiest months while in guitiriz or madroñera it is overestimated similar conclusions were obtained in the work published by senent aparicio et al 2018b where precipitation data from aemet s 5 km grid was compared with additional gridded datasets cfsr trmm mswep and persiann over peninsular spain the ability to detect daily precipitation events was also assessed by estimating three categorical statistics the probability of detection pod which represents the ratio of rainy days that were correctly predicted a perfect pod estimation is equal to 1 the false alarm ratio far which measures precipitation detections that did not actually occur i e precipitation that was detected by the precipitation product but not by the rain gauges the value of this ratio varies between 0 and 1 being 0 the optimal value the critical success index csi considers both situations and is based on pod and far being 1 the optimal value to measure the accuracy of the rainfall datasets in terms of precipitation amount and timing patterns six additional indicators were employed 1 correlation coefficient cc 2 root mean square error rmse 3 mean error me 4 relative bias bias 5 total number of days in which rainfall exceeds 1 pd1 or 6 10 mm pd10 the results shown in table 4 indicates that aemet was in better agreement with local stations with high precipitation detection ability compared with the cfsr dataset as can be drawn from the indicators related to the number of rainy days both aemet and cfsr tend to overestimate the number of rainy days however aemet performs better than cfsr in terms of the number of days with heavy rainfall events 10 mm threshold 3 2 temperature comparison similarly to the previous section the observed temperature have been also compared on a monthly scale with the data derived from pswg and cfsr fig 5 similar performances are observed at the marco da curra and guitiriz mirador stations both aemet and cfsr overestimate temperatures in the summer months while in the winter months aemet temperatures are more in accordance with observed temperatures at the station located in the mrb madroñera both datasets fit the observed values adequately however the shape of the density distribution presents a more accurate fit using the aemet data finally the two weather stations used in erb show different trends on the one hand the navarrete station shows a good fit regardless of the data set used on the other hand at the herrera station both aemet and cfsr overestimate the temperature values which can be explained by the location of the station in a high mountain area with steep slopes in the surroundings 3 3 pswg performance evaluation in this section performance of the pswg and cfsr datasets was compared using six different scenarios where missing rates from 10 to 60 were applied and missing data were filled in using both datasets finally we compared swat model outputs from these scenarios with model results using complete historical data as shown in table 4 the pswg dataset clearly outperforms cfsr especially when missing rates exceed 50 when the missing rate was gradually increased nse pbias rsr and kge exhibited the same worsening trends in wetter climate basins model results for even higher missing rates 60 are acceptable with nse values above 0 5 pbias below 25 and rsr below 0 70 in the case of erb the results obtained with the pswg and cfsr datasets are very similar however in the case of lrb the results obtained with pswg are higher than those of cfsr and this difference becomes more pronounced as the missing rate increases in the case of the mrb which is characterized by its semi arid climate the relative superiority of the pswg dataset is also evident here however model performance worsens significantly as the missing rates increase and the pswg dataset results are not acceptable for missing rates above 30 these results can be explained by the pluviometric regime characteristic of semi arid mediterranean climates which are characterized by episodes of heavy rainfall characterized by short and very intense rainfall which cause large floods with a markedly torrential character senent aparicio et al 2016 pérez sánchez et al 2019 indicated based on the application of six hydrological models in sixteen different basins over peninsular spain that the climatic characteristics of the watershed are the most important factor in a hydrological model s performance in addition the effectiveness of the cfsr dataset in this watershed is much lower than that of the pswg dataset in mrb cfsr data significantly increases the simulated water volume as the missing rate increases fig 6 resulting in increasing pbias that can double simulated water volumes compared with observed ones for scenarios with a higher missing rate 60 these results were expected based on previous findings that indicated a global trend in cfsr data to generally overestimate both rainfall and the number of rainy days dhanesh et al 2020 in case studies where the initial pbias is positive and therefore the total volume generated is underestimated the cfsr dataset allows for acceptable data generation however in such basins as mrb where the initial pbias is 22 65 use of the cfsr dataset causes an important worsening of the model performance table 5 4 conclusions meteorological data are the main drivers of hydrological modelling however available meteorological data can have gaps in the data series and often have limited spatial coverage for use in hydrological models such as the swat model to address this limitation swat includes a weather data generator algorithm that can complete these data based on long term weather statistics this work presents a set of weather statistics data pswg calculated for the whole peninsular spain that provides a higher resolution than the statistics calculated from cfsr available on the swat website pswg dataset has been tested in three different basins under the most representative climatic conditions of the peninsular spain showing an improvement in the monthly flow simulation a clear limitation of this work is that daily data on relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed from cfsr are available until july 2014 so the statistics have been calculated for the common period 1979 2013 however the satellite datasets continue to improve so the authors encourage the need for further studies using different satellite data products as well as the use of a larger number of test basins for verification considering the climatic diversity that characterizes peninsular spain to ensure a broader impact from this work s results all weather datasets generated in this study were made available online to promote other swat modelling approaches in peninsular spain as stated in abbaspour et al 2019 data preparation is extremely time consuming and susceptible to errors resulting in much of the research time being spent on data processing instead of output analysis the pswg dataset is archived for long term storage on the swat model website https swat tamu edu data and consists of two wgen database files in microsoft access and sqlite file format that can be used in swat and swat respectively swat is a renovated version of the swat model aimed at solving previous weaknesses and improving the spatial representation of processes interactions bieger et al 2017 that uses the sqlite database engine for data storage besides aemet gridded precipitation and temperature data are available in ready to use swat format at the same url credit authorship contribution statement javier senent
