13155,dairy plants are classified as wet industries since their product processing steps require considerable water according to current statistics india is one of the world s top milk producers most of the effluent generated in the dairy sector comes from clean up procedures from dairy plant equipment to milk transport vehicles dairy effluent treatment systems that use classic biological methods remove organic compounds and nitrogen from effluent at a relatively low cost even though the fat content high organic load and sludge generation in dairy effluent are still a problem to be managed in biological and coagulation reactors therefore dairy effluent treatment and waste management have received much attention in recent years a few critical reviews have examined the role and applicability of geographic information system for dairy waste management this article explores the new dimensions in reviewing the unexplored areas including performance range evaluation of different reactors and

information system membrane reactor 1 introduction in terms of industry the food industry consumes the most water and produces the most effluent per production unit after the chemical and refinery sectors the dairy sector comes third in water use and effluent discharge quantities 1 2 furthermore the food industry generates substantial sludge during biological effluent treatment which is an additional constraint to manage 1 the dairy industry is a significant shareholder in terms of effluent output and water usage according to national dairy development board ndeb india report 2018 the milk production in india is 187 96 million tons india leads the world in milk production accounting for 22 of total output followed by the united states of america china pakistan and brazil raw milk is processed in the industry and several products such as milk milk peda milk powder ice cream whey butter cheese curd yogurt etc are produced roughly 1 to 10 m3 of water is required to produce 1 m3 of milk 3 according to estimates around 2 of all processed milk is lost in drains 4 therefore the process plant effluent is heavy in organic entities such as protein lipids fats carbohydrates detergents sanitizing agents and minerals bod and cod values as a result it is a significant constraint for the dairy manufacturing industry to maintain an effective effluent treatment system to discharge dairy effluent from the factory premises to the water bodies dairy effluents are dumped into streams which may decompose quickly yet have a strong odor 5 dairy effluent also leads to the eutrophication of water highly nutrient effluent promotes the fast development of algae and bacteria which can absorb a significant quantity of oxygen in the water environment causing anaerobic conditions in aquatic creatures and plants and ultimately mass mortality the preparation and transformation of effluent for safe reuse or disposal are referred to as effective industrial effluent treatment and management solids nutrients pathogenic microbes and heavy metals are the primary factors that must be treated or eliminated chemical treatment is required for non biodegradable effluents such as those produced by the pharmaceutical sector or pesticide manufacturers in effluent treatment optimization the environment and local variables are crucial the main potential of effluent treatment optimization is product reuse e g water and nutrients see also sustainable sanitation energy requirement optimization and scale optimization the ability of a functional unit to adapt to a particular environment and the overall sanitation system is the most crucial variable in deciding whether effluent treatment is appropriate the release of dairy effluent without adequate treatment causes environmental issues the dairy effluent treatment procedure is complicated by the high organic content particularly fat content fat biodegradation is quite sluggish another constraint is the varied nature of produced effluent within the same dairy process plant the wastewater generation of a process plant depends upon the size of the plant operating shifts suspended solids this is mainly affected by the cleaning method employed plant equipment wash water etc while designing a suitable etp the constraints are plenty the operational techniques adopted in the process plants the design pattern of plants the degree of water management techniques etc are the significant constraints the volume concentration and composition of effluents produced in a dairy plant are all affected by the kind of product being processed the production program operating techniques processing plant design and the degree of water management technology employed to mention a few factors therefore optimizing and treating industrial effluent especially dairy effluent is challenging advanced tools such as response surface methodology rsm and factorial design methodology fdm are employed for the modeling of industrial effluents to cut down the complexity in plant designs 6 9 the dairy effluent generated in a process plant is categorized as follows reusable water generated from cooling and heating condenser and boilers operations in chemical plant process equipment can be discharged into drainage after periodic intervals wastewater is generated from equipment cleaning spilled milk products whey pressings brines and equipment breakdowns or operational issues wastewater generated from the floor cleaning water channels bottles utensils interiors of tankers cleaning in place cip of industrial equipment and tanks consisting mainly of detergent based wastewater dairy effluent and a range of other food industry effluents have previously been effectively used to land interest in wasteland application is growing due to the regulatory agency s general push to limit the enormous expense of incineration and landfilling and trash dumping into rivers lakes and the ocean 10 the inclusion of hazardous chemicals excessive salt concentrations or severe ph levels may limit the effluent s ability to be applied to land according to marth and steele 11 it may be the most cost effective solution for dairy companies in rural regions due to regulatory enforcement efforts several industries have begun to build effluent treatment plants etps in their facilities with many in various stages of completion in order to decrease the bod load of water to that of domestic sewage high concentration industrial effluents are facilitated with municipal water treatment at the industrial level the water quality of the discharge is mandatory so to meet the required treated water quality standards several types of reactors and technologies are implemented for the dairy effluent treatment basically the treatment methodologies are categorized into four groups biological coagulation processes membrane technology and hybrid technologies the performance range of different reactors and technologies in these four categories are tabulated in this review in the indian scenario the central pollution control board cpcb periodically updates the law for effluent discharge quality and parameters through the pollution control law series table 1 depicts the latest updates from cpcb on dairy effluent discharge quality in wastewater treatment current laboratory technologies such as biohydrogen production and conductive nanoparticles emerge in the future the integration of current laboratory technology with traditional wastewater treatment prospects will accelerate the research and development in the field of wastewater treatment process design and sustainable technologies a geographic information system gis is a computer program that displays information about locations such as latitude and longitude on the earth s surface technocrats can utilize the features of gis to compare the positions of various objects in the map to relate how they are associated with each other for example to study the extent of water pollution weather forecasting mineral resource locating etc adapting gis is a perfect option gis can show many different kinds of data on a single map such as streets roads buildings terrains and vegetation software such as qgis arcgis etc are examples of commonly used gis software among geologists and environmental engineers the researchers can mark the location of the study area sampling sites with the aid of gis software fig 1 depicts the representation of sampling sites using qgis software location kerala india several critical reviews and research work on farm dairy effluent fde discharge management environmental impact assessment studies and proposed remediation are available in the literature 13 15 the evaluation of different types of high rate anaerobic aerobic wastewater treatment methods to hybrid anaerobic aerobic bioreactors is reviewed by goli et al 16 in a critical review raghunath et al 17 discussed the impact of dairy wastewater on the environment and methods for reducing the amount of organic and inorganic materials in wastewater and its treatment even though this review does not includes the details regarding other technologies implemented for dairy effluent treatment a few critical reviews had the role and applicability of geographic information system gis in effluent treatment plants for dairy waste management and treated effluent reusability studies there are no critical reviews available for the reactors and technologies implemented for dairy effluent treatment and the applicability of gis in etp plants for waste management therefore this article explores the new dimensions in reviewing the unexplored areas in dairy effluent treatment and waste management 2 treatment prospects municipal sewage treatment plants can handle specific organic pollutants and should handle specified maximum loads certain components found in dairy waste streams on the other hand may cause issues fat is one material that clings to the central system s walls and creates sedimentation issues in the clarifiers on site pretreatment techniques are advised to minimize the fat content of industrial effluent that can be mixed with sanitary effluent heading to the sewage treatment facility 18 21 dairy effluent is treated among the four technology methods coagulation membrane technology biological and hybrid methods each technique has its supremacy and inferiority in the treatment of dairy effluent availability of land infrastructure and targeted treatment efficiency decide the selectivity of technology and reactor necessary for the design of etps fig 2 illustrates the methods and reactors employed in dairy effluent treatment treatment prospects available for the dairy effluent are in plenty to cope with industrial waste an increasing number of dairy etp s are focusing on onsite effluent treatment water treatment may be accomplished using various technologies including biological coagulation filtration membrane and ultraviolet uv treatment for small and medium scale dairy industries the effluent treatment alternatives incorporated are phytoremediation and constructed wetlands with aquatic macrophytes such as cyperus articulates 22 however it s vital to remember that the chosen treatment option must meet the requirements while reducing long term industrial waste discharge costs biological treatment technologies are a good initial choice for removing organic compounds and nitrogen from effluent at a reasonable price etp design necessitates a complete understanding of the methodologies and parameters for a successful process design the schematic representation of design constraints for dairy effluent treatment plants is depicted in fig 3 engineers and researchers periodically modify the different reactor designs for the efficient and effective treatment of dairy effluent at a reduced cost the main objectives of treating onsite or clean in place cip dairy effluent are a to minimize the required retention time for the treatment process b to minimize the amount of organic matter in the effluent produced c to reduce the required footprint area of the effluent treatment plants d to remove or inactivate potential pathogenic microorganisms e to reduce the operating and overhead constraints of the effluent treatment plant f to lessen the negative environmental impact of effluent discharge into water bodies g to simplify the required process equipment and effluent plant designs h to ensure the reusability of treated effluent within the industrial limit etc the onsite treatment necessitates selecting and implementing a suitable treatment technology and designing the effluent treatment plant therefore the following sections discussed the different treatment methodologies implemented for dairy effluent treatment 2 1 chemical coagulation for dairy effluent treatment dairy effluent treatments in industries are employed by the methods such as chemical coagulation electro coagulation biological processes and membrane technology coagulation flocculation is a physical chemical approach demonstrated to be effective coagulants based on metals make up most of the goods on the market chemical coagulation and flocculation processes are used prior to filtration or sedimentation to improve the removal of finely divided particles by creating more easily settleable flocs 23 the chemical reaction of coagulant with water leads to the formation of insoluble sludge as precipitate which entraps pollutants leading to their decomposition understanding the weakening mechanisms behind chemical reactions is crucial to understanding how pollution reacts with water and other organic molecules 24 26 the formation of polyvalent ions al3 fe2 and fe3 from coagulant dissociation in the solution lead to metal hydroxides formation the charged hydroxyl ions form complexes with the contaminants present in the effluent as the metal hydroxides form as a result the pollutant surface s repulsive charges are destabilized permitting pollutants to agglomerate and form flocs by compressing and collapsing the electrical double layer edl 27 depending on the kind and size of the flocs formed they begin to precipitate and separate from the solution via flotation by rising to the solution s surface or by sedimentation under gravity s impact 28 polymerized metal salts such as poly aluminum chloride or aluminum chlorohydrate are popular chemical coagulants ferric sulfate 29 30 ferric chloride hydrated lime 31 potassium alum 29 poly acrylamide pam 32 tanfloc calcium chloride magnesium chloride 33 carboxymethylcellulose ligno sulfonic acid etc are the other available coagulants the performance range of the listed coagulants is tabulated in table 2 synthetic coagulants have the potential to have extremely high charge densities such as polyamine or poly diallyl dimethylammonium chloride poly dadmac on relatively big molecules even though the availability of coagulants is plenty in numbers the sludge generated from coagulant mediated water treatment is causing secondary contaminants the metal oxides present in this sludge are difficult for treatment and disposal therefore organic coagulants were widely emerging and accepted globally for wastewater treatment organic coagulants are considered as the future of the coagulation process for wastewater treatment natural sources are used to make biopolymer coagulants bio based sources such as lignin chitosan 41 42 tannins 32 starches passion fruit seeds okra seeds 37 and moringa seeds 39 had got broad applicability as a coagulating agent table 2 natural coagulants benefit from reducing the number of metallic ions in the treated effluent 43 one of the practical difficulties of using chemical coagulants is sludge generation in a typical water treatment facility at a range of 0 4 to 0 8 mg of sludge is produced per mg of coagulants incorporated 44 according to hamdani 45 a cubic meter of dairy effluent treated with three coagulants produces has sludge with 0 98 1 38 mg of suspended matter per liter of dairy effluent and costs between 0 01 and 0 25 usd industrially applied coagulants listing with performance range are reviewed by lee 33 studies on sludge management open a remedy for investigating the reusability and proper management of the process plant wastes the coagulant sludge generated during the process still contains a reusability scope as an effective mode of sludge management kushwaha 29 suggested the utilization of the coagulant sludge as boiler fuel and fuel briquettes production the development of value added products recovery from the generated sludge is an explorable scope for researchers it will provide a new dimension to the applicability and economics of coagulation processes in dairy effluent treatment 2 2 electrochemical method for dairy effluent treatment electrocoagulation ec is a promising and moderately environmentally friendly electrochemical wastewater treatment method the electrocoagulation ec technique is a popular approach for treating water and effluent ec method integrates the advantages of coagulation flotation and electrochemistry 25 46 the electrocoagulation method has been extensively used for treating different types of wastewaters in recent decades including wastewater from tanneries 47 textile mills 48 49 laundry 50 dairy 51 and the steel industry 52 etc electrochemical techniques used in dairy treatment include electrocoagulation electro flotation and anodic oxidation ec is an indirect wastewater treatment process that uses metals such as iron or aluminum as anodes aluminum iron or stainless steel are used as electrodes because they are non toxic cost effective and readily available the sacrificial anode s dissolution determines the electrocoagulation process performance this anode produces metal ions acting as coagulating agents in aqueous solutions an electrocoagulation system comprises a metal plate anode and cathode submerged in the aqueous solution being treated ec treatment has grown in popularity as an ecologically friendly wastewater treatment method that generates little sludge requires no additional chemicals and has a compact footprint without sacrificing treatment efficiency 53 the various parameters that affect the performance of the electrocoagulation process depend upon initial ph conductivity temperature current density concentrations of constituents in the effluent electrolyte concentration electrode material stirring speed supporting electrolyte and reaction time 27 51 54 58 the different electrode combinations and the performance range are tabulated in table 3 the ec process efficiency is based on the maximization of flocs yield which defines the adsorption effect of hydroxide flocs the flocs yield reaches its maximum at no aeration condition and flocs yields steadily decrease with time after electrolysis in short the higher the floc the higher the removal efficiency of anion and organics 58 the detailed developmental reviews on the electrocoagulation process its potentials and challenges are available in the articles 25 27 the suggested reviews offer a comprehensive look at current research and the adaptation of the electrocoagulation technique in industrial wastewater treatment integrating multiple technologies such as peroxidation 63 64 chemical coagulation 65 photovoltaic methods 48 66 biological processes 47 membrane technologies 67 68 etc with electrocoagulation method enhance the treatment efficiency it is clear that ec is becoming more critical and has a bright future in wastewater treatment hybrid integration with other separation processes brings it one step closer to replacing traditional treatment systems on a long term basis it is a significant step forward to replace conventional electricity with solar power for the ec process 2 3 biological method for dairy effluent treatment in the case of onsite etp systems biological treatment techniques are usually the primary choice for environmental engineers aerobic or anaerobic treatment techniques are utilized to handle dairy effluent efficiently however sludge produced during aerobic biodegradation can cause significant and expensive disposal issues the potential of sludge to adsorb certain organic molecules and potentially hazardous heavy metals might aggravate this process biological systems benefit from microbial alterations of complex organics and the possibility of heavy metal adsorption by appropriate microorganisms biological processes hold a lot of promise for integrating different biological systems for selective component removal from wastewater in indian climatic conditions most biological treatment design options work efficiently periodic updates of engineering research and applications result in design modifications in reactors and the basic process layout of biological processes tables 4 and 5 depict the operating conditions and performance range for anaerobic and aerobic digester configurations for the design of biological reactors several design parameters need to be considered volumetric flow rate total substrate concentration in influent total substrate concentration in the effluent volume of reactor cross sectional area total substrate loading of the reactor total sludge mass in the reactor total media surface in the reactor residence time superficial velocity substrate loading per unit volume of the reactor substrate loading per unit sludge mass substrate removal per unit volume of the reactor substrate removal per unit sludge mass etc the detailed calculations formulae and design protocols are depicted by chen et al 69 in his book on biological wastewater treatment principles modeling and design is a valuable reference for design engineers the following review session deals with anaerobic and aerobic treatment methods types of reactors and their performance range implemented for dairy effluent treatment 2 3 1 anaerobic biological systems the ability of certain bacteria to thrive on a range of organic molecules in the absence of oxygen eventually converting them to carbon dioxide and methane is known as anaerobic digestion the parameters that influence anaerobic digestion include ph temperature anaerobic environment retention period nutrients and trace metals and inhibition toxicity of the system since the anaerobic process does not require significant energy levels for aeration anaerobic systems are usually regarded as more cost effective for the biological stabilization of dairy wastes in the anaerobic degradation ad process the collaborative action of fermentative syntrophic acetogenic and methanogenic bacteria breaks down organic molecules into ch4 and co2 a detailed review of the anaerobic degradation process and microbial ecology are coined in 10 70 in most anaerobic reactors sludge retention within the reactor is critical to the reactor s functioning while designing the anaerobic reactors the fluid flow rate fluid up flow velocity etc are optimized to minimize the sludge washout from the reactor to minimize methanogens washout and sludge retention durations srt of 20 days or more anaerobic digestion in cstr normally operates at organic loading rates olr below their ideal capacity 36 the reactor washout occurs when biomass is not retained in the reactor leading to a loss of biological activity and as a result the reactor s performance deteriorates the presence of inocula is another critical component in balancing syntrobacter and methanogen populations during anaerobic reactor startup pandey 10 investigated the formation of microcolonies in granular non granular and dairy manure to look for syntrophic frequency of methanogens and syntrophobacter for maximizing biogas efficiency the anaerobic digestion process is dependent on several kinetic factors 71 different types of bacteria are involved in methane production and ideal circumstances must be created for a balanced chain of microbes to pass from one stage to the next hydraulic retention time hrt is determined by temperature ph biomass substrate and c n ratio through direct and indirect interspecies electron transfer ad is a gradual and long term process that takes three to four weeks for microorganisms to shift into a different state due to a temperature change that promotes bacterial growth the c n ratio of biomass must be optimized to balance the carbon supply with the substrate which digests slowly and readily destroys the biomass as the acid concentrations increase the primary constraint in designing the anaerobic reactors at the industrial level is the optimization difficulties of converting the pilot scale to industry in process stability microbial growth rate hrt and increased biogas yield 72 2 3 2 different biological reactors for de treatment for the etp design there are a bunch of reactors available to the process design engineers table 4 enlisted the different reactors and their operational and performance range there is a laboratory to industrial scale reactor designs available continuous stirred tank reactors cstr are generally employed on the laboratory scale lebrato et al 73 reported 90 cod removal at a minimum hrt of 9 0 days the main drawback in operating cstr at the industrial level is the feedstock washout low conversion per unit volume and long retention time requirement for anaerobic degradation bacteria 16 the attractive advantages of cstr are less footprint area and energy requirements less sludge generation and it is cost effective the fixed bed digesters are another design option implemented consisting of permanent porous carrier materials generally activated carbon particles silica granules and polymers are employed as the material for fixed beds 74 bacteria can attach to the packing material s surface through extracellular polysaccharides and ensure close contact with the effluent passes through the packing the main operating difficulties of fixed film reactors are periodic biomass scrapping or backwashing requirements and scale up limitations even though the studies reported the daily scraping of the biofilm obtained from diluted milk powder effluent with a constant thickness increased the biomass yield by 15 and resulted in a poor settling sludge sludge volume index around 200 ml g dry matter in aerobic fixed film reactors 75 currently industrial scale up and parameters optimization are under development for fixed bed digesters anaerobic baffled reactor abr is one of the most uncomplicated and affordable reactors suitable for developing countries with minimal operating and maintenance costs sludge washout and low biogas production are the disadvantages of abr even though the sludge washout problem can be eliminated by incorporating granular or flocculent biomass combination with fixed films in the reactor design 76 such reactors are hybrid baffled biofilm reactors abbrs the clone version of uasb with a filter positioned at the lower and upper portions of the reactor design the performance range of abr is tabulated table 4 the combination of anaerobic and aerobic processes such as the abr aerobic biofilm reactor 77 was investigated to improve water quality furthermore by including biomass immobilization in some compartments a hybrid anaerobic baffled reactor habr system can increase reactor performance by capturing biomass that would otherwise be wasted 78 giordani et al 79 obtained up to 92 cod removal for simulated dairy effluent using a hybrid anaerobic baffled reactor a recent study of abbr and diluted semi skimmed milk with cod 0 5 g l 1 santos et al 80 reported 80 cod removal in an abbr at a hydraulic retention time hrt range of 80 and 10 h the development of a fixed film reactor in wastewater treatment provided a new dimension in reactor design generally plastic or polymeric materials are employed to construct fixed films the immobilized cells on the surface of arranged media or fixed film are less sensitive to ph temperature and toxic substances this is because of the increased local concentration of enzymes and nutrients or the extracellular polymeric matrix which selectively affects toxic or inhibitory substances 16 most dairy etps milma in kerala employed anaerobic fixed film reactors due to their design and operational simplicity the uasb reactors upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors are commonly used to handle dairy wastewater agro wastewater and municipal wastewater 106 the critical design constituents of a traditional uasb reactor are a sludge blanket gas solid separator influent distribution system and effluent withdrawal system the influent is supplied from the bottom of the uasb reactor and flows upwards 107 uasb reactors are particularly desirable because unlike other reactor designs they can handle higher suspended solid and shock loads as well as wastewaters with a wider variety of strengths 18 21 carbohydrates enhance extracellular polysaccharides in dairy wastewaters which aid bacterial aggregation and are thus essential for developing granules required for uasb reactor performance the addition of polymers such as chitosan or percol 763 to the reactors dramatically increases the pace of granule formation 18 the possibility of utilizing upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors for treating dairy effluent and recovery of energy generation potential was investigated by ramasamy et al 81 the report details research into reactor setup the performance of two distinct sludge granules and the impact of varying cod chemical oxygen demand feeding rates on reactor performance the buildup of fat oil and greece fog at the uasb reactor is a typical operating issue the fog accumulation at the reactor top prevents the movement of ch4 and co2 to gas chambers and affects its performance as a remedy for the periodic removal of fog and to minimize biomass washout a novel systematic technique for dairy effluent treatment was developed consisting of a modified uasb reactor with a scum extraction device and a lamella settler 97 this design variation is the advanced integration of multiple design concepts to simplify reactor performance the major attractions of uasb are high removal efficiency minimal sludge generation and biogas recovery uasb has proven to be successful at a variety of temperatures several types of dairy effluent are discharged at room temperature 18 c however the bulk of treatment systems operate at mesophilic 25 45 c or thermophilic 45 65 c temperatures 108 as a result heating requires a lot of energy and keeping anaerobic degradation ad systems at high temperatures is usually expensive and infeasible 109 the situation in india is different there is less of an issue with heating requirements because the temperature is usually or almost in the mesophilic zone in many cases low temperature ad 25 c is often preferable since it allows effluent treatment at discharge temperatures at 15 c mcateer et al 78 stated that dairy effluent s high rate low temperature anaerobic treatment was possible lactococcus is a widespread genus used in the low temperature anaerobic treatment of dairy effluent lactococcus bacteria produce lactic acid by extensively digesting carbohydrates and proteins 110 in short the uasb reactors are widely accepted because they can operate in almost all environmental conditions with limited constraints the performance of uasb reactors in wastewater treatment is enhanced by a set of technical factors and the integration of multiple reactor design variations in uasb reactors designed to treat wastewater containing complex lipids intermittent operation improves the biological conversion efficiency the efficiency of the uasb reactor can be increased by reducing the amount of organic debris that accumulates in the sludge bed during the feed less period by complete mechanization of retained substrates 111 the anaerobic baffled reactor abr is a horizontal multi compartment reactor with the design features of a long biomass retention period minimal sludge formation and acidogenesis and methanogenesis separation abr can maintain a constant amount of active biomass making the process resistant to large organic loads despite the widespread use of abr meeting the enhanced wastewater discharge criteria remains problematic because of the high effluent quality integrating reactors with uasb is suitable for improving performance and treatment efficiency in the treatment of dairy effluent the anaerobic baffled reactor abr and the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb have long been used 112 114 a recent study on dairy effluent ji et al 113 combined an abr and a uasb reactor and obtained a cod removal rate of 98 many design options are available for the anaerobic degradation technique table 4 therefore reactor design option suitability and selectivity depend upon multiple constraints listed in fig 2 even though in the indian scenario the uasb reactors and anaerobic fixed film reactors are commonly employed for dairy effluent treatment because of their efficiency over 90 cod removal and operational advancements 2 3 3 emerging trends in anaerobic biological systems technology is meant to be updated concerning time the emerging technologies are conductive nanoparticles and anaerobic biohydrogen production in anaerobic degradation processes the conductive nanoparticles cnps 1 100 nm have unique physicochemical properties such as high activity high reactive surface area and high specificity to improve performance the addition of cnps accelerates the ad process speeding the hydrolysis or acidification stage by direct or indirect interspecies electron transfer diet 115 in biogas production most research has shown that utilizing various types of conductive nanoparticles such as zero valent metals zvm metal oxide and carbon based nanoparticles improves diet performance 116 in ad conductive nanoparticle s cnp s role increases biogas production capacity from biomass and industrial wastewater depending on operating parameters it is noticed that carbon to nitrogen ratio temperature ph catalytic role 117 118 and cnps size play essential functions in anaerobic digestion in anaerobic degradation biogas production is enhanced by using different kinds of nanoparticles the first step of ad hydrolysis remains to be revealed and the inhibition effects of volatile fatty acids vfas ammonia sulfides and h2 need to reduce the ad process necessitates water recovery and energy production with zero solid discharge 119 a comparative study is required to investigate the positive and negative impacts of cnps on ad most research on ad process management has narrowed and focused on pollution control and energy generation furthermore research is required to modify the relationship between microbes and cnps during the ad process 120 the recent review by jadav et al 115 on conductive nanoparticles discussed various types of cnps used in digestion methods to enhance the biogas production and degradation performance its limitations inhibition effects and finally mathematical modeling for predicting microbial behavior during different conditions in ad processes this article focuses on the applicability of cnps in wastewater treatment even though the adaptation of cnps in dairy effluent treatment is still in its infancy to be explored in the future the ad mediated cnp processes are the emerging technology to boost the applicability future of the ad process anaerobic biohydrogen production bhp technology is another rapidly advancing technology implemented for wastewater treatment the bhp technology processes high strength organic wastewater including food waste molasses cassava waste 121 algae waste and water hyacinths producing biohydrogen a renewable energy carrier a two stage anaerobic digestion system has been developed in the recent decade to create biohydrogen and methane simultaneously 122 125 since about 65 of organics are present in wastewater as alcohol and organic acids fermentative hydrogen generation from organic matter still has a low energy recovery efficiency 126 127 is the challenge in developing bhp in this context adopting two phase systems in which fermentation is followed by anaerobic digestion might help optimize the residual energy utilization methane 50 65 and carbon dioxide 35 50 make up the biogas produced utilized to create energy or heat 128 the implementation of bhp from dairy effluent treatment is not yet explored since the dairy effluent has a high amount of organic content the scope of using it as a source for biohydrogen production is the future perspective for many researchers 2 3 4 aerobic biological systems the aerobic biological treatment process is defined as the breakdown and oxidation of waste by microorganisms in the presence of oxygen in the conventional aerobic treatment activated sludge 129 rotating biological contactors trickling filters aerated lagoons sequential batch reactor 130 132 membrane bioreactors or combinations are used particularly dairy effluent the sequential batch reactor sbr appears to be the most promising aerobic technique for treating dairy effluent among the numerous aerobic methods sbr is a sludge system that s triggered by filling and draining wastewater is pumped into an sbr where it is treated to remove contaminants before being discharged back into the system furthermore anaerobic techniques have poor nutrient removal efficiency whereas aerobic methods produce a lot of extra sludge and consume a lot of energy 133 134 microbes oxidize organics to carbon dioxide water and cellular material in an oxygen rich environment different varieties of heterotrophic microbes bacillus cereus escherichia coli enterobacter etc and yeast candida saccharomyces etc are present in dairy effluent 135 136 to allow for the establishment of a competitive microbial population most startups require an acclimatization period microbial growth and stabilization are enhanced during the initial acclimation or startup period the addition of inoculums or sludge from similar processing plants will shorten this acclimation period problems associated with aerobic processes include foaming and poor solid liquid separation bulking precipitation of iron and carbonates excessive sludge production and decreased efficiency during winter many reports demonstrate that the activated sludge process asp has effectively been utilized to remediate the dairy sector waster russell 137 discovered that using a milk powder butter mixture consistent cod and nitrogen removals of over 90 and 65 were accomplishable the operating conditions and performance range for aerobic digester configurations for dairy effluent treatment is represented in table 5 the jet loop membrane bioreactor jlmbr and sequential batch reactor sbr are the most popular and efficient aerobic dairy effluent treatment reactors the jlmbr bioreactor is a cylindrical vessel with a height to diameter ratio of about 7 1 it consists mainly of a draft tube a cross flow microfiltration unit and a degassing tank in the jlmbr bioreactor the fluid flow is initially from top to bottom within the annulus draught tube and later rises within the annulus between the reactor wall and the draught tube the provision for fluid recycling from the top side of the draught tube results in re dispersion of the bubbles and biomass generation by the biological reaction 138 the key benefit of installing jlmbr is that it requires less land has lower installation and maintenance costs and uses less energy 147 148 the sequential batch reactor sbr is a fill and draw type reactor that integrates bod oxidation nitrification denitrification and settling into a single unit 149 in other words equalization aeration and clarification may all be accomplished using a single sequential batch reactor the key advantages of sbr are ease of operation low cost handling hydraulic fluctuation no requirement for a settling tank sludge recycling and consistent organic load removal efficiency 150 151 aerobic granule formation in sbr is the best suited mechanism for maximum effluent separation and settling the granular sludge quickly the aggregation of micro organisms forms granules one single granule can have millions of copies of a cell type these granules are very compact and densely aggregated they have suitable settling properties and resistivity for a long duration to survive long term contact when this aggregation occurs between the same species it is called auto aggregation while in the case of different cells it is named coaggregation 149 bunn et al 152 developed the granules in an sbr airlift type with acetate cod 2 5 kg m3d loading in 1 week the low strength municipal wastewater was treated with sbr aerobic granules resulting in 90 cod removal and 95 nitrogen removal after 300 days 153 it is reported for dairy effluent treatment aerobic granular sludge in sbr at a 15 30 min retention time with 90 cod 80 n and 67 p removal efficiency 154 membrane bioreactor is one of the emerging and currently more applied reactor technology implemented for the treatment of wastewater mediated by membranes both organic and ceramic membranes are employed in membrane bioreactors fouling issue is the major drawback in membrane bioreactor performance powder activated carbon pac at a dosing rate of 5 g l reduces fouling 155 even though membranes high cost and operational difficulties are the significant constraints to be rectified the hybridization of aerobic and anaerobic technologies with membranes for etp design is the current biological wastewater treatment trend with a water reusability scope hybrid biological wastewater treatment technology has a crucial role and applicability to reduce retention time requirements and enhance overall treatment efficiency 2 4 membrane technologies in dairy effluent treatment membrane filtration is a tertiary wastewater treatment procedure that polishes effluent quality to satisfy high discharge criteria or allows treated effluents to be reused to replace freshwater supplies membrane filtration is the process of removing or separating particulate and colloidal particles from a liquid by passing them through a selective barrier with a diameter of 0 0001 1 0 m the two types of membranes that can be used are porous membranes microfiltration ultrafiltration and nanofiltration and dense membranes microfiltration ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membrane technology may be classified based on the kind of membrane the pressure force the configuration and the removal method microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration dialysis electrodialysis and reverse osmosis are all viable approaches to membrane technologies the wastewater business bacteria and virus eradication paint treatment for the metal industry and the textile industry are applications requiring ultrafiltration techniques 156 159 when integrated with biological and chemical processes membrane based technologies have promise for dairy water reclamation fouling high investment and operating costs are the series of disadvantages that affect membrane technology implementation 157 in order to control fouling problems chemical coagulants or adsorbents such as powdered activated carbon or zeolite are commonly employed to increase filtering efficiency to minimize the quantity of suspended and colloidal elements that cause turbidity in the feed solution table 6 represents the types and performance range of various membranes used in dairy effluent treatment ultrafiltration membranes and processes are gaining featured attention within the scientific research community as measured by the scientific database platforms one of the statistical reviews on the number of articles published in ultrafiltration technology and wastewater treatment based on 4547 articles from 2010 to 2018 al aani et al 167 pointed out the growth increased by 12 based on the available statistics there is no doubt that the research community will persevere and enhance membrane technology s overall performance especially uf in the future 3 reusability of treated dairy effluent dairy effluents reusability within the production plant premises is there for robust process design constrain in etps due to water scarcity and the high demand for water in the dairy sector the reusability of treated water from etps is advantageous dairy effluents can be dispersed on flat terrain using spray nozzles or ridge and troughs the nature and availability of soil topography and waste quality all impact the method adopted for irrigation in most dairy plants located in kerala the treated effluent is used for gardening purposes as a source for cleaning dairy transport vehicles cleaning equipment and utensils the generated sludge is dried in the sludge drying bed and used as fertilizer the dairy effluent treatment plant 300m3 day is represented in fig 4 the anaerobic fixed film reactor is the core of this process the downstream processing stage selection will be more sophisticated if the procedure requires pure versions of treated water in this required scenario membrane technology is implemented along with reverse osmosis and uv disinfection units for correctly returning various wastewater products to the environment the technologies and procedures are wastewater recharge and reuse this is achieved by productive use or if direct reuse is not desired safe disposal or recharging is suggested it is always better to reuse the water nutrients and energy contained in various waste streams if at all possible the efficiency of wastewater reuse is thus determined by how it is collected and pre treated the composting products are made from organic waste and sludge as soil amendments and livestock feed therefore the practical reusability of treated wastewater and sludge within the plant premises results from a functional well engineered process design planning and execution 4 geographic information system gis in effluent treatment and sludge disposal the adaptation of remote sensing and gis methods in environmental impact assessment eia studies is the current boom in environmental engineering research remote sensing is the science of gathering data about an item or phenomenon without directly contacting it remote sensing is a more cost effective time saving and efficient technique of acquiring data from inaccessible remote regions such as steep or rugged terrains familiar in arid and semi arid nations than field surveys 168 169 on the other hand a geographic information system gis combines standard database functions with maps such as querying and statistical analysis integrating rs findings with different complicated sets of data collected by the techniques such as geophysics geochemistry and field data allows reliable information on mineral occurrences to be extracted 170 using satellite image technology and gis is suitable for locating convenient centralized etp s especially in cities implementing gis ensures a future scope to design modification possibilities and city planning effectively and systematically environmental impact assessments eias are a strategic environmental assessment tool for global environmental planning and management eia studies based on the adaptation of the gis method are an effective method for data representation gis is applied in field studies locating water and soil contamination studies climatic change studies geological surveys population and human health studies risk of accidents and disasters human health and population marine environment social impacts etc 170 176 for the execution of eia each nation has its own set of regulations and processes in india projects are divided into two categories based on their capacity category a and category b the ministry of environment and forests and state pollution control boards spcb monitor the project screening procedures 177 the application of gis software to environmental contamination uses spatial interpolation methods from gis to map out pollutants in soil and water spatial interpolation provides a more practical approach to soil and water contamination treatment and monitoring metal and other pollution of soil and water have become a serious environmental issue in many regions of the world due to industrialization in digital processing spectral improvement and spectral classification the software packages pci geomatica envi erdas and arcgis with different versions and capabilities are utilized 170 in particular geographic information system gis mapping and profiling effluent treatment plants especially dairy effluent treatment plants are not well studied even though just a few researchers have worked on this topic the gis software tool arcgis v 10 is used for finding locations appropriate for anaerobic degradation systems ads that are accessible to a large number of dairy farms in addison county vermont as well as analyzing these sites for optimization to maximize the system s energy return was reported by thompson 178 is one such attempt fig 5 later stafford 173 utilized a gis tool to investigate soil cd concentrations on two long term dairy farms in new zealand s waikato and canterbury regions the contamination of groundwater and soil occurs due to inappropriate effluent treatment and discharge into the environment from the factories industries the gis technique is an excellent way to portray a plant s impact on its surroundings researchers from all across the world used gis technologies to perform eia studies to highlight this negative impact the groundwater contamination results from the discharge of effluents from the wastewater treatment plant wwtp into the alluvial artesian basin from a distance from the discharge point ankeny usa outfall was reported by hubbard 172 in the same year a similar work on the primary wastewater flow direction estimated extent of upstream effluent recirculation etc was marked on the map by bradley 180 process integration is a cost effective method adopted in the industries to cut down the operating cost by clubbing multiple processes haque 179 employed the geographic information system gis to identify the sources of industrial sludge generation in bangladesh and potential management strategies fig 6 the study suggests a symbiosis of industry generated sludge and its productive routing to adjacent brick kilns as a clay substitute one of the critical advantages of using gis in the project is that it allows technocrats to create a perfect portrayal of environmental contamination status therefore assisting technocrats in executing perfect strategic remediation to manage pollution 5 perspectives the treatment options available for dairy effluent at industrial levels are plenty from the author s perspective the decision on selectivity adaptability and implementation of a treatment technology varies on the situation currently the anaerobic and aerobic treatment methods and reactors for dairy effluent are the engineer s choice to design etps there are a lot of emerging technologies especially conductive nanoparticles and anaerobic biohydrogen production bhp technology on their outbreak phase to be a permanent inclusion in all anaerobic reactor designs at the industrial level anti fouling membrane technology is emerging rapidly which will boost membrane based reactor designs in the future the organic coagulants extracted from natural sources open the scope of coagulation processes in a new dimension from an economics perspective cutting edge findings from this field will overcome the constraints of chemical coagulant cost requirements therefore future dairy effluent treatment trends rely on these current laboratory technologies hybridization of multiple biological reactors in a process design will enhance the performance of etp geographic information system and its practical scope in eia studies is an emerging approach to access the impact of a process plant on the surrounding therefore gis implementation for assessing the environmental impact assessment due to the industrial operations and effluent release to the environment is a future research area 6 conclusions biological chemical electrochemical and membrane technologies are effectively implemented for dairy effluent treatment the various reactor setups as well as performance range are tabulated in this review however each method has advantages and drawbacks that need to be considered for example biological treatment selection of effective reactor design depends on the environmental factors cost factor land and availability of infrastructure performance based selection of reactors is secondary in some contexts in terms of anaerobic degradation the uasb reactor and anaerobic fixed film reactor are engineers choices because of the high treatment efficiency in aerobic bioreactors sequential batch reactor is the choice of interest combining cnps technology with the ad process boosts anaerobic processes performance with limited investment chemical process coagulation is expensive due to coagulant cost research focuses on natural materials as coagulating agents are booming to cut down the cost requirement of chemical coagulants the optimization and scale up of the coagulation process and reactor designs for de treatment can be expected in the future the al and fe electrode is commonly used in electrocoagulation reactor designs the electrode and operating costs at the industrial level are expensive the photovoltaic cell is a reliable addition to the etp process design to reduce operating costs particularly in electrocoagulation reactors membrane technology is an advanced method for effluent treatment fouling choking etc are the main constraints in adapting membrane technology in effluent treatment incorporating membranes as a tertiary treatment component is a remedy to minimize the operational problems and increase the membrane life in the case of etp with water recycling requirements advanced methodologies and technologies are the best options electrocoagulation membrane technology etc will be the choice of etp designs in that case recent research has reported integrating multiple reactor designs into the process enhances the performance of the dairy effluent treatment at a minimal cost the scope of dealing with treated wastewater discharge and sludge disposal after treatment opens a new area of eia studies a few research explored the adaptation of gis mediated performance evaluation of etps therefore the transformation of gis tools for environmental impact assessment studies to evaluate the performance of etps is the future scope of sustainable engineering and eia studies funding the authors would like to express their sincere

13155,dairy plants are classified as wet industries since their product processing steps require considerable water according to current statistics india is one of the world s top milk producers most of the effluent generated in the dairy sector comes from clean up procedures from dairy plant equipment to milk transport vehicles dairy effluent treatment systems that use classic biological methods remove organic compounds and nitrogen from effluent at a relatively low cost even though the fat content high organic load and sludge generation in dairy effluent are still a problem to be managed in biological and coagulation reactors therefore dairy effluent treatment and waste management have received much attention in recent years a few critical reviews have examined the role and applicability of geographic information system for dairy waste management this article explores the new dimensions in reviewing the unexplored areas including performance range evaluation of different reactors and

information system membrane reactor 1 introduction in terms of industry the food industry consumes the most water and produces the most effluent per production unit after the chemical and refinery sectors the dairy sector comes third in water use and effluent discharge quantities 1 2 furthermore the food industry generates substantial sludge during biological effluent treatment which is an additional constraint to manage 1 the dairy industry is a significant shareholder in terms of effluent output and water usage according to national dairy development board ndeb india report 2018 the milk production in india is 187 96 million tons india leads the world in milk production accounting for 22 of total output followed by the united states of america china pakistan and brazil raw milk is processed in the industry and several products such as milk milk peda milk powder ice cream whey butter cheese curd yogurt etc are produced roughly 1 to 10 m3 of water is required to produce 1 m3 of milk 3 according to estimates around 2 of all processed milk is lost in drains 4 therefore the process plant effluent is heavy in organic entities such as protein lipids fats carbohydrates detergents sanitizing agents and minerals bod and cod values as a result it is a significant constraint for the dairy manufacturing industry to maintain an effective effluent treatment system to discharge dairy effluent from the factory premises to the water bodies dairy effluents are dumped into streams which may decompose quickly yet have a strong odor 5 dairy effluent also leads to the eutrophication of water highly nutrient effluent promotes the fast development of algae and bacteria which can absorb a significant quantity of oxygen in the water environment causing anaerobic conditions in aquatic creatures and plants and ultimately mass mortality the preparation and transformation of effluent for safe reuse or disposal are referred to as effective industrial effluent treatment and management solids nutrients pathogenic microbes and heavy metals are the primary factors that must be treated or eliminated chemical treatment is required for non biodegradable effluents such as those produced by the pharmaceutical sector or pesticide manufacturers in effluent treatment optimization the environment and local variables are crucial the main potential of effluent treatment optimization is product reuse e g water and nutrients see also sustainable sanitation energy requirement optimization and scale optimization the ability of a functional unit to adapt to a particular environment and the overall sanitation system is the most crucial variable in deciding whether effluent treatment is appropriate the release of dairy effluent without adequate treatment causes environmental issues the dairy effluent treatment procedure is complicated by the high organic content particularly fat content fat biodegradation is quite sluggish another constraint is the varied nature of produced effluent within the same dairy process plant the wastewater generation of a process plant depends upon the size of the plant operating shifts suspended solids this is mainly affected by the cleaning method employed plant equipment wash water etc while designing a suitable etp the constraints are plenty the operational techniques adopted in the process plants the design pattern of plants the degree of water management techniques etc are the significant constraints the volume concentration and composition of effluents produced in a dairy plant are all affected by the kind of product being processed the production program operating techniques processing plant design and the degree of water management technology employed to mention a few factors therefore optimizing and treating industrial effluent especially dairy effluent is challenging advanced tools such as response surface methodology rsm and factorial design methodology fdm are employed for the modeling of industrial effluents to cut down the complexity in plant designs 6 9 the dairy effluent generated in a process plant is categorized as follows reusable water generated from cooling and heating condenser and boilers operations in chemical plant process equipment can be discharged into drainage after periodic intervals wastewater is generated from equipment cleaning spilled milk products whey pressings brines and equipment breakdowns or operational issues wastewater generated from the floor cleaning water channels bottles utensils interiors of tankers cleaning in place cip of industrial equipment and tanks consisting mainly of detergent based wastewater dairy effluent and a range of other food industry effluents have previously been effectively used to land interest in wasteland application is growing due to the regulatory agency s general push to limit the enormous expense of incineration and landfilling and trash dumping into rivers lakes and the ocean 10 the inclusion of hazardous chemicals excessive salt concentrations or severe ph levels may limit the effluent s ability to be applied to land according to marth and steele 11 it may be the most cost effective solution for dairy companies in rural regions due to regulatory enforcement efforts several industries have begun to build effluent treatment plants etps in their facilities with many in various stages of completion in order to decrease the bod load of water to that of domestic sewage high concentration industrial effluents are facilitated with municipal water treatment at the industrial level the water quality of the discharge is mandatory so to meet the required treated water quality standards several types of reactors and technologies are implemented for the dairy effluent treatment basically the treatment methodologies are categorized into four groups biological coagulation processes membrane technology and hybrid technologies the performance range of different reactors and technologies in these four categories are tabulated in this review in the indian scenario the central pollution control board cpcb periodically updates the law for effluent discharge quality and parameters through the pollution control law series table 1 depicts the latest updates from cpcb on dairy effluent discharge quality in wastewater treatment current laboratory technologies such as biohydrogen production and conductive nanoparticles emerge in the future the integration of current laboratory technology with traditional wastewater treatment prospects will accelerate the research and development in the field of wastewater treatment process design and sustainable technologies a geographic information system gis is a computer program that displays information about locations such as latitude and longitude on the earth s surface technocrats can utilize the features of gis to compare the positions of various objects in the map to relate how they are associated with each other for example to study the extent of water pollution weather forecasting mineral resource locating etc adapting gis is a perfect option gis can show many different kinds of data on a single map such as streets roads buildings terrains and vegetation software such as qgis arcgis etc are examples of commonly used gis software among geologists and environmental engineers the researchers can mark the location of the study area sampling sites with the aid of gis software fig 1 depicts the representation of sampling sites using qgis software location kerala india several critical reviews and research work on farm dairy effluent fde discharge management environmental impact assessment studies and proposed remediation are available in the literature 13 15 the evaluation of different types of high rate anaerobic aerobic wastewater treatment methods to hybrid anaerobic aerobic bioreactors is reviewed by goli et al 16 in a critical review raghunath et al 17 discussed the impact of dairy wastewater on the environment and methods for reducing the amount of organic and inorganic materials in wastewater and its treatment even though this review does not includes the details regarding other technologies implemented for dairy effluent treatment a few critical reviews had the role and applicability of geographic information system gis in effluent treatment plants for dairy waste management and treated effluent reusability studies there are no critical reviews available for the reactors and technologies implemented for dairy effluent treatment and the applicability of gis in etp plants for waste management therefore this article explores the new dimensions in reviewing the unexplored areas in dairy effluent treatment and waste management 2 treatment prospects municipal sewage treatment plants can handle specific organic pollutants and should handle specified maximum loads certain components found in dairy waste streams on the other hand may cause issues fat is one material that clings to the central system s walls and creates sedimentation issues in the clarifiers on site pretreatment techniques are advised to minimize the fat content of industrial effluent that can be mixed with sanitary effluent heading to the sewage treatment facility 18 21 dairy effluent is treated among the four technology methods coagulation membrane technology biological and hybrid methods each technique has its supremacy and inferiority in the treatment of dairy effluent availability of land infrastructure and targeted treatment efficiency decide the selectivity of technology and reactor necessary for the design of etps fig 2 illustrates the methods and reactors employed in dairy effluent treatment treatment prospects available for the dairy effluent are in plenty to cope with industrial waste an increasing number of dairy etp s are focusing on onsite effluent treatment water treatment may be accomplished using various technologies including biological coagulation filtration membrane and ultraviolet uv treatment for small and medium scale dairy industries the effluent treatment alternatives incorporated are phytoremediation and constructed wetlands with aquatic macrophytes such as cyperus articulates 22 however it s vital to remember that the chosen treatment option must meet the requirements while reducing long term industrial waste discharge costs biological treatment technologies are a good initial choice for removing organic compounds and nitrogen from effluent at a reasonable price etp design necessitates a complete understanding of the methodologies and parameters for a successful process design the schematic representation of design constraints for dairy effluent treatment plants is depicted in fig 3 engineers and researchers periodically modify the different reactor designs for the efficient and effective treatment of dairy effluent at a reduced cost the main objectives of treating onsite or clean in place cip dairy effluent are a to minimize the required retention time for the treatment process b to minimize the amount of organic matter in the effluent produced c to reduce the required footprint area of the effluent treatment plants d to remove or inactivate potential pathogenic microorganisms e to reduce the operating and overhead constraints of the effluent treatment plant f to lessen the negative environmental impact of effluent discharge into water bodies g to simplify the required process equipment and effluent plant designs h to ensure the reusability of treated effluent within the industrial limit etc the onsite treatment necessitates selecting and implementing a suitable treatment technology and designing the effluent treatment plant therefore the following sections discussed the different treatment methodologies implemented for dairy effluent treatment 2 1 chemical coagulation for dairy effluent treatment dairy effluent treatments in industries are employed by the methods such as chemical coagulation electro coagulation biological processes and membrane technology coagulation flocculation is a physical chemical approach demonstrated to be effective coagulants based on metals make up most of the goods on the market chemical coagulation and flocculation processes are used prior to filtration or sedimentation to improve the removal of finely divided particles by creating more easily settleable flocs 23 the chemical reaction of coagulant with water leads to the formation of insoluble sludge as precipitate which entraps pollutants leading to their decomposition understanding the weakening mechanisms behind chemical reactions is crucial to understanding how pollution reacts with water and other organic molecules 24 26 the formation of polyvalent ions al3 fe2 and fe3 from coagulant dissociation in the solution lead to metal hydroxides formation the charged hydroxyl ions form complexes with the contaminants present in the effluent as the metal hydroxides form as a result the pollutant surface s repulsive charges are destabilized permitting pollutants to agglomerate and form flocs by compressing and collapsing the electrical double layer edl 27 depending on the kind and size of the flocs formed they begin to precipitate and separate from the solution via flotation by rising to the solution s surface or by sedimentation under gravity s impact 28 polymerized metal salts such as poly aluminum chloride or aluminum chlorohydrate are popular chemical coagulants ferric sulfate 29 30 ferric chloride hydrated lime 31 potassium alum 29 poly acrylamide pam 32 tanfloc calcium chloride magnesium chloride 33 carboxymethylcellulose ligno sulfonic acid etc are the other available coagulants the performance range of the listed coagulants is tabulated in table 2 synthetic coagulants have the potential to have extremely high charge densities such as polyamine or poly diallyl dimethylammonium chloride poly dadmac on relatively big molecules even though the availability of coagulants is plenty in numbers the sludge generated from coagulant mediated water treatment is causing secondary contaminants the metal oxides present in this sludge are difficult for treatment and disposal therefore organic coagulants were widely emerging and accepted globally for wastewater treatment organic coagulants are considered as the future of the coagulation process for wastewater treatment natural sources are used to make biopolymer coagulants bio based sources such as lignin chitosan 41 42 tannins 32 starches passion fruit seeds okra seeds 37 and moringa seeds 39 had got broad applicability as a coagulating agent table 2 natural coagulants benefit from reducing the number of metallic ions in the treated effluent 43 one of the practical difficulties of using chemical coagulants is sludge generation in a typical water treatment facility at a range of 0 4 to 0 8 mg of sludge is produced per mg of coagulants incorporated 44 according to hamdani 45 a cubic meter of dairy effluent treated with three coagulants produces has sludge with 0 98 1 38 mg of suspended matter per liter of dairy effluent and costs between 0 01 and 0 25 usd industrially applied coagulants listing with performance range are reviewed by lee 33 studies on sludge management open a remedy for investigating the reusability and proper management of the process plant wastes the coagulant sludge generated during the process still contains a reusability scope as an effective mode of sludge management kushwaha 29 suggested the utilization of the coagulant sludge as boiler fuel and fuel briquettes production the development of value added products recovery from the generated sludge is an explorable scope for researchers it will provide a new dimension to the applicability and economics of coagulation processes in dairy effluent treatment 2 2 electrochemical method for dairy effluent treatment electrocoagulation ec is a promising and moderately environmentally friendly electrochemical wastewater treatment method the electrocoagulation ec technique is a popular approach for treating water and effluent ec method integrates the advantages of coagulation flotation and electrochemistry 25 46 the electrocoagulation method has been extensively used for treating different types of wastewaters in recent decades including wastewater from tanneries 47 textile mills 48 49 laundry 50 dairy 51 and the steel industry 52 etc electrochemical techniques used in dairy treatment include electrocoagulation electro flotation and anodic oxidation ec is an indirect wastewater treatment process that uses metals such as iron or aluminum as anodes aluminum iron or stainless steel are used as electrodes because they are non toxic cost effective and readily available the sacrificial anode s dissolution determines the electrocoagulation process performance this anode produces metal ions acting as coagulating agents in aqueous solutions an electrocoagulation system comprises a metal plate anode and cathode submerged in the aqueous solution being treated ec treatment has grown in popularity as an ecologically friendly wastewater treatment method that generates little sludge requires no additional chemicals and has a compact footprint without sacrificing treatment efficiency 53 the various parameters that affect the performance of the electrocoagulation process depend upon initial ph conductivity temperature current density concentrations of constituents in the effluent electrolyte concentration electrode material stirring speed supporting electrolyte and reaction time 27 51 54 58 the different electrode combinations and the performance range are tabulated in table 3 the ec process efficiency is based on the maximization of flocs yield which defines the adsorption effect of hydroxide flocs the flocs yield reaches its maximum at no aeration condition and flocs yields steadily decrease with time after electrolysis in short the higher the floc the higher the removal efficiency of anion and organics 58 the detailed developmental reviews on the electrocoagulation process its potentials and challenges are available in the articles 25 27 the suggested reviews offer a comprehensive look at current research and the adaptation of the electrocoagulation technique in industrial wastewater treatment integrating multiple technologies such as peroxidation 63 64 chemical coagulation 65 photovoltaic methods 48 66 biological processes 47 membrane technologies 67 68 etc with electrocoagulation method enhance the treatment efficiency it is clear that ec is becoming more critical and has a bright future in wastewater treatment hybrid integration with other separation processes brings it one step closer to replacing traditional treatment systems on a long term basis it is a significant step forward to replace conventional electricity with solar power for the ec process 2 3 biological method for dairy effluent treatment in the case of onsite etp systems biological treatment techniques are usually the primary choice for environmental engineers aerobic or anaerobic treatment techniques are utilized to handle dairy effluent efficiently however sludge produced during aerobic biodegradation can cause significant and expensive disposal issues the potential of sludge to adsorb certain organic molecules and potentially hazardous heavy metals might aggravate this process biological systems benefit from microbial alterations of complex organics and the possibility of heavy metal adsorption by appropriate microorganisms biological processes hold a lot of promise for integrating different biological systems for selective component removal from wastewater in indian climatic conditions most biological treatment design options work efficiently periodic updates of engineering research and applications result in design modifications in reactors and the basic process layout of biological processes tables 4 and 5 depict the operating conditions and performance range for anaerobic and aerobic digester configurations for the design of biological reactors several design parameters need to be considered volumetric flow rate total substrate concentration in influent total substrate concentration in the effluent volume of reactor cross sectional area total substrate loading of the reactor total sludge mass in the reactor total media surface in the reactor residence time superficial velocity substrate loading per unit volume of the reactor substrate loading per unit sludge mass substrate removal per unit volume of the reactor substrate removal per unit sludge mass etc the detailed calculations formulae and design protocols are depicted by chen et al 69 in his book on biological wastewater treatment principles modeling and design is a valuable reference for design engineers the following review session deals with anaerobic and aerobic treatment methods types of reactors and their performance range implemented for dairy effluent treatment 2 3 1 anaerobic biological systems the ability of certain bacteria to thrive on a range of organic molecules in the absence of oxygen eventually converting them to carbon dioxide and methane is known as anaerobic digestion the parameters that influence anaerobic digestion include ph temperature anaerobic environment retention period nutrients and trace metals and inhibition toxicity of the system since the anaerobic process does not require significant energy levels for aeration anaerobic systems are usually regarded as more cost effective for the biological stabilization of dairy wastes in the anaerobic degradation ad process the collaborative action of fermentative syntrophic acetogenic and methanogenic bacteria breaks down organic molecules into ch4 and co2 a detailed review of the anaerobic degradation process and microbial ecology are coined in 10 70 in most anaerobic reactors sludge retention within the reactor is critical to the reactor s functioning while designing the anaerobic reactors the fluid flow rate fluid up flow velocity etc are optimized to minimize the sludge washout from the reactor to minimize methanogens washout and sludge retention durations srt of 20 days or more anaerobic digestion in cstr normally operates at organic loading rates olr below their ideal capacity 36 the reactor washout occurs when biomass is not retained in the reactor leading to a loss of biological activity and as a result the reactor s performance deteriorates the presence of inocula is another critical component in balancing syntrobacter and methanogen populations during anaerobic reactor startup pandey 10 investigated the formation of microcolonies in granular non granular and dairy manure to look for syntrophic frequency of methanogens and syntrophobacter for maximizing biogas efficiency the anaerobic digestion process is dependent on several kinetic factors 71 different types of bacteria are involved in methane production and ideal circumstances must be created for a balanced chain of microbes to pass from one stage to the next hydraulic retention time hrt is determined by temperature ph biomass substrate and c n ratio through direct and indirect interspecies electron transfer ad is a gradual and long term process that takes three to four weeks for microorganisms to shift into a different state due to a temperature change that promotes bacterial growth the c n ratio of biomass must be optimized to balance the carbon supply with the substrate which digests slowly and readily destroys the biomass as the acid concentrations increase the primary constraint in designing the anaerobic reactors at the industrial level is the optimization difficulties of converting the pilot scale to industry in process stability microbial growth rate hrt and increased biogas yield 72 2 3 2 different biological reactors for de treatment for the etp design there are a bunch of reactors available to the process design engineers table 4 enlisted the different reactors and their operational and performance range there is a laboratory to industrial scale reactor designs available continuous stirred tank reactors cstr are generally employed on the laboratory scale lebrato et al 73 reported 90 cod removal at a minimum hrt of 9 0 days the main drawback in operating cstr at the industrial level is the feedstock washout low conversion per unit volume and long retention time requirement for anaerobic degradation bacteria 16 the attractive advantages of cstr are less footprint area and energy requirements less sludge generation and it is cost effective the fixed bed digesters are another design option implemented consisting of permanent porous carrier materials generally activated carbon particles silica granules and polymers are employed as the material for fixed beds 74 bacteria can attach to the packing material s surface through extracellular polysaccharides and ensure close contact with the effluent passes through the packing the main operating difficulties of fixed film reactors are periodic biomass scrapping or backwashing requirements and scale up limitations even though the studies reported the daily scraping of the biofilm obtained from diluted milk powder effluent with a constant thickness increased the biomass yield by 15 and resulted in a poor settling sludge sludge volume index around 200 ml g dry matter in aerobic fixed film reactors 75 currently industrial scale up and parameters optimization are under development for fixed bed digesters anaerobic baffled reactor abr is one of the most uncomplicated and affordable reactors suitable for developing countries with minimal operating and maintenance costs sludge washout and low biogas production are the disadvantages of abr even though the sludge washout problem can be eliminated by incorporating granular or flocculent biomass combination with fixed films in the reactor design 76 such reactors are hybrid baffled biofilm reactors abbrs the clone version of uasb with a filter positioned at the lower and upper portions of the reactor design the performance range of abr is tabulated table 4 the combination of anaerobic and aerobic processes such as the abr aerobic biofilm reactor 77 was investigated to improve water quality furthermore by including biomass immobilization in some compartments a hybrid anaerobic baffled reactor habr system can increase reactor performance by capturing biomass that would otherwise be wasted 78 giordani et al 79 obtained up to 92 cod removal for simulated dairy effluent using a hybrid anaerobic baffled reactor a recent study of abbr and diluted semi skimmed milk with cod 0 5 g l 1 santos et al 80 reported 80 cod removal in an abbr at a hydraulic retention time hrt range of 80 and 10 h the development of a fixed film reactor in wastewater treatment provided a new dimension in reactor design generally plastic or polymeric materials are employed to construct fixed films the immobilized cells on the surface of arranged media or fixed film are less sensitive to ph temperature and toxic substances this is because of the increased local concentration of enzymes and nutrients or the extracellular polymeric matrix which selectively affects toxic or inhibitory substances 16 most dairy etps milma in kerala employed anaerobic fixed film reactors due to their design and operational simplicity the uasb reactors upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors are commonly used to handle dairy wastewater agro wastewater and municipal wastewater 106 the critical design constituents of a traditional uasb reactor are a sludge blanket gas solid separator influent distribution system and effluent withdrawal system the influent is supplied from the bottom of the uasb reactor and flows upwards 107 uasb reactors are particularly desirable because unlike other reactor designs they can handle higher suspended solid and shock loads as well as wastewaters with a wider variety of strengths 18 21 carbohydrates enhance extracellular polysaccharides in dairy wastewaters which aid bacterial aggregation and are thus essential for developing granules required for uasb reactor performance the addition of polymers such as chitosan or percol 763 to the reactors dramatically increases the pace of granule formation 18 the possibility of utilizing upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors for treating dairy effluent and recovery of energy generation potential was investigated by ramasamy et al 81 the report details research into reactor setup the performance of two distinct sludge granules and the impact of varying cod chemical oxygen demand feeding rates on reactor performance the buildup of fat oil and greece fog at the uasb reactor is a typical operating issue the fog accumulation at the reactor top prevents the movement of ch4 and co2 to gas chambers and affects its performance as a remedy for the periodic removal of fog and to minimize biomass washout a novel systematic technique for dairy effluent treatment was developed consisting of a modified uasb reactor with a scum extraction device and a lamella settler 97 this design variation is the advanced integration of multiple design concepts to simplify reactor performance the major attractions of uasb are high removal efficiency minimal sludge generation and biogas recovery uasb has proven to be successful at a variety of temperatures several types of dairy effluent are discharged at room temperature 18 c however the bulk of treatment systems operate at mesophilic 25 45 c or thermophilic 45 65 c temperatures 108 as a result heating requires a lot of energy and keeping anaerobic degradation ad systems at high temperatures is usually expensive and infeasible 109 the situation in india is different there is less of an issue with heating requirements because the temperature is usually or almost in the mesophilic zone in many cases low temperature ad 25 c is often preferable since it allows effluent treatment at discharge temperatures at 15 c mcateer et al 78 stated that dairy effluent s high rate low temperature anaerobic treatment was possible lactococcus is a widespread genus used in the low temperature anaerobic treatment of dairy effluent lactococcus bacteria produce lactic acid by extensively digesting carbohydrates and proteins 110 in short the uasb reactors are widely accepted because they can operate in almost all environmental conditions with limited constraints the performance of uasb reactors in wastewater treatment is enhanced by a set of technical factors and the integration of multiple reactor design variations in uasb reactors designed to treat wastewater containing complex lipids intermittent operation improves the biological conversion efficiency the efficiency of the uasb reactor can be increased by reducing the amount of organic debris that accumulates in the sludge bed during the feed less period by complete mechanization of retained substrates 111 the anaerobic baffled reactor abr is a horizontal multi compartment reactor with the design features of a long biomass retention period minimal sludge formation and acidogenesis and methanogenesis separation abr can maintain a constant amount of active biomass making the process resistant to large organic loads despite the widespread use of abr meeting the enhanced wastewater discharge criteria remains problematic because of the high effluent quality integrating reactors with uasb is suitable for improving performance and treatment efficiency in the treatment of dairy effluent the anaerobic baffled reactor abr and the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb have long been used 112 114 a recent study on dairy effluent ji et al 113 combined an abr and a uasb reactor and obtained a cod removal rate of 98 many design options are available for the anaerobic degradation technique table 4 therefore reactor design option suitability and selectivity depend upon multiple constraints listed in fig 2 even though in the indian scenario the uasb reactors and anaerobic fixed film reactors are commonly employed for dairy effluent treatment because of their efficiency over 90 cod removal and operational advancements 2 3 3 emerging trends in anaerobic biological systems technology is meant to be updated concerning time the emerging technologies are conductive nanoparticles and anaerobic biohydrogen production in anaerobic degradation processes the conductive nanoparticles cnps 1 100 nm have unique physicochemical properties such as high activity high reactive surface area and high specificity to improve performance the addition of cnps accelerates the ad process speeding the hydrolysis or acidification stage by direct or indirect interspecies electron transfer diet 115 in biogas production most research has shown that utilizing various types of conductive nanoparticles such as zero valent metals zvm metal oxide and carbon based nanoparticles improves diet performance 116 in ad conductive nanoparticle s cnp s role increases biogas production capacity from biomass and industrial wastewater depending on operating parameters it is noticed that carbon to nitrogen ratio temperature ph catalytic role 117 118 and cnps size play essential functions in anaerobic digestion in anaerobic degradation biogas production is enhanced by using different kinds of nanoparticles the first step of ad hydrolysis remains to be revealed and the inhibition effects of volatile fatty acids vfas ammonia sulfides and h2 need to reduce the ad process necessitates water recovery and energy production with zero solid discharge 119 a comparative study is required to investigate the positive and negative impacts of cnps on ad most research on ad process management has narrowed and focused on pollution control and energy generation furthermore research is required to modify the relationship between microbes and cnps during the ad process 120 the recent review by jadav et al 115 on conductive nanoparticles discussed various types of cnps used in digestion methods to enhance the biogas production and degradation performance its limitations inhibition effects and finally mathematical modeling for predicting microbial behavior during different conditions in ad processes this article focuses on the applicability of cnps in wastewater treatment even though the adaptation of cnps in dairy effluent treatment is still in its infancy to be explored in the future the ad mediated cnp processes are the emerging technology to boost the applicability future of the ad process anaerobic biohydrogen production bhp technology is another rapidly advancing technology implemented for wastewater treatment the bhp technology processes high strength organic wastewater including food waste molasses cassava waste 121 algae waste and water hyacinths producing biohydrogen a renewable energy carrier a two stage anaerobic digestion system has been developed in the recent decade to create biohydrogen and methane simultaneously 122 125 since about 65 of organics are present in wastewater as alcohol and organic acids fermentative hydrogen generation from organic matter still has a low energy recovery efficiency 126 127 is the challenge in developing bhp in this context adopting two phase systems in which fermentation is followed by anaerobic digestion might help optimize the residual energy utilization methane 50 65 and carbon dioxide 35 50 make up the biogas produced utilized to create energy or heat 128 the implementation of bhp from dairy effluent treatment is not yet explored since the dairy effluent has a high amount of organic content the scope of using it as a source for biohydrogen production is the future perspective for many researchers 2 3 4 aerobic biological systems the aerobic biological treatment process is defined as the breakdown and oxidation of waste by microorganisms in the presence of oxygen in the conventional aerobic treatment activated sludge 129 rotating biological contactors trickling filters aerated lagoons sequential batch reactor 130 132 membrane bioreactors or combinations are used particularly dairy effluent the sequential batch reactor sbr appears to be the most promising aerobic technique for treating dairy effluent among the numerous aerobic methods sbr is a sludge system that s triggered by filling and draining wastewater is pumped into an sbr where it is treated to remove contaminants before being discharged back into the system furthermore anaerobic techniques have poor nutrient removal efficiency whereas aerobic methods produce a lot of extra sludge and consume a lot of energy 133 134 microbes oxidize organics to carbon dioxide water and cellular material in an oxygen rich environment different varieties of heterotrophic microbes bacillus cereus escherichia coli enterobacter etc and yeast candida saccharomyces etc are present in dairy effluent 135 136 to allow for the establishment of a competitive microbial population most startups require an acclimatization period microbial growth and stabilization are enhanced during the initial acclimation or startup period the addition of inoculums or sludge from similar processing plants will shorten this acclimation period problems associated with aerobic processes include foaming and poor solid liquid separation bulking precipitation of iron and carbonates excessive sludge production and decreased efficiency during winter many reports demonstrate that the activated sludge process asp has effectively been utilized to remediate the dairy sector waster russell 137 discovered that using a milk powder butter mixture consistent cod and nitrogen removals of over 90 and 65 were accomplishable the operating conditions and performance range for aerobic digester configurations for dairy effluent treatment is represented in table 5 the jet loop membrane bioreactor jlmbr and sequential batch reactor sbr are the most popular and efficient aerobic dairy effluent treatment reactors the jlmbr bioreactor is a cylindrical vessel with a height to diameter ratio of about 7 1 it consists mainly of a draft tube a cross flow microfiltration unit and a degassing tank in the jlmbr bioreactor the fluid flow is initially from top to bottom within the annulus draught tube and later rises within the annulus between the reactor wall and the draught tube the provision for fluid recycling from the top side of the draught tube results in re dispersion of the bubbles and biomass generation by the biological reaction 138 the key benefit of installing jlmbr is that it requires less land has lower installation and maintenance costs and uses less energy 147 148 the sequential batch reactor sbr is a fill and draw type reactor that integrates bod oxidation nitrification denitrification and settling into a single unit 149 in other words equalization aeration and clarification may all be accomplished using a single sequential batch reactor the key advantages of sbr are ease of operation low cost handling hydraulic fluctuation no requirement for a settling tank sludge recycling and consistent organic load removal efficiency 150 151 aerobic granule formation in sbr is the best suited mechanism for maximum effluent separation and settling the granular sludge quickly the aggregation of micro organisms forms granules one single granule can have millions of copies of a cell type these granules are very compact and densely aggregated they have suitable settling properties and resistivity for a long duration to survive long term contact when this aggregation occurs between the same species it is called auto aggregation while in the case of different cells it is named coaggregation 149 bunn et al 152 developed the granules in an sbr airlift type with acetate cod 2 5 kg m3d loading in 1 week the low strength municipal wastewater was treated with sbr aerobic granules resulting in 90 cod removal and 95 nitrogen removal after 300 days 153 it is reported for dairy effluent treatment aerobic granular sludge in sbr at a 15 30 min retention time with 90 cod 80 n and 67 p removal efficiency 154 membrane bioreactor is one of the emerging and currently more applied reactor technology implemented for the treatment of wastewater mediated by membranes both organic and ceramic membranes are employed in membrane bioreactors fouling issue is the major drawback in membrane bioreactor performance powder activated carbon pac at a dosing rate of 5 g l reduces fouling 155 even though membranes high cost and operational difficulties are the significant constraints to be rectified the hybridization of aerobic and anaerobic technologies with membranes for etp design is the current biological wastewater treatment trend with a water reusability scope hybrid biological wastewater treatment technology has a crucial role and applicability to reduce retention time requirements and enhance overall treatment efficiency 2 4 membrane technologies in dairy effluent treatment membrane filtration is a tertiary wastewater treatment procedure that polishes effluent quality to satisfy high discharge criteria or allows treated effluents to be reused to replace freshwater supplies membrane filtration is the process of removing or separating particulate and colloidal particles from a liquid by passing them through a selective barrier with a diameter of 0 0001 1 0 m the two types of membranes that can be used are porous membranes microfiltration ultrafiltration and nanofiltration and dense membranes microfiltration ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membrane technology may be classified based on the kind of membrane the pressure force the configuration and the removal method microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration dialysis electrodialysis and reverse osmosis are all viable approaches to membrane technologies the wastewater business bacteria and virus eradication paint treatment for the metal industry and the textile industry are applications requiring ultrafiltration techniques 156 159 when integrated with biological and chemical processes membrane based technologies have promise for dairy water reclamation fouling high investment and operating costs are the series of disadvantages that affect membrane technology implementation 157 in order to control fouling problems chemical coagulants or adsorbents such as powdered activated carbon or zeolite are commonly employed to increase filtering efficiency to minimize the quantity of suspended and colloidal elements that cause turbidity in the feed solution table 6 represents the types and performance range of various membranes used in dairy effluent treatment ultrafiltration membranes and processes are gaining featured attention within the scientific research community as measured by the scientific database platforms one of the statistical reviews on the number of articles published in ultrafiltration technology and wastewater treatment based on 4547 articles from 2010 to 2018 al aani et al 167 pointed out the growth increased by 12 based on the available statistics there is no doubt that the research community will persevere and enhance membrane technology s overall performance especially uf in the future 3 reusability of treated dairy effluent dairy effluents reusability within the production plant premises is there for robust process design constrain in etps due to water scarcity and the high demand for water in the dairy sector the reusability of treated water from etps is advantageous dairy effluents can be dispersed on flat terrain using spray nozzles or ridge and troughs the nature and availability of soil topography and waste quality all impact the method adopted for irrigation in most dairy plants located in kerala the treated effluent is used for gardening purposes as a source for cleaning dairy transport vehicles cleaning equipment and utensils the generated sludge is dried in the sludge drying bed and used as fertilizer the dairy effluent treatment plant 300m3 day is represented in fig 4 the anaerobic fixed film reactor is the core of this process the downstream processing stage selection will be more sophisticated if the procedure requires pure versions of treated water in this required scenario membrane technology is implemented along with reverse osmosis and uv disinfection units for correctly returning various wastewater products to the environment the technologies and procedures are wastewater recharge and reuse this is achieved by productive use or if direct reuse is not desired safe disposal or recharging is suggested it is always better to reuse the water nutrients and energy contained in various waste streams if at all possible the efficiency of wastewater reuse is thus determined by how it is collected and pre treated the composting products are made from organic waste and sludge as soil amendments and livestock feed therefore the practical reusability of treated wastewater and sludge within the plant premises results from a functional well engineered process design planning and execution 4 geographic information system gis in effluent treatment and sludge disposal the adaptation of remote sensing and gis methods in environmental impact assessment eia studies is the current boom in environmental engineering research remote sensing is the science of gathering data about an item or phenomenon without directly contacting it remote sensing is a more cost effective time saving and efficient technique of acquiring data from inaccessible remote regions such as steep or rugged terrains familiar in arid and semi arid nations than field surveys 168 169 on the other hand a geographic information system gis combines standard database functions with maps such as querying and statistical analysis integrating rs findings with different complicated sets of data collected by the techniques such as geophysics geochemistry and field data allows reliable information on mineral occurrences to be extracted 170 using satellite image technology and gis is suitable for locating convenient centralized etp s especially in cities implementing gis ensures a future scope to design modification possibilities and city planning effectively and systematically environmental impact assessments eias are a strategic environmental assessment tool for global environmental planning and management eia studies based on the adaptation of the gis method are an effective method for data representation gis is applied in field studies locating water and soil contamination studies climatic change studies geological surveys population and human health studies risk of accidents and disasters human health and population marine environment social impacts etc 170 176 for the execution of eia each nation has its own set of regulations and processes in india projects are divided into two categories based on their capacity category a and category b the ministry of environment and forests and state pollution control boards spcb monitor the project screening procedures 177 the application of gis software to environmental contamination uses spatial interpolation methods from gis to map out pollutants in soil and water spatial interpolation provides a more practical approach to soil and water contamination treatment and monitoring metal and other pollution of soil and water have become a serious environmental issue in many regions of the world due to industrialization in digital processing spectral improvement and spectral classification the software packages pci geomatica envi erdas and arcgis with different versions and capabilities are utilized 170 in particular geographic information system gis mapping and profiling effluent treatment plants especially dairy effluent treatment plants are not well studied even though just a few researchers have worked on this topic the gis software tool arcgis v 10 is used for finding locations appropriate for anaerobic degradation systems ads that are accessible to a large number of dairy farms in addison county vermont as well as analyzing these sites for optimization to maximize the system s energy return was reported by thompson 178 is one such attempt fig 5 later stafford 173 utilized a gis tool to investigate soil cd concentrations on two long term dairy farms in new zealand s waikato and canterbury regions the contamination of groundwater and soil occurs due to inappropriate effluent treatment and discharge into the environment from the factories industries the gis technique is an excellent way to portray a plant s impact on its surroundings researchers from all across the world used gis technologies to perform eia studies to highlight this negative impact the groundwater contamination results from the discharge of effluents from the wastewater treatment plant wwtp into the alluvial artesian basin from a distance from the discharge point ankeny usa outfall was reported by hubbard 172 in the same year a similar work on the primary wastewater flow direction estimated extent of upstream effluent recirculation etc was marked on the map by bradley 180 process integration is a cost effective method adopted in the industries to cut down the operating cost by clubbing multiple processes haque 179 employed the geographic information system gis to identify the sources of industrial sludge generation in bangladesh and potential management strategies fig 6 the study suggests a symbiosis of industry generated sludge and its productive routing to adjacent brick kilns as a clay substitute one of the critical advantages of using gis in the project is that it allows technocrats to create a perfect portrayal of environmental contamination status therefore assisting technocrats in executing perfect strategic remediation to manage pollution 5 perspectives the treatment options available for dairy effluent at industrial levels are plenty from the author s perspective the decision on selectivity adaptability and implementation of a treatment technology varies on the situation currently the anaerobic and aerobic treatment methods and reactors for dairy effluent are the engineer s choice to design etps there are a lot of emerging technologies especially conductive nanoparticles and anaerobic biohydrogen production bhp technology on their outbreak phase to be a permanent inclusion in all anaerobic reactor designs at the industrial level anti fouling membrane technology is emerging rapidly which will boost membrane based reactor designs in the future the organic coagulants extracted from natural sources open the scope of coagulation processes in a new dimension from an economics perspective cutting edge findings from this field will overcome the constraints of chemical coagulant cost requirements therefore future dairy effluent treatment trends rely on these current laboratory technologies hybridization of multiple biological reactors in a process design will enhance the performance of etp geographic information system and its practical scope in eia studies is an emerging approach to access the impact of a process plant on the surrounding therefore gis implementation for assessing the environmental impact assessment due to the industrial operations and effluent release to the environment is a future research area 6 conclusions biological chemical electrochemical and membrane technologies are effectively implemented for dairy effluent treatment the various reactor setups as well as performance range are tabulated in this review however each method has advantages and drawbacks that need to be considered for example biological treatment selection of effective reactor design depends on the environmental factors cost factor land and availability of infrastructure performance based selection of reactors is secondary in some contexts in terms of anaerobic degradation the uasb reactor and anaerobic fixed film reactor are engineers choices because of the high treatment efficiency in aerobic bioreactors sequential batch reactor is the choice of interest combining cnps technology with the ad process boosts anaerobic processes performance with limited investment chemical process coagulation is expensive due to coagulant cost research focuses on natural materials as coagulating agents are booming to cut down the cost requirement of chemical coagulants the optimization and scale up of the coagulation process and reactor designs for de treatment can be expected in the future the al and fe electrode is commonly used in electrocoagulation reactor designs the electrode and operating costs at the industrial level are expensive the photovoltaic cell is a reliable addition to the etp process design to reduce operating costs particularly in electrocoagulation reactors membrane technology is an advanced method for effluent treatment fouling choking etc are the main constraints in adapting membrane technology in effluent treatment incorporating membranes as a tertiary treatment component is a remedy to minimize the operational problems and increase the membrane life in the case of etp with water recycling requirements advanced methodologies and technologies are the best options electrocoagulation membrane technology etc will be the choice of etp designs in that case recent research has reported integrating multiple reactor designs into the process enhances the performance of the dairy effluent treatment at a minimal cost the scope of dealing with treated wastewater discharge and sludge disposal after treatment opens a new area of eia studies a few research explored the adaptation of gis mediated performance evaluation of etps therefore the transformation of gis tools for

13156,in this study fe ce bimetallic oxide particles bop were immobilized in poly vinyl alcohol pva hydrogel aiming to engineer a granular material that preserves the adsorptive properties of bop powder allowing their use in conventional water treatment systems through a detailed evaluation of the synthesis conditions we were able to produce a composite pva bop with excellent physicochemical properties while retaining up to 100 of the bop arsenic adsorption capacity even at ppb of as v concentrations the composites were characterized by sem n2 physisorption ft ir potentiometric titration and compression test also adsorption experiments including isotherms kinetics ph effect and selectivity were performed the inclusion of bop in the pva hydrogel improved the mechanical properties of the hydrogel increasing the elastic limit from 60 for pva to 90 for the composite making it suitable for packed bed systems the bop particles showed a uniform dispersion in the composite as evidenced by sem the surface area of the composite reached 10 m2 g and has an acidic surface phpzc of 4 1 the ftir analyses allowed us to demonstrate the interactions of bop with pva and to propose the arsenic adsorption mechanism the dry composite labeled as c7p60 showed excellent arsenic removal adsorption capacity of 77 62 mg g measured at 0 8 mg as l and ph 7 adsorption kinetics of 1 69 mg as v min g reaching equilibrium in less than 30 min and a high affinity for arsenic in presence of competing anions including f cl hco3 no3 so4 2 and h2po4 the results reported herein suggest that this granular composite pva bop can be an excellent candidate to address arsenic water contamination problems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption arsenic bimetallic oxides pva 1 introduction human activities have caused water reservoirs to become contaminated with a large number of elements arsenic is a priority pollutant due to the negative effects it causes on the health of living beings even at low concentrations 1 2 according to the world health organization who the maximum permissible limit for as is 0 01 mg l in water which in the near future will become undetectable 3 due to the high risk caused by the presence of as in water it is necessary to develop much more efficient materials and technologies to comply with the maximum permissible limit stablished by the who among the various technologies used for the removal of arsenic from water the adsorption process is considered one of the most promising due to its simplicity of design easy handling and maintenance as well as for its high removal capacity 4 6 various adsorbent materials have been studied for the removal of as being the bimetallic oxide particles bop of great interest because of their high arsenic affinity due to the fact that these can not only inherit the advantages of monometallic counterparts but also show a synergistic effect 4 7 among the different combinations of bimetallic oxides that have been tested fe ce particles have shown excellent arsenic adsorption capacity 8 11 ce has shown that due to its relatively small ionic radius low ionic potential and strong basicity numerous oh groups would dissociate into abundant surface hydroxyl groups m oh which has proven to be the important factor for high anion uptake through the ion and or ligand exchange process 12 13 on the other hand mixing ce with cheaper fe oxides widely used in adsorption processes is also considered an economical method to reduce the widespread use of expensive rare earth metals 14 the bops are usually a fine powder that can be applied in water treatment only in batch operations were the particles can be easily lost in the effluent and restrict its use in full scale operations 15 16 an alternative to solve this limitation is to anchor the bops to granular materials that can be used in adsorption packed columns 17 19 within various strategies the use of polymeric hydrogels three dimensional network of flexible chains made up of elements connected in a certain way and swollen by a liquid is considered an excellent alternative due to their mechanical properties affinity for water versatility and low cost 20 21 in recent years several authors have reported the introduction of adsorbent materials in polymers for the elimination of various toxic pollutants from aqueous solutions with excellent results 22 30 in this research we selected polyvinyl alcohol pva as polymeric matrix for the bops dispersion pva has good properties as a support material like hydrophilicity non toxic low cost has good mechanical stability easy to prepare photostability low residual monomer swollen pore formation that helps the contaminants diffusion and is very stable for long periods of time under different conditions of temperature and ph 31 in this light the study herein have the objective of developing a granular composite material using pva as the polymer matrix and fe ce bimetallic oxide particles as adsorbent aiming attention to preserving the remarkable arsenic adsorption capacity of the original fe ce bops in powder form 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all

composites for the synthesis of the fe ce bimetallic particles ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o and cerium nitrate cen3o9 6h2o were used sigma aldrich brand sodium arsenate na2haso4 7h2o was used for the preparation of arsenic solution the solutions ph was adjusted using sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl standard solutions both sigma aldrich analytical grade deionized water with conductivity lower than 11 μs cm was used in all experiments 2 2 synthesis of fe ce bimetallic particles the fe ce bop were synthesized by the hydrothermal method using microwaves as already reported in the literature 32 20 ml of 0 25 m feso4 7h2o solution and 20 ml of 1 25 m solution of cen3o9 6h2o were mixed and then placed into a microwave anton paar model monowave 400 at 110 c for 30 min then the synthesized particles were washed with deionized water by 5 centrifugation cycles at 4000 rpm for 2 min each next a last wash was carried out with ethanol to finally dry them in an oven at 80 c for 24 h 2 3 synthesis of composites pva bop for the synthesis of composites pva solutions were made 4 to 10 polymer then bops were added to the polymeric solutions in various weight ratios relative to the weight of the polymer 1 0 25 to 1 0 7 and the mixture was vigorous stirred at 90 c until obtaining the dispersion of bop the 7 composites that contain 50 60 and 70 of bops will be named as c7p50 c7p60 and c7p70 respectively where c stands for composite and p for particles subsequently the polymer solutions were poured into the glass vials and kept at 20 c for 20 h the frozen gels were then placed at room temperature 25 c for 2 h freeze thaw cycles were repeated 2 times obtaining a swollen hydrogel finally the solid was divided and the particles were sieved to obtain an average particle size of 675 μm 2 4 materials characterization the swelling capacity of the c7p60 composite was evaluated to know the size change when the composite gets hydrated 40 mg of hydrogel got into contact with water and this was weighed every 20 min until the mass did not change the swelling tests were carried out in triplicate at 25 c and the swelling capacity was calculated by the following equation s m f m i m f 100 where mi and mf are the initial and equilibrium mass respectively the morphology of fe ce bop pva hydrogel and composite c7p60 was studied by scanning electron microscopy sem for fe ce bop a helios nanolab 600i microscope with high vacuum mode was used and for pva hydrogels and composite c7p60 a quanta 250 microscope with low vacuum mode was used before the analysis the pva hydrogel and the composite were fragmented and lyophilized in order to observe the internal structure of the swelling material subsequently they were retained in an sem sample holder with carbon tape without gold coating the surface area of bop pva and composite c7p60 was determined by nitrogen physisorption at 77 k using a micromeritics asap 2020 the surface area was determined by using the brunauer emmentt teller bet adsorption isotherm the identification of surface groups of c7p60 pva and bop was performed by fourier transform infrared spectrometry ft ir by direct measurements using the mode of attenuated total reflection atr in a range of 4000 to 500 cm 1 with 64 scans of a resolution of 4 cm 1 in a thermo nicolet nexus 470 spectrophotometer the surface charge distribution and point of zero charge phpzc of bop pva hydrogel and c7p60 were estimated by acid base potentiometric titrations data were collected in a mettler toledo automatic titrator pl 70 using the following procedure 0 01 g of the sample were contacted with 50 ml of 0 1 m nacl as electrolyte solution during 12 h and then purged with n2 during 5 min afterwards the required volume of 0 1 n naoh was added to the mixture to increase the solution ph to 11 and next the potentiometric titration was conducted by the addition of 0 1 n hcl using the dynamic mode addition under n2 gas atmosphere the values obtained from the potentiometric titration were fed into the saeius pk dist program 1994 software 33 to determine the materials surface charge distribution and pka values compression tests were carried out in triplicate on cylindrical samples 10 mm in diameter and 4 mm high to study the behavior of the materials under a compression load from these tests the compressibility modules of the 7 pva hydrogel and the composites c7p50 c7p60 and c7p70 were obtained using a shimadzu ags x unit with a 1kn load cell and a displacement speed of 1 mm min 2 5 as v adsorption capacity and kinetics the as v adsorption capacity of the composites and fe ce bimetallic particles was determined as follows about 2 mg of adsorbent were contacted with 40 ml of 10 mg l arsenic solution analytical balance discovery ohaus vd215cd with 0 01 mg sensitivity the tests were carried out in triplicate at 25 c and ph 7 and the solution ph was adjusted by adding 0 1 n hcl or naoh until the equilibrium was reached then arsenic iron and cerium concentration were determined using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes varian 730 es at a wavelength of 188 98 nm 259 94 nm and 418 66 nm respectively the adsorption capacity was determined with the following equation q v c o c e m where v is the volume m is the mass of adsorbent co and ce are the initial and final on equilibrium as v concentration respectively adsorption isotherms were determined by triplicate for fe ce bops composite c7p60 and the bops within the composite briefly 2 mg of material were contacted with 40 ml of arsenic solution at different initial concentrations 0 5 mg l to 10 mg l at 25 c and ph 7 the ph was kept constant by the addition of 0 1 n naoh or hcl until the equilibrium was reached the residual arsenic concentration was analyzed for every sample as mentioned before the experimental data of the adsorption isotherms were fitted by the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models using the statistica 10 0 program the effect of solution ph was studied following the procedure described above from ph 4 to 9 to determine the adsorption kinetics 2 mg of adsorbent material were placed in 40 ml of 5 mg l arsenic solution at ph 7 these experiments were performed with composite c7p60 of two different sizes one of 8 mm named large size composite lsc and other one of 0 85 to 0 5 mm called small size composite ssc subsequently sacrificial experimental samples were placed in an orbital incubator at 25 c and 100 120 rpm these were taken at different times 0 5 1440 min and the arsenic concentration was measured as mentioned above the adsorption rate parameters were determined for the pseudo first pseudo second and weber morris intra particle diffusion models 34 the pseudo first order kinetic equation is given by ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where qt mg g and qe mg g are the adsorption capacities at time t min and equilibrium respectively and k1 min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant the pseudo second order kinetic is represent by the follow equation t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where k2 mg g min is the pseudo second order rate constant of adsorption qe mg g is the amount of pollutant adsorbed at equilibrium and qt mg g is the amount of pollutant adsorbed at any time t min weber morris rate equation describes the influence of diffusion on the uptake mechanism by a linear plot of the form q e k 3 t 1 2 c where k3 mg g min1 2 is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant t is the time min and c is the intercept of equation finally the arsenic adsorption in presence of competing anions was studied by triplicate experiments for this 2 mg of adsorbent were mixed with 40 ml of a solution that contained 5 mg l of arsenic and 5 10 30 or 50 mg l of each of the following anions f cl hco3 no3 h2po4 so4 2 these experiments were conducted at ph 7 and 25 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization the maximum swelling capacity s as well as the size that a hydrogel can reach when hydrated are important parameters when designing a packed column adsorption system the composite c7p60 presented a maximum swelling capacity of 135 in about 2 h this value is slightly higher than for commercial ion exchange resins of polyacrylate cross linked with divinylbenzene 78 108 and sulfonated styrene 85 104 the physical structure of the hydrogel and compound c7p60 was analyzed by sem fig 1 in the pva hydrogel fig 1a the polymer arrangement is more compact and homogeneous unlike the c7p60 composite where the pva is not homogeneously distributed forming a porous structure as observed in fig 1b this is attributed to the fact that during the hydrogel formation the bops work as crosslinker causing differences between one site and another compared to the pva hydrogel where there are only polymeric chains and the crosslinking is more homogeneous furthermore in fig 1c a homogeneous distribution of bops with small agglomerates can be observed which is due to a phenomenon called cryoconcentration already reported when a hydrogel is synthesized by freeze thaw cycles 35 the mechanical properties of hydrogels were determined by compression tests the compression module fig 2 was determined considering the average of the slopes of the linear portion of the resulting stress strain curve fig 3a accordingly the compression module of the pva bop composites decreased from 0 015 mpa for the pva hydrogel to about 0 003 mpa for the composites this change in mechanical properties could be attributed to interferences caused by bops during the hydrogen bond crosslinking of pva when the crosslinking process is carried out only with pva this is carried out homogeneously throughout the hydrogel as observed in sem micrographs fig 1a however when bops are introduced these interact with the polymer causing the crosslinking to change and the homogeneity in the polymer density is lost as observed in fig 1b it was also observed that the heterogeneity in the crosslinking of the pva chains was more noticeable when increasing the concentration of bops which caused a low density of pva chains in certain areas of the hydrogel negatively affecting its compressibility this decreased about 50 from 0 015 mpa to 0 0029 mpa when adding up to 70 of bops nevertheless from the stress strain curves fig 3b it was observed that although the compressive strength decreased when particles are included in the hydrogel the material increased its elasticity or elastic deformation capacity of a body to regain its original shape by removing the force that causes deformation that is the composites could be deformed around 90 with the ability to return to its original shape whereas the pva hydrogel can be deformed about 60 but this does not return to its original shape after the compression is removed it is important to consider that commercial materials for application in packed bed columns can generally withstand pressures between 70 psi and 100 psi which is equivalent to 0 48 mpa to 0 68 mpa within these values the composites based on pva and fe ce particles presented a deformation between 60 and 65 that is below its elastic limit which allows them to be used in treatment systems 36 37 the ftir spectrum of the pva hydrogel and composite c7p60 were compared to identify interactions between bop and the polymer fig 4a the ftir spectrum of pva is characterized by a band signal at 3400 cm 1 attributed to hydroxyl groups other characteristic bands of pva were identified at 2940 cm 1 corresponding to ch stretching 1150 and 1100 cm 1 correspond to coc and co stretching of the acetyl group 1641 cm 1 corresponds to oh vibration 1400 cm 1 to a ch scissoring and 830 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching mode of cc groups 38 41 also at about 1300 cm 1 appears a signal corresponding to co vibration of polyvinyl acetate residual from the pva synthesis in addition bands corresponding to moh and mo were found at 1100 cm 1 and between 600 and 900 cm 1 respectively in the ftir spectrum for bop finally the ftir spectrum of the composite c7p60 showed the same bands identified in the pva and bop spectra with a displacement and decrease in the intensity of bands at 890 and 790 cm 1 which correspond to vibrations of the metal oxygen bond mo and a displacement of the bands between 3250 and 3300 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching mode of oh vibration fig 4b these effects have been attributed to the electrostatic interactions between the hydroxylated groups of pva and bops 38 3 2 arsenic adsorption capacity different synthesis protocols for the production of composites were conducted and evaluated for the as removal first the effects of bops and pva concentrations in the composite were tested as reported in in table 1 accordingly samples with 25 of bops and a low pva concentration 4 7 were not stable and got dissolved during the adsorption tests we can infer that bops helped during the synthesis of the hydrogel as a crosslinker between the polymer chains providing stability to the composite only the adsorption capacity of sample c10p25 hydrogel was measured being considerable low in comparison with the rest of the composites on the other hand when higher concentrations of bops were used in the composite up to 50 the hydrogels remained stable in solution even when low pva concentrations were used this confirms the fact that bops help in the stabilization of the hydrogel however at a concentration of 70 the dispersion of bops was not achieved these began to precipitate resulting in a concentration gradient of bops in the hydrogel it was also observed that the composites with 7 pva c7p60 exhibited good mechanical properties and the highest adsorption capacity without releasing bops during the adsorption tests which were conducted with dried lyophilized or oven dried pre hydrated swollen composite and dried then swollen in deionized water composites as reported in table 2 as observed the arsenic adsorption capacity of fe ce particles is about 188 mg as g which was attributed to their high surface area and oh groups concentration 42 on the other hand the adsorption capacity of the lyophilized and swollen composites decreased 90 65 and 47 34 with respect to powder bops however the oven dried composite od did not have adsorption inhibition that was attributed to the good dispersion of bops and therefore a greater number of active sites were available also when the composite is obtained by oven dryed and is in contact with the as v solution the bops are distributed homogeneously in the polymer matrix fig 1c and have less interaction with the polymeric support as illustrated in fig 5a contrary to this some active sites of the bops in the composites that are swollen or lyophilized were obstructed by the polymer matrix fig 5b where the lyophilized composite presented the greatest inhibition because due to the drying conditions the composite structure collapsed and consequently larger number of active sites of the bops was blocked additionally in places where the pva density was higher the polymeric matrix blocked the active sites for the adsorption of arsenic and only the bops that are immobilized in sites with low density of polymer chains were available to capture the pollutant therefore the composite s inhibition was not total even when the composite reached its swelling equilibrium fig 6 based on these results it was decided to carry out the subsequent tests only with the dry composite 3 2 1 adsorption isotherms fig 7 shows the arsenic adsorption isotherms of fe ce bop and composite c7p60 oven dried to evaluate the change in the adsorption capacity of the bops once they are incorporated into the hydrogel we include a calculated isotherm considering the mass of bops added during synthesis the experimental data were best adjusted by the langmuir isotherm model based on the correlation coefficients r2 reported by the freundlich isotherm table 3 from the maximum adsorption capacity of bops 212 05 mg as g and bops in the composite 206 99 mg as g it is observed that their difference is less than 5 which indicates that the bop inhibition is not significant when introduced into the polymeric matrix the above as a result of the well dispersion of bops and practically null inhibition of active sites 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics fig 8 shows that bops have excellent adsorption kinetics 13 33 mg as v min g reaching equilibrium in less than 5 min as previously reported 32 on the other hand although the adsorption rate decreased when introducing bops into the pva hydrogel the composite s maximum adsorption capacity can be obtained in approximately 30 min the as adsorption rate increased from 0 23 mg as v min g lsc to 1 69 mg as v min g ssc 7 times more in the first 30 min by reducing the granule size of the composite from 8 mm to about 0 7 mm it is to be mentioned that these particle sizes are commonly used in full scale adsorption systems furthermore reducing the particle size of the composite increases its exposed external surface area and shortens the distance that arsenic must diffuse into the pores before it is adsorbed additionally three kinetic models were employed to describe the as v adsorption rate of bop and c7p60 according to the correlation coefficients r2 see table 4 the experimental data of bop and c7p60 ssc were better described by the pseudo first order model the theoretical values of qe obtained from the pseudo first order model agrees with qe exp and the adsorption rate constants k1 were 1 795 and 0 071 min 1 for bop and c7p60 respectively the decrease in the adsorption constant is attributed to the relative slow mass transfer to the active sites of the bops due to the pva matrix unlike the pristine bops where the mass transfer to the active sites takes place instantaneously 43 in contrast the kinetic model that best described the kinetic data of c7p60 lsc was the weber morris equation r2 0 97 which implies a strong effect of intraparticle diffusion 44 comparing the as v adsorption capacity and adsorption rate of the composite c7p60 with that of other materials reported in the literature table 5 it is clear that our material has a superior performance even when other studies use a very high initial arsenic concentrations 100 mg l or the optimal solution ph to enhanced the arsenic removal these results support the idea that our composite is an excellent adsorbent material to be use in full scale operations 3 2 3 solution ph effect on arsenic adsorption as observed in fig 9 the highest as adsorption capacity occurs between ph 6 and 7 which is relevant because the ph of water for human consumption must be between 6 5 and 8 5 according to national and international standards such the nom 127 ssa1 1994 health in mexico the adsorption capacity of as v was correlated with the phpzc of the c7p60 composite 4 2 value similar to that of the pva hydrogel phpzc 4 1 this acidic ph is attributed to the high concentration of hydroxyl groups that they possess 45 this indicates that at ph 7 where the maximum adsorption capacity was obtained c7p60 is negatively charged at ph between 6 and 7 the composite removes the arsenic species h 2 aso 4 y haso 4 2 mostly by ligand exchange as reported by various authors 11 45 47 and less due to electrostatic interactions on the other hand at basic ph ph 7 arsenic species with a higher negative charge or deprotonated haso 4 2and aso 4 3 predominate the composite has more negative charges due to the loss of protons from the hydroxyl groups of fe ce particles therefore the as v repulsion is bigger causing the adsorption capacity to decrease by up to 50 finally at ph 4 the predominant arsenic species is h 2 aso 4 and the composite acquires positive charge due to the protonation of oh groups so the adsorption process mainly occurs by electrostatics attraction it is worth mentioning that during these tests no release of fe ce particles was detected 3 2 4 effect of coexisting anions on as v adsorption capacity the effect of chloride cl carbonate hco3 nitrate no3 phosphate h 2po4 and sulfate so4 2 which are normally found in water sources at neutral ph 52 on the as v adsorption capacity of c7p60 was evaluated at different concentrations of each anion 5 10 30 and 50 mg l and with f 17 ppm and using an initial arsenic concentration of 5 mg l in all cases fig 10 shows that the adsorption capacity of the c7p60 composite is about 10 mg l even in the presence of up to 10 mg l of each anion and beyond this concentration of competing anions up to 50 ppm the adsorption capacity does not decrease below 5 mg g in addition to this an as v adsorption capacity of 39 6 mg g was obtained in the presence of fluoride an element that has been reported to compete with arsenic for active sites 53 these results show the great affinity of arsenic for this composite and are comparable to those reported for commercial materials that have reported about 12 mg g 54 3 2 5 arsenic removal mechanism it has been proposed that arsenic is adsorbed to metal oxides by exchanging ligands with oh groups on the metal arsenic onto the surface of bimetallic oxyhydroxides can form monodentate bidentate mononuclear and bidentate binuclear internal sphere complexes 9 11 45 47 by using infrared spectroscopy ft ir it is possible to elucidate where arsenic is adsorbed on the adsorbent material fig 11a shows the ft ir obtained from the adsorbent material after adsorbing arsenic on its surface the same signals presented in fig 4 were identified with the addition of a signal at approximately 828 cm 1 attributed to the vibration of aso therefore the 828 cm 1 band indicates the bond between arsenic and the ce fe bimetallic oxyhydroxides present in pva then in the adsorption mechanism the formation of a monodentate surface complex of internal sphere is proposed which could lead to the formation of bidentate complexes of internal sphere as can be seen in fig 11b 55 56 in addition internal sphere complexes can be formed with 1 1 and 1 2 stoichiometry forming monodentate ξmoaso3h m ce fe and bidentate complexes fig 11b respectively 56 57 it should be noted that an internal sphere complex is defined as a covalent bond between the adsorbed ion and the reactive surface 56 58 finally as v can replace two individually coordinated oh groups on bimetallic oxyhydroxides surfaces to form binuclear bridge complexes mo aso oh om and mo as oh om 4 conclusions in this research we have successfully developed a granular composite based on pva fe ce bop in which the remarkable arsenic adsorption capacity of bops is conserved according with the results the pva hydrogel retains the bop particles mainly by hydrogen bond interactions also the composite that has the least inhibition on adsorption capacity has 7 pva with respect to the solvent mass and 60 of fe ce bop with respect to the polymer mass the optimum pva bop composite has an arsenic adsorption capacity of 77 6 mg l at an initial arsenic concentration of 10 mg l and solution ph of 7 and can reach adsorption equilibrium in less than 30 min with a speed of 1 69 mg as v min g when using an composite particle size between 0 85 and 0 5 mm in addition the introduction of bops in the pva polymeric matrix allowed to increase the elasticity of the composite from 60 to 90 which is suitable for its application in packed bed columns furthermore the arsenic adsorption capacity of composite c7p60 ranged from 10 to 5 mg as g when evaluated in solution containing 5 competing anions with a concentration from 5 to 50 mg g of each of them finally composite c7p60 reports an excellent performance to remove as v therefore it is believed that this has the potential to be implemented in water treatment systems credit authorship contribution statement l e rios saldaña methodology investigation data

13156,in this study fe ce bimetallic oxide particles bop were immobilized in poly vinyl alcohol pva hydrogel aiming to engineer a granular material that preserves the adsorptive properties of bop powder allowing their use in conventional water treatment systems through a detailed evaluation of the synthesis conditions we were able to produce a composite pva bop with excellent physicochemical properties while retaining up to 100 of the bop arsenic adsorption capacity even at ppb of as v concentrations the composites were characterized by sem n2 physisorption ft ir potentiometric titration and compression test also adsorption experiments including isotherms kinetics ph effect and selectivity were performed the inclusion of bop in the pva hydrogel improved the mechanical properties of the hydrogel increasing the elastic limit from 60 for pva to 90 for the composite making it suitable for packed bed systems the bop particles showed a uniform dispersion in the composite as evidenced by sem the surface area of the composite reached 10 m2 g and has an acidic surface phpzc of 4 1 the ftir analyses allowed us to demonstrate the interactions of bop with pva and to propose the arsenic adsorption mechanism the dry composite labeled as c7p60 showed excellent arsenic removal adsorption capacity of 77 62 mg g measured at 0 8 mg as l and ph 7 adsorption kinetics of 1 69 mg as v min g reaching equilibrium in less than 30 min and a high affinity for arsenic in presence of competing anions including f cl hco3 no3 so4 2 and h2po4 the results reported herein suggest that this granular composite pva bop can be an excellent candidate to address arsenic water contamination problems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption arsenic bimetallic oxides pva 1 introduction human activities have caused water reservoirs to become contaminated with a large number of elements arsenic is a priority pollutant due to the negative effects it causes on the health of living beings even at low concentrations 1 2 according to the world health organization who the maximum permissible limit for as is 0 01 mg l in water which in the near future will become undetectable 3 due to the high risk caused by the presence of as in water it is necessary to develop much more efficient materials and technologies to comply with the maximum permissible limit stablished by the who among the various technologies used for the removal of arsenic from water the adsorption process is considered one of the most promising due to its simplicity of design easy handling and maintenance as well as for its high removal capacity 4 6 various adsorbent materials have been studied for the removal of as being the bimetallic oxide particles bop of great interest because of their high arsenic affinity due to the fact that these can not only inherit the advantages of monometallic counterparts but also show a synergistic effect 4 7 among the different combinations of bimetallic oxides that have been tested fe ce particles have shown excellent arsenic adsorption capacity 8 11 ce has shown that due to its relatively small ionic radius low ionic potential and strong basicity numerous oh groups would dissociate into abundant surface hydroxyl groups m oh which has proven to be the important factor for high anion uptake through the ion and or ligand exchange process 12 13 on the other hand mixing ce with cheaper fe oxides widely used in adsorption processes is also considered an economical method to reduce the widespread use of expensive rare earth metals 14 the bops are usually a fine powder that can be applied in water treatment only in batch operations were the particles can be easily lost in the effluent and restrict its use in full scale operations 15 16 an alternative to solve this limitation is to anchor the bops to granular materials that can be used in adsorption packed columns 17 19 within various strategies the use of polymeric hydrogels three dimensional network of flexible chains made up of elements connected in a certain way and swollen by a liquid is considered an excellent alternative due to their mechanical properties affinity for water versatility and low cost 20 21 in recent years several authors have reported the introduction of adsorbent materials in polymers for the elimination of various toxic pollutants from aqueous solutions with excellent results 22 30 in this research we selected polyvinyl alcohol pva as polymeric matrix for the bops dispersion pva has good properties as a support material like hydrophilicity non toxic low cost has good mechanical stability easy to prepare photostability low residual monomer swollen pore formation that helps the contaminants diffusion and is very stable for long periods of time under different conditions of temperature and ph 31 in this light the study herein have the objective of developing a granular composite material using pva as the polymer matrix and fe ce bimetallic oxide particles as adsorbent aiming attention to preserving the remarkable arsenic adsorption capacity of the original fe ce bops in powder form 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were reagent grade and were used without further purification purchased from sigma aldrich polyvinyl alcohol mw 85 000 124 000 hydrolyzed 99 was used for the synthesis of the hydrogel and composites for the synthesis of the fe ce bimetallic particles ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o and cerium nitrate cen3o9 6h2o were used sigma aldrich brand sodium arsenate na2haso4 7h2o was used for the preparation of arsenic solution the solutions ph was adjusted using sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl standard solutions both sigma aldrich analytical grade deionized water with conductivity lower than 11 μs cm was used in all experiments 2 2 synthesis of fe ce bimetallic particles the fe ce bop were synthesized by the hydrothermal method using microwaves as already reported in the literature 32 20 ml of 0 25 m feso4 7h2o solution and 20 ml of 1 25 m solution of cen3o9 6h2o were mixed and then placed into a microwave anton paar model monowave 400 at 110 c for 30 min then the synthesized particles were washed with deionized water by 5 centrifugation cycles at 4000 rpm for 2 min each next a last wash was carried out with ethanol to finally dry them in an oven at 80 c for 24 h 2 3 synthesis of composites pva bop for the synthesis of composites pva solutions were made 4 to 10 polymer then bops were added to the polymeric solutions in various weight ratios relative to the weight of the polymer 1 0 25 to 1 0 7 and the mixture was vigorous stirred at 90 c until obtaining the dispersion of bop the 7 composites that contain 50 60 and 70 of bops will be named as c7p50 c7p60 and c7p70 respectively where c stands for composite and p for particles subsequently the polymer solutions were poured into the glass vials and kept at 20 c for 20 h the frozen gels were then placed at room temperature 25 c for 2 h freeze thaw cycles were repeated 2 times obtaining a swollen hydrogel finally the solid was divided and the particles were sieved to obtain an average particle size of 675 μm 2 4 materials characterization the swelling capacity of the c7p60 composite was evaluated to know the size change when the composite gets hydrated 40 mg of hydrogel got into contact with water and this was weighed every 20 min until the mass did not change the swelling tests were carried out in triplicate at 25 c and the swelling capacity was calculated by the following equation s m f m i m f 100 where mi and mf are the initial and equilibrium mass respectively the morphology of fe ce bop pva hydrogel and composite c7p60 was studied by scanning electron microscopy sem for fe ce bop a helios nanolab 600i microscope with high vacuum mode was used and for pva hydrogels and composite c7p60 a quanta 250 microscope with low vacuum mode was used before the analysis the pva hydrogel and the composite were fragmented and lyophilized in order to observe the internal structure of the swelling material subsequently they were retained in an sem sample holder with carbon tape without gold coating the surface area of bop pva and composite c7p60 was determined by nitrogen physisorption at 77 k using a micromeritics asap 2020 the surface area was determined by using the brunauer emmentt teller bet adsorption isotherm the identification of surface groups of c7p60 pva and bop was performed by fourier transform infrared spectrometry ft ir by direct measurements using the mode of attenuated total reflection atr in a range of 4000 to 500 cm 1 with 64 scans of a resolution of 4 cm 1 in a thermo nicolet nexus 470 spectrophotometer the surface charge distribution and point of zero charge phpzc of bop pva hydrogel and c7p60 were estimated by acid base potentiometric titrations data were collected in a mettler toledo automatic titrator pl 70 using the following procedure 0 01 g of the sample were contacted with 50 ml of 0 1 m nacl as electrolyte solution during 12 h and then purged with n2 during 5 min afterwards the required volume of 0 1 n naoh was added to the mixture to increase the solution ph to 11 and next the potentiometric titration was conducted by the addition of 0 1 n hcl using the dynamic mode addition under n2 gas atmosphere the values obtained from the potentiometric titration were fed into the saeius pk dist program 1994 software 33 to determine the materials surface charge distribution and pka values compression tests were carried out in triplicate on cylindrical samples 10 mm in diameter and 4 mm high to study the behavior of the materials under a compression load from these tests the compressibility modules of the 7 pva hydrogel and the composites c7p50 c7p60 and c7p70 were obtained using a shimadzu ags x unit with a 1kn load cell and a displacement speed of 1 mm min 2 5 as v adsorption capacity and kinetics the as v adsorption capacity of the composites and fe ce bimetallic particles was determined as follows about 2 mg of adsorbent were contacted with 40 ml of 10 mg l arsenic solution analytical balance discovery ohaus vd215cd with 0 01 mg sensitivity the tests were carried out in triplicate at 25 c and ph 7 and the solution ph was adjusted by adding 0 1 n hcl or naoh until the equilibrium was reached then arsenic iron and cerium concentration were determined using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes varian 730 es at a wavelength of 188 98 nm 259 94 nm and 418 66 nm respectively the adsorption capacity was determined with the following equation q v c o c e m where v is the volume m is the mass of adsorbent co and ce are the initial and final on equilibrium as v concentration respectively adsorption isotherms were determined by triplicate for fe ce bops composite c7p60 and the bops within the composite briefly 2 mg of material were contacted with 40 ml of arsenic solution at different initial concentrations 0 5 mg l to 10 mg l at 25 c and ph 7 the ph was kept constant by the addition of 0 1 n naoh or hcl until the equilibrium was reached the residual arsenic concentration was analyzed for every sample as mentioned before the experimental data of the adsorption isotherms were fitted by the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models using the statistica 10 0 program the effect of solution ph was studied following the procedure described above from ph 4 to 9 to determine the adsorption kinetics 2 mg of adsorbent material were placed in 40 ml of 5 mg l arsenic solution at ph 7 these experiments were performed with composite c7p60 of two different sizes one of 8 mm named large size composite lsc and other one of 0 85 to 0 5 mm called small size composite ssc subsequently sacrificial experimental samples were placed in an orbital incubator at 25 c and 100 120 rpm these were taken at different times 0 5 1440 min and the arsenic concentration was measured as mentioned above the adsorption rate parameters were determined for the pseudo first pseudo second and weber morris intra particle diffusion models 34 the pseudo first order kinetic equation is given by ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where qt mg g and qe mg g are the adsorption capacities at time t min and equilibrium respectively and k1 min 1 is the pseudo first order rate constant the pseudo second order kinetic is represent by the follow equation t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t where k2 mg g min is the pseudo second order rate constant of adsorption qe mg g is the amount of pollutant adsorbed at equilibrium and qt mg g is the amount of pollutant adsorbed at any time t min weber morris rate equation describes the influence of diffusion on the uptake mechanism by a linear plot of the form q e k 3 t 1 2 c where k3 mg g min1 2 is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant t is the time min and c is the intercept of equation finally the arsenic adsorption in presence of competing anions was studied by triplicate experiments for this 2 mg of adsorbent were mixed with 40 ml of a solution that contained 5 mg l of arsenic and 5 10 30 or 50 mg l of each of the following anions f cl hco3 no3 h2po4 so4 2 these experiments were conducted at ph 7 and 25 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 materials characterization the maximum swelling capacity s as well as the size that a hydrogel can reach when hydrated are important parameters when designing a packed column adsorption system the composite c7p60 presented a maximum swelling capacity of 135 in about 2 h this value is slightly higher than for commercial ion exchange resins of polyacrylate cross linked with divinylbenzene 78 108 and sulfonated styrene 85 104 the physical structure of the hydrogel and compound c7p60 was analyzed by sem fig 1 in the pva hydrogel fig 1a the polymer arrangement is more compact and homogeneous unlike the c7p60 composite where the pva is not homogeneously distributed forming a porous structure as observed in fig 1b this is attributed to the fact that during the hydrogel formation the bops work as crosslinker causing differences between one site and another compared to the pva hydrogel where there are only polymeric chains and the crosslinking is more homogeneous furthermore in fig 1c a homogeneous distribution of bops with small agglomerates can be observed which is due to a phenomenon called cryoconcentration already reported when a hydrogel is synthesized by freeze thaw cycles 35 the mechanical properties of hydrogels were determined by compression tests the compression module fig 2 was determined considering the average of the slopes of the linear portion of the resulting stress strain curve fig 3a accordingly the compression module of the pva bop composites decreased from 0 015 mpa for the pva hydrogel to about 0 003 mpa for the composites this change in mechanical properties could be attributed to interferences caused by bops during the hydrogen bond crosslinking of pva when the crosslinking process is carried out only with pva this is carried out homogeneously throughout the hydrogel as observed in sem micrographs fig 1a however when bops are introduced these interact with the polymer causing the crosslinking to change and the homogeneity in the polymer density is lost as observed in fig 1b it was also observed that the heterogeneity in the crosslinking of the pva chains was more noticeable when increasing the concentration of bops which caused a low density of pva chains in certain areas of the hydrogel negatively affecting its compressibility this decreased about 50 from 0 015 mpa to 0 0029 mpa when adding up to 70 of bops nevertheless from the stress strain curves fig 3b it was observed that although the compressive strength decreased when particles are included in the hydrogel the material increased its elasticity or elastic deformation capacity of a body to regain its original shape by removing the force that causes deformation that is the composites could be deformed around 90 with the ability to return to its original shape whereas the pva hydrogel can be deformed about 60 but this does not return to its original shape after the compression is removed it is important to consider that commercial materials for application in packed bed columns can generally withstand pressures between 70 psi and 100 psi which is equivalent to 0 48 mpa to 0 68 mpa within these values the composites based on pva and fe ce particles presented a deformation between 60 and 65 that is below its elastic limit which allows them to be used in treatment systems 36 37 the ftir spectrum of the pva hydrogel and composite c7p60 were compared to identify interactions between bop and the polymer fig 4a the ftir spectrum of pva is characterized by a band signal at 3400 cm 1 attributed to hydroxyl groups other characteristic bands of pva were identified at 2940 cm 1 corresponding to ch stretching 1150 and 1100 cm 1 correspond to coc and co stretching of the acetyl group 1641 cm 1 corresponds to oh vibration 1400 cm 1 to a ch scissoring and 830 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching mode of cc groups 38 41 also at about 1300 cm 1 appears a signal corresponding to co vibration of polyvinyl acetate residual from the pva synthesis in addition bands corresponding to moh and mo were found at 1100 cm 1 and between 600 and 900 cm 1 respectively in the ftir spectrum for bop finally the ftir spectrum of the composite c7p60 showed the same bands identified in the pva and bop spectra with a displacement and decrease in the intensity of bands at 890 and 790 cm 1 which correspond to vibrations of the metal oxygen bond mo and a displacement of the bands between 3250 and 3300 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching mode of oh vibration fig 4b these effects have been attributed to the electrostatic interactions between the hydroxylated groups of pva and bops 38 3 2 arsenic adsorption capacity different synthesis protocols for the production of composites were conducted and evaluated for the as removal first the effects of bops and pva concentrations in the composite were tested as reported in in table 1 accordingly samples with 25 of bops and a low pva concentration 4 7 were not stable and got dissolved during the adsorption tests we can infer that bops helped during the synthesis of the hydrogel as a crosslinker between the polymer chains providing stability to the composite only the adsorption capacity of sample c10p25 hydrogel was measured being considerable low in comparison with the rest of the composites on the other hand when higher concentrations of bops were used in the composite up to 50 the hydrogels remained stable in solution even when low pva concentrations were used this confirms the fact that bops help in the stabilization of the hydrogel however at a concentration of 70 the dispersion of bops was not achieved these began to precipitate resulting in a concentration gradient of bops in the hydrogel it was also observed that the composites with 7 pva c7p60 exhibited good mechanical properties and the highest adsorption capacity without releasing bops during the adsorption tests which were conducted with dried lyophilized or oven dried pre hydrated swollen composite and dried then swollen in deionized water composites as reported in table 2 as observed the arsenic adsorption capacity of fe ce particles is about 188 mg as g which was attributed to their high surface area and oh groups concentration 42 on the other hand the adsorption capacity of the lyophilized and swollen composites decreased 90 65 and 47 34 with respect to powder bops however the oven dried composite od did not have adsorption inhibition that was attributed to the good dispersion of bops and therefore a greater number of active sites were available also when the composite is obtained by oven dryed and is in contact with the as v solution the bops are distributed homogeneously in the polymer matrix fig 1c and have less interaction with the polymeric support as illustrated in fig 5a contrary to this some active sites of the bops in the composites that are swollen or lyophilized were obstructed by the polymer matrix fig 5b where the lyophilized composite presented the greatest inhibition because due to the drying conditions the composite structure collapsed and consequently larger number of active sites of the bops was blocked additionally in places where the pva density was higher the polymeric matrix blocked the active sites for the adsorption of arsenic and only the bops that are immobilized in sites with low density of polymer chains were available to capture the pollutant therefore the composite s inhibition was not total even when the composite reached its swelling equilibrium fig 6 based on these results it was decided to carry out the subsequent tests only with the dry composite 3 2 1 adsorption isotherms fig 7 shows the arsenic adsorption isotherms of fe ce bop and composite c7p60 oven dried to evaluate the change in the adsorption capacity of the bops once they are incorporated into the hydrogel we include a calculated isotherm considering the mass of bops added during synthesis the experimental data were best adjusted by the langmuir isotherm model based on the correlation coefficients r2 reported by the freundlich isotherm table 3 from the maximum adsorption capacity of bops 212 05 mg as g and bops in the composite 206 99 mg as g it is observed that their difference is less than 5 which indicates that the bop inhibition is not significant when introduced into the polymeric matrix the above as a result of the well dispersion of bops and practically null inhibition of active sites 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics fig 8 shows that bops have excellent adsorption kinetics 13 33 mg as v min g reaching equilibrium in less than 5 min as previously reported 32 on the other hand although the adsorption rate decreased when introducing bops into the pva hydrogel the composite s maximum adsorption capacity can be obtained in approximately 30 min the as adsorption rate increased from 0 23 mg as v min g lsc to 1 69 mg as v min g ssc 7 times more in the first 30 min by reducing the granule size of the composite from 8 mm to about 0 7 mm it is to be mentioned that these particle sizes are commonly used in full scale adsorption systems furthermore reducing the particle size of the composite increases its exposed external surface area and shortens the distance that arsenic must diffuse into the pores before it is adsorbed additionally three kinetic models were employed to describe the as v adsorption rate of bop and c7p60 according to the correlation coefficients r2 see table 4 the experimental data of bop and c7p60 ssc were better described by the pseudo first order model the theoretical values of qe obtained from the pseudo first order model agrees with qe exp and the adsorption rate constants k1 were 1 795 and 0 071 min 1 for bop and c7p60 respectively the decrease in the adsorption constant is attributed to the relative slow mass transfer to the active sites of the bops due to the pva matrix unlike the pristine bops where the mass transfer to the active sites takes place instantaneously 43 in contrast the kinetic model that best described the kinetic data of c7p60 lsc was the weber morris equation r2 0 97 which implies a strong effect of intraparticle diffusion 44 comparing the as v adsorption capacity and adsorption rate of the composite c7p60 with that of other materials reported in the literature table 5 it is clear that our material has a superior performance even when other studies use a very high initial arsenic concentrations 100 mg l or the optimal solution ph to enhanced the arsenic removal these results support the idea that our composite is an excellent adsorbent material to be use in full scale operations 3 2 3 solution ph effect on arsenic adsorption as observed in fig 9 the highest as adsorption capacity occurs between ph 6 and 7 which is relevant because the ph of water for human consumption must be between 6 5 and 8 5 according to national and international standards such the nom 127 ssa1 1994 health in mexico the adsorption capacity of as v was correlated with the phpzc of the c7p60 composite 4 2 value similar to that of the pva hydrogel phpzc 4 1 this acidic ph is attributed to the high concentration of hydroxyl groups that they possess 45 this indicates that at ph 7 where the maximum adsorption capacity was obtained c7p60 is negatively charged at ph between 6 and 7 the composite removes the arsenic species h 2 aso 4 y haso 4 2 mostly by ligand exchange as reported by various authors 11 45 47 and less due to electrostatic interactions on the other hand at basic ph ph 7 arsenic species with a higher negative charge or deprotonated haso 4 2and aso 4 3 predominate the composite has more negative charges due to the loss of protons from the hydroxyl groups of fe ce particles therefore the as v repulsion is bigger causing the adsorption capacity to decrease by up to 50 finally at ph 4 the predominant arsenic species is h 2 aso 4 and the composite acquires positive charge due to the protonation of oh groups so the adsorption process mainly occurs by electrostatics attraction it is worth mentioning that during these tests no release of fe ce particles was detected 3 2 4 effect of coexisting anions on as v adsorption capacity the effect of chloride cl carbonate hco3 nitrate no3 phosphate h 2po4 and sulfate so4 2 which are normally found in water sources at neutral ph 52 on the as v adsorption capacity of c7p60 was evaluated at different concentrations of each anion 5 10 30 and 50 mg l and with f 17 ppm and using an initial arsenic concentration of 5 mg l in all cases fig 10 shows that the adsorption capacity of the c7p60 composite is about 10 mg l even in the presence of up to 10 mg l of each anion and beyond this concentration of competing anions up to 50 ppm the adsorption capacity does not decrease below 5 mg g in addition to this an as v adsorption capacity of 39 6 mg g was obtained in the presence of fluoride an element that has been reported to compete with arsenic for active sites 53 these results show the great affinity of arsenic for this composite and are comparable to those reported for commercial materials that have reported about 12 mg g 54 3 2 5 arsenic removal mechanism it has been proposed that arsenic is adsorbed to metal oxides by exchanging ligands with oh groups on the metal arsenic onto the surface of bimetallic oxyhydroxides can form monodentate bidentate mononuclear and bidentate binuclear internal sphere complexes 9 11 45 47 by using infrared spectroscopy ft ir it is possible to elucidate where arsenic is adsorbed on the adsorbent material fig 11a shows the ft ir obtained from the adsorbent material after adsorbing arsenic on its surface the same signals presented in fig 4 were identified with the addition of a signal at approximately 828 cm 1 attributed to the vibration of aso therefore the 828 cm 1 band indicates the bond between arsenic and the ce fe bimetallic oxyhydroxides present in pva then in the adsorption mechanism the formation of a monodentate surface complex of internal sphere is proposed which could lead to the formation of bidentate complexes of internal sphere as can be seen in fig 11b 55 56 in addition internal sphere complexes can be formed with 1 1 and 1 2 stoichiometry forming monodentate ξmoaso3h m ce fe and bidentate complexes fig 11b respectively 56 57 it should be noted that an internal sphere complex is defined as a covalent bond between the adsorbed ion and the reactive surface 56 58 finally as v can replace two individually coordinated oh groups on bimetallic oxyhydroxides surfaces to form binuclear bridge complexes mo aso oh om and mo as oh om 4 conclusions in this research we have successfully developed a granular composite based on pva fe ce bop in which the remarkable arsenic adsorption capacity of bops is conserved according with the results the pva hydrogel retains the bop particles mainly by hydrogen bond interactions also the composite that has the least inhibition on adsorption capacity has 7 pva with respect to the solvent mass and 60 of fe ce bop with respect to the polymer mass the optimum pva bop composite has an arsenic adsorption capacity of 77 6 mg l at an initial arsenic concentration of 10 mg l and solution ph of 7 and can reach adsorption equilibrium in less than 30 min with a speed of 1 69 mg as v min g when using an composite particle size between 0 85 and 0 5 mm in addition the introduction of bops in the pva polymeric matrix allowed to increase the elasticity of the composite from 60 to 90 which is suitable for its application in packed bed columns furthermore the arsenic adsorption capacity of composite c7p60 ranged from 10 to 5 mg as g when evaluated in solution containing 5 competing anions with a concentration from 5 to 50 mg g of each of them finally composite c7p60 reports an excellent performance to remove as v therefore it is believed that this has the potential to be implemented in water treatment systems credit authorship contribution statement l e rios saldaña methodology investigation data

13157,membrane distillation md has excellent potential for wastewater treatment and studies on this subject have increased recently the unique features of md to pass only volatile component through the pores has led to the exploration of hybrid md particularly membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr and osmotic membrane bioreactor membrane distillation ombr md fouling and wetting are recognised as drawbacks in particular applications despite the excellent performance the application of classical porous md is highlighted as the main concern that leads to poor separation performances this review highlights the possibility of applying dense membrane to push forward md applications for wastewater treatment the development of self standing and composite dense md and their performances in applications of wastewater treatment are summarized and discussed the operational parameters affecting md performance in the treatment of various types of feed are presented to analyze the robustness and the critical shortcomings of dense md for wastewater treatment challenges such as the trade off between mechanical integrity and permeate flux lack of studies using real wastewater for long term operation stability of the dense membrane against rigorous operation conditions complicated fabrication methods and the use of harsh chemicals during the fabrication of dense md membranes are elaborated for further improvement in the development of dense md membranes for wastewater treatment keywords dense membrane membrane distillation wastewater treatment fouling wetting 1 introduction industrialization and the increase in the world s population have led to the scarcity of fresh water and propelled the urge to find new dependable freshwater sources 1 seawater desalination is one of the most promising methods 2 3 and has been increasingly popular with a 9 annual growth in desalination plants worldwide from 2010 to 2016 4 5 membrane distillation md has drawn much attention as an emerging technology for desalination and is particularly suitable for treating hypersaline solution e g seawater reverse osmosis swro brine in the md process a hydrophobic porous membrane acts as a physical barrier between the hot feed and the permeate stream while the vapor pressure gradient drives the transport of volatile compounds from the feed side to the permeate side as the need for trans membrane pressure is eliminated in md the operation is insensitive to the feed concentration 6 in addition md operates at low temperatures under feed water s boiling point to generate the water vapor and can utilize low grade or renewable thermal energy 7 various configurations such as direct contact membrane distillation dcmd air gap membrane distillation agmd sweep gas membrane distillation sgmd and vacuum membrane distillation vmd have been proposed which notably differ in the approach of generating the driving force 1 fig 1 the hot feed solution is continuously circulated in all configurations and in direct contact with the membrane surface in dcmd the cold permeate stream is circulated and in direct contact with the opposite side of the membrane the temperature difference between the hot feed solution and the cold permeate stream creates vapor pressure difference and induces the transport of water vapor from the feed to the permeate a stagnant air gap exists between the membrane and a cool condensing plate in the agmd water vapor from the feed solution passes across the air gap before being condensed at the surface of the condensing plate in sgmd cold and inert sweep gas is circulated at the permeate side to carry the water vapor to an external condenser in vmd the vapor pressure difference is created by applying vacuum pressure at the permeate side water vapor in the permeate side condenses outside the membrane module further improvements in the md configurations such as material gap membrane distillation mgmd conductive gap membrane distillation cgmd multi stage membrane distillation msmd have been made and rigorously studied to improve the md performance and energy efficiency as described in 9 porous polymeric membranes such as polypropylene pp polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 10 11 are widely used for md application the utilization of non woven fabric as the support material for pvdf membrane was studied in vmd configuration at low feed temperature it was indicated that an up to 15 times increase in the permeate flux was achieved when a suitable non woven fabric material was used compared to that of unsupported pvdf membrane 12 higher flux in the supported membranes was due to the ability of the support layer to prevent the pore from collapsing while 42 thickness reduction after the md test occurred in the unsupported pvdf membrane little change in membrane thickness was observed in the supported membranes after similar test 13 the membrane materials and structures have been modified to form superhydrophobic omniphobic and janus membranes to improve md performance and increase membrane robustness against various feed water porous polymeric nanocomposite membrane structure with tuned hydrophobicity also has gained much interest a novel hydrophobic hydrophilic polyetherimide composite membrane was fabricated by adding self synthesized surface modifying macromolecules smms containing fluorine the modified smms pei membranes exhibited higher dcmd flux than the commercially available ptfe membrane with more than 99 nacl rejection 14 further improvement was attempted by varying the stoichiometric molar ratio of the smms components the results suggested that the highest flux was obtained by smms pei membrane with methylene bis p phenyl isocyanate mdi poly dimethylsiloxane pdms zonyl ba ltm bal ratio of 3 2 2 due to the lower liquid entry pressure and larger macrovoids 15 the addition of multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and sio2 on the pvdf membrane also led to enhanced vmd performance synergistic effects of the two additives led to the increase of overall porosity by mwncts and growth of macrovoids by sio2 even though the effect of mwcnt was more prominent 16 nanocomposite pvdf ptfe membrane was also demonstrated promising performance in the vmd test with the salt rejection of more than 99 9 the addition of 40 ptfe into the pvdf membrane increased the permeate flux by 464 than the pristine pvdf membrane 17 another nanoparticle such as titanium dioxide tio2 has also remarkably improved the pvdf membrane flux in the vmd test compared to the pristine pvdf membrane more than ten times higher flux was achieved in the test using pvdf membrane loaded with 5 wt and 2 wt of hydrophilic and hydrophobic tio2 nanoparticles respectively 18 further optimization of the nanocomposite membrane was conducted by incorporating 7 nm tio2 200 nm tio2 and hydrophilic and hydrophobic sio2 into the pvdf membrane promising results were obtained with the addition of 200 nm tio2 nanoparticles at 2 concentration 19 carbon based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have also gained much interest due to their high specific surface area strength vapor transport and tuneable hydrophobicity membranes coated by carbon based nanomaterials exhibit flux enhancement and show anti fouling properties detailed discussion on the carbon based membrane for md has been systematically reviewed 20 in the past few years wastewater treatment and reclamation by using md have gained increasing interest 21 fig 2 with increasingly stringent environmental regulations md appears as an advanced technique to remove hazardous pollutants prior to wastewater disposal to the environment moreover in the treatment of specific wastewater the unique features of md to only allow the passage of volatile components through the pores leads to the simultaneous production of water and concentration of recyclable materials 22 the quality of the product water produced in md varies and depends on the composition of the wastewater hence subsequent water treatment processes are often required to obtain high grade water nevertheless life cycle analyses indicate that in cases where surface water is not readily available water production via wastewater reclamation requires less energy and are economically more feasible than desalination 23 24 md application has been reported for the treatment of metallurgical wastewater 25 oil containing wastewater 26 textile wastewater 27 28 olive mill wastewater 29 30 municipal wastewater 31 33 pharmaceutical wastewater 34 petrochemical wastewater 35 etc table 1 in a study using agmd to treat wastewater containing high boron concentrations of 2500 6200 mg l high boron rejection of more than 99 was achieved due to the superior selectivity of md towards volatile compounds 36 treatment of oily wastewater by md has also drawn much attention as md is considered a cleaner technology than conventional oily wastewater treatment methods 37 treatment of petroleum in water emulsion with surfactant was conducted using composite pda pvdf hollow fiber membrane test showed md s robust performance with no fouling or wetting as indicated by stable flux and superior salt rejection of 99 99 38 highly polluted and hazardous spent caustic was treated by nanofibrous styrene acrylonitrile san membrane in dcmd configuration compared to the commercially available ptfe membrane the san membrane possessed higher surface hydrophobicity and lower permeate flux chemical oxygen demand and sulfide removal of 99 2 and 99 99 were reported 39 not limited to the lab scale md for wastewater treatment has also been explored in pilot scale with a capacity of 8 m3 d to decontaminate synthetic radioactive wastewater a stable permeate flux of 1 5 l m2 h was maintained for more than 70 h and notably low permeate conductivity of less than 1 μs cm was achieved throughout the process 40 techno economic analysis of md for wastewater treatment has also been conducted in treating shale gas produced water by dcmd the thermal energy cost for md operation was high as in general md processes to concentrate the produced water from tds of 10 to 30 the total cost was 5 70 m3 feed a significant reduction in the total cost can be obtained by operating the md with locally available waste heat 41 in another study recovering freshwater from anaerobically digested effluents by hybrid forward osmosis fo md low permeate flux was a significant concern for the technology industrialization and resulted in water production cost of 1 29 m3 the analysis indicated that the technology would only be technically feasible and economically attractive if the permeate flux could exceed 14 l m2 h 42 however in the treatment of nano electronic wastewater the application of agmd coupled with a low grade heat source showed 95 lower wastewater treatment cost than the existing electrochemical method 43 despite promising results there are severe operational issues associated with md for wastewater treatment limiting its commercial implementation due to inefficient energy utilization and poor produced water quality in this paper fundamental challenges impeding the performance of md for wastewater treatment are discussed strategies to overcome the aforementioned issues are continuously explored and optimized to address md operation for more complicated wastewater and push forward its commercial implementation in producing freshwater accordingly the status of the corresponding resolution development is comprehensively reviewed in particular the application of hybrid md to produce high grade freshwater from wastewater is elaborated furthermore the concept of dense md to replace the conventional porous md and its applicability on the treatment of wastewater is presented lastly this paper provides perspectives on future work for the commercialization of md for wastewater treatment and an outlook on the strategies for further improvement 2 challenges and current resolution strategies in md for wastewater treatment 2 1 temperature polarization and concentration polarization as in general md operation temperature polarization and concentration polarization occur due to the simultaneous mass and heat transfer during the process 1 the transport of water vapor in the heated feed solution through the membrane pores brings latent heat in the feed solution and results in lower feed temperature on the feed side boundary layer than in the bulk feed solution heat is transferred to the permeate side increasing the permeate temperature in the boundary layer of the permeate side the latter can be neglected in the vmd operation due to the extremely low pressure at the permeate side but still applicable in other md configurations 2 the severity of temperature polarization is referred to as temperature polarization coefficient tpc which describes the ratio of the actual temperature difference between the feed and permeate to the theoretical value 50 in practice the tpc for md ranges between 0 2 and 0 99 depending on the membrane module s configuration and operational conditions 52 54 the water vapor transfer from the feed side to the permeate side also enhances non volatile component concentration on the feed side boundary layer referred to as concentration polarization both temperature polarization and concentration polarization are unfavourable in md application as they result in a lower driving force for mass transport and consequently reduce the water flux 54 it was reported that the temperature polarization and concentration polarization became more severe at high feed temperature fig 3 a and b indicating less energy efficient operations while many studies concluded that the influence of concentration polarization on the driving force is much less significant compared to the temperature polarization the former shows a detrimental effect as it may induce rapid fouling on the membrane surface due to the concentration of non volatile components 55 efforts on alleviating temperature polarization and concentration polarization have been made which particularly focus on the enhancement of fluid shear rate on the membrane surface by modifying operation conditions and module configurations 9 such as employing higher feed and or permeate flow rate fig 3 c 56 transverse vibration of membrane module 57 the addition of spacers into the membrane module 58 and feed aeration 59 in a study on decontamination of uranium containing radioactive wastewater with vmd the rise of the feed velocity in the range of 0 3 0 7 m s resulted in increases in the shear velocity on the feed boundary layer thus reducing the boundary layer thickness as indicated by the enhancement of tpc and permeate flux 60 similar results on the effect of feed velocity on the permeate flux have also been reported in the study of textile dye wastewater treatment by dcmd 61 other novel methods to overcome temperature polarization have been proposed these include the utilization of the direct heating system such as localized photothermal fig 3 d joule fig 3 e and induction heating fig 3 f at which the heated membrane surface is contributed on the higher temperature on feed on the membrane surface than that in the bulk solution 62 67 the modification of membrane surface by thermally conductive nanomaterial coating to enhance the heat dispersion along the membrane has also been reported to increase the permeate flux 68 these novel strategies alleviate the temperature polarization and may result in reduced energy requirement of md the application of photothermal md utilizing various materials has been researched and developed nanofluids such as graphite ag ni multi walled carbon nanotubes and titanium nitride absorb light the utilization of titanium nitride in solar powered md tests showed remarkable flux and solar energy utilization 69 in another study polydimethylsiloxane carbon nanotube pvdf membrane was tested in solar md the results indicated 60 production efficiency 99 9 salt rejection and increased permeate flux with reduced total energy consumption 70 in a vmd test using ag nanoparticles incorporated in pvdf membrane negligible temperature polarization was observed throughout the test the permeate flux of the photothermal membrane was 1100 higher than the pristine pvdf membrane 71 despite the promising performance of photothermal md research on these novel strategies were conducted with saline water as feed further studies on the applicability of the strategies in wastewater treatment should be done 2 2 fouling fouling is an inevitable challenge in long term md for wastewater treatment the deposition of unwanted non volatile materials on the membrane surface and or within the membrane pores results in additional thermal and hydraulic resistance as well as the increase of temperature polarization depending on the components fouling in md may have porous or dense structure the dense fouling layer increases thermal and hydraulic resistance while the porous one only increases thermal resistance nevertheless fouling lead to reductions in permeate flux and compromised process efficiency wastewaters are complex solutions containing volatile organic compounds surfactants particulates colloidal substances sludge oily substances organic and inorganic salts etc 74 77 with specific characteristics and interaction with membrane surfaces the type of fouling can be varied in general fouling in md for wastewater treatment can be categorized into 1 organic fouling 2 inorganic fouling 3 biofouling and 4 colloidal fouling 77 fig 4 organic fouling occurs due to the adsorption of natural organic matter nom which mostly consists of humic acids the deposited nom may penetrate inside the membrane pores resulting in partial or complete blocking it can also create a gel like structure on the membrane surface 78 hydrophobic membrane surface is favourable for humic adsorption particularly at low ph 79 this highlight the organic fouling concern in md operation however humic acid deposition on pva pvdf composite membranes was investigated and physical cleaning using milli q water effectively removed the humic fouling layer on the membrane surface 80 another study reported that the organic substances in the feed solution penetrated membrane pores without wetting due to the adsorption desorption foulant migration through the membrane pores 81 inorganic fouling is the deposition of poorly soluble inorganic salts on the membrane surface and is significant in treating saline wastewater 82 the salts may undergo surface crystallization or bulk crystallization 83 84 salt crystallization on the membrane surface is categorized as heterogeneous crystallization mechanism which is thermodynamically easier to occur than homogeneous bulk crystallization in order for crystallization to occur the feed solution needs to be in supersaturated condition in md the concentration polarization may aggravate the heterogeneous crystallization as the concentration of the non volatile material on the membrane surface is higher than that in the bulk solution the most common inorganic fouling in md is caco3 caso4 calcium phosphate and silicate 85 however the compounds can be varied depending on the composition of the treated water other salts such as baso4 srso4 mgcl2 mgso4 ferric oxide iron oxide potentially form the inorganic fouling as well 86 the presence of microorganisms in the wastewater leads to the formation of biofouling compared to other membrane processes the biofouling in md is less severe due to the elevated feed temperature however biofouling formation was reported in previous research and the consequence of biofouling cannot be neglected 87 during biofilm formation microorganisms secrete an extracellular polymeric substance eps which acts as a physical barrier to biocides making its control extremely challenging 88 significant flux decline due to the biofouling has been reported in the membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr process at which membrane cleaning and process optimization were required to control the biofouling 90 colloidal fouling may consist of high molecular weight substances such as polysaccharides lipoproteins oils etc in depth discussions on fouling in md has been extensively reviewed 21 88 90 the occurrence of individual fouling mechanism during md operation using real wastewater is extremely rare 21 as shown in fig 5 combined fouling mechanisms often lead to a synergistic effect where certain fouling mechanisms exacerbate the deposition of other foulants leading to surface fouling and pore blocking it is important to note that fouling deposition depends on feed characteristics ph ionic strength foulant concentration molecular size charge membrane characteristics roughness hydrophobicity surface charge surface functional groups operation conditions cross flow velocity and feed temperature and the interactions among these factors 88 94 the foulant and membrane surface charges are essential as similar foulant and membrane surface charges lead to electrostatic repulsion and reduce fouling deposition 95 the interaction between membrane surfaces and solutes also plays an important role in determining the extent of membrane fouling it is known that hydrophobic interaction between solutes or microbial cells and membrane material is frequently addressed as one of the predominant causes of fouling therefore membrane fouling is more severe with hydrophobic than hydrophilic membranes 96 however it was indicated that polysaccharide and protein fouling were more severe at wastewater treatment tests using hydrophobic membranes than hydrophilic membranes 87 due to hydrophobic hydrophilic interactions between the foulant and membrane surface another study showed that the feed containing hydrophobic contaminants such as oils showed strong interaction with the hydrophobic membrane surface 98 fouling compaction was observed at tests with higher feed velocity due to higher permeate flux and rapid increase in the concentration of the non volatile solute on the membrane surface contributing to rapid flux decline 61 efforts to alleviate fouling in md are varied and should be chosen according to the foulant components fouling can be controlled by conducting feed pretreatment and membrane cleaning feed pre treatments in md are relatively straightforward particularly compared to other membrane processes such as ro pre treatment strategies that have been studied in the literature include adsorption coagulation flocculation advanced oxidation processes aop pre filtration and scale inhibitor 99 adsorption is widely used to remove the heavy metals dyes and organic matter in the feed solution and is considered a cost effective pre treatment strategy in the treatment of shale oil and gas produced water silica scaling was prevented by adsorption using 15 ppm al2 so4 3 18h2o in combination with precipitation softening to achieve 80 water recovery feed turbidity was reduced by 94 and toxic contaminants in the feed water such as benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes was removed by more than 95 100 in another work adsorption by activated carbon or amberlite ira67 was conducted to remove the acetic acid in lignocellulosic hydrolysates feed prior to vmd operation 101 in md application removing suspended solids and colloids in the feed solution by coagulation flocculation to prevent fouling has proven effective poly aluminium chloride pacl and polyacrylamide pam were used as coagulants for coke wastewater treatment prior to md operation increased rejection was reported in the study 102 when the feed solution was pre treated by flocculation sedimentation mitigation of organic fouling was also reported in the shale gas wastewater md test 103 the application of aop in md is limited but evident for fouling control fenton oxidation process electrochemical oxidation and photocatalytic process have been studied as the pre treatment process for md and promising results have been reported 104 105 the use of scale inhibitors as the internal water pre treatment is highly effective in controlling inorganic scaling several scale inhibitors such as pretreat plus 0400 and pretreat plus y2k 106 polyphosphate based compounds 107 and carboxyline cmi 108 have been utilized as pre treatment and were able to prevent scaling during the md process in another study polyaspartate pasp polyepoxysuccinate pesa polyacrylic acid sodium salt paas copolymer of maleic and acrylic acid ma aa aminotris methylene phosphonic acid atmp and 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 bis phosphonic acid hedp were also reported to prevent the crystallization of caco3 109 even with the aid of pre treatment fouling is inevitable in md and membrane cleaning is essential to be periodically conducted to remove the fouling from the membrane surface chemical cleaning using alkaline solution i e naocl and naoh can be conducted to target biofouling and organic fouling while acidic solutions are effective for inorganic fouling removal 99 however membrane damage occurred due to the prolonged and repetitive exposure of the membrane to the chemicals 110 111 in addition treatment or disposal of the chemical solution is required and increases the process s operational cost physical cleaning can be conducted by backwash 112 113 feed aeration 57 114 vibration 115 116 and water flushing 117 118 even though physical cleaning can alleviate the flux decline it is not as effective as chemical cleaning and requires additional energy to conduct the physical processes 99 2 3 wetting in the occurrence of wetting md cannot maintain its hydrophobicity and loses its unique properties to retain the transport of non volatile components in the feed side to the permeate side depending on the severity of the pore wetting fig 6 wetting leads to either permeate flux reduction or poor permeate quality in the case of surface wetting the feed solution penetrates the entrance of the pores increasing the mass transfer resistance for water vapor to pass through the pores and resulting in lower flux however as the surface wetting progresses the membrane suffers from partial wetting which results in some of the pores being thoroughly wetted by the feed solution as the feed solution freely passes through some of the pores in the aqueous phase the permeate quality is compromised and the presence of non volatile solutes in the permeate stream can be detected 119 furthermore most membrane pores are fully wetted in the fully wetting stage the membrane loses its separation ability indicated by the high concentration of non volatile solutes in the permeate stream 120 wetting can be induced by foulant deposition due to the hydrophilic properties of the foulant in wastewater 122 in addition wetting occurs when the transmembrane hydrostatic pressure surpasses the liquid entry pressure lep 120 low surface tension amphiphilic contaminants in the industrial wastewater such as surfactants can result in pore wetting by lowering the surface tension of the feed solution and saturating the hydrophobic pore surface with surfactants 123 other substances commonly contained in the wastewater such as proteins 124 oily substances 125 and biomass can readily be adsorbed on hydrophobic membranes and cause pore wetting in a study on integrated md bioreactor mdbr which employed pvdf flat sheet membrane millipore durapore gvhp for water reclamation from wastewater containing carbohydrates and proteins the reactor failed to perform well due to biofouling and flux decline even though the flux could be maintained at more than 6 8 l m2 h 8 lower than the average md flux for at least 13 days 126 inorganic fouling may also lead to pore wetting as the crystals on the membrane surface reduce the membrane hydrophobicity and can further grow inside the membrane pores parallel with the viscous flow of the permeate repetitive physical and chemical cleaning to remove the fouling layer on the membrane surface indirectly lead to pore wetting the chemical used during the cleaning can degrade and change the morphology of the membrane surface 57 operational parameters such as the temperature and flow rate of hot and cold streams have also been reported to affect pore wetting the pore wetting can be delayed by setting high feed temperature low temperature of the cold stream and low flow rate of both hot and cold stream 127 in addition membranes subjected to intermittent operation experienced rapid pore wetting due to the deposition of dried out foulant on the membrane surface 128 porous hydrophobic membranes in md have always been associated with the wetting challenge in a study by gryta et al polypropylene pp hollow fiber membranes were utilized in a dcmd with tap water as the feed solution partial wetting was observed during long term operation despite the low concentration of non volatile solute and low surface tension contaminants in the tap water 129 studies on the modification of the membrane structure and material have been widely conducted to reduce the risk of pore wetting membrane pore size should be optimized by considering the trade off between the high liquid entry pressure and permeate flux during the operation typically pore diameters of around 0 3 μm are recommended 130 even though a smaller pore diameter could further alleviate membrane wetting to prevent fouling induced wetting it was indicated that reducing the surface pore size porosity was more effective than increasing the surface hydrophobicity 131 the membrane material modification development highlighted superhydrophobic md with lower surface energy than the classical hydrophobic membrane the surface of the superhydrophobic membranes is roughened to form a hierarchical structure by combining inorganic materials such as silica and titanium oxide 132 133 in a recent study β feooh nanorods are incorporated in a polydopamine pda polyethyleneimine pei pvdf membrane via in situ mineralization to form a superhydrophobic membrane that achieved contact angle and sliding angle of 162 and 5 7 respectively dcmd tests with synthetic dye solution containing a mixture of nacl and sodium dodecyl sulphate sds resulted in a stable flux of 15 lmh without wetting for 60 h of operation 134 a novel membrane fabrication technique spray assisted nonsolvent induced phase separation sanips has been developed to fabricate a self cleaning superhydrophobic pvdf membrane the multilevel polymeric crystalline structure was formed due to the air spraying before the phase inversion in water the membrane performance was tested in a dcmd set up with a synthetic dye solution containing a mixture of 10 nacl and 2000 ppm rose bengal dye as the feed solution high flux and more than 99 9 salt rejection were observed during a 100 hour test indicating its remarkably superior hydrophobicity 135 however the wetting resistance property of the superhydrophobic membrane was compromised with the presence of low surface tension substances and surface active reagents in the feed solution 22 omniphobic membranes which combine the low surface energy material and re entrant structure on the membrane surface are repellent to high and low surface tension liquids 136 137 previous studies demonstrated successful attempts to fabricate omniphobic membranes by grafting nanoparticles to create the re entrant structure and functionalization of the surface by fluoroalkyl silane fas to lower the surface energy the modified membrane exhibited superior performance compared to the virgin pvdf membrane in the test using synthetic oily wastewater containing sds hexadecane and nacl however a slight increase in the permeate conductivity was observed after 400 min of test 138 chung et al reported the modification of pvdf membrane by nano silica deposition and teflon af 2400 coating wetting resistance of the modified membrane was observed for 420 min test using a mixture of nacl and sds as the feed solution partial wetting was observed towards the end of the tests as indicated by the reduced permeate flux 136 janus membranes have also been widely explored as an alternative to md for wastewater treatment materials of opposing wettability are integrated to form two bounded layers that prevent the adsorption of non polar substances on the membrane surface 139 140 the hydrophilic top surface of the janus membranes is crucial as it determines the membrane s performance in alleviating wetting and maintaining the permeate flux many studies indicated delayed wetting using janus membranes 141 142 however contradicting results have also been reported 143 144 3 hybrid md for wastewater treatment hybrid mds for wastewater treatment was developed by combining specific processes that complement each other to enhance the overall performance of the treatment process e g obtain higher grade water for specific utilization to reduce the energy consumption nutrient recovery among others membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr and md assisted osmotic membrane bioreactor have been widely explored and are referred to as high retention bioreactors 3 1 membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr membrane bioreactor mbr is one of the most prominent technologies to treat wastewater in conventional mbr microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membrane is employed to separate the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss from the treated effluent either in submerged or in crossflow configuration 145 compared to conventional activated sludge the mbr benefits from the ability to control sludge retention time srt independently of hydraulic retention time hrt lower footprint and increased product water quality as indicated by low total organic carbon toc and negligible suspended solid 146 despite these advantages the presence of some organic substances particularly those that are poorly biodegradable and are of low molecular weight are detected in the mbr permeate with concentration similar to the supernatant in the bioreactor this affects product water quality and raises the requirement of downstream processing in addition the low organic retention time ort of the recalcitrant organic substances delay the acclimatization of the microorganisms longer start up time and or larger size of mbr are required to acclimatize the microorganism 147 in mdbr the pressure driven microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf is replaced by hydrophobic md which provides complete retention of the non volatile components such as salts microorganisms and non volatile organics producing high grade product water in a single step process studies on the application of mdbr are presented in table 2 the application of mdbr is of interest for industries with the availability of waste heat or heated effluent high overall organic removal efficiency of mdbr was reported and found comparable to those observed in municipal wastewater treatment by uf membrane bioreactor mbr reverse osmosis ro operation 155 as the temperature of the mdbr feed solution is elevated in the range of 30 80 c heat tolerant biomass is required to operate the bioreactor in the submerged configuration the md modules are immersed in the feed tank and in direct contact with the mlss fig 7 a in the aerobic bioreactor air is introduced to the bioreactor to provide oxygen for the microorganisms and continuously scour the membrane surface to limit temperature polarization concentration polarization and fouling formation in a proof of concept study pvdf and ptfe membranes were utilized in submerged mdbr to treat mlss with concentration ranging from 1 5 5 7 g l the process achieved sustainable operation of 15 days and the permeate flux of 5 2 l m2 h the reported total organic carbon concentration toc 0 2 0 7 ppm and chemical oxygen demand cod 0 0 5 ppm in the permeate stream were extremely low particularly compared to those in mf uf mbr operation 147 removing trace organic compounds from wastewater is essential to meet the more stringent environmental regulations of wastewater discharge and water reuse 158 using a crossflow mdbr configuration the removal of 25 trace organic compounds in synthetic wastewater was investigated high rejection of the trace organic compounds 99 and nitrogen 96 was achieved regardless of the deteriorating performance of mdbr due to salinity build up in the feed solution 151 in an anaerobic mdbr operation fig 7 b 26 trace organic compounds were added to the feed solution representing the waste from pharmaceutical personal care products endocrine disruptors and industrial chemicals md served as the complement to the anaerobic mbr to enhance the removal of these compounds in addition the anaerobic mdbr also acted as an energy producing system by producing biogas in the range of 0 3 0 5 g cod with methane concentration of 65 the anaerobic mbr could remove 70 of specific trace organic compounds although the removal of ketoprofen primidone ibuprofen diclofenac carbamazepine gemfibrozil simazine atrazine and diuron were as low as 15 25 trace organic compounds removal by further treatment using md is reported to improve the overall rejection to 76 which indicated the ability of md to remove compounds that were poorly removed by anaerobic mbr however due to the superior rejection of the md module organic matter and inorganic salts were accumulated in the feed solution and resulted in severe fouling 152 it is also important to note that the stability of an anaerobic bioreactor is a function of alkalinity which maintains suitable ph for microorganisms md provides crucial advantages by rejecting most alkaline salts thus retaining the alkalinity in the system 159 despite the robustness of mdbr in removing compounds of interest fouling remains a challenge for the operation specifically when the tests are conducted at high permeate flux earlier study comparing md and mdbr indicated 19 higher md flux than the mdbr flux at similar fouling layer thickness this highlights the influence of fouling layer structure composition and porosity on the permeate flux apart from the fouling layer thickness 150 in mdbr organic inorganic and biofouling occur simultaneously the organic fouling layers tend to deposit at the early stage as in the conventional mbr and provide nutrients for the biofilm 160 the excreted extracellular polymeric substances eps in the biofilm interact with the inorganic ions and affect the crystallization of the inorganic salt by trapping and concentrating the ions 161 the combination of inorganic fouling and microbial eps formed an impermeable crust in mdbr leading to a more rapid decline in the permeate flux fouling in mdbr also showed more detrimental effect on the permeate flux than the mbr it increased mass transfer resistance and elevated heat transfer resistance by reducing the vapor pressure gradient in the mdbr system 149 162 feed temperature was reported to significantly affect fouling in a submerged thermophilic anaerobic mdbr fig 7 c with 50 flux reduction after operating at 65 c feed temperature for seven days at feed temperature as low as 45 c minimum flux reduction was observed with a biogas yield of 0 14 l g cod 107 despite the low flux wastewater treatment by thermophilic microorganisms has been proven to delay wetting in mdbr by 1 7 3 6 times compared to the md at similar operation conditions and feed composition except for no biomass in md feed however aggravated wetting was still observed after 22 days of operation due to the transport of amphiphilic organic compounds 150 3 2 osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr md another attractive alternative for wastewater treatment is the integration of an osmotic based membrane bioreactor with md in ombr forward osmosis fo membrane produces clean water products with lower energy consumption and fouling tendency than conventional mbr 163 164 the highly concentrated solution e g nacl cacl2 sucrose mgcl2 ch3coona mg ch3coo 2 165 166 is circulated as the draw solution ds in the permeate side of the fo membrane to create the osmotic pressure gradient which acts as the driving force for water transport from the feed side to the permeate side as the operation progresses the draw solution concentration reduces and results in lower water flux across the membrane in many studies md has been suggested as the regeneration process of the draw solution with a salt rejection of higher than 99 7 167 168 to maintain the driving force of the fo operation fig 8 a in this configuration the draw solution of fo acts as the feed in md and high quality water is produced as the permeate of md 169 hybrid fo md has also been combined with an anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactor afbr to improve the removal efficiency of nutrients in the bioreactor such as ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus using nacl or mgcl2 as the draw solution 99 of phosphorus was retained in the bioreactor by the fo membrane 171 173 however it was reported that only 80 of ammonia rejection could be achieved and accumulation of ammonia in the draw solution was observed 174 in addition as fo utilized a semipermeable membrane the salt back diffusion from the draw solution to the feed side was unavoidable and is one of its significant drawbacks 175 further draw solution treatment by md indicated improved nutrient removal with more than 85 ammonia nitrogen and less than 6 mg l chemical oxygen demand in the md permeate dense fouling consisting of mainly biofouling was observed on the fo membrane and physical cleaning was ineffective to recover the permeability of the membrane on the md membrane however the fouling was mild and only consisted of inorganic scale due to the exclusion of organic materials by fo prior to the md operation 176 recently the removal of pharmaceutically active compound phac and estrogenic activity from the wastewater using an anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor was investigated the hybrid fo md in a single membrane module was immersed in the bioreactor inoculated with anaerobic sludge to a final mlvss concentration of 10 g l fig 8 b in this configuration the draw solution was diluted by the fo permeate while simultaneously being concentrated by the md municipal wastewater containing seven phacs and estrogenic activity were fed to the bioreactor using 2 mol l nacl as the draw solution the overall removal of phacs was 96 even though trace amounts of betamethasone fluconazole and prednisone were still detected in the distillate of md 170 using a similar configuration it was found that fouling occurred in both fo and md membranes in fo membranes the fouling was due to the salinity build up inside the bioreactor that enhanced the eps production while in md membranes accumulation of organic materials in the fo ds aggravated the fouling 177 4 recent development of dense membrane for anti wetting and anti fouling md to address the fouling and wetting challenge the possibility of utilizing dense membranes instead of porous membranes has been investigated the absence of pores in the dense membrane is considered pivotal in resisting fouling and wetting the application of dense md dates back to 1968 when dense silicone rubber was used 178 comparison of microporous hydrophobic pp membrane liqui cel x 50 g478 celgard and dense silicone rubber hollow fiber was performed using 3 5 nacl as the feed at a similar membrane thickness of 40 μm an air sweep vmd test was conducted at a feed temperature of 291 295 k the dense silicon membrane exhibited 20 lower flux than the porous pp membrane but prevented the feed penetration to the permeate stream 179 to date research on dense membranes is almost exclusively conducted in the field of desalination despite the more challenging fouling and wetting in wastewater treatment though more limited than the porous membrane the development of dense md membranes has attracted more attention lately as shown in table 3 dense md membranes can be categorized into self standing and composite ones each with advantages and disadvantages 4 1 self standing dense membrane distillation studies on self standing dense md membranes have been carried out using self manufactured flat sheet pvdf membranes the membrane porosities varied from 0 dense membrane to 70 by adjusting the fabrication methods at similar vmd setup and operation conditions the performance of the membranes was investigated in tests using pure water and a mixture of chloroform water as the feed solution results indicated that the permeate flux of the dense membrane was highly dependent on membrane thickness more than 60 reduction in the permeate flux was observed at increased membrane thickness from 38 μm to 110 μm comparing the permeate flux of the dense membrane and porous membrane it was emphasized that higher flux was conferred with porous membranes with increased flux at tests with higher porosity however in the chloroform water separation test the dense membrane exhibited a significantly higher chloroform water separation factor which indicated better chloroform enrichment in the permeate side given that the membrane material used in this study was hydrophobic 192 another study on the dense silicone rubber membrane with 40 μm membrane thickness also showed agreement with previous work as the permeate flux of the dense membrane was significantly lower than that of porous pp pvdf polyethylene pe membranes 193 depending on the separation purposes and permeating components the self standing dense md membranes can be made of hydrophobic or hydrophilic materials hydrophobic materials can be chosen to separate water from a solution in contrast hydrophilic materials separate organic components from an aqueous organic solution or organic organic solutions in a recent study a sulfonated pentablock terpolymer nexar membrane was fabricated and tested for desalination with 32 g l nacl as the feed solution permeate flux of 3 32 lmh and a salt removal of 99 5 were achieved the low permeate flux obtained in the test resulted from the thickness of the dense membrane further study on composite membranes where the nexar membrane acts as a thin dense top layer should be further explored 194 in other applications nonporous polyamide pa membranes have been employed in water treatment to reject carcinogenic components such as n nitrosodimethylamine ndma from potable water 195 nonporous membranes have also been utilized in the removal of volatile organic compounds vocs such as btex a mixture of benzene ethylbenzene toluene and xylenes for the treatment of vapor phase waste streams btex removal in the test using the dense silicone membrane was higher than that obtained using a microporous membrane in addition the microporous membrane experienced significant flux reduction associated with pore blocking by biomass and water vapor condensation inside the porous structure 196 recently self standing dense md membranes were modeling was conducted to investigate the optimum membrane thickness that could be competitive with the productivity of the porous membrane membranes as thin as 1 0 0 2 μm were able to produce as much permeate as the conventional porous membrane used for md application however the mechanical integrity of these particular membranes can be compromised in depth research on fabricating ultra thin self standing dense membranes is essential 197 4 2 composite dense membrane distillation the development of composite dense md has attracted much attention to tackle the trade off between mechanical integrity and permeate flux which has emerged as the fundamental drawbacks of self standing dense md application while the porous support layers are mainly hydrophobic membranes classically used in md the dense top layer can be made of hydrophobic or hydrophilic materials fig 9 the hydrophilic hydrophobic arrangement of the composite dense md is also widely acknowledged as janus membrane the preparation of a composite membrane by evaporation deposition of a poly vinyl alcohol pva dense layer on top of a dense pp and pvdf has been investigated the fabricated membranes were applied in the separation of ethanol water mixture results showed that high selectivity with moderate flux or moderate selectivity with high flux could be obtained however additional surface treatments during the membrane fabrication step were crucial to improve the integrity of the dense top layer 198 composite dense membranes have also been utilized in osmotic distillation applications in terms of separation and transport mechanisms osmotic distillation is identical to md with both using a porous hydrophobic membrane that acts as a selective barrier for water vapor the driving force for water vapor transport in membrane distillation is generated by the temperature difference between the feed solution and permeate stream but in osmotic distillation it is generated by the difference in water activity in the feed solution and draw solution stream 199 dense polyvinyl alcohol pva hydrogel layer was coated on top of porous pp pe celgard 2500 pvdf durapore gvsp millipore and umhwpe upvp millipore membrane osmotic distillation tests using 0 2 0 5 and 1 wt of limolene oil in water dispersions as the feed solutions indicated that the addition of a top layer had remarkable effects on the flux with good stability while uncoated membranes were instantly wetted the composite membrane showed stable and comparable flux for 24 h of operation 200 in another study a composite alginate hydrogel ptfe membrane was fabricated to treat oily feed surface active agent containing solution in an osmotic distillation application results also suggested outstanding wetting resistance at least for a limited time 201 202 in the last decade research on composite dense md membranes has increased as the application of md for more complex solutions arises bell et al prepared a thin film composite tfc polyelectrolyte pvdf membrane which prohibited pore wetting and reduced adsorption of organic substances on the membrane surface tests in dcmd configuration showed that the tfc membranes exhibited only a slight reduction in permeate flux compared to virgin pvdf membrane due to the high water permeability provided by a 2 μm thin dense polyelectrolyte layer 203 other studies by an et al 204 focus on fabricating a high performance hierarchical fibrous composite hfc membrane to acquire a high water flux while maintaining a high salt rejection in md for desalination the hfc membrane comprised a 3 μm thin active dense layer of small poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene ph nanofibers porous support layer of large poly ethylene terephthalate pet microfibers salt rejection of 99 9 and an outstanding permeate flux of 79 l m2 h were obtained in the dcmd tests using 3 5 nacl as the feed solution at a feed temperature of 65 c 204 the fabrication of other hydrophilic hydrophobic md was also conducted using layer by layer assembly of cationic polyethyleneimine and anionic poly sodium 4 styrene sulfonate polyelectrolytes on porous pvdf substrate fig 10 a the number of polyelectrolyte layers determined the anti wetting property of the developed membrane a remarkably thin dense top layer of 48 nm was obtained and resulted in 16 l m2 h permeate flux compared to the virgin pvdf membrane the permeate of the modified membrane was approximately 20 reduced in the dcmd test with a mixture of nacl and sds as the feed solution the modified membrane exhibited excellent anti wetting property indicated by 99 salt rejection during 36 h of operation however the pristine membrane was instantly wetted and showed no salt rejection after 3 h of operation 140 the composite polyurethane pu ptfe c ptfe membrane was also tested to treat synthetic wastewater containing 2 g l nacl and 40 mg l sds or 100 g l ethanol using a dcmd configuration in the test with nacl and ethanol as the feed solution the c ptfe membrane exhibited 10 lower flux than the virgin ptfe due to the doubled c ptfe membrane thickness with thickness of 14 20 μm and 28 μm for virgin ptfe and c ptfe respectively however the c ptfe membrane showed good wetting resistance as the permeate conductivity was extremely low at 60 water recovery the membrane performance in tests using nacl and sds as the feed solution was in agreement with that using nacl and ethanol though the permeate conductivity slightly increased towards the end of the tests the wetting mechanism in the virgin ptfe membrane is related to the interaction between the membrane material and the wetting agents both ethanol and sds consist of alkyl chains and hydrophilic hydroxyl or sulphate groups which can simultaneously interact with the membrane surface and the feed solution resulting in reduced membrane hydrophobicity and induced wetting fig 10 b 189 other modifications of composite dense md membranes incorporated nanocomposites to the md membrane to modify the membrane surface to form a rough and hierarchically structured membrane surface which is the mechanism to create superhydrophobic membranes a mixture of polydimethylsiloxane pdms and hydrophobic sio2 nanoparticles was sprayed on a pvdf flat sheet membrane to form a dense top layer fig 11 a varying the sio2 concentration from 0 to 1 5 wt the water contact angle of the membrane increased from 107 to 156 in a dcmd test using 3 5 wt nacl solution as feed the modified membrane exhibited slightly lower flux than the pristine membrane yet possessed better anti wetting property as indicated by low less than 50 μs cm permeate conductivity in tests with a higher feed concentration of 25 wt nacl the modified membrane consistently showed 99 99 rejection rate for 180 h of operation and more significant fouling repellent property fig 11 b and c 205 5 factors affecting dense md operation several operational factors related to the feed and permeate such as temperature flow rate and concentration significantly affect dense md performance as in porous md this has been extensively reviewed 1 206 and is only briefly discussed in this study the increment in feed temperature and the reduction in the permeate temperature proportionally increase the permeate flux this is attributed to the enhancement of the vapor pressure gradient between the feed and permeate streams 207 208 in addition the increases in temperature gradient also lead to an increase in diffusion coefficient for vapor transport 209 however it requires more thermal energy supply to increase the feed temperature and reduce the permeate temperature a concern being raised in many md applications 210 the higher flow rate of the feed and permeate flows fundamentally reduces the stagnant heat and mass transfer boundary layer on the membrane surface this results in less severe temperature polarization and concentration polarization which considerably reduce the vapor pressure gradient across the membrane 207 211 it is important to note that a higher flow rate raises the electrical energy need of the operation in the case of osmotic assisted md omd the vapor pressure gradient is also generated with the aid of highly concentrated osmotic agent draw solution flowing in the permeate stream high concentration draw solution results in the reduced water activity and lower vapor pressure of the draw solution thus increasing the permeate flux 212 similarly the effect of feed concentration on the permeate flux is in agreement with the draw solution concentration due to the reduction of water activity at higher feed concentration 213 214 in a study using composite alginic acid ptfe membrane the concentration of orange oil in the feed solution varied from 0 2 0 8 wt and lower permeate flux was obtained at higher oil concentrations in a test using dbs in water as the feed solution reasonable flux was achieved at dbs concentration of 0 1 wt however at dbs concentration of 0 3 and 0 5 wt major flux reduction was observed after 4 h of operation due to dbs fouling the flux decline was followed by a rapid flux increase in the test with 0 5 wt dbs solution indicating membrane wet out 190 in applying dense membrane for wastewater treatment the feed composition affects the membrane performance in terms of the permeate flux and quality c ptfe membrane exhibited superior performance in tests using mixtures of ethanol and water as the feed solution compared to the pristine ptfe membrane only 5 flux reduction was observed the permeate conductivity was less than 3 μs cm throughout the tests while a comparable trend of the permeate flux was observed the permeate conductivity increased with the increment of water recovery in the test using water sds mixture fig 12 a 189 for composite dense md applications membrane orientation also substantially affected the system s performance in a test with 1 m nacl feed solution the membrane was tested with the dense layer facing the hot feed solution and the opposite orientation fig 12 d a high permeate flux of 26 l m2 h was achieved at the dense feed orientation while a much lower permeate flux of 6 2 l m2h was obtained using the opposite configuration this was attributed to pore wetting and water penetration into the porous structure in the porous feed orientation water penetration was not observed in the dense feed orientation as the surface tension of the water used in the permeate stream was higher than that of nacl solution 72 8 mn m compared to 68 mn m partial wetting in the porous feed configuration created a stagnant feed layer inside the membrane pores out of reach of the feed hydrodynamic mixing and led to a pronounced temperature polarization 215 membrane characteristics also play an important role in md performance in composite dense membrane assembled layer by layer it was noted that the number of polyelectrolyte layers determined the anti wetting properties of the membrane rather than the surface charge or surface wettability as indicated in fig 12 c the number of pei pss polyelectrolyte lbl deposition varied from one to three the tests were conducted using mixtures of sds and nacl solution at which the sds concentration increased gradually the dense composite membrane with one and two layers exhibited wetting once the sds concentration was 0 2 and 0 3 mm respectively in contrast the composite membrane with three layers did not exhibit any wetting even at 0 4 mm sds demonstrating wetting resistance during the 36 h of operation while these membranes showed comparable contact angle and surface charge the outstanding wetting resistance was attributed to the size exclusion mechanism of the dense layer that can reject the sds molecules 140 furthermore the membrane thickness is also an important aspect that affects the performance of the dense md the flux reduces as the thickness of the dense layer increases due to increased mass transfer resistance 188 6 challenges on dense membrane distillation for wastewater treatment mass transfer resistance in a dense membrane is much higher than that in a porous membrane of the same thickness due to the absence of pores the effective diffusion coefficients of the transporting molecules are indeed lower by several orders of magnitude than that observed in a porous membrane in a porous membrane reduction of the pore diameter results in increased resistance to vapor transport further pore diameter reduction to minimal significantly reduces vapor permeability 216 although the application of dense membranes can avoid membrane wetting as have been proven experimentally 217 mass transfer mechanism in dense md is similar to thermo pervaporation which is based on solution diffusion theory there are three sequential steps involved i selective sorption of the volatile substances in the feed solution into the membrane ii selective diffusion of the volatile substances through the membrane and iii desorption of the volatile substance into the vapor phase on the permeate side 218 in the solution diffusion mechanism the transport of a gas vapor or liquid through a dense nonporous membrane is determined by the compound s solubility and diffusivity in the solution diffusion model when the hydrostatic pressure within a membrane is assumed uniform and the chemical potential gradient across the membrane is expressed only as a function of concentration gradient i e the flux j i of component i can be described by the following equation 6 1 j i d i d c i dx d i c if m c ip m l where d i is the diffusion coefficient of component i in the membrane c if m is the concentration of component i at the feed membrane interface c ip m is the concentration of component i at the membrane permeate interface and l is the membrane thickness in wastewater treatment and reclamation the substances to be transported through the membrane is water eq 1 emphasizes that the flux significantly depends on the physicochemical properties of the membrane such as thickness the affinity to water and the diffusion coefficient of water through the membrane 219 in a composite membrane consisting of a selective top layer active layer and a porous support layer the separation process occurs in the active layer of the membrane while the support layer acts to increase the mechanical strength of the membrane the mass transfer mechanism in the composite membranes combines transport in the dense and porous membrane at the dense top layer water is transported following the solution diffusion mechanism once entering the porous layer water vaporizes due to the low water vapor pressure in the permeate side and is transported following the poiseuille flow ordinary molecular diffusion knudsen diffusion or the combination of these mechanisms mass transfer in porous md membrane has been extensively discussed in many studies 1 220 221 the mass transfer resistance during the transport which directly affects the permeate flux is mainly attributed to the dense top layer the support layer s mass transfer resistance is low due to the high gas diffusion coefficient towards the low pressure permeate side 217 in addition high porosities of the support layer reduce the additional mass transfer resistance for the permeating compounds 222 zeng et al described the mass transfer resistance in asymmetric membranes as shown in fig 13 the resistance is divided into three regions 1 the nonporous membrane as the nonporous layer l 1 2 the nonporous membrane material in the pore structure in the supporting layer l 0 and 3 the porous sub layer as the support layer for the active layer of the membrane l s 223 the total mass transfer resistance can be written as follow 2 r t r i r o r o r o r o r s where r i is the resistance of the nonporous membrane r o is the resistance of the dense material in the second region r o is the resistance of the porous material in the second region and r s is the resistance of the porous sublayer considering the significantly higher resistance in the dense top layer the permeate flux j i can be expressed in terms of resistance as follow 3 j i p i a p l p l p i a p r i where p i is the permeability coefficient a is the effective surface area p the partial pressure difference l the membrane thickness as described in eqs 1 and 3 permeate flux in dense md both self standing and composite are dictated by the membrane thickness the increase in membrane thickness leads to the addition of the resistance to mass transport due to the lengthen path for vapor transport 224 khayet et al suggested self standing dense membrane thickness of less than 60 μm to achieve low mass transfer resistance 192 however such thickness was not feasible as the mechanical stability was very low and the risk for defects were high 130 in dense composite membranes wetting of membrane pores can be avoided without compromising membrane integrity to reduce the overall mass transfer resistance the membrane should be manufactured based on several key points high porosity and pore diameter of the support layer and minimum thickness of both top layer and support layer the mass transfer coefficient of a particular component in the support layer has a constant value and is a function of the component s molecular weight 217 however it is important to note that the wide pores of the support layer may also cause high mass transfer resistance when the composite dense md membrane is fabricated by coating dilute polymer solution on top of the support layer the top layer solution can penetrate through and clog the pores once they are solidified and indirectly increase the dense layer thickness techniques such as the utilization of pre wetting agents have already been developed to prevent this penetration the pores of the support layer can be filled with a pre wetting agent before applying the coating polymer the pre wetting agent can then be removed from the membrane structure by evaporation and or solvent exchange 225 a composite polydimethylsiloxane pdms membrane supported by cellulose acetate ca was prepared by the pre wetting method the membrane structure contained crosslinked pdms and was treated in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 4 h to complete the cross linking procedure this technique successfully reduced the mass transfer resistance due to the intrusion of the pdms solution into the porous substrate during the fabrication of the composite membrane membrane with a top layer thickness of 8 μm was achieved and exhibited higher overall mass transfer coefficient than the thicker membranes 226 in another study filling the pores with highly viscous materials or creating the pores only after deposition of the top layer has been proven to reduce the polymer penetration and pore clogging 222 in the application of dense md membranes careful considerations of the membrane materials are required to obtain the membranes wetting prevention property while minimizing the mass transfer resistance 229 in research by lizeth et al a mathematical model was used to study various types of dense membrane materials with different permeability coefficients that have the potential to be fabricated as dense md membranes table 3 the polyethylene oxide and poly butylene terephtalate peo pbt polymers used in the study provided higher permeability coefficient than commercial polymers such as psf and ca 227 it is also worth noting that as the transport in the dense layer is based on the solution diffusion mechanism the hydrophobicity of the top layer material is crucial when hydrophobic material is used as the top layer water cannot pass through the membrane due to its hydrophobicity this is indicated by the significantly lower permeability of pp compared to other materials in table 4 also the nonporous structure of the top layer restricts vapor transport and leads to poor permeate flux 7 conclusion and future outlook with increasingly more stringent environmental standards the ability of md to remove pollutants from various wastewaters prior to disposal has gained increasing attention in general the operational challenges for md in wastewater treatment are identical to other md applications i e temperature polarization concentration polarization fouling and wetting to mitigate these challenges strategies such as enhancing fluid shear rate on the membrane surface and applying a direct heating system have been applied however fouling and wetting in md for wastewater treatment is more pronounced than in other applications due to the complex nature of the contaminants in the feed this highlights the need for further investigation of specifically tuned membrane properties and structures the application of novel janus membranes and omniphobic membranes has alleviated fouling and wetting problems although these mainly were tested for a short time period contradictory results have also been obtained in research on treating different feed solutions the unique features of md that allows only passage of volatile components through the pores have led to the exploration of hybrid md i e high retention mbr mdbr and ombr md for producing high grade water reducing energy consumption and enhancing nutrient recovery the excellent performance of mdbr and ombr md has been reported with superior retention of non volatile solutes from the feed lower energy requirement and lower carbon footprint compared to conventional mf uf mbr in the case of anaerobic operation simultaneous biogas production is another attractive potential however fouling on the md membrane was one of the drawbacks in both mdbr and ombr md operations at the same time wetting was reported in the mdbr operation compromising the product water quality further studies on the application of novel md membranes such as janus and omniphobic membranes for mdbr and ombr md applications are required dense membrane has demonstrated great potential in alleviating wetting in md for wastewater treatment fouling in dense md does not induce wetting due to the absence of membrane pores however fouling still poses a major concern as it results in a significant reduction in permeate flux and process efficiency it is noteworthy that the applications of dense md membranes were mostly tested for synthetic feed simulating textile wastewater or a mixture of sds and salts in the tests using synthetic wastewater the extent of fouling deposition is not definitive its behaviour may differ greatly from real wastewater as other contaminants might aggravate the membrane fouling therefore the utilization of modified dense membrane for real wastewater solutions is required fouling deposition and wetting in real applications should be further studied the tests of dense md reported in the literature have been conducted on the lab scale for a short period of time to forward the application of dense md membranes on an industrial scale a long term performance test should be conducted to investigate the durability and integrity of the dense md despite the recent advancements in membrane fabrication discussed above significant improvements in the performance test are required study on the effect of operation conditions such as feed and permeate flow rate temperature permeate vacuum pressure etc is still lacking in porous md applications the operation condition directly affects the membrane performance in terms of permeate flux and quality fouling deposition rate and wetting severity similar behaviours are expected in dense md applications however this should be further examined it is also important to note that the operation condition might affect the dense membrane stability particularly composite dense md membranes fabricated by coating operation wise the flux of dense md membranes is lower than that of porous md membranes the fabrication of dense md membranes with unconventional materials is of interest to increase the permeate flux for the self standing dense md selecting membrane material with outstanding permeability is crucial to reduce the mass transfer resistance another strategy to minimise mass transfer resistance in self standing dense md membranes is the fabrication of ultra thin self standing dense md with a thickness of less than 5 μm the mechanical integrity and defect formation are still the main drawbacks of ultra thin dense membrane fabrication particularly in md applications composite dense md membrane is a promising alternative for cost effective operation the fabrication should be facile and straightforward unfortunately the approaches to fabricate composite dense md membranes are complex and time consuming since chemicals that are harmful to the environment are also extensively used during the preparation of the membranes there is an urgent need for greener methodology to be adopted

13157,membrane distillation md has excellent potential for wastewater treatment and studies on this subject have increased recently the unique features of md to pass only volatile component through the pores has led to the exploration of hybrid md particularly membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr and osmotic membrane bioreactor membrane distillation ombr md fouling and wetting are recognised as drawbacks in particular applications despite the excellent performance the application of classical porous md is highlighted as the main concern that leads to poor separation performances this review highlights the possibility of applying dense membrane to push forward md applications for wastewater treatment the development of self standing and composite dense md and their performances in applications of wastewater treatment are summarized and discussed the operational parameters affecting md performance in the treatment of various types of feed are presented to analyze the robustness and the critical shortcomings of dense md for wastewater treatment challenges such as the trade off between mechanical integrity and permeate flux lack of studies using real wastewater for long term operation stability of the dense membrane against rigorous operation conditions complicated fabrication methods and the use of harsh chemicals during the fabrication of dense md membranes are elaborated for further improvement in the development of dense md membranes for wastewater treatment keywords dense membrane membrane distillation wastewater treatment fouling wetting 1 introduction industrialization and the increase in the world s population have led to the scarcity of fresh water and propelled the urge to find new dependable freshwater sources 1 seawater desalination is one of the most promising methods 2 3 and has been increasingly popular with a 9 annual growth in desalination plants worldwide from 2010 to 2016 4 5 membrane distillation md has drawn much attention as an emerging technology for desalination and is particularly suitable for treating hypersaline solution e g seawater reverse osmosis swro brine in the md process a hydrophobic porous membrane acts as a physical barrier between the hot feed and the permeate stream while the vapor pressure gradient drives the transport of volatile compounds from the feed side to the permeate side as the need for trans membrane pressure is eliminated in md the operation is insensitive to the feed concentration 6 in addition md operates at low temperatures under feed water s boiling point to generate the water vapor and can utilize low grade or renewable thermal energy 7 various configurations such as direct contact membrane distillation dcmd air gap membrane distillation agmd sweep gas membrane distillation sgmd and vacuum membrane distillation vmd have been proposed which notably differ in the approach of generating the driving force 1 fig 1 the hot feed solution is continuously circulated in all configurations and in direct contact with the membrane surface in dcmd the cold permeate stream is circulated and in direct contact with the opposite side of the membrane the temperature difference between the hot feed solution and the cold permeate stream creates vapor pressure difference and induces the transport of water vapor from the feed to the permeate a stagnant air gap exists between the membrane and a cool condensing plate in the agmd water vapor from the feed solution passes across the air gap before being condensed at the surface of the condensing plate in sgmd cold and inert sweep gas is circulated at the permeate side to carry the water vapor to an external condenser in vmd the vapor pressure difference is created by applying vacuum pressure at the permeate side water vapor in the permeate side condenses outside the membrane module further improvements in the md configurations such as material gap membrane distillation mgmd conductive gap membrane distillation cgmd multi stage membrane distillation msmd have been made and rigorously studied to improve the md performance and energy efficiency as described in 9 porous polymeric membranes such as polypropylene pp polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 10 11 are widely used for md application the utilization of non woven fabric as the support material for pvdf membrane was studied in vmd configuration at low feed temperature it was indicated that an up to 15 times increase in the permeate flux was achieved when a suitable non woven fabric material was used compared to that of unsupported pvdf membrane 12 higher flux in the supported membranes was due to the ability of the support layer to prevent the pore from collapsing while 42 thickness reduction after the md test occurred in the unsupported pvdf membrane little change in membrane thickness was observed in the supported membranes after similar test 13 the membrane materials and structures have been modified to form superhydrophobic omniphobic and janus membranes to improve md performance and increase membrane robustness against various feed water porous polymeric nanocomposite membrane structure with tuned hydrophobicity also has gained much interest a novel hydrophobic hydrophilic polyetherimide composite membrane was fabricated by adding self synthesized surface modifying macromolecules smms containing fluorine the modified smms pei membranes exhibited higher dcmd flux than the commercially available ptfe membrane with more than 99 nacl rejection 14 further improvement was attempted by varying the stoichiometric molar ratio of the smms components the results suggested that the highest flux was obtained by smms pei membrane with methylene bis p phenyl isocyanate mdi poly dimethylsiloxane pdms zonyl ba ltm bal ratio of 3 2 2 due to the lower liquid entry pressure and larger macrovoids 15 the addition of multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts and sio2 on the pvdf membrane also led to enhanced vmd performance synergistic effects of the two additives led to the increase of overall porosity by mwncts and growth of macrovoids by sio2 even though the effect of mwcnt was more prominent 16 nanocomposite pvdf ptfe membrane was also demonstrated promising performance in the vmd test with the salt rejection of more than 99 9 the addition of 40 ptfe into the pvdf membrane increased the permeate flux by 464 than the pristine pvdf membrane 17 another nanoparticle such as titanium dioxide tio2 has also remarkably improved the pvdf membrane flux in the vmd test compared to the pristine pvdf membrane more than ten times higher flux was achieved in the test using pvdf membrane loaded with 5 wt and 2 wt of hydrophilic and hydrophobic tio2 nanoparticles respectively 18 further optimization of the nanocomposite membrane was conducted by incorporating 7 nm tio2 200 nm tio2 and hydrophilic and hydrophobic sio2 into the pvdf membrane promising results were obtained with the addition of 200 nm tio2 nanoparticles at 2 concentration 19 carbon based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have also gained much interest due to their high specific surface area strength vapor transport and tuneable hydrophobicity membranes coated by carbon based nanomaterials exhibit flux enhancement and show anti fouling properties detailed discussion on the carbon based membrane for md has been systematically reviewed 20 in the past few years wastewater treatment and reclamation by using md have gained increasing interest 21 fig 2 with increasingly stringent environmental regulations md appears as an advanced technique to remove hazardous pollutants prior to wastewater disposal to the environment moreover in the treatment of specific wastewater the unique features of md to only allow the passage of volatile components through the pores leads to the simultaneous production of water and concentration of recyclable materials 22 the quality of the product water produced in md varies and depends on the composition of the wastewater hence subsequent water treatment processes are often required to obtain high grade water nevertheless life cycle analyses indicate that in cases where surface water is not readily available water production via wastewater reclamation requires less energy and are economically more feasible than desalination 23 24 md application has been reported for the treatment of metallurgical wastewater 25 oil containing wastewater 26 textile wastewater 27 28 olive mill wastewater 29 30 municipal wastewater 31 33 pharmaceutical wastewater 34 petrochemical wastewater 35 etc table 1 in a study using agmd to treat wastewater containing high boron concentrations of 2500 6200 mg l high boron rejection of more than 99 was achieved due to the superior selectivity of md towards volatile compounds 36 treatment of oily wastewater by md has also drawn much attention as md is considered a cleaner technology than conventional oily wastewater treatment methods 37 treatment of petroleum in water emulsion with surfactant was conducted using composite pda pvdf hollow fiber membrane test showed md s robust performance with no fouling or wetting as indicated by stable flux and superior salt rejection of 99 99 38 highly polluted and hazardous spent caustic was treated by nanofibrous styrene acrylonitrile san membrane in dcmd configuration compared to the commercially available ptfe membrane the san membrane possessed higher surface hydrophobicity and lower permeate flux chemical oxygen demand and sulfide removal of 99 2 and 99 99 were reported 39 not limited to the lab scale md for wastewater treatment has also been explored in pilot scale with a capacity of 8 m3 d to decontaminate synthetic radioactive wastewater a stable permeate flux of 1 5 l m2 h was maintained for more than 70 h and notably low permeate conductivity of less than 1 μs cm was achieved throughout the process 40 techno economic analysis of md for wastewater treatment has also been conducted in treating shale gas produced water by dcmd the thermal energy cost for md operation was high as in general md processes to concentrate the produced water from tds of 10 to 30 the total cost was 5 70 m3 feed a significant reduction in the total cost can be obtained by operating the md with locally available waste heat 41 in another study recovering freshwater from anaerobically digested effluents by hybrid forward osmosis fo md low permeate flux was a significant concern for the technology industrialization and resulted in water production cost of 1 29 m3 the analysis indicated that the technology would only be technically feasible and economically attractive if the permeate flux could exceed 14 l m2 h 42 however in the treatment of nano electronic wastewater the application of agmd coupled with a low grade heat source showed 95 lower wastewater treatment cost than the existing electrochemical method 43 despite promising results there are severe operational issues associated with md for wastewater treatment limiting its commercial implementation due to inefficient energy utilization and poor produced water quality in this paper fundamental challenges impeding the performance of md for wastewater treatment are discussed strategies to overcome the aforementioned issues are continuously explored and optimized to address md operation for more complicated wastewater and push forward its commercial implementation in producing freshwater accordingly the status of the corresponding resolution development is comprehensively reviewed in particular the application of hybrid md to produce high grade freshwater from wastewater is elaborated furthermore the concept of dense md to replace the conventional porous md and its applicability on the treatment of wastewater is presented lastly this paper provides perspectives on future work for the commercialization of md for wastewater treatment and an outlook on the strategies for further improvement 2 challenges and current resolution strategies in md for wastewater treatment 2 1 temperature polarization and concentration polarization as in general md operation temperature polarization and concentration polarization occur due to the simultaneous mass and heat transfer during the process 1 the transport of water vapor in the heated feed solution through the membrane pores brings latent heat in the feed solution and results in lower feed temperature on the feed side boundary layer than in the bulk feed solution heat is transferred to the permeate side increasing the permeate temperature in the boundary layer of the permeate side the latter can be neglected in the vmd operation due to the extremely low pressure at the permeate side but still applicable in other md configurations 2 the severity of temperature polarization is referred to as temperature polarization coefficient tpc which describes the ratio of the actual temperature difference between the feed and permeate to the theoretical value 50 in practice the tpc for md ranges between 0 2 and 0 99 depending on the membrane module s configuration and operational conditions 52 54 the water vapor transfer from the feed side to the permeate side also enhances non volatile component concentration on the feed side boundary layer referred to as concentration polarization both temperature polarization and concentration polarization are unfavourable in md application as they result in a lower driving force for mass transport and consequently reduce the water flux 54 it was reported that the temperature polarization and concentration polarization became more severe at high feed temperature fig 3 a and b indicating less energy efficient operations while many studies concluded that the influence of concentration polarization on the driving force is much less significant compared to the temperature polarization the former shows a detrimental effect as it may induce rapid fouling on the membrane surface due to the concentration of non volatile components 55 efforts on alleviating temperature polarization and concentration polarization have been made which particularly focus on the enhancement of fluid shear rate on the membrane surface by modifying operation conditions and module configurations 9 such as employing higher feed and or permeate flow rate fig 3 c 56 transverse vibration of membrane module 57 the addition of spacers into the membrane module 58 and feed aeration 59 in a study on decontamination of uranium containing radioactive wastewater with vmd the rise of the feed velocity in the range of 0 3 0 7 m s resulted in increases in the shear velocity on the feed boundary layer thus reducing the boundary layer thickness as indicated by the enhancement of tpc and permeate flux 60 similar results on the effect of feed velocity on the permeate flux have also been reported in the study of textile dye wastewater treatment by dcmd 61 other novel methods to overcome temperature polarization have been proposed these include the utilization of the direct heating system such as localized photothermal fig 3 d joule fig 3 e and induction heating fig 3 f at which the heated membrane surface is contributed on the higher temperature on feed on the membrane surface than that in the bulk solution 62 67 the modification of membrane surface by thermally conductive nanomaterial coating to enhance the heat dispersion along the membrane has also been reported to increase the permeate flux 68 these novel strategies alleviate the temperature polarization and may result in reduced energy requirement of md the application of photothermal md utilizing various materials has been researched and developed nanofluids such as graphite ag ni multi walled carbon nanotubes and titanium nitride absorb light the utilization of titanium nitride in solar powered md tests showed remarkable flux and solar energy utilization 69 in another study polydimethylsiloxane carbon nanotube pvdf membrane was tested in solar md the results indicated 60 production efficiency 99 9 salt rejection and increased permeate flux with reduced total energy consumption 70 in a vmd test using ag nanoparticles incorporated in pvdf membrane negligible temperature polarization was observed throughout the test the permeate flux of the photothermal membrane was 1100 higher than the pristine pvdf membrane 71 despite the promising performance of photothermal md research on these novel strategies were conducted with saline water as feed further studies on the applicability of the strategies in wastewater treatment should be done 2 2 fouling fouling is an inevitable challenge in long term md for wastewater treatment the deposition of unwanted non volatile materials on the membrane surface and or within the membrane pores results in additional thermal and hydraulic resistance as well as the increase of temperature polarization depending on the components fouling in md may have porous or dense structure the dense fouling layer increases thermal and hydraulic resistance while the porous one only increases thermal resistance nevertheless fouling lead to reductions in permeate flux and compromised process efficiency wastewaters are complex solutions containing volatile organic compounds surfactants particulates colloidal substances sludge oily substances organic and inorganic salts etc 74 77 with specific characteristics and interaction with membrane surfaces the type of fouling can be varied in general fouling in md for wastewater treatment can be categorized into 1 organic fouling 2 inorganic fouling 3 biofouling and 4 colloidal fouling 77 fig 4 organic fouling occurs due to the adsorption of natural organic matter nom which mostly consists of humic acids the deposited nom may penetrate inside the membrane pores resulting in partial or complete blocking it can also create a gel like structure on the membrane surface 78 hydrophobic membrane surface is favourable for humic adsorption particularly at low ph 79 this highlight the organic fouling concern in md operation however humic acid deposition on pva pvdf composite membranes was investigated and physical cleaning using milli q water effectively removed the humic fouling layer on the membrane surface 80 another study reported that the organic substances in the feed solution penetrated membrane pores without wetting due to the adsorption desorption foulant migration through the membrane pores 81 inorganic fouling is the deposition of poorly soluble inorganic salts on the membrane surface and is significant in treating saline wastewater 82 the salts may undergo surface crystallization or bulk crystallization 83 84 salt crystallization on the membrane surface is categorized as heterogeneous crystallization mechanism which is thermodynamically easier to occur than homogeneous bulk crystallization in order for crystallization to occur the feed solution needs to be in supersaturated condition in md the concentration polarization may aggravate the heterogeneous crystallization as the concentration of the non volatile material on the membrane surface is higher than that in the bulk solution the most common inorganic fouling in md is caco3 caso4 calcium phosphate and silicate 85 however the compounds can be varied depending on the composition of the treated water other salts such as baso4 srso4 mgcl2 mgso4 ferric oxide iron oxide potentially form the inorganic fouling as well 86 the presence of microorganisms in the wastewater leads to the formation of biofouling compared to other membrane processes the biofouling in md is less severe due to the elevated feed temperature however biofouling formation was reported in previous research and the consequence of biofouling cannot be neglected 87 during biofilm formation microorganisms secrete an extracellular polymeric substance eps which acts as a physical barrier to biocides making its control extremely challenging 88 significant flux decline due to the biofouling has been reported in the membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr process at which membrane cleaning and process optimization were required to control the biofouling 90 colloidal fouling may consist of high molecular weight substances such as polysaccharides lipoproteins oils etc in depth discussions on fouling in md has been extensively reviewed 21 88 90 the occurrence of individual fouling mechanism during md operation using real wastewater is extremely rare 21 as shown in fig 5 combined fouling mechanisms often lead to a synergistic effect where certain fouling mechanisms exacerbate the deposition of other foulants leading to surface fouling and pore blocking it is important to note that fouling deposition depends on feed characteristics ph ionic strength foulant concentration molecular size charge membrane characteristics roughness hydrophobicity surface charge surface functional groups operation conditions cross flow velocity and feed temperature and the interactions among these factors 88 94 the foulant and membrane surface charges are essential as similar foulant and membrane surface charges lead to electrostatic repulsion and reduce fouling deposition 95 the interaction between membrane surfaces and solutes also plays an important role in determining the extent of membrane fouling it is known that hydrophobic interaction between solutes or microbial cells and membrane material is frequently addressed as one of the predominant causes of fouling therefore membrane fouling is more severe with hydrophobic than hydrophilic membranes 96 however it was indicated that polysaccharide and protein fouling were more severe at wastewater treatment tests using hydrophobic membranes than hydrophilic membranes 87 due to hydrophobic hydrophilic interactions between the foulant and membrane surface another study showed that the feed containing hydrophobic contaminants such as oils showed strong interaction with the hydrophobic membrane surface 98 fouling compaction was observed at tests with higher feed velocity due to higher permeate flux and rapid increase in the concentration of the non volatile solute on the membrane surface contributing to rapid flux decline 61 efforts to alleviate fouling in md are varied and should be chosen according to the foulant components fouling can be controlled by conducting feed pretreatment and membrane cleaning feed pre treatments in md are relatively straightforward particularly compared to other membrane processes such as ro pre treatment strategies that have been studied in the literature include adsorption coagulation flocculation advanced oxidation processes aop pre filtration and scale inhibitor 99 adsorption is widely used to remove the heavy metals dyes and organic matter in the feed solution and is considered a cost effective pre treatment strategy in the treatment of shale oil and gas produced water silica scaling was prevented by adsorption using 15 ppm al2 so4 3 18h2o in combination with precipitation softening to achieve 80 water recovery feed turbidity was reduced by 94 and toxic contaminants in the feed water such as benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes was removed by more than 95 100 in another work adsorption by activated carbon or amberlite ira67 was conducted to remove the acetic acid in lignocellulosic hydrolysates feed prior to vmd operation 101 in md application removing suspended solids and colloids in the feed solution by coagulation flocculation to prevent fouling has proven effective poly aluminium chloride pacl and polyacrylamide pam were used as coagulants for coke wastewater treatment prior to md operation increased rejection was reported in the study 102 when the feed solution was pre treated by flocculation sedimentation mitigation of organic fouling was also reported in the shale gas wastewater md test 103 the application of aop in md is limited but evident for fouling control fenton oxidation process electrochemical oxidation and photocatalytic process have been studied as the pre treatment process for md and promising results have been reported 104 105 the use of scale inhibitors as the internal water pre treatment is highly effective in controlling inorganic scaling several scale inhibitors such as pretreat plus 0400 and pretreat plus y2k 106 polyphosphate based compounds 107 and carboxyline cmi 108 have been utilized as pre treatment and were able to prevent scaling during the md process in another study polyaspartate pasp polyepoxysuccinate pesa polyacrylic acid sodium salt paas copolymer of maleic and acrylic acid ma aa aminotris methylene phosphonic acid atmp and 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 bis phosphonic acid hedp were also reported to prevent the crystallization of caco3 109 even with the aid of pre treatment fouling is inevitable in md and membrane cleaning is essential to be periodically conducted to remove the fouling from the membrane surface chemical cleaning using alkaline solution i e naocl and naoh can be conducted to target biofouling and organic fouling while acidic solutions are effective for inorganic fouling removal 99 however membrane damage occurred due to the prolonged and repetitive exposure of the membrane to the chemicals 110 111 in addition treatment or disposal of the chemical solution is required and increases the process s operational cost physical cleaning can be conducted by backwash 112 113 feed aeration 57 114 vibration 115 116 and water flushing 117 118 even though physical cleaning can alleviate the flux decline it is not as effective as chemical cleaning and requires additional energy to conduct the physical processes 99 2 3 wetting in the occurrence of wetting md cannot maintain its hydrophobicity and loses its unique properties to retain the transport of non volatile components in the feed side to the permeate side depending on the severity of the pore wetting fig 6 wetting leads to either permeate flux reduction or poor permeate quality in the case of surface wetting the feed solution penetrates the entrance of the pores increasing the mass transfer resistance for water vapor to pass through the pores and resulting in lower flux however as the surface wetting progresses the membrane suffers from partial wetting which results in some of the pores being thoroughly wetted by the feed solution as the feed solution freely passes through some of the pores in the aqueous phase the permeate quality is compromised and the presence of non volatile solutes in the permeate stream can be detected 119 furthermore most membrane pores are fully wetted in the fully wetting stage the membrane loses its separation ability indicated by the high concentration of non volatile solutes in the permeate stream 120 wetting can be induced by foulant deposition due to the hydrophilic properties of the foulant in wastewater 122 in addition wetting occurs when the transmembrane hydrostatic pressure surpasses the liquid entry pressure lep 120 low surface tension amphiphilic contaminants in the industrial wastewater such as surfactants can result in pore wetting by lowering the surface tension of the feed solution and saturating the hydrophobic pore surface with surfactants 123 other substances commonly contained in the wastewater such as proteins 124 oily substances 125 and biomass can readily be adsorbed on hydrophobic membranes and cause pore wetting in a study on integrated md bioreactor mdbr which employed pvdf flat sheet membrane millipore durapore gvhp for water reclamation from wastewater containing carbohydrates and proteins the reactor failed to perform well due to biofouling and flux decline even though the flux could be maintained at more than 6 8 l m2 h 8 lower than the average md flux for at least 13 days 126 inorganic fouling may also lead to pore wetting as the crystals on the membrane surface reduce the membrane hydrophobicity and can further grow inside the membrane pores parallel with the viscous flow of the permeate repetitive physical and chemical cleaning to remove the fouling layer on the membrane surface indirectly lead to pore wetting the chemical used during the cleaning can degrade and change the morphology of the membrane surface 57 operational parameters such as the temperature and flow rate of hot and cold streams have also been reported to affect pore wetting the pore wetting can be delayed by setting high feed temperature low temperature of the cold stream and low flow rate of both hot and cold stream 127 in addition membranes subjected to intermittent operation experienced rapid pore wetting due to the deposition of dried out foulant on the membrane surface 128 porous hydrophobic membranes in md have always been associated with the wetting challenge in a study by gryta et al polypropylene pp hollow fiber membranes were utilized in a dcmd with tap water as the feed solution partial wetting was observed during long term operation despite the low concentration of non volatile solute and low surface tension contaminants in the tap water 129 studies on the modification of the membrane structure and material have been widely conducted to reduce the risk of pore wetting membrane pore size should be optimized by considering the trade off between the high liquid entry pressure and permeate flux during the operation typically pore diameters of around 0 3 μm are recommended 130 even though a smaller pore diameter could further alleviate membrane wetting to prevent fouling induced wetting it was indicated that reducing the surface pore size porosity was more effective than increasing the surface hydrophobicity 131 the membrane material modification development highlighted superhydrophobic md with lower surface energy than the classical hydrophobic membrane the surface of the superhydrophobic membranes is roughened to form a hierarchical structure by combining inorganic materials such as silica and titanium oxide 132 133 in a recent study β feooh nanorods are incorporated in a polydopamine pda polyethyleneimine pei pvdf membrane via in situ mineralization to form a superhydrophobic membrane that achieved contact angle and sliding angle of 162 and 5 7 respectively dcmd tests with synthetic dye solution containing a mixture of nacl and sodium dodecyl sulphate sds resulted in a stable flux of 15 lmh without wetting for 60 h of operation 134 a novel membrane fabrication technique spray assisted nonsolvent induced phase separation sanips has been developed to fabricate a self cleaning superhydrophobic pvdf membrane the multilevel polymeric crystalline structure was formed due to the air spraying before the phase inversion in water the membrane performance was tested in a dcmd set up with a synthetic dye solution containing a mixture of 10 nacl and 2000 ppm rose bengal dye as the feed solution high flux and more than 99 9 salt rejection were observed during a 100 hour test indicating its remarkably superior hydrophobicity 135 however the wetting resistance property of the superhydrophobic membrane was compromised with the presence of low surface tension substances and surface active reagents in the feed solution 22 omniphobic membranes which combine the low surface energy material and re entrant structure on the membrane surface are repellent to high and low surface tension liquids 136 137 previous studies demonstrated successful attempts to fabricate omniphobic membranes by grafting nanoparticles to create the re entrant structure and functionalization of the surface by fluoroalkyl silane fas to lower the surface energy the modified membrane exhibited superior performance compared to the virgin pvdf membrane in the test using synthetic oily wastewater containing sds hexadecane and nacl however a slight increase in the permeate conductivity was observed after 400 min of test 138 chung et al reported the modification of pvdf membrane by nano silica deposition and teflon af 2400 coating wetting resistance of the modified membrane was observed for 420 min test using a mixture of nacl and sds as the feed solution partial wetting was observed towards the end of the tests as indicated by the reduced permeate flux 136 janus membranes have also been widely explored as an alternative to md for wastewater treatment materials of opposing wettability are integrated to form two bounded layers that prevent the adsorption of non polar substances on the membrane surface 139 140 the hydrophilic top surface of the janus membranes is crucial as it determines the membrane s performance in alleviating wetting and maintaining the permeate flux many studies indicated delayed wetting using janus membranes 141 142 however contradicting results have also been reported 143 144 3 hybrid md for wastewater treatment hybrid mds for wastewater treatment was developed by combining specific processes that complement each other to enhance the overall performance of the treatment process e g obtain higher grade water for specific utilization to reduce the energy consumption nutrient recovery among others membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr and md assisted osmotic membrane bioreactor have been widely explored and are referred to as high retention bioreactors 3 1 membrane distillation bioreactor mdbr membrane bioreactor mbr is one of the most prominent technologies to treat wastewater in conventional mbr microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf membrane is employed to separate the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss from the treated effluent either in submerged or in crossflow configuration 145 compared to conventional activated sludge the mbr benefits from the ability to control sludge retention time srt independently of hydraulic retention time hrt lower footprint and increased product water quality as indicated by low total organic carbon toc and negligible suspended solid 146 despite these advantages the presence of some organic substances particularly those that are poorly biodegradable and are of low molecular weight are detected in the mbr permeate with concentration similar to the supernatant in the bioreactor this affects product water quality and raises the requirement of downstream processing in addition the low organic retention time ort of the recalcitrant organic substances delay the acclimatization of the microorganisms longer start up time and or larger size of mbr are required to acclimatize the microorganism 147 in mdbr the pressure driven microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf is replaced by hydrophobic md which provides complete retention of the non volatile components such as salts microorganisms and non volatile organics producing high grade product water in a single step process studies on the application of mdbr are presented in table 2 the application of mdbr is of interest for industries with the availability of waste heat or heated effluent high overall organic removal efficiency of mdbr was reported and found comparable to those observed in municipal wastewater treatment by uf membrane bioreactor mbr reverse osmosis ro operation 155 as the temperature of the mdbr feed solution is elevated in the range of 30 80 c heat tolerant biomass is required to operate the bioreactor in the submerged configuration the md modules are immersed in the feed tank and in direct contact with the mlss fig 7 a in the aerobic bioreactor air is introduced to the bioreactor to provide oxygen for the microorganisms and continuously scour the membrane surface to limit temperature polarization concentration polarization and fouling formation in a proof of concept study pvdf and ptfe membranes were utilized in submerged mdbr to treat mlss with concentration ranging from 1 5 5 7 g l the process achieved sustainable operation of 15 days and the permeate flux of 5 2 l m2 h the reported total organic carbon concentration toc 0 2 0 7 ppm and chemical oxygen demand cod 0 0 5 ppm in the permeate stream were extremely low particularly compared to those in mf uf mbr operation 147 removing trace organic compounds from wastewater is essential to meet the more stringent environmental regulations of wastewater discharge and water reuse 158 using a crossflow mdbr configuration the removal of 25 trace organic compounds in synthetic wastewater was investigated high rejection of the trace organic compounds 99 and nitrogen 96 was achieved regardless of the deteriorating performance of mdbr due to salinity build up in the feed solution 151 in an anaerobic mdbr operation fig 7 b 26 trace organic compounds were added to the feed solution representing the waste from pharmaceutical personal care products endocrine disruptors and industrial chemicals md served as the complement to the anaerobic mbr to enhance the removal of these compounds in addition the anaerobic mdbr also acted as an energy producing system by producing biogas in the range of 0 3 0 5 g cod with methane concentration of 65 the anaerobic mbr could remove 70 of specific trace organic compounds although the removal of ketoprofen primidone ibuprofen diclofenac carbamazepine gemfibrozil simazine atrazine and diuron were as low as 15 25 trace organic compounds removal by further treatment using md is reported to improve the overall rejection to 76 which indicated the ability of md to remove compounds that were poorly removed by anaerobic mbr however due to the superior rejection of the md module organic matter and inorganic salts were accumulated in the feed solution and resulted in severe fouling 152 it is also important to note that the stability of an anaerobic bioreactor is a function of alkalinity which maintains suitable ph for microorganisms md provides crucial advantages by rejecting most alkaline salts thus retaining the alkalinity in the system 159 despite the robustness of mdbr in removing compounds of interest fouling remains a challenge for the operation specifically when the tests are conducted at high permeate flux earlier study comparing md and mdbr indicated 19 higher md flux than the mdbr flux at similar fouling layer thickness this highlights the influence of fouling layer structure composition and porosity on the permeate flux apart from the fouling layer thickness 150 in mdbr organic inorganic and biofouling occur simultaneously the organic fouling layers tend to deposit at the early stage as in the conventional mbr and provide nutrients for the biofilm 160 the excreted extracellular polymeric substances eps in the biofilm interact with the inorganic ions and affect the crystallization of the inorganic salt by trapping and concentrating the ions 161 the combination of inorganic fouling and microbial eps formed an impermeable crust in mdbr leading to a more rapid decline in the permeate flux fouling in mdbr also showed more detrimental effect on the permeate flux than the mbr it increased mass transfer resistance and elevated heat transfer resistance by reducing the vapor pressure gradient in the mdbr system 149 162 feed temperature was reported to significantly affect fouling in a submerged thermophilic anaerobic mdbr fig 7 c with 50 flux reduction after operating at 65 c feed temperature for seven days at feed temperature as low as 45 c minimum flux reduction was observed with a biogas yield of 0 14 l g cod 107 despite the low flux wastewater treatment by thermophilic microorganisms has been proven to delay wetting in mdbr by 1 7 3 6 times compared to the md at similar operation conditions and feed composition except for no biomass in md feed however aggravated wetting was still observed after 22 days of operation due to the transport of amphiphilic organic compounds 150 3 2 osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr md another attractive alternative for wastewater treatment is the integration of an osmotic based membrane bioreactor with md in ombr forward osmosis fo membrane produces clean water products with lower energy consumption and fouling tendency than conventional mbr 163 164 the highly concentrated solution e g nacl cacl2 sucrose mgcl2 ch3coona mg ch3coo 2 165 166 is circulated as the draw solution ds in the permeate side of the fo membrane to create the osmotic pressure gradient which acts as the driving force for water transport from the feed side to the permeate side as the operation progresses the draw solution concentration reduces and results in lower water flux across the membrane in many studies md has been suggested as the regeneration process of the draw solution with a salt rejection of higher than 99 7 167 168 to maintain the driving force of the fo operation fig 8 a in this configuration the draw solution of fo acts as the feed in md and high quality water is produced as the permeate of md 169 hybrid fo md has also been combined with an anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactor afbr to improve the removal efficiency of nutrients in the bioreactor such as ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus using nacl or mgcl2 as the draw solution 99 of phosphorus was retained in the bioreactor by the fo membrane 171 173 however it was reported that only 80 of ammonia rejection could be achieved and accumulation of ammonia in the draw solution was observed 174 in addition as fo utilized a semipermeable membrane the salt back diffusion from the draw solution to the feed side was unavoidable and is one of its significant drawbacks 175 further draw solution treatment by md indicated improved nutrient removal with more than 85 ammonia nitrogen and less than 6 mg l chemical oxygen demand in the md permeate dense fouling consisting of mainly biofouling was observed on the fo membrane and physical cleaning was ineffective to recover the permeability of the membrane on the md membrane however the fouling was mild and only consisted of inorganic scale due to the exclusion of organic materials by fo prior to the md operation 176 recently the removal of pharmaceutically active compound phac and estrogenic activity from the wastewater using an anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor was investigated the hybrid fo md in a single membrane module was immersed in the bioreactor inoculated with anaerobic sludge to a final mlvss concentration of 10 g l fig 8 b in this configuration the draw solution was diluted by the fo permeate while simultaneously being concentrated by the md municipal wastewater containing seven phacs and estrogenic activity were fed to the bioreactor using 2 mol l nacl as the draw solution the overall removal of phacs was 96 even though trace amounts of betamethasone fluconazole and prednisone were still detected in the distillate of md 170 using a similar configuration it was found that fouling occurred in both fo and md membranes in fo membranes the fouling was due to the salinity build up inside the bioreactor that enhanced the eps production while in md membranes accumulation of organic materials in the fo ds aggravated the fouling 177 4 recent development of dense membrane for anti wetting and anti fouling md to address the fouling and wetting challenge the possibility of utilizing dense membranes instead of porous membranes has been investigated the absence of pores in the dense membrane is considered pivotal in resisting fouling and wetting the application of dense md dates back to 1968 when dense silicone rubber was used 178 comparison of microporous hydrophobic pp membrane liqui cel x 50 g478 celgard and dense silicone rubber hollow fiber was performed using 3 5 nacl as the feed at a similar membrane thickness of 40 μm an air sweep vmd test was conducted at a feed temperature of 291 295 k the dense silicon membrane exhibited 20 lower flux than the porous pp membrane but prevented the feed penetration to the permeate stream 179 to date research on dense membranes is almost exclusively conducted in the field of desalination despite the more challenging fouling and wetting in wastewater treatment though more limited than the porous membrane the development of dense md membranes has attracted more attention lately as shown in table 3 dense md membranes can be categorized into self standing and composite ones each with advantages and disadvantages 4 1 self standing dense membrane distillation studies on self standing dense md membranes have been carried out using self manufactured flat sheet pvdf membranes the membrane porosities varied from 0 dense membrane to 70 by adjusting the fabrication methods at similar vmd setup and operation conditions the performance of the membranes was investigated in tests using pure water and a mixture of chloroform water as the feed solution results indicated that the permeate flux of the dense membrane was highly dependent on membrane thickness more than 60 reduction in the permeate flux was observed at increased membrane thickness from 38 μm to 110 μm comparing the permeate flux of the dense membrane and porous membrane it was emphasized that higher flux was conferred with porous membranes with increased flux at tests with higher porosity however in the chloroform water separation test the dense membrane exhibited a significantly higher chloroform water separation factor which indicated better chloroform enrichment in the permeate side given that the membrane material used in this study was hydrophobic 192 another study on the dense silicone rubber membrane with 40 μm membrane thickness also showed agreement with previous work as the permeate flux of the dense membrane was significantly lower than that of porous pp pvdf polyethylene pe membranes 193 depending on the separation purposes and permeating components the self standing dense md membranes can be made of hydrophobic or hydrophilic materials hydrophobic materials can be chosen to separate water from a solution in contrast hydrophilic materials separate organic components from an aqueous organic solution or organic organic solutions in a recent study a sulfonated pentablock terpolymer nexar membrane was fabricated and tested for desalination with 32 g l nacl as the feed solution permeate flux of 3 32 lmh and a salt removal of 99 5 were achieved the low permeate flux obtained in the test resulted from the thickness of the dense membrane further study on composite membranes where the nexar membrane acts as a thin dense top layer should be further explored 194 in other applications nonporous polyamide pa membranes have been employed in water treatment to reject carcinogenic components such as n nitrosodimethylamine ndma from potable water 195 nonporous membranes have also been utilized in the removal of volatile organic compounds vocs such as btex a mixture of benzene ethylbenzene toluene and xylenes for the treatment of vapor phase waste streams btex removal in the test using the dense silicone membrane was higher than that obtained using a microporous membrane in addition the microporous membrane experienced significant flux reduction associated with pore blocking by biomass and water vapor condensation inside the porous structure 196 recently self standing dense md membranes were modeling was conducted to investigate the optimum membrane thickness that could be competitive with the productivity of the porous membrane membranes as thin as 1 0 0 2 μm were able to produce as much permeate as the conventional porous membrane used for md application however the mechanical integrity of these particular membranes can be compromised in depth research on fabricating ultra thin self standing dense membranes is essential 197 4 2 composite dense membrane distillation the development of composite dense md has attracted much attention to tackle the trade off between mechanical integrity and permeate flux which has emerged as the fundamental drawbacks of self standing dense md application while the porous support layers are mainly hydrophobic membranes classically used in md the dense top layer can be made of hydrophobic or hydrophilic materials fig 9 the hydrophilic hydrophobic arrangement of the composite dense md is also widely acknowledged as janus membrane the preparation of a composite membrane by evaporation deposition of a poly vinyl alcohol pva dense layer on top of a dense pp and pvdf has been investigated the fabricated membranes were applied in the separation of ethanol water mixture results showed that high selectivity with moderate flux or moderate selectivity with high flux could be obtained however additional surface treatments during the membrane fabrication step were crucial to improve the integrity of the dense top layer 198 composite dense membranes have also been utilized in osmotic distillation applications in terms of separation and transport mechanisms osmotic distillation is identical to md with both using a porous hydrophobic membrane that acts as a selective barrier for water vapor the driving force for water vapor transport in membrane distillation is generated by the temperature difference between the feed solution and permeate stream but in osmotic distillation it is generated by the difference in water activity in the feed solution and draw solution stream 199 dense polyvinyl alcohol pva hydrogel layer was coated on top of porous pp pe celgard 2500 pvdf durapore gvsp millipore and umhwpe upvp millipore membrane osmotic distillation tests using 0 2 0 5 and 1 wt of limolene oil in water dispersions as the feed solutions indicated that the addition of a top layer had remarkable effects on the flux with good stability while uncoated membranes were instantly wetted the composite membrane showed stable and comparable flux for 24 h of operation 200 in another study a composite alginate hydrogel ptfe membrane was fabricated to treat oily feed surface active agent containing solution in an osmotic distillation application results also suggested outstanding wetting resistance at least for a limited time 201 202 in the last decade research on composite dense md membranes has increased as the application of md for more complex solutions arises bell et al prepared a thin film composite tfc polyelectrolyte pvdf membrane which prohibited pore wetting and reduced adsorption of organic substances on the membrane surface tests in dcmd configuration showed that the tfc membranes exhibited only a slight reduction in permeate flux compared to virgin pvdf membrane due to the high water permeability provided by a 2 μm thin dense polyelectrolyte layer 203 other studies by an et al 204 focus on fabricating a high performance hierarchical fibrous composite hfc membrane to acquire a high water flux while maintaining a high salt rejection in md for desalination the hfc membrane comprised a 3 μm thin active dense layer of small poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropylene ph nanofibers porous support layer of large poly ethylene terephthalate pet microfibers salt rejection of 99 9 and an outstanding permeate flux of 79 l m2 h were obtained in the dcmd tests using 3 5 nacl as the feed solution at a feed temperature of 65 c 204 the fabrication of other hydrophilic hydrophobic md was also conducted using layer by layer assembly of cationic polyethyleneimine and anionic poly sodium 4 styrene sulfonate polyelectrolytes on porous pvdf substrate fig 10 a the number of polyelectrolyte layers determined the anti wetting property of the developed membrane a remarkably thin dense top layer of 48 nm was obtained and resulted in 16 l m2 h permeate flux compared to the virgin pvdf membrane the permeate of the modified membrane was approximately 20 reduced in the dcmd test with a mixture of nacl and sds as the feed solution the modified membrane exhibited excellent anti wetting property indicated by 99 salt rejection during 36 h of operation however the pristine membrane was instantly wetted and showed no salt rejection after 3 h of operation 140 the composite polyurethane pu ptfe c ptfe membrane was also tested to treat synthetic wastewater containing 2 g l nacl and 40 mg l sds or 100 g l ethanol using a dcmd configuration in the test with nacl and ethanol as the feed solution the c ptfe membrane exhibited 10 lower flux than the virgin ptfe due to the doubled c ptfe membrane thickness with thickness of 14 20 μm and 28 μm for virgin ptfe and c ptfe respectively however the c ptfe membrane showed good wetting resistance as the permeate conductivity was extremely low at 60 water recovery the membrane performance in tests using nacl and sds as the feed solution was in agreement with that using nacl and ethanol though the permeate conductivity slightly increased towards the end of the tests the wetting mechanism in the virgin ptfe membrane is related to the interaction between the membrane material and the wetting agents both ethanol and sds consist of alkyl chains and hydrophilic hydroxyl or sulphate groups which can simultaneously interact with the membrane surface and the feed solution resulting in reduced membrane hydrophobicity and induced wetting fig 10 b 189 other modifications of composite dense md membranes incorporated nanocomposites to the md membrane to modify the membrane surface to form a rough and hierarchically structured membrane surface which is the mechanism to create superhydrophobic membranes a mixture of polydimethylsiloxane pdms and hydrophobic sio2 nanoparticles was sprayed on a pvdf flat sheet membrane to form a dense top layer fig 11 a varying the sio2 concentration from 0 to 1 5 wt the water contact angle of the membrane increased from 107 to 156 in a dcmd test using 3 5 wt nacl solution as feed the modified membrane exhibited slightly lower flux than the pristine membrane yet possessed better anti wetting property as indicated by low less than 50 μs cm permeate conductivity in tests with a higher feed concentration of 25 wt nacl the modified membrane consistently showed 99 99 rejection rate for 180 h of operation and more significant fouling repellent property fig 11 b and c 205 5 factors affecting dense md operation several operational factors related to the feed and permeate such as temperature flow rate and concentration significantly affect dense md performance as in porous md this has been extensively reviewed 1 206 and is only briefly discussed in this study the increment in feed temperature and the reduction in the permeate temperature proportionally increase the permeate flux this is attributed to the enhancement of the vapor pressure gradient between the feed and permeate streams 207 208 in addition the increases in temperature gradient also lead to an increase in diffusion coefficient for vapor transport 209 however it requires more thermal energy supply to increase the feed temperature and reduce the permeate temperature a concern being raised in many md applications 210 the higher flow rate of the feed and permeate flows fundamentally reduces the stagnant heat and mass transfer boundary layer on the membrane surface this results in less severe temperature polarization and concentration polarization which considerably reduce the vapor pressure gradient across the membrane 207 211 it is important to note that a higher flow rate raises the electrical energy need of the operation in the case of osmotic assisted md omd the vapor pressure gradient is also generated with the aid of highly concentrated osmotic agent draw solution flowing in the permeate stream high concentration draw solution results in the reduced water activity and lower vapor pressure of the draw solution thus increasing the permeate flux 212 similarly the effect of feed concentration on the permeate flux is in agreement with the draw solution concentration due to the reduction of water activity at higher feed concentration 213 214 in a study using composite alginic acid ptfe membrane the concentration of orange oil in the feed solution varied from 0 2 0 8 wt and lower permeate flux was obtained at higher oil concentrations in a test using dbs in water as the feed solution reasonable flux was achieved at dbs concentration of 0 1 wt however at dbs concentration of 0 3 and 0 5 wt major flux reduction was observed after 4 h of operation due to dbs fouling the flux decline was followed by a rapid flux increase in the test with 0 5 wt dbs solution indicating membrane wet out 190 in applying dense membrane for wastewater treatment the feed composition affects the membrane performance in terms of the permeate flux and quality c ptfe membrane exhibited superior performance in tests using mixtures of ethanol and water as the feed solution compared to the pristine ptfe membrane only 5 flux reduction was observed the permeate conductivity was less than 3 μs cm throughout the tests while a comparable trend of the permeate flux was observed the permeate conductivity increased with the increment of water recovery in the test using water sds mixture fig 12 a 189 for composite dense md applications membrane orientation also substantially affected the system s performance in a test with 1 m nacl feed solution the membrane was tested with the dense layer facing the hot feed solution and the opposite orientation fig 12 d a high permeate flux of 26 l m2 h was achieved at the dense feed orientation while a much lower permeate flux of 6 2 l m2h was obtained using the opposite configuration this was attributed to pore wetting and water penetration into the porous structure in the porous feed orientation water penetration was not observed in the dense feed orientation as the surface tension of the water used in the permeate stream was higher than that of nacl solution 72 8 mn m compared to 68 mn m partial wetting in the porous feed configuration created a stagnant feed layer inside the membrane pores out of reach of the feed hydrodynamic mixing and led to a pronounced temperature polarization 215 membrane characteristics also play an important role in md performance in composite dense membrane assembled layer by layer it was noted that the number of polyelectrolyte layers determined the anti wetting properties of the membrane rather than the surface charge or surface wettability as indicated in fig 12 c the number of pei pss polyelectrolyte lbl deposition varied from one to three the tests were conducted using mixtures of sds and nacl solution at which the sds concentration increased gradually the dense composite membrane with one and two layers exhibited wetting once the sds concentration was 0 2 and 0 3 mm respectively in contrast the composite membrane with three layers did not exhibit any wetting even at 0 4 mm sds demonstrating wetting resistance during the 36 h of operation while these membranes showed comparable contact angle and surface charge the outstanding wetting resistance was attributed to the size exclusion mechanism of the dense layer that can reject the sds molecules 140 furthermore the membrane thickness is also an important aspect that affects the performance of the dense md the flux reduces as the thickness of the dense layer increases due to increased mass transfer resistance 188 6 challenges on dense membrane distillation for wastewater treatment mass transfer resistance in a dense membrane is much higher than that in a porous membrane of the same thickness due to the absence of pores the effective diffusion coefficients of the transporting molecules are indeed lower by several orders of magnitude than that observed in a porous membrane in a porous membrane reduction of the pore diameter results in increased resistance to vapor transport further pore diameter reduction to minimal significantly reduces vapor permeability 216 although the application of dense membranes can avoid membrane wetting as have been proven experimentally 217 mass transfer mechanism in dense md is similar to thermo pervaporation which is based on solution diffusion theory there are three sequential steps involved i selective sorption of the volatile substances in the feed solution into the membrane ii selective diffusion of the volatile substances through the membrane and iii desorption of the volatile substance into the vapor phase on the permeate side 218 in the solution diffusion mechanism the transport of a gas vapor or liquid through a dense nonporous membrane is determined by the compound s solubility and diffusivity in the solution diffusion model when the hydrostatic pressure within a membrane is assumed uniform and the chemical potential gradient across the membrane is expressed only as a function of concentration gradient i e the flux j i of component i can be described by the following equation 6 1 j i d i d c i dx d i c if m c ip m l where d i is the diffusion coefficient of component i in the membrane c if m is the concentration of component i at the feed membrane interface c ip m is the concentration of component i at the membrane permeate interface and l is the membrane thickness in wastewater treatment and reclamation the substances to be transported through the membrane is water eq 1 emphasizes that the flux significantly depends on the physicochemical properties of the membrane such as thickness the affinity to water and the diffusion coefficient of water through the membrane 219 in a composite membrane consisting of a selective top layer active layer and a porous support layer the separation process occurs in the active layer of the membrane while the support layer acts to increase the mechanical strength of the membrane the mass transfer mechanism in the composite membranes combines transport in the dense and porous membrane at the dense top layer water is transported following the solution diffusion mechanism once entering the porous layer water vaporizes due to the low water vapor pressure in the permeate side and is transported following the poiseuille flow ordinary molecular diffusion knudsen diffusion or the combination of these mechanisms mass transfer in porous md membrane has been extensively discussed in many studies 1 220 221 the mass transfer resistance during the transport which directly affects the permeate flux is mainly attributed to the dense top layer the support layer s mass transfer resistance is low due to the high gas diffusion coefficient towards the low pressure permeate side 217 in addition high porosities of the support layer reduce the additional mass transfer resistance for the permeating compounds 222 zeng et al described the mass transfer resistance in asymmetric membranes as shown in fig 13 the resistance is divided into three regions 1 the nonporous membrane as the nonporous layer l 1 2 the nonporous membrane material in the pore structure in the supporting layer l 0 and 3 the porous sub layer as the support layer for the active layer of the membrane l s 223 the total mass transfer resistance can be written as follow 2 r t r i r o r o r o r o r s where r i is the resistance of the nonporous membrane r o is the resistance of the dense material in the second region r o is the resistance of the porous material in the second region and r s is the resistance of the porous sublayer considering the significantly higher resistance in the dense top layer the permeate flux j i can be expressed in terms of resistance as follow 3 j i p i a p l p l p i a p r i where p i is the permeability coefficient a is the effective surface area p the partial pressure difference l the membrane thickness as described in eqs 1 and 3 permeate flux in dense md both self standing and composite are dictated by the membrane thickness the increase in membrane thickness leads to the addition of the resistance to mass transport due to the lengthen path for vapor transport 224 khayet et al suggested self standing dense membrane thickness of less than 60 μm to achieve low mass transfer resistance 192 however such thickness was not feasible as the mechanical stability was very low and the risk for defects were high 130 in dense composite membranes wetting of membrane pores can be avoided without compromising membrane integrity to reduce the overall mass transfer resistance the membrane should be manufactured based on several key points high porosity and pore diameter of the support layer and minimum thickness of both top layer and support layer the mass transfer coefficient of a particular component in the support layer has a constant value and is a function of the component s molecular weight 217 however it is important to note that the wide pores of the support layer may also cause high mass transfer resistance when the composite dense md membrane is fabricated by coating dilute polymer solution on top of the support layer the top layer solution can penetrate through and clog the pores once they are solidified and indirectly increase the dense layer thickness techniques such as the utilization of pre wetting agents have already been developed to prevent this penetration the pores of the support layer can be filled with a pre wetting agent before applying the coating polymer the pre wetting agent can then be removed from the membrane structure by evaporation and or solvent exchange 225 a composite polydimethylsiloxane pdms membrane supported by cellulose acetate ca was prepared by the pre wetting method the membrane structure contained crosslinked pdms and was treated in a vacuum oven at 60 c for 4 h to complete the cross linking procedure this technique successfully reduced the mass transfer resistance due to the intrusion of the pdms solution into the porous substrate during the fabrication of the composite membrane membrane with a top layer thickness of 8 μm was achieved and exhibited higher overall mass transfer coefficient than the thicker membranes 226 in another study filling the pores with highly viscous materials or creating the pores only after deposition of the top layer has been proven to reduce the polymer penetration and pore clogging 222 in the application of dense md membranes careful considerations of the membrane materials are required to obtain the membranes wetting prevention property while minimizing the mass transfer resistance 229 in research by lizeth et al a mathematical model was used to study various types of dense membrane materials with different permeability coefficients that have the potential to be fabricated as dense md membranes table 3 the polyethylene oxide and poly butylene terephtalate peo pbt polymers used in the study provided higher permeability coefficient than commercial polymers such as psf and ca 227 it is also worth noting that as the transport in the dense layer is based on the solution diffusion mechanism the hydrophobicity of the top layer material is crucial when hydrophobic material is used as the top layer water cannot pass through the membrane due to its hydrophobicity this is indicated by the significantly lower permeability of pp compared to other materials in table 4 also the nonporous structure of the top layer restricts vapor transport and leads to poor permeate flux 7 conclusion and future outlook with increasingly more stringent environmental standards the ability of md to remove pollutants from various wastewaters prior to disposal has gained increasing attention in general the operational challenges for md in wastewater treatment are identical to other md applications i e temperature polarization concentration polarization fouling and wetting to mitigate these challenges strategies such as enhancing fluid shear rate on the membrane surface and applying a direct heating system have been applied however fouling and wetting in md for wastewater treatment is more pronounced than in other applications due to the complex nature of the contaminants in the feed this highlights the need for further investigation of specifically tuned membrane properties and structures the application of novel janus membranes and omniphobic membranes has alleviated fouling and wetting problems although these mainly were tested for a short time period contradictory results have also been obtained in research on treating different feed solutions the unique features of md that allows only passage of volatile components through the pores have led to the exploration of hybrid md i e high retention mbr mdbr and ombr md for producing high grade water reducing energy consumption and enhancing nutrient recovery the excellent performance of mdbr and ombr md has been reported with superior retention of non volatile solutes from the feed lower energy requirement and lower carbon footprint compared to conventional mf uf mbr in the case of anaerobic operation simultaneous biogas production is another attractive potential however fouling on the md membrane was one of the drawbacks in both mdbr and ombr md operations at the same time wetting was reported in the mdbr operation compromising the product water quality further studies on the application of novel md membranes such as janus and omniphobic membranes for mdbr and ombr md applications are required dense membrane has demonstrated great potential in alleviating wetting in md for wastewater treatment fouling in dense md does not induce wetting due to the absence of membrane pores however fouling still poses a major concern as it results in a significant reduction in permeate flux and process efficiency it is noteworthy that the applications of dense md membranes were mostly tested for synthetic feed simulating textile wastewater or a mixture of sds and salts in the tests using synthetic wastewater the extent of fouling deposition is not definitive its behaviour may differ greatly from real wastewater as other contaminants might aggravate the membrane fouling therefore the utilization of modified dense membrane for real wastewater solutions is required fouling deposition and wetting in real applications should be further studied the tests of dense md reported in the literature have been conducted on the lab scale for a short period of time to forward the application of dense md membranes on an industrial scale a long term performance test should be conducted to investigate the durability and integrity of the dense md despite the recent advancements in membrane fabrication discussed above significant improvements in the performance test are required study on the effect of operation conditions such as feed and permeate flow rate temperature permeate vacuum pressure etc is still lacking in porous md applications the operation condition directly affects the membrane performance in terms of permeate flux and quality fouling deposition rate and wetting severity similar behaviours are expected in dense md applications however this should be further examined it is also important to note that the operation condition might affect the dense membrane stability particularly composite dense md membranes fabricated by coating operation wise the flux of dense md membranes is lower than that of porous md membranes the fabrication of dense md membranes with unconventional materials is of interest to increase the permeate flux for the self standing dense md selecting membrane material with outstanding permeability is crucial to reduce the mass transfer resistance another strategy to minimise mass transfer resistance in self standing dense md membranes is the fabrication of ultra thin self standing dense md with a thickness of less than 5 μm the mechanical integrity and defect formation are still the main drawbacks of ultra thin dense membrane fabrication particularly in md applications composite dense md membrane is a promising alternative for cost effective operation the fabrication should be facile and straightforward unfortunately the approaches to fabricate composite dense md membranes are complex and time consuming since chemicals that are harmful to the environment are also extensively used during the preparation of the membranes there is an urgent need for greener methodology to be adopted

13158,as an emerging sustainable process knowledge of microalgal bacterial granular sludge mbgs for the treatment of complex organic wastewater is limited which hinders its further technical application in this work the mbgs process for the disposal of wastewater with simple and complex organic substances was evaluated in a comparable manner the results showed that the average cod nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies for wastewater containing simple complex organic matter were 75 2 84 9 96 6 89 3 and 76 2 85 3 respectively it has been found that complex organics can promote granule size growth and bacteria growth as evidenced by the decrease in chlorophyll content and cellular carbon nitrogen ratio compared to simple organics chloroflexi became the dominant bacterium of mbgs for potential contribution to the breakdown of complex organic matter in addition the settling property of mbgs has been improved and the extracellular protein of mbgs has been strengthened by complex organic substances during a one cycle reaction co2 levels could be reduced by about 300 ppm suggesting that a carbon neutral target for wastewater treatment by mbgs is possible this research complements knowledge of mbgs for real wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microalgal bacterial granular sludge complex organics simple organics chloroflexi carbon neutral 1 introduction nowadays controlling carbon emission is recognized as one of the great challenges facing humans as global carbon dioxide concentration has increased by 44 since 1959 1 carbon emission can cause global warming leading to extreme weather conditions 2 rising sea levels 3 and infectious diseases 4 which threaten human survival to slow global warming more and more nations have recently committed to being carbon neutral by 2050 5 as one of the carbon emitters wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been noticed 6 thus the energy water carbon nexus was proposed as a topic in the field of wastewater treatment 7 the widespread conventional activated sludge cas process in current wwtps which generates carbon dioxide can result from the biological oxidation of pollutants in wastewater 8 which can hardly do justice to the carbon neutral goal as a carbon scavenger and hydropower resource factory the microalgal bacterial granular sludge mbgs process was developed and attracted widespread attention due to its low greenhouse gas emission and energy consumption 8 9 this is due to the efficient microalgal bacterial assimilation of pollutants motivated by light while the organics and nutrients are fixed in the biomass rather than discharged as gas pollutants 8 in addition the mbgs shows the potential to use greenhouse gases e g carbon dioxide 10 and methane 11 therefore the mbgs process can probably achieve the goal of carbon neutrality for municipal wastewater treatment although the mbgs process in terms of process optimization 12 the nutrient removal mechanism 13 mbgs cultivation 14 and the response to emerging pollutants 15 most laboratory scale studies were based on simulated wastewater containing simple organics such as sodium acetate 16 17 glucose 18 sucrose 19 etc however there are few reports of real municipal wastewater treatment with complex organics by mbgs 20 while the carbon emission from wastewater treatment of complex organics using the mbgs process are still unclear which hinders its further application this study compared the pollutants removal performance granule characteristics and microbial community of the mbgs process for synthetic municipal wastewater containing simple organics and complex organics in the meantime the mechanisms of the mbgs process for the breakdown of complex organic substances were clarified and the reduction of carbon emission was presented it is expected that this work will add knowledge of mbgs for real wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic wastewater simulated complex organic wastewater with the following composition was used 21 22 250 0 mg l glucose 80 0 mg l peptone 55 0 mg l meat extract 15 0 mg l urea 15 4 mg l kh2po4 10 0 mg l feso4 7h2o 20 0 mg l nahco3 10 0 mg l cacl2 50 0 mg l mgso4 7h2o and 1 ml l trace element solution 23 the main components of the simple organic wastewater were 527 0 mg l naac 95 5 mg l nh4cl 15 4 mg l kh2po4 with the concentrations of feso4 7h2o nahco3 cacl2 mgso4 7h2o and trace element solution corresponding with complex organic wastewater the initial ph was adjusted to about 7 2 and the initial dissolved oxygen do concentration was about 4 0 mg l the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen and phosphorus were approximately 400 mg l 25 mg l and 3 5 mg l respectively 2 2 experimental procedure the mbgs used in this study was cultured 13 with a mean size of 0 9 mm and a 5 min sludge volume index svi5 of 34 5 ml g the experiment was carried out in parallel in 200 ml glass reactors with an effective volume of 120 ml at a light intensity of 500 10 μ mol m 2 s 1 and temperature of about 25 c the initial volatile suspended solids vss concentrations of mbgs were approximately 4 7 g l with a reaction time of 8 h influent and effluent samples were collected three cycles a day and passed through a 0 45 μm filter for further analysis while the gases were also collected for analysis at the end of the experiment the cyclic experiment was carried out in 50 ml glass reactors with an effective volume of 30 ml which was similar to the 200 ml reactors in terms of reactor configuration 2 3 analytical methods the standard methods 24 were used to measure cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n tn tp 5 min sludge volume index svi5 and volatile suspended solids vss and the chlorophyll content of mbgs was extracted and measured 25 a ysi5100 do meter yellow springs oh usa and a starter3100 ph meter ohaus new jersey usa were used to measure the do concentration and ph values the granule size of mbgs was analyzed by imagej 26 the carbon and nitrogen content was measured by elemental analysis elemantar vario el cube germany the carbon dioxide concentration was analyzed by the gas chromatograph 7890a agilent technologies usa the heat extraction method 27 was used to extract extracellular polymeric substances eps from mgbs which were subsequently analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy f 7100 hitachi high technology corp japan the experimental data was analyzed by anova by ibm spss 26 0 and p 0 05 indicated that there was a significant difference 2 4 microbial community analysis the mag bind soil dna kit omega ym biotech co ltd was used to extract the total dna then the universal primers 338f 806r for prokaryotes and 528f 706r for eukaryotes were used to amplify the 16s rrna and 18s rrna gene fragments respectively 23 finally the illumina miseq platform was used for sequencing and the sequencing data analyses were performed as reported 28 the raw sequencing data is available from the ncbi under accession no prjna 789125 3 results and discussion 3 1 complex organics promoted the removal of cod and phosphorus by mbgs it was observed that complex organics appeared to facilitate the removal of cod and phosphorus through the mbgs process and simple organics appeared to facilitate the removal of nitrogen as shown in fig 1a the average removals of cod nitrogen and phosphorus for both simple and complex organic wastewater were over 75 85 and 75 respectively the average cod and phosphorus removals were 84 9 and 85 3 for complex organics by mbgs both of which were higher than those for simple organics of 75 2 and 76 2 respectively p 0 05 in addition the pollutants removal rate for cod and phosphorus appeared to be faster among the complex organic substances than with the simple organic substances as suggested by fig 1b for example the removal efficiency of phosphorus within 1 h was up to 73 7 for complex organic substances while it was only 14 8 for simple organic substances fig 1b this might be attributed to that phosphorus was first adsorbed by eps and then broken down by microorganisms 29 in contrast the average nitrogen removal for simple organics was 96 6 which was higher than that of 89 3 for complex organics by mbgs p 0 05 this was likely because the complex organic wastewater contained a complex source of nitrogen in peptone meat extract and urea it should be noted that nitrate and nitrite were less than 0 5 mg l in this study suggesting that nitrogen removal mainly resulted from microbial assimilation 13 30 which was different from the dissimilation route 31 32 in addition the do concentration exceeded 10 0 mg l at the end of a cycle to ensure that the bacteria had enough oxygen to break down organic matter for both simple and complex organic wastewater treatment by mbgs process 3 2 complex organics promoted the granule size and bacteria growth of mbgs figs 2 and s1 showed that the granule size could increase for both complex and simple organic wastewater and that the complex organics was more conducive to increasing the granule size than simple organics as shown in fig 2a the simple organics could have more granules in the granule size range of 0 5 to 2 0 mm than complex organics however the complex organics could have more mbgs with a granule size over 2 0 mm than simple organics specifically about a quarter of the mbgs exceeded 2 5 mm for mbgs cultured with complex organic matter in addition it can be seen that the uniformity of granule size of mbgs cultured with complex organics was decreased which might be due to the massive secretion of eps that promoted the microbial flocculation and aggregation form larger granules 33 34 the average granule size of mbgs for complex organic wastewater treatment and simple organic wastewater treatment was 1 6 mm and 1 2 mm respectively fig 2b the increase in granule size could be linked to bacteria growth as the larger mbgs could have a higher bacteria to microalgae ratio 9 35 the chlorophyll content could be the estimate of the microalgae content 36 fig 3a showed that the chlorophyll content of mbgs cultured with complex organics was much lower than that of simple organics suggesting that complex organics could dramatically promote bacteria growth in addition the elemental compositions could also provide evidence that complex organics favored bacteria growth the cellular c n ratio of microalgae and bacteria was 7 1 and 4 3 respectively based on the empirical formulas 10 37 as shown in fig 2b the cellular c n ratio was 5 2 for simple organics and 4 9 for complex organics of the mbgs at the end of the experiment which implies that the mass content of the microalgae was about 0 32 for simple organics and 0 21 for complex organics these indicated a relatively lower content of microalgae than bacteria in larger mbgs due to a smaller specific surface area for light 9 38 in addition a higher chl a chl b ratio was found in mbgs cultured with complex organics than simple organics suggesting that greater proportions of eukaryotic microalgae were decreased compared to prokaryotic microalgae it has been reported that the growth of bacteria possesses the potential to degrade varied refractory organic pollutants 39 40 as for the prokaryotes it can be seen from fig 4 that the growth of chloroflexi including chloroflexia and anaerolineae was significantly promoted by complex organics according to the reports 41 42 chloroflexi prefers the ingestion of complex organic substances e g sugar which should play a key role in breaking down complex organic matter in fact chloroflexi could also be predominant microbes in cas 28 which favored the breakdown of complex organics in addition no nitrifying bacteria were detected which further suggested nitrogen assimilation by mbgs for both simple and complex organic substances in eukaryotes the predominant microalgae chlorophyta fig 4a could also potentially contribute to the removal for both simple and complex organic substances 43 44 which corresponded to the results of the chlorophyll content as in fig 3a 3 3 complex organics improved the sludge settling property of mbgs the mbgs cultured with complex organic wastewater could have a lower svi5 value compared to simple organic wastewater fig 5a this could be attributed to the excessive eps secretion in complex organic substances since eps could maintain the granule stability and promote granule growth 45 47 in this study the eps content of mbgs cultured with complex organic matter was about five times higher than that of simple organic matter fig 5b specifically the pn content of mbgs cultured with complex organic substances was more than fifteen times higher than that of simple organic substances this indicated that excess extracelluar protein was enriched in eps of mbgs from the media with complex organics a further analysis by eem showed that all aromatic proteins soluble microbial products and humic acid substances of eps were dramatically improved by complex organic substances compared to simple organic substances fig s2 these products could contribute to both mbgs growth and settlement ability 6 45 for example aromatic proteins could promote cells aggregation 46 in addition it has been speculated that excessive eps secretion of mbgs cultured with complex organic wastewater could originate from the dead microalgae cells 3 4 pollutants removal mechanisms of mbgs due to environmental stress mbgs changed the microalgal bacterial community and lowered the microalgae to bacteria ratio as evidenced by the decline in the chlorophyll content and cellular carbon nitrogen ratio of mbgs meanwhile the substantial increase in eps particularly pn promoted the increase in granule size and improved the settling property of mbgs 45 chloroflexi increased and became the dominant bacterium that contributed to the breakdown of complex organic substances at the same time nitrogen and phosphorus were also assimilated by mbgs cultured with complex organic matter overall the mbgs process could adapt to complex organic matter by adapting the microbial community as well as the physico chemical properties to achieve efficient pollutants removal and biomass production it should also be noted that the reduction in carbon emission could also be achieved in this study through the mbgs process during a one cycle reaction the co2 content could be reduced by about 300 ppm for both simple and complex organic compounds based on the experimental results table s1 if additional co2 was added the mbgs might achieve a carbon neutral or even carbon negative goal for real municipal wastewater treatment 9 10 since the mbgs dealt efficiently with complex organic substances as observed in this study 4 conclusions the performance of the mbgs process for wastewater treatment with simple and complex organic substances was assessed it was found that the complex organics promoted the increase in granule size and bacteria growth of mbgs as evidenced by the decrease in chlorophyll content and cellular carbon nitrogen ratio the pn content of eps was dramatically generated by mbgs cultivated with complex organics which favored the increase in granule size and settling property the amount of chloroflexi was significantly increased which facilitated the breakdown of complex organic substances additionally the mbgs process could consume carbon dioxide during this process suggesting that a carbon neutral target for real wastewater treatment is possible

13158,as an emerging sustainable process knowledge of microalgal bacterial granular sludge mbgs for the treatment of complex organic wastewater is limited which hinders its further technical application in this work the mbgs process for the disposal of wastewater with simple and complex organic substances was evaluated in a comparable manner the results showed that the average cod nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies for wastewater containing simple complex organic matter were 75 2 84 9 96 6 89 3 and 76 2 85 3 respectively it has been found that complex organics can promote granule size growth and bacteria growth as evidenced by the decrease in chlorophyll content and cellular carbon nitrogen ratio compared to simple organics chloroflexi became the dominant bacterium of mbgs for potential contribution to the breakdown of complex organic matter in addition the settling property of mbgs has been improved and the extracellular protein of mbgs has been strengthened by complex organic substances during a one cycle reaction co2 levels could be reduced by about 300 ppm suggesting that a carbon neutral target for wastewater treatment by mbgs is possible this research complements knowledge of mbgs for real wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microalgal bacterial granular sludge complex organics simple organics chloroflexi carbon neutral 1 introduction nowadays controlling carbon emission is recognized as one of the great challenges facing humans as global carbon dioxide concentration has increased by 44 since 1959 1 carbon emission can cause global warming leading to extreme weather conditions 2 rising sea levels 3 and infectious diseases 4 which threaten human survival to slow global warming more and more nations have recently committed to being carbon neutral by 2050 5 as one of the carbon emitters wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been noticed 6 thus the energy water carbon nexus was proposed as a topic in the field of wastewater treatment 7 the widespread conventional activated sludge cas process in current wwtps which generates carbon dioxide can result from the biological oxidation of pollutants in wastewater 8 which can hardly do justice to the carbon neutral goal as a carbon scavenger and hydropower resource factory the microalgal bacterial granular sludge mbgs process was developed and attracted widespread attention due to its low greenhouse gas emission and energy consumption 8 9 this is due to the efficient microalgal bacterial assimilation of pollutants motivated by light while the organics and nutrients are fixed in the biomass rather than discharged as gas pollutants 8 in addition the mbgs shows the potential to use greenhouse gases e g carbon dioxide 10 and methane 11 therefore the mbgs process can probably achieve the goal of carbon neutrality for municipal wastewater treatment although the mbgs process in terms of process optimization 12 the nutrient removal mechanism 13 mbgs cultivation 14 and the response to emerging pollutants 15 most laboratory scale studies were based on simulated wastewater containing simple organics such as sodium acetate 16 17 glucose 18 sucrose 19 etc however there are few reports of real municipal wastewater treatment with complex organics by mbgs 20 while the carbon emission from wastewater treatment of complex organics using the mbgs process are still unclear which hinders its further application this study compared the pollutants removal performance granule characteristics and microbial community of the mbgs process for synthetic municipal wastewater containing simple organics and complex organics in the meantime the mechanisms of the mbgs process for the breakdown of complex organic substances were clarified and the reduction of carbon emission was presented it is expected that this work will add knowledge of mbgs for real wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic wastewater simulated complex organic wastewater with the following composition was used 21 22 250 0 mg l glucose 80 0 mg l peptone 55 0 mg l meat extract 15 0 mg l urea 15 4 mg l kh2po4 10 0 mg l feso4 7h2o 20 0 mg l nahco3 10 0 mg l cacl2 50 0 mg l mgso4 7h2o and 1 ml l trace element solution 23 the main components of the simple organic wastewater were 527 0 mg l naac 95 5 mg l nh4cl 15 4 mg l kh2po4 with the concentrations of feso4 7h2o nahco3 cacl2 mgso4 7h2o and trace element solution corresponding with complex organic wastewater the initial ph was adjusted to about 7 2 and the initial dissolved oxygen do concentration was about 4 0 mg l the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen and phosphorus were approximately 400 mg l 25 mg l and 3 5 mg l respectively 2 2 experimental procedure the mbgs used in this study was cultured 13 with a mean size of 0 9 mm and a 5 min sludge volume index svi5 of 34 5 ml g the experiment was carried out in parallel in 200 ml glass reactors with an effective volume of 120 ml at a light intensity of 500 10 μ mol m 2 s 1 and temperature of about 25 c the initial volatile suspended solids vss concentrations of mbgs were approximately 4 7 g l with a reaction time of 8 h influent and effluent samples were collected three cycles a day and passed through a 0 45 μm filter for further analysis while the gases were also collected for analysis at the end of the experiment the cyclic experiment was carried out in 50 ml glass reactors with an effective volume of 30 ml which was similar to the 200 ml reactors in terms of reactor configuration 2 3 analytical methods the standard methods 24 were used to measure cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n tn tp 5 min sludge volume index svi5 and volatile suspended solids vss and the chlorophyll content of mbgs was extracted and measured 25 a ysi5100 do meter yellow springs oh usa and a starter3100 ph meter ohaus new jersey usa were used to measure the do concentration and ph values the granule size of mbgs was analyzed by imagej 26 the carbon and nitrogen content was measured by elemental analysis elemantar vario el cube germany the carbon dioxide concentration was analyzed by the gas chromatograph 7890a agilent technologies usa the heat extraction method 27 was used to extract extracellular polymeric substances eps from mgbs which were subsequently analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy f 7100 hitachi high technology corp japan the experimental data was analyzed by anova by ibm spss 26 0 and p 0 05 indicated that there was a significant difference 2 4 microbial community analysis the mag bind soil dna kit omega ym biotech co ltd was used to extract the total dna then the universal primers 338f 806r for prokaryotes and 528f 706r for eukaryotes were used to amplify the 16s rrna and 18s rrna gene fragments respectively 23 finally the illumina miseq platform was used for sequencing and the sequencing data analyses were performed as reported 28 the raw sequencing data is available from the ncbi under accession no prjna 789125 3 results and discussion 3 1 complex organics promoted the removal of cod and phosphorus by mbgs it was observed that complex organics appeared to facilitate the removal of cod and phosphorus through the mbgs process and simple organics appeared to facilitate the removal of nitrogen as shown in fig 1a the average removals of cod nitrogen and phosphorus for both simple and complex organic wastewater were over 75 85 and 75 respectively the average cod and phosphorus removals were 84 9 and 85 3 for complex organics by mbgs both of which were higher than those for simple organics of 75 2 and 76 2 respectively p 0 05 in addition the pollutants removal rate for cod and phosphorus appeared to be faster among the complex organic substances than with the simple organic substances as suggested by fig 1b for example the removal efficiency of phosphorus within 1 h was up to 73 7 for complex organic substances while it was only 14 8 for simple organic substances fig 1b this might be attributed to that phosphorus was first adsorbed by eps and then broken down by microorganisms 29 in contrast the average nitrogen removal for simple organics was 96 6 which was higher than that of 89 3 for complex organics by mbgs p 0 05 this was likely because the complex organic wastewater contained a complex source of nitrogen in peptone meat extract and urea it should be noted that nitrate and nitrite were less than 0 5 mg l in this study suggesting that nitrogen removal mainly resulted from microbial assimilation 13 30 which was different from the dissimilation route 31 32 in addition the do concentration exceeded 10 0 mg l at the end of a cycle to ensure that the bacteria had enough oxygen to break down organic matter for both simple and complex organic wastewater treatment by mbgs process 3 2 complex organics promoted the granule size and bacteria growth of mbgs figs 2 and s1 showed that the granule size could increase for both complex and simple organic wastewater and that the complex organics was more conducive to increasing the granule size than simple organics as shown in fig 2a the simple organics could have more granules in the granule size range of 0 5 to 2 0 mm than complex organics however the complex organics could have more mbgs with a granule size over 2 0 mm than simple organics specifically about a quarter of the mbgs exceeded 2 5 mm for mbgs cultured with complex organic matter in addition it can be seen that the uniformity of granule size of mbgs cultured with complex organics was decreased which might be due to the massive secretion of eps that promoted the microbial flocculation and aggregation form larger granules 33 34 the average granule size of mbgs for complex organic wastewater treatment and simple organic wastewater treatment was 1 6 mm and 1 2 mm respectively fig 2b the increase in granule size could be linked to bacteria growth as the larger mbgs could have a higher bacteria to microalgae ratio 9 35 the chlorophyll content could be the estimate of the microalgae content 36 fig 3a showed that the chlorophyll content of mbgs cultured with complex organics was much lower than that of simple organics suggesting that complex organics could dramatically promote bacteria growth in addition the elemental compositions could also provide evidence that complex organics favored bacteria growth the cellular c n ratio of microalgae and bacteria was 7 1 and 4 3 respectively based on the empirical formulas 10 37 as shown in fig 2b the cellular c n ratio was 5 2 for simple organics and 4 9 for complex organics of the mbgs at the end of the experiment which implies that the mass content of the microalgae was about 0 32 for simple organics and 0 21 for complex organics these indicated a relatively lower content of microalgae than bacteria in larger mbgs due to a smaller specific surface area for light 9 38 in addition a higher chl a chl b ratio was found in mbgs cultured with complex organics than simple organics suggesting that greater proportions of eukaryotic microalgae were decreased compared to prokaryotic microalgae it has been reported that the growth of bacteria possesses the potential to degrade varied refractory organic pollutants 39 40 as for the prokaryotes it can be seen from fig 4 that the growth of chloroflexi including chloroflexia and anaerolineae was significantly promoted by complex organics according to the reports 41 42 chloroflexi prefers the ingestion of complex organic substances e g sugar which should play a key role in breaking down complex organic matter in fact chloroflexi could also be predominant microbes in cas 28 which favored the breakdown of complex organics in addition no nitrifying bacteria were detected which further suggested nitrogen assimilation by mbgs for both simple and complex organic substances in eukaryotes the predominant microalgae chlorophyta fig 4a could also potentially contribute to the removal for both simple and complex organic substances 43 44 which corresponded to the results of the chlorophyll content as in fig 3a 3 3 complex organics improved the sludge settling property of mbgs the mbgs cultured with complex organic wastewater could have a lower svi5 value compared to simple organic wastewater fig 5a this could be attributed to the excessive eps secretion in complex organic substances since eps could maintain the granule stability and promote granule growth 45 47 in this study the eps content of mbgs cultured with complex organic matter was about five times higher than that of simple organic matter fig 5b specifically the pn content of mbgs cultured with complex organic substances was more than fifteen times higher than that of simple organic substances this indicated that excess extracelluar protein was enriched in eps of mbgs from the media with complex organics a further analysis by eem showed that all aromatic proteins soluble microbial products and humic acid substances of eps were dramatically improved by complex organic substances compared to simple organic substances fig s2 these products could contribute to both mbgs growth and settlement ability 6 45 for example aromatic proteins could promote cells aggregation 46 in addition it has been speculated that excessive eps secretion of mbgs cultured with complex organic wastewater could originate from the dead microalgae cells 3 4 pollutants removal mechanisms of mbgs due to environmental stress mbgs changed the microalgal bacterial community and lowered the microalgae to bacteria ratio as evidenced by the decline in the chlorophyll content and cellular carbon nitrogen ratio of mbgs meanwhile the substantial increase in eps particularly pn promoted the increase in granule size and improved the settling property of mbgs 45 chloroflexi increased and became the dominant bacterium that contributed to the breakdown of complex organic substances at the same time nitrogen and phosphorus were also assimilated by mbgs cultured with complex organic matter overall the mbgs process could adapt to complex organic matter by adapting the microbial community as well as the physico chemical properties to achieve efficient pollutants removal and biomass production it should also be noted that the reduction in carbon emission could also be achieved in this study through the mbgs process during a one cycle reaction the co2 content could be reduced by about 300 ppm for both simple and complex organic compounds based on the experimental results table s1 if additional co2 was added the mbgs might achieve a carbon neutral or even carbon negative goal for real municipal wastewater treatment 9 10 since the mbgs dealt efficiently with complex organic substances as observed in this study 4 conclusions the performance of the mbgs process for wastewater treatment with simple and complex organic substances was assessed it was found that the complex organics promoted the increase in granule size and bacteria growth of mbgs as evidenced by the decrease in chlorophyll content and cellular carbon nitrogen ratio the pn content of eps was dramatically generated by mbgs cultivated with complex organics which favored the increase in granule size and settling property the amount of chloroflexi was significantly increased which facilitated the breakdown of complex organic substances additionally the mbgs process could consume carbon dioxide during this process suggesting that a carbon neutral target for real wastewater treatment is possible

13159,due to natural and production activities mercury contamination has become one of the major environmental problems in the world adsorption is one of the important means to solve this problem however most of the commercially available adsorbents exhibit relatively low adsorption capacity and slow kinetics therefore a novel 4 6 diamino 2 mercaptopyrimidine functionalised zr based metal organic framework uio 66 dmp was synthesised in this study the uio 66 dmp was characterised through x ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectrometry x ray photoelectron spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectrometry and thermogravimetric analysis the potential of the uio 66 dmp as a superior adsorbent for hg ii removal and the corresponding mechanisms were evaluated through batch experiments under different conditions and density functional theory calculations benefitting from its high specific surface area and multiple adsorption sites the maximum hg ii adsorption capacity achieved in this study was 822 00 mg g 1 which is the highest hg ii adsorption capacity reported to date in addition under the interference of ca ii cd ii co ii mg ii mn ii ni ii cr iii cu ii zn ii and other coexisting ions the uio 66 dmp could still maintain the high selective adsorption capacity for hg ii according to the characterization analysis and dft calculation results the adsorption of hg ii onto the uio 66 dmp was dependent on electrostatic and covalent interactions between metal ions and abundant functional groups on the uio 66 dmp surface graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords functionalization uio 66 4 6 diamino 2 mercaptopyrimidine adsorption mercury 1 introduction with the development of industry and technology the increased presence of heavy metals in water has received increasing attention due to their threats to the worldwide ecosystems and public health especially hg one of the most toxic heavy metals 1 3 hg is a volatile insoluble and mobile toxic element 4 it is widely used in electricity generation industrial production of materials such as chlor alkali plastics and electronic items and metallurgy 5 6 46 its increasing presence in water bodies poses a serious threat to ecosystems hg has been considered as one of the most toxic metals that can affect the health of human beings hg is widely distributed in water rocks and even in air most of the hg in water is present in the form of hg ii which causes great harm to the environment and human health 8 therefore removal of hg ii from wastewater is of great importance 9 to date various technologies such as chemical precipitation membrane separation biological treatment solvent extraction and adsorption 10 47 49 have been employed to remove hg ii from wastewater among these techniques adsorption utilising porous materials is extensively employed owing to its high efficiency low cost simple regeneration and simplicity of operation different adsorbents such as activated carbon graphene carbon nanotubes metal oxides polymers zeolites and biomass materials have been applied for the removal of hg ii 50 52 however some drawbacks such as low adsorption capacity poor selectivity and weak binding affinity limit the application of these adsorbents 53 55 therefore it is necessary to develop a novel adsorbent with excellent adsorption capacity good selectivity and high stability metal organic frameworks mofs are considered as one of the most promising options because of their extremely high surface area pore size tunability and customisable pore functionalisation 56 57 mofs are the hybrid organic inorganic materials with metal or metal clusters linked by organic ligands through coordination bonding among the mofs zr based mofs e g uio 66 with strong zro bond exhibits high stability and is considered as a potential adsorbent 58 however low adsorption capacity and poor selectivity limit its applications in adsorption chemical modification of the uio 66 nh2 with specific functional groups has been reported to be a promising strategy to improve its adsorption ability and selectivity for metal ions zhang et al 59 fabricated an efficient and redox active adsorbent uio 66 btu by modifying zr mof with bis thiourea the uio 66 btu showed significant adsorption ability and high selectivity towards au iii in the presence of various mixed ions in wastewater the improvement in adsorption performance was mainly attributed to the introduction of s containing functional groups aminabhavi et al 60 successfully synthesised a ethylenediamine functionalised zr based metal organic framework uio 66 eda the high adsorption capacity of the uio 66 eda is achieved through a strong interaction between metal ions and n sites of the functional groups in the mofs in conclusion functionalisation of uio 66 with sulfur or nitrogen can considerably improve its adsorption performance for metal ions providing a reliable solution for using mofs to treat hg containing wastewater herein we report a simple economic and expandable manufacture process of the uio 66 dmp 4 6 diamino 2 mercaptopyrimidine composite dmp is rich in n and s groups and it can be introduced to uio 66 nh2 through the schiff base reaction by using glutaraldehyde as the bridge the uio 66 dmp was used as an adsorbent for efficient removal of hg ii metal ions from water moreover the different influencing factors such as adsorption time ph adsorbent dosage temperature and coexistence of other metal ions were thoroughly investigated through batch experiments finally the adsorption mechanism and stability of the uio 66 dmp for hg ii were explored through characterization analysis and dft calculations 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all the reagents

hydrochloric acid and hydrochloric acid 36 0 38 0 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd moreover the solutions with different ph were prepared using naoh 0 1 mol l 1 and nitric acid 0 1 mol l 1 solutions and deionised water was prepared in the laboratory 2 2 adsorbent preparation the overall preparation process of uio 66 dmp is depicted in scheme 1 aa 0 6848 g zrcl4 0 63 g hydrochloric acid 10 ml and dmf 42 ml were added into a teflon lined autoclave and heated for 24 h at 393 k by using an electric oven the solid product uio 66 nh2 after cooling was recovered through centrifugation washed first with dmf and finally with acetone and dried 12 h 100 c under vacuum subsequently uio 66 nh2 4 g and gd 5 ml were added to 150 ml of anhydrous alcohol and the mixture was allowed to react at 353 k for 24 h uio 66 gd was prepared through centrifugation washing and vacuum drying finally 3 g of uio 66 gd and 3 g of dmp were mixed into 200 ml of dmf and then the mixture was stirred and allowed to react at 343 k for 24 h after centrifugation and washing the uio 66 dmp was obtained 2 3 characterization methods x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the adsorbent were determined using a powder diffractometer under cu kα λ 0 154 nm radiation fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra were recorded on a nicolet is50 america spectrometer the field emission scanning electron microscopic fe sem image was studied on the nova nano sem 250 from fei company america and spraying platinum before the sample test the element distribution was assessed using the x ray energy spectrometer eds on the phenom prox the netherlands the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were analysed using a surface area analyser asap 2460 to study the surface area and porosity of the adsorbents x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra were obtained through a thermo scientific k alpha usa at a vacuum of approximately 2 10 7 mbar 2 4 adsorption experiments the adsorption behaviour of hg ii on the uio 66 dmp was investigated in batch adsorption experiments typically 0 01 g of the prepared adsorbent was added to 10 ml of hg ii solution 100 mg l 1 and ph of the solution was adjusted using 0 1 m naoh and hcl solutions then the mixture was shaken in a vibrator at 200 rpm at room temperature during the adsorption process a small aliquot of hg ii solution was collected at regular intervals and analysed through icpe 9000 the effect of reaction time on the sorption rate of hg ii was determined in a tube containing hg ii and uio 66 dmp shaking for 2 240 min at 298 k the initial concentration of hg ii was 400 mg l and the solution ph was controlled using hcl and naoh solutions in addition to the reaction time the effect of initial concentration was investigated in this case different concentrations of hg ii were used for the adsorption isotherm study the stock solution was diluted into various aqueous solutions with different concentrations the adsorbent dosage was maintained to be approximately 2 mg in 4 ml solution and three different temperatures 298 k 308 k and 318 k were used the adsorption amount at balance q e mg g 1 and the removal rate η were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 q e c 0 c e v m 2 η c 0 c e c 0 100 where c e and c 0 mg l 1 are the balance and initial concentrations of hg ii respectively v l is the volume of the solution and m mg is the amount of the uio 66 dmp used during adsorption experiments for exploring the adsorption behaviour three kinetic models were adopted namely pseudo first order model pseudo second order model and interparticle diffusion model these models can be expressed by the following three equations 61 63 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t 5 q t k i t 0 5 c i where k 1 k 2 and k i are the rate constants of pseudo first order pseudo second order and interparticle diffusion model respectively q t is the adsorption capacity at time t and c i is a constant of the interparticle diffusion model to explore its isotherm adsorption behaviour three isotherm models namely langmuir model freundlich model and dubinin radushkevich d r model were adopted these models can be expressed by the following three equations 64 66 6 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m 7 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k f 8 ln q e ln q m β ε 2 9 ε rtln 1 1 c e 10 e 1 2 β where k l and k f represent the constants of langmuir and freundlich isotherm models respectively q e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity and c e is the residual concentration of hg ii ion solution in addition n value represents the adsorption capacity index and e represents mean free energy of adsorption the adsorption thermodynamic model is used to describe thermodynamic behaviour in the adsorption process determine the effect of temperature on the adsorption performance and the type of adsorption and reveal its adsorption mechanism these models could be expressed as the following equations 67 11 k d c a e c e 12 δg

determine the microscopic crystal structure of the synthesised materials xrd measurements were performed on uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp the results are shown in fig 1 a the xrd pattern of the uio 66 nh2 showed two characteristic crystal planes 111 and 200 at 7 32 and 8 51 respectively which are consistent with the simulated uio 66 nh2 simulated peak position indicating the successful synthesis of uio 66 nh2 after modification of dmp the xrd pattern indicated no substantial change in the uio 66 dmp structure suggesting that the synthesised uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp became highly stable with the introduction of functional groups the successful introduction of dmp on uio 66 nh2 is evidenced by ft ir spectra illustrated in fig 1 b as shown in the figure the main peaks appeared at 3438 cm 1 and 3389 cm 1 which represented stretching vibrations of the primary amine nh on aromatic rings in the spectrum of uio 66 nh2 compared with pristine uio 66 nh2 the new peak that appeared at 1630 cm 1 in the spectrum of uio 66 dmp was attributed to the cn bond indicating that dmp was successfully incorporated into uio 66 nh2 uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp were observed respectively the sem images of uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp are shown in fig 1 and the tem images of uio 66 dmp are shown in fig s1 as shown in the figure uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp are spherical structures with a size of approximately 100 nm no obvious difference in size and shapes was observed between uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp indicating that the introduction of dmp did not destroy the structure of uio 66 nh2 in addition the eds analysis results of uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp are shown in fig 1 e f uio 66 nh2 mainly contains four elements c 23 37 wt n 20 23 wt o 15 64 wt and zr 40 76 wt by contrast due to the introduction of dmp into uio 66 dmp 5 84 wt of s appeared in the composition and the content of n also increased to 25 51 wt which further showed the successful modification of dmp the specific surface area and pore size are the major factors that determine the adsorption capacity therefore the specific surface area and pore size were measured using n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the n2 absorption desorption isotherms before and after dmp functionalization belong to type i adsorption isotherms at p p0 0 05 n2 adsorption increased rapidly with increasing pressure reflecting the rapid filling of micropores in the material by n2 the data were further processed using bet and dft models to obtain parameters of specific surface area and pore structure as shown in table s1 after modification of dmp ligands dmp grafted onto uio 66 nh 2 via schiff base which inevitably occupied some of its pores leading to a decrease in the specific surface area of uio 66 dmp from 721 m2 g 1 to 513 m2 g 1 and the pore volume from 0 38 cm3 g 1 to 0 31 cm3 g 1 however the uio 66 dmp still exhibited a high specific surface area and pore volume indicating that dmp does not block the porous framework of uio 66 nh2 further analysis of the pore size distribution of uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp was performed according to the dft model as shown in fig 1 g h both uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp materials have rich microporous and mesoporous structures and the introduction of dmp did not damage the pore structure of uio 66 nh2 the thermogravimetric analyses of uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp are shown in fig 1 i both uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp present a similar behaviour with a marked weight loss at 100 c which can be attributed to the release of free water followed by a slightly decreasing plateau between 100 c and 190 c which can be ascribed to the release of bound water finally another pronounced weight loss occurred at a higher temperature 190 c that was associated with full degradation of the linker for uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp the third stage showed more weightlessness of uio 66 dmp compared to uio 66 nh2 38 15 33 30 and the main weightlessness of dmp was also observed in this stage by dmp s tga it is indicated that the mass loss of uio 66 dmp in stage iii included the loss of dmp organic groups in addition to the collapse of the mof s skeleton this finding further provides supporting evidence for the successful synthesis of uio 66 dmp 3 2 adsorption performance 3 2 1 effect of ph on hg ii adsorption following the successful synthesis of the uio 66 dmp the adsorption of hg ii on uio 66 dmp was performed first the effect of ph of the solution on the adsorption performance for hg ii was evaluated in the ph range of 1 7 the results are shown in fig 2 at ph 4 the removal rate of hg ii was relatively poor due to the presence of h ions in the solution because of competitive adsorption between h and hg ii for limited adsorption sites at ph 4 and with further increase in ph the removal rate of hg ii increased significantly the optimum removal rate of 95 97 was achieved at ph 7 3 2 2 effect of adsorption time and kinetics the adsorption rate is one of the key factors for evaluating the performance of adsorbents and it determines the efficiency of the adsorption process therefore we studied the effect of adsorption time on the performance of the uio 66 dmp for hg ii adsorption the results are shown in fig 3 a the influence of adsorption time on the adsorption process may be divided into two stages in the first stage the adsorption of hg ii occurred rapidly within the initial 40 min with approximately 86 5 of the total hg ii being captured during this period sufficient adsorption sites are present on the uio 66 dmp surface that can be combined with hg ii thereafter with the decrease in the hg ii concentration and the gradual increase in depleted active sites the adsorption proceeded slowly with contact time before reaching the balanced adsorption capacity after 90 min the high adsorption rate was attributed to the porous uio 66 dmp structure and multiple adsorption sites the equilibrium time and adsorption capacity were determined by adsorption kinetics experiments the results are shown in fig 3 when the initial hg ii concentration is 100 mg l the final equilibrium is reached in 90 min which is consistent with the fact that the absorption of hg ii by uio 66 dmp is a rapid process adsorption kinetics was further analysed using typical pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models kinetic parameters and determination coefficient r2 can be determined by linear regression compared to pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 9917 pseudo second order kinetics r2 0 9996 was in good agreement with experimental data indicating that the adsorption of hg ii by uio 66 dmp is a chemical adsorption to further analyse the diffusion mechanism and rate control steps of the adsorption of hg ii on the uio 66 dmp the w m kinetic model was used and the analysis results are shown in fig 3 d two linear regions can be seen in the intra particle diffusion model thus the adsorption process comprises two steps hg ii diffusion from the solution to the surface of uio 66 dmp followed by the intra particle diffusion process according to the w m kinetic model theory when c1 and c2 are not zero the adsorption of mercury by uio 66 dmp is not only controlled by intraparticle diffusion but also by physical and chemical adsorption 32 33 3 2 3 effect of hg ii concentration and isotherms to further explore the adsorption mechanisms of hg ii on the uio 66 dmp the adsorption isothermal experiments were conducted with different initial concentrations of hg ii from 200 mg l 1 to 1200 mg l 1 for uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp 34 35 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the uio 66 dmp for hg ii was 822 00 mg g 1 which was higher than that of uio 66 nh2 480 00 mg g 1 additionally the slope of the adsorption isotherm slowed down when the equilibrium concentration reached 800 mg l 1 fig 4a indicating that the adsorptive property of adsorbents depends on the active site 36 then the isotherms were analysed based on three adsorption isothermal models namely langmuir model freundlich model and dubinin radushkevich d r model the results are presented in table s2 and fig 4 the r2 for the langmuir model was significantly higher than that of the freundlich model table s2 to describe hg ii adsorption phenomenon in both uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp 0 9899 and 0 9970 vs 0 9135 and 0 9587 respectively the finding indicated that the langmuir model is more suitable for describing the adsorption behaviour of hg ii on uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp and it also shows that the adsorption of hg ii on uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp is mainly a monolayer adsorption process according the freundlich model the constant n was 2 6929 t 298 k which is greater than 1 indicating favorable adsorption of hg ii according to the d r model the free energy of adsorption was 9 9691 t 298 k which was between 8 e 16 kj mol 1 suggesting that the adsorption of hg ii on the uio 66 dmp occurs through electrostatic interaction or chemisorption by chelation 3 2 4 effect of temperature and thermodynamics external thermal conditions affect the adsorption performance of hg ii adsorbents therefore it is necessary to study the removal capacity of hg ii by uio 66 dmp at different temperatures the experiment was performed under temperatures of 298 k 308 k and 318 k thermodynamic curves and the related parameters are shown in fig 5 and table 1 the negative δh value indicated that the adsorption of hg ii onto the uio 66 dmp is an exothermic process the negative δs value indicated that the uio 66 dmp has a strong adsorption effect on hg ii which reduces the degree of freedom of hg ii in water and makes the whole system more orderly the negative δg value at each temperature manifested that the hg ii adsorption process was spontaneous and chemical sorption had occurred the absolute value of δg decreased slightly with the increase in temperature indicating that the low temperature is conducive to the adsorption process 37 3 2 5 selectivity and reusability generally various heavy metal ions coexist with hg ii in wastewater which can affect the adsorption performance of the adsorbent for hg ii therefore the adsorption selectivity of uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp was studied using the metal ions ca ii mg ii cd ii co ii mn ii and ni ii with the initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 the results are shown in fig 6 the uio 66 dmp exhibits a high removal rate of hg ii and less adsorption of other metal ions compared with uio 66 nh2 indicating that the type and number of functional groups can substantially affect the material s adsorption selectivity to hg ii 38 separation factors in table s3 indicate that the αi hg of other mixed heavy metal ions is far greater than that of hg ii suggesting that the uio 66 dmp exhibits a better affinity for hg ii in the presence of other interfering metal ions which also contributes to its highly selective adsorption performance for hg ii additionally according to the hsab law hard acid can form a stable bond with a hard base and soft acid can form a stable bond with a soft base ca ii mg ii is hard acids cd ii co ii cu ii zn ii cr iii and ni ii are boundary acids hg ii is a soft acid whereas the n group and s are soft bases thus the uio 66 dmp has a good affinity for hg ii theoretically it further indicates the good adsorption selectivity of the uio 66 dmp for hg ii the stability and regeneration of an adsorbent play a governing role in selecting appropriate and cost effective adsorbents for the removal of hg ii therefore the stability and reusability of uio 66 dmp were investigated and the results are presented in fig 7 after five adsorption desorption cycles the removal rate of hg ii by uio 66 dmp decreased from 95 97 to 85 42 indicating that the uio 66 dmp exhibits good repeatability in the removal of hg ii in addition the main reason for the decrease in the removal rate by the uio 66 dmp may be the slight loss of the adsorbent during the elution process and irreversible occupation of some adsorption active sites 3 3 adsorption mechanism to further clarify the adsorption mechanism of hg ii on the uio 66 dmp the uio 66 dmp samples were analysed before and after hg ii adsorption through xrd sem eds ft ir bet zeta potential and xps xrd measurement of the uio 66 dmp before and after hg ii adsorption was conducted and the results are shown in fig 8 the change in the crystalline structure of the regenerative uio 66 dmp was nonsignificant compared with that in the pristine uio 66 dmp revealing that uio 66 dmp nanoparticles were quite stable however the overall peak intensity of the regenerative uio 66 dmp was significantly decreased this may be because of the presence of hg ii that covered the uio 66 dmp surface adsorption sites indicating that hg ii was successfully adsorbed onto the uio 66 dmp uio 66 dmp hg was measured through sem and eds and the results are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the morphology of uio 66 dmp before and after hg ii adsorption did not change significantly which proves the good stability of the material the eds analysis of uio 66 dmp hg is also shown in the figure the hg content was 8 16 which showed that hg ii was successfully adsorbed onto the uio 66 dmp the ft ir pattern fig 10 of the uio 66 dmp showed negligible changes after use the peaks of uio 66 dmp hg at 1574 cm 1 and 1654 cm 1 indicated that a bond is present between the zirconium ion and carboxyl group whereas the peak at 1630 cm 1 indicated the presence of a cn bond which indicated that the schiff base structure remains stable after adsorption by the uio 66 dmp the nh2 peaks at 3389 cm 1 and 3438 cm 1 shifted to 3375 cm 1 after hg ii adsorption and the intensity decreased which was caused by the binding of hg ii at the adsorption site 39 the n2 adsorption and desorption isotherm fig 11 of uio 66 dmp hg showed that the specific surface area of uio 66 dmp drops from 513 m2 g 1 to 412 m2 g 1 the pore volume decreased from 0 32 cm3 g 1 to 0 26 cm3 g 1 which may be caused by a large amount of hg ii adsorbed on the surface of uio 66 dmp and caused a certain pore blockage these changes prove the successful adsorption of hg ii on uio 66 dmp 40 to further elucidate the adsorption mechanism of uio 66 dmp to hg ii the charge types in different ph solutions were investigated using zeta potential the zeta potential of the uio 66 dmp is shown in fig 12 the results showed that uio 66 dmp had a positive surface charge at all ph values indicating a negative effect of electrostatic adsorption 41 furthermore the size of the surface charge decreased with the increase of ph and the adsorption capacity increased with the increase of ph suggesting that the more positive charge uio 66 dmp had on its surface the less favorable it was for hg ii adsorption the elemental composition of uio 66 dmp before and after the adsorption was analysed by xps spectroscopy to further explore the interaction between hg ii and the adsorbent surfaces the full scan spectrum fig 13 clearly shows that the uio 66 dmp was primarily composed of three elements c zr and o the adsorption of hg ii is evident from fig 13 which shows a new binding peak hg 4f appears in the binding band of uio 66 dmp hg in fig 13 the double peaks appearing at the binding energies of 101 45 ev and 105 42 ev are hg 4f7 2 and hg 4f7 2 respectively the difference in spin orbits between them is 3 97 which is consistent with the xps standard values of mercury indicating that mercury exists in the form of divalent mercury on the surface of uio 66 dmp the n 1 s spectra before and after the adsorption of hg ii are shown in fig 13 c and d the spectra before adsorption can be divided into 399 11 ev cn bond and 399 96 ev cn bond the binding energies have moved to 399 47 ev and 400 81 ev respectively which indicates that hg ii chelates with the n atom on uio 66 dmp 45 in 13 e and f the binding energies of the two s 2p peaks at 161 78 ev and 162 84 ev shifted to 163 27 ev and 169 50 ev respectively and the peaks changed significantly which proved that the sh group has a strong chelating effect with hg ii in summary the n and s groups on uio 66 dmp play a key role in the adsorption and removal of hg ii in order to further understand the interaction force in the adsorption process and explore adsorption mechanism of hg ii on uio 66 dmp a simplified model of uio 66 dmp material was established using materials studio software and calculated by dft method the calculation results of the adsorption energy between different binding sites on uio 66 dmp and hg ii are shown in fig 14 among them the binding energy of n1hg in model 1 is 6 3894 ev the binding energy of n2 hg in model 2 is 6 4113 ev and the binding energy of four n sites complexed with hg ii in model 3 is 6 4249 ev the binding energy of shg in model 4 is 6 44475 ev all of them have strong binding capacity indicating that all binding sites on uio 66 dmp can effectively bind to hg ii in water in summary the multiple n groups and s groups on uio 66 dmp greatly improve the adsorption performance of hg ii 4 conclusions a novel 4 6 diamino 2 mercaptopyrimidine functionalized zr based metal organic framework uio 66 dmp was synthesised in this work and applied to the adsorption of hg ii from aqueous solutions through a series of adsorption experiments the maximum adsorption capacity of uio 66 dmp reaches 822 mg g 1 which is much higher than that of uio 66 nh2 480 mg g 1 the kinetic and isotherm adsorption studies showed that adsorption of these metal ions onto uio 66 dmp could be described well by the langmuir model and the quasi second order kinetic model indicating that it is mainly controlled by chemical adsorption using a mixture of 1 thiourea and 0 1 m hydrochloric acid as the desorption agent the removal rate can still reach 85 42 after 5 adsorption desorption cycles in addition under the interference of ca ii cd ii co ii mg ii ni ii cr iii cu ii zn ii and other coexisting ions the adsorption of hg ii by uio 66 dmp still maintains a high removal rate of 91 52 the adsorption energy between different binding sites on uio 66 dmp and hg ii was calculated by xps analysis combined with dft method and it was found that all binding sites can effectively bind hg ii in water therefore the prepared novel uio 66 dmp is a

13159,due to natural and production activities mercury contamination has become one of the major environmental problems in the world adsorption is one of the important means to solve this problem however most of the commercially available adsorbents exhibit relatively low adsorption capacity and slow kinetics therefore a novel 4 6 diamino 2 mercaptopyrimidine functionalised zr based metal organic framework uio 66 dmp was synthesised in this study the uio 66 dmp was characterised through x ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectrometry x ray photoelectron spectroscopy fourier transform infrared spectrometry and thermogravimetric analysis the potential of the uio 66 dmp as a superior adsorbent for hg ii removal and the corresponding mechanisms were evaluated through batch experiments under different conditions and density functional theory calculations benefitting from its high specific surface area and multiple adsorption sites the maximum hg ii adsorption capacity achieved in this study was 822 00 mg g 1 which is the highest hg ii adsorption capacity reported to date in addition under the interference of ca ii cd ii co ii mg ii mn ii ni ii cr iii cu ii zn ii and other coexisting ions the uio 66 dmp could still maintain the high selective adsorption capacity for hg ii according to the characterization analysis and dft calculation results the adsorption of hg ii onto the uio 66 dmp was dependent on electrostatic and covalent interactions between metal ions and abundant functional groups on the uio 66 dmp surface graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords functionalization uio 66 4 6 diamino 2 mercaptopyrimidine adsorption mercury 1 introduction with the development of industry and technology the increased presence of heavy metals in water has received increasing attention due to their threats to the worldwide ecosystems and public health especially hg one of the most toxic heavy metals 1 3 hg is a volatile insoluble and mobile toxic element 4 it is widely used in electricity generation industrial production of materials such as chlor alkali plastics and electronic items and metallurgy 5 6 46 its increasing presence in water bodies poses a serious threat to ecosystems hg has been considered as one of the most toxic metals that can affect the health of human beings hg is widely distributed in water rocks and even in air most of the hg in water is present in the form of hg ii which causes great harm to the environment and human health 8 therefore removal of hg ii from wastewater is of great importance 9 to date various technologies such as chemical precipitation membrane separation biological treatment solvent extraction and adsorption 10 47 49 have been employed to remove hg ii from wastewater among these techniques adsorption utilising porous materials is extensively employed owing to its high efficiency low cost simple regeneration and simplicity of operation different adsorbents such as activated carbon graphene carbon nanotubes metal oxides polymers zeolites and biomass materials have been applied for the removal of hg ii 50 52 however some drawbacks such as low adsorption capacity poor selectivity and weak binding affinity limit the application of these adsorbents 53 55 therefore it is necessary to develop a novel adsorbent with excellent adsorption capacity good selectivity and high stability metal organic frameworks mofs are considered as one of the most promising options because of their extremely high surface area pore size tunability and customisable pore functionalisation 56 57 mofs are the hybrid organic inorganic materials with metal or metal clusters linked by organic ligands through coordination bonding among the mofs zr based mofs e g uio 66 with strong zro bond exhibits high stability and is considered as a potential adsorbent 58 however low adsorption capacity and poor selectivity limit its applications in adsorption chemical modification of the uio 66 nh2 with specific functional groups has been reported to be a promising strategy to improve its adsorption ability and selectivity for metal ions zhang et al 59 fabricated an efficient and redox active adsorbent uio 66 btu by modifying zr mof with bis thiourea the uio 66 btu showed significant adsorption ability and high selectivity towards au iii in the presence of various mixed ions in wastewater the improvement in adsorption performance was mainly attributed to the introduction of s containing functional groups aminabhavi et al 60 successfully synthesised a ethylenediamine functionalised zr based metal organic framework uio 66 eda the high adsorption capacity of the uio 66 eda is achieved through a strong interaction between metal ions and n sites of the functional groups in the mofs in conclusion functionalisation of uio 66 with sulfur or nitrogen can considerably improve its adsorption performance for metal ions providing a reliable solution for using mofs to treat hg containing wastewater herein we report a simple economic and expandable manufacture process of the uio 66 dmp 4 6 diamino 2 mercaptopyrimidine composite dmp is rich in n and s groups and it can be introduced to uio 66 nh2 through the schiff base reaction by using glutaraldehyde as the bridge the uio 66 dmp was used as an adsorbent for efficient removal of hg ii metal ions from water moreover the different influencing factors such as adsorption time ph adsorbent dosage temperature and coexistence of other metal ions were thoroughly investigated through batch experiments finally the adsorption mechanism and stability of the uio 66 dmp for hg ii were explored through characterization analysis and dft calculations 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all the reagents

hydrochloric acid 10 ml and dmf 42 ml were added into a teflon lined autoclave and heated for 24 h at 393 k by using an electric oven the solid product uio 66 nh2 after cooling was recovered through centrifugation washed first with dmf and finally with acetone and dried 12 h 100 c under vacuum subsequently uio 66 nh2 4 g and gd 5 ml were added to 150 ml of anhydrous alcohol and the mixture was allowed to react at 353 k for 24 h uio 66 gd was prepared through centrifugation washing and vacuum drying finally 3 g of uio 66 gd and 3 g of dmp were mixed into 200 ml of dmf and then the mixture was stirred and allowed to react at 343 k for 24 h after centrifugation and washing the uio 66 dmp was obtained 2 3 characterization methods x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the adsorbent were determined using a powder diffractometer under cu kα λ 0 154 nm radiation fourier transform infrared ft ir spectra were recorded on a nicolet is50 america spectrometer the field emission scanning electron microscopic fe sem image was studied on the nova nano sem 250 from fei company america and spraying platinum before the sample test the element distribution was assessed using the x ray energy spectrometer eds on the phenom prox the netherlands the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms were analysed using a surface area analyser asap 2460 to study the surface area and porosity of the adsorbents x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra were obtained through a thermo scientific k alpha usa at a vacuum of approximately 2 10 7 mbar 2 4 adsorption experiments the adsorption behaviour of hg ii on the uio 66 dmp was investigated in batch adsorption experiments typically 0 01 g of the prepared adsorbent was added to 10 ml of hg ii solution 100 mg l 1 and ph of the solution was adjusted using 0 1 m naoh and hcl solutions then the mixture was shaken in a vibrator at 200 rpm at room temperature during the adsorption process a small aliquot of hg ii solution was collected at regular intervals and analysed through icpe 9000 the effect of reaction time on the sorption rate of hg ii was determined in a tube containing hg ii and uio 66 dmp shaking for 2 240 min at 298 k the initial concentration of hg ii was 400 mg l and the solution ph was controlled using hcl and naoh solutions in addition to the reaction time the effect of initial concentration was investigated in this case different concentrations of hg ii were used for the adsorption isotherm study the stock solution was diluted into various aqueous solutions with different concentrations the adsorbent dosage was maintained to be approximately 2 mg in 4 ml solution and three different temperatures 298 k 308 k and 318 k were used the adsorption amount at balance q e mg g 1 and the removal rate η were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 q e c 0 c e v m 2 η c 0 c e c 0 100 where c e and c 0 mg l 1 are the balance and initial concentrations of hg ii respectively v l is the volume of the solution and m mg is the amount of the uio 66 dmp used during adsorption experiments for exploring the adsorption behaviour three kinetic models were adopted namely pseudo first order model pseudo second order model and interparticle diffusion model these models can be expressed by the following three equations 61 63 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t 5 q t k i t 0 5 c i where k 1 k 2 and k i are the rate constants of pseudo first order pseudo second order and interparticle diffusion model respectively q t is the adsorption capacity at time t and c i is a constant of the interparticle diffusion model to explore its isotherm adsorption behaviour three isotherm models namely langmuir model freundlich model and dubinin radushkevich d r model were adopted these models can be expressed by the following three equations 64 66 6 c e q e 1 q m k l c e q m 7 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k f 8 ln q e ln q m β ε 2 9 ε rtln 1 1 c e 10 e 1 2 β where k l and k f represent the constants of langmuir and freundlich isotherm models respectively q e is the equilibrium adsorption capacity and c e is the residual concentration of hg ii ion solution in addition n value represents the adsorption capacity index and e represents mean free energy of adsorption the adsorption thermodynamic model is used to describe thermodynamic behaviour in the adsorption process determine the effect of temperature on the adsorption performance and the type of adsorption and reveal its adsorption mechanism these models could be expressed as the following equations 67 11 k d c a e c e 12 δg

determine the microscopic crystal structure of the synthesised materials xrd measurements were performed on uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp the results are shown in fig 1 a the xrd pattern of the uio 66 nh2 showed two characteristic crystal planes 111 and 200 at 7 32 and 8 51 respectively which are consistent with the simulated uio 66 nh2 simulated peak position indicating the successful synthesis of uio 66 nh2 after modification of dmp the xrd pattern indicated no substantial change in the uio 66 dmp structure suggesting that the synthesised uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp became highly stable with the introduction of functional groups the successful introduction of dmp on uio 66 nh2 is evidenced by ft ir spectra illustrated in fig 1 b as shown in the figure the main peaks appeared at 3438 cm 1 and 3389 cm 1 which represented stretching vibrations of the primary amine nh on aromatic rings in the spectrum of uio 66 nh2 compared with pristine uio 66 nh2 the new peak that appeared at 1630 cm 1 in the spectrum of uio 66 dmp was attributed to the cn bond indicating that dmp was successfully incorporated into uio 66 nh2 uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp were observed respectively the sem images of uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp are shown in fig 1 and the tem images of uio 66 dmp are shown in fig s1 as shown in the figure uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp are spherical structures with a size of approximately 100 nm no obvious difference in size and shapes was observed between uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp indicating that the introduction of dmp did not destroy the structure of uio 66 nh2 in addition the eds analysis results of uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp are shown in fig 1 e f uio 66 nh2 mainly contains four elements c 23 37 wt n 20 23 wt o 15 64 wt and zr 40 76 wt by contrast due to the introduction of dmp into uio 66 dmp 5 84 wt of s appeared in the composition and the content of n also increased to 25 51 wt which further showed the successful modification of dmp the specific surface area and pore size are the major factors that determine the adsorption capacity therefore the specific surface area and pore size were measured using n2 adsorption desorption isotherms the n2 absorption desorption isotherms before and after dmp functionalization belong to type i adsorption isotherms at p p0 0 05 n2 adsorption increased rapidly with increasing pressure reflecting the rapid filling of micropores in the material by n2 the data were further processed using bet and dft models to obtain parameters of specific surface area and pore structure as shown in table s1 after modification of dmp ligands dmp grafted onto uio 66 nh 2 via schiff base which inevitably occupied some of its pores leading to a decrease in the specific surface area of uio 66 dmp from 721 m2 g 1 to 513 m2 g 1 and the pore volume from 0 38 cm3 g 1 to 0 31 cm3 g 1 however the uio 66 dmp still exhibited a high specific surface area and pore volume indicating that dmp does not block the porous framework of uio 66 nh2 further analysis of the pore size distribution of uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp was performed according to the dft model as shown in fig 1 g h both uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp materials have rich microporous and mesoporous structures and the introduction of dmp did not damage the pore structure of uio 66 nh2 the thermogravimetric analyses of uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp are shown in fig 1 i both uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp present a similar behaviour with a marked weight loss at 100 c which can be attributed to the release of free water followed by a slightly decreasing plateau between 100 c and 190 c which can be ascribed to the release of bound water finally another pronounced weight loss occurred at a higher temperature 190 c that was associated with full degradation of the linker for uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp the third stage showed more weightlessness of uio 66 dmp compared to uio 66 nh2 38 15 33 30 and the main weightlessness of dmp was also observed in this stage by dmp s tga it is indicated that the mass loss of uio 66 dmp in stage iii included the loss of dmp organic groups in addition to the collapse of the mof s skeleton this finding further provides supporting evidence for the successful synthesis of uio 66 dmp 3 2 adsorption performance 3 2 1 effect of ph on hg ii adsorption following the successful synthesis of the uio 66 dmp the adsorption of hg ii on uio 66 dmp was performed first the effect of ph of the solution on the adsorption performance for hg ii was evaluated in the ph range of 1 7 the results are shown in fig 2 at ph 4 the removal rate of hg ii was relatively poor due to the presence of h ions in the solution because of competitive adsorption between h and hg ii for limited adsorption sites at ph 4 and with further increase in ph the removal rate of hg ii increased significantly the optimum removal rate of 95 97 was achieved at ph 7 3 2 2 effect of adsorption time and kinetics the adsorption rate is one of the key factors for evaluating the performance of adsorbents and it determines the efficiency of the adsorption process therefore we studied the effect of adsorption time on the performance of the uio 66 dmp for hg ii adsorption the results are shown in fig 3 a the influence of adsorption time on the adsorption process may be divided into two stages in the first stage the adsorption of hg ii occurred rapidly within the initial 40 min with approximately 86 5 of the total hg ii being captured during this period sufficient adsorption sites are present on the uio 66 dmp surface that can be combined with hg ii thereafter with the decrease in the hg ii concentration and the gradual increase in depleted active sites the adsorption proceeded slowly with contact time before reaching the balanced adsorption capacity after 90 min the high adsorption rate was attributed to the porous uio 66 dmp structure and multiple adsorption sites the equilibrium time and adsorption capacity were determined by adsorption kinetics experiments the results are shown in fig 3 when the initial hg ii concentration is 100 mg l the final equilibrium is reached in 90 min which is consistent with the fact that the absorption of hg ii by uio 66 dmp is a rapid process adsorption kinetics was further analysed using typical pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetic models kinetic parameters and determination coefficient r2 can be determined by linear regression compared to pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 9917 pseudo second order kinetics r2 0 9996 was in good agreement with experimental data indicating that the adsorption of hg ii by uio 66 dmp is a chemical adsorption to further analyse the diffusion mechanism and rate control steps of the adsorption of hg ii on the uio 66 dmp the w m kinetic model was used and the analysis results are shown in fig 3 d two linear regions can be seen in the intra particle diffusion model thus the adsorption process comprises two steps hg ii diffusion from the solution to the surface of uio 66 dmp followed by the intra particle diffusion process according to the w m kinetic model theory when c1 and c2 are not zero the adsorption of mercury by uio 66 dmp is not only controlled by intraparticle diffusion but also by physical and chemical adsorption 32 33 3 2 3 effect of hg ii concentration and isotherms to further explore the adsorption mechanisms of hg ii on the uio 66 dmp the adsorption isothermal experiments were conducted with different initial concentrations of hg ii from 200 mg l 1 to 1200 mg l 1 for uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp 34 35 the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the uio 66 dmp for hg ii was 822 00 mg g 1 which was higher than that of uio 66 nh2 480 00 mg g 1 additionally the slope of the adsorption isotherm slowed down when the equilibrium concentration reached 800 mg l 1 fig 4a indicating that the adsorptive property of adsorbents depends on the active site 36 then the isotherms were analysed based on three adsorption isothermal models namely langmuir model freundlich model and dubinin radushkevich d r model the results are presented in table s2 and fig 4 the r2 for the langmuir model was significantly higher than that of the freundlich model table s2 to describe hg ii adsorption phenomenon in both uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp 0 9899 and 0 9970 vs 0 9135 and 0 9587 respectively the finding indicated that the langmuir model is more suitable for describing the adsorption behaviour of hg ii on uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp and it also shows that the adsorption of hg ii on uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp is mainly a monolayer adsorption process according the freundlich model the constant n was 2 6929 t 298 k which is greater than 1 indicating favorable adsorption of hg ii according to the d r model the free energy of adsorption was 9 9691 t 298 k which was between 8 e 16 kj mol 1 suggesting that the adsorption of hg ii on the uio 66 dmp occurs through electrostatic interaction or chemisorption by chelation 3 2 4 effect of temperature and thermodynamics external thermal conditions affect the adsorption performance of hg ii adsorbents therefore it is necessary to study the removal capacity of hg ii by uio 66 dmp at different temperatures the experiment was performed under temperatures of 298 k 308 k and 318 k thermodynamic curves and the related parameters are shown in fig 5 and table 1 the negative δh value indicated that the adsorption of hg ii onto the uio 66 dmp is an exothermic process the negative δs value indicated that the uio 66 dmp has a strong adsorption effect on hg ii which reduces the degree of freedom of hg ii in water and makes the whole system more orderly the negative δg value at each temperature manifested that the hg ii adsorption process was spontaneous and chemical sorption had occurred the absolute value of δg decreased slightly with the increase in temperature indicating that the low temperature is conducive to the adsorption process 37 3 2 5 selectivity and reusability generally various heavy metal ions coexist with hg ii in wastewater which can affect the adsorption performance of the adsorbent for hg ii therefore the adsorption selectivity of uio 66 nh2 and uio 66 dmp was studied using the metal ions ca ii mg ii cd ii co ii mn ii and ni ii with the initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 the results are shown in fig 6 the uio 66 dmp exhibits a high removal rate of hg ii and less adsorption of other metal ions compared with uio 66 nh2 indicating that the type and number of functional groups can substantially affect the material s adsorption selectivity to hg ii 38 separation factors in table s3 indicate that the αi hg of other mixed heavy metal ions is far greater than that of hg ii suggesting that the uio 66 dmp exhibits a better affinity for hg ii in the presence of other interfering metal ions which also contributes to its highly selective adsorption performance for hg ii additionally according to the hsab law hard acid can form a stable bond with a hard base and soft acid can form a stable bond with a soft base ca ii mg ii is hard acids cd ii co ii cu ii zn ii cr iii and ni ii are boundary acids hg ii is a soft acid whereas the n group and s are soft bases thus the uio 66 dmp has a good affinity for hg ii theoretically it further indicates the good adsorption selectivity of the uio 66 dmp for hg ii the stability and regeneration of an adsorbent play a governing role in selecting appropriate and cost effective adsorbents for the removal of hg ii therefore the stability and reusability of uio 66 dmp were investigated and the results are presented in fig 7 after five adsorption desorption cycles the removal rate of hg ii by uio 66 dmp decreased from 95 97 to 85 42 indicating that the uio 66 dmp exhibits good repeatability in the removal of hg ii in addition the main reason for the decrease in the removal rate by the uio 66 dmp may be the slight loss of the adsorbent during the elution process and irreversible occupation of some adsorption active sites 3 3 adsorption mechanism to further clarify the adsorption mechanism of hg ii on the uio 66 dmp the uio 66 dmp samples were analysed before and after hg ii adsorption through xrd sem eds ft ir bet zeta potential and xps xrd measurement of the uio 66 dmp before and after hg ii adsorption was conducted and the results are shown in fig 8 the change in the crystalline structure of the regenerative uio 66 dmp was nonsignificant compared with that in the pristine uio 66 dmp revealing that uio 66 dmp nanoparticles were quite stable however the overall peak intensity of the regenerative uio 66 dmp was significantly decreased this may be because of the presence of hg ii that covered the uio 66 dmp surface adsorption sites indicating that hg ii was successfully adsorbed onto the uio 66 dmp uio 66 dmp hg was measured through sem and eds and the results are shown in fig 9 it can be seen that the morphology of uio 66 dmp before and after hg ii adsorption did not change significantly which proves the good stability of the material the eds analysis of uio 66 dmp hg is also shown in the figure the hg content was 8 16 which showed that hg ii was successfully adsorbed onto the uio 66 dmp the ft ir pattern fig 10 of the uio 66 dmp showed negligible changes after use the peaks of uio 66 dmp hg at 1574 cm 1 and 1654 cm 1 indicated that a bond is present between the zirconium ion and carboxyl group whereas the peak at 1630 cm 1 indicated the presence of a cn bond which indicated that the schiff base structure remains stable after adsorption by the uio 66 dmp the nh2 peaks at 3389 cm 1 and 3438 cm 1 shifted to 3375 cm 1 after hg ii adsorption and the intensity decreased which was caused by the binding of hg ii at the adsorption site 39 the n2 adsorption and desorption isotherm fig 11 of uio 66 dmp hg showed that the specific surface area of uio 66 dmp drops from 513 m2 g 1 to 412 m2 g 1 the pore volume decreased from 0 32 cm3 g 1 to 0 26 cm3 g 1 which may be caused by a large amount of hg ii adsorbed on the surface of uio 66 dmp and caused a certain pore blockage these changes prove the successful adsorption of hg ii on uio 66 dmp 40 to further elucidate the adsorption mechanism of uio 66 dmp to hg ii the charge types in different ph solutions were investigated using zeta potential the zeta potential of the uio 66 dmp is shown in fig 12 the results showed that uio 66 dmp had a positive surface charge at all ph values indicating a negative effect of electrostatic adsorption 41 furthermore the size of the surface charge decreased with the increase of ph and the adsorption capacity increased with the increase of ph suggesting that the more positive charge uio 66 dmp had on its surface the less favorable it was for hg ii adsorption the elemental composition of uio 66 dmp before and after the adsorption was analysed by xps spectroscopy to further explore the interaction between hg ii and the adsorbent surfaces the full scan spectrum fig 13 clearly shows that the uio 66 dmp was primarily composed of three elements c zr and o the adsorption of hg ii is evident from fig 13 which shows a new binding peak hg 4f appears in the binding band of uio 66 dmp hg in fig 13 the double peaks appearing at the binding energies of 101 45 ev and 105 42 ev are hg 4f7 2 and hg 4f7 2 respectively the difference in spin orbits between them is 3 97 which is consistent with the xps standard values of mercury indicating that mercury exists in the form of divalent mercury on the surface of uio 66 dmp the n 1 s spectra before and after the adsorption of hg ii are shown in fig 13 c and d the spectra before adsorption can be divided into 399 11 ev cn bond and 399 96 ev cn bond the binding energies have moved to 399 47 ev and 400 81 ev respectively which indicates that hg ii chelates with the n atom on uio 66 dmp 45 in 13 e and f the binding energies of the two s 2p peaks at 161 78 ev and 162 84 ev shifted to 163 27 ev and 169 50 ev respectively and the peaks changed significantly which proved that the sh group has a strong chelating effect with hg ii in summary the n and s groups on uio 66 dmp play a key role in the adsorption and removal of hg ii in order to further understand the interaction force in the adsorption process and explore adsorption mechanism of hg ii on uio 66 dmp a simplified model of uio 66 dmp material was established using materials studio software and calculated by dft method the calculation results of the adsorption energy between different binding sites on uio 66 dmp and hg ii are shown in fig 14 among them the binding energy of n1hg in model 1 is 6 3894 ev the binding energy of n2 hg in model 2 is 6 4113 ev and the binding energy of four n sites complexed with hg ii in model 3 is 6 4249 ev the binding energy of shg in model 4 is 6 44475 ev all of them have strong binding capacity indicating that all binding sites on uio 66 dmp can effectively bind to hg ii in water in summary the multiple n groups and s groups on uio 66 dmp greatly improve the adsorption performance of hg ii 4 conclusions a novel 4 6 diamino 2 mercaptopyrimidine functionalized zr based metal organic framework uio 66 dmp was synthesised in this work and applied to the adsorption of hg ii from aqueous solutions through a series of adsorption experiments the maximum adsorption capacity of uio 66 dmp reaches 822 mg g 1 which is much higher than that of uio 66 nh2 480 mg g 1 the kinetic and isotherm adsorption studies showed that adsorption of these metal ions onto uio 66 dmp could be described well by the langmuir model and the quasi second order kinetic model indicating that it is mainly controlled by chemical adsorption using a mixture of 1 thiourea and 0 1 m hydrochloric acid as the desorption agent the removal rate can still reach 85 42 after 5 adsorption desorption cycles in addition under the interference of ca ii cd ii co ii mg ii ni ii cr iii cu ii zn ii and other coexisting ions the adsorption of hg ii by uio 66 dmp still maintains a high removal rate of 91 52 the adsorption energy between different binding sites on uio 66 dmp and hg ii was calculated by xps analysis combined with dft method and it was found that all binding sites can effectively bind hg ii in water therefore the prepared novel uio 66 dmp is a
