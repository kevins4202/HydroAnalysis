untreated soil after h2o2 treatment for removal of organic matter and nh2oh hcl treatment for removal mn oxides the distribution coefficient k d decreased by a maximum of 25 2 and 64 1 respectively after dithionite citrate bicarbonate treatment for removal of free fe oxides k d increased by 1670 2 after increasing the solution ph from 2 to 3 k d increased by 2842 1 whereas after increasing the solution ph from 3 to 7 the adsorption tended stabilize as the ionic strength increased from 0 001 m to 0 1 m nano3 k d gradually decreased whereas at the same ionic strength k d decreased as the initial concentration of cd increased the effects of different background electrolytes on cd adsorption was as follows ca2 mg2 k na for cations and cl so4 2 no3 for anions the adsorption capacity of cd increased as the increased of temperature and it s a spontaneous endothermic process the pseudo second order rate model described the process of cd adsorption well keywords alluvial soil cadmium soil components solution chemistry thermodynamics kinetics 1 introduction cd is the seventh most toxic heavy metal as per ranking among environmental pollutants by the agency for toxic substance and disease registry atdsr 2017 the world health organization who 2000 reported that the average background concentration of cd was 0 1 0 4 mg kg 1 in soil in recent years with the development of industry and intensive agriculture a large amount of cd has entered into the soil environment causing the content of cd in the soil in some areas to exceed the recommended level cd is more bioavailable and mobile than other metals li et al 2015 it can easily enter the human food chain causing a range of acute and chronic disease symptoms as well as cause serious damage to the kidneys lungs and liver bedoui et al 2008 soil is a complex heterogeneous system as soil components iron oxides manganese oxides and organic matter are important adsorption carriers which play an important role in the transfer transformation and other environmental geochemical behaviors of cd in soil dong et al 2000 li et al 2015 a variety of methods are used to study the effects of soil components on cd adsorption for example firstly we can study the adsorption capacity of synthetic or semi synthetic pure substances to cd and then perform an extrapolation covelo et al 2007 tan et al 2018 secondly we can analyze the correlation between mineral composition and content distribution of cd in soil lee 2006 holm et al 2003 thirdly we can compare the adsorption capacity of cd after separation of specific component by selective chemical extraction li et al 2015 zhao et al 2014 however overall analysis by selective chemical extraction technology is an effective method for accurately evaluating the adsorption effect of specific components on heavy metals in soil and their adsorption mechanism sarkar et al 2014 it is well known that the conditions of solution chemistry e g ph ionic strength background electrolyte type etc can also significantly affect the cd adsorption in soil chen et al 2011 loganathan et al 2012 the ph mainly affects cd adsorption by changing the speciation of cd such as cd oh 3 cd oh 2 0 cdoh and cd2 hu et al 2014 and the surface charge of the adsorbent hu et al 2011 the ionic strength and background electrolyte mainly affect the adsorption of cd by affecting the structure of the double electrode layer of the adsorbent wang et al 2013 malamis and katsou 2013 competing with cd for adsorption sites or forming soluble complexes with cd wang et al 2013 dai et al 2013 however the effects of the three types of solution chemistry conditions on cd adsorption show different characteristics due to the differences in the physicochemical features of the studied soil the adsorption equilibrium is influenced not only by soil components and solution chemistry conditions but also by the kinetic and the thermodynamics processes the adsorption of cd as with other heavy metals is recognized as a two step process axe et al 2006 that is adsorption is divided into the initial rapid adsorption stage followed by the slow adsorption stage the temperature affects the adsorption process mainly through the following mechanism as the temperature increases the viscosity of the solution decreases nouri et al 2007 and the kinetic energy of the ions in the solution increases increasing the diffusion rate of the metal ions malamis and katsou 2013 wang et al 2019 the increase in the temperature promotes the hydrolysis of metal ions reducing the electrostatic repulsion between the sorbate and the surface of the adsorbent fan et al 2009 moreover an elevated temperature results in an increase in the number of the active adsorption sites on the solid goyal et al 2003 puranik and paknikar 1999 however it has also been reported that an increase in the temperature enhances the tendency of cd to escape from the solid surface thus reducing the ability of the adsorbent to remove cd öztürk et al 2014 sharma et al 2007 the thermodynamic parameters i e g0 h0 and s0 will also change with temperature chen and wang 2006 riverine alluvial plains are usually densely populated with relatively well developed agriculture due to the flatness of the terrain and good quality of the soil however this also leads to heavy metal pollution of the latter to date the reports in the literature regarding the effect of multiple factors on cd adsorption in alluvial acidic soils have been inadequate in this study selective chemical extraction technology and adsorption experiments were applied to investigate 1 the quantitative analysis of the effects of organic matter free fe oxides and mn oxides in an alluvial soil on cd adsorption 2 the effects of solution chemistry conditions ph ionic strength background electrolyte on cd adsorption and 3 the thermodynamics and kinetic characteristics of cd adsorption the research results should provide a theoretical basis and data support for soil cd pollution prevention treatment and remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil characterization topsoils 0 20 cm used in this study were sampled from an alluvial soil from the muxi river near hongyue coal mine located in xiba town southwest china soil samples were naturally dried crushed and passed through a 2 mm nylon sieve after removing plant residues stones and other large particles soil ph was determined by ph meter in a 1 2 5 soil solution soil organic matter was analyzed by the k2cr2o7 oxidation method nelson and sommers 1982 the free fe oxides and amorphous fe oxides contents were determined by the dcb dithionite citrate bicarbonate method mehra and jackson 1960 and the nh4 2c2o4 h2c2o4 method mckeague and day 1966 respectively the content of mn oxides was determined by the nh2oh hcl method xiong 1985 cation exchange capacity cec was determined by the cobalt hexamine trichloride extraction method iso 23470 particle size analysis was determined by the pipette method gbt 50123 1999 the mineral composition and surface characteristics of the soil were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy respectively after hno3 hf hclo4 digestion the content of cd was analyzed by icp ms pe6000 perkin elmer corp usa the contents of fe and mn were analyzed by aas ggx 9 beijing haiguang instrument co china the characterization of the alluvial soil are presented in table 1 2 2 adsorption experiments selective chemical extraction was used to remove specific components from the tested soil the extraction method is shown in table 2 all the treated soil samples were washed 3 times with deionized water naturally dried crushed then passed through a 2 mm nylon sieve solutions of different concentrations of cd were configured with cd no3 2 4h2o the ratio of soil to water was 1 20 in all adsorption tests the ionic strength of all experiments was 0 01 m except for the experiments associated with the influence of ionic strength the ph of all the experiments were adjusted to a ph value of 5 28 0 2 using hno3 and naoh except for the experiments of ph influence the temperature of all experiments was 25 0 2 c except for the experiments with regard to the influence of temperature all experiments were conducted with a constant agitation at 180 rpm for 24 h except for the kinetic experiment for the influence of different background electrolytes the background electrolytes were 0 01 m solution for the cations k na ca2 and mg2 and anions so4 2 no3 and cl after adsorption the liquid phases and solid phase was separated by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 min the supernatants were filtered through a 0 45 μm needle filter the concentration of cd was analyzed by aas ggx 9 beijing haiguang instrument co china all experimental data and statistical analyses were processed using microsoft excel and the relative errors p 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd and ftir analyses fig 1 is the xrd pattern of the alluvial soil the main mineral are quartz muscovite and feldspar the characteristic peaks of clay minerals aren t obvious probably because the clay minerals are poorly crystallized resulting in low and broad diffraction peaks it is also that clay minerals possible be coated by other soil components causing the diffraction peaks of clay minerals disappear xiong 1985 ft ir spectra of the studied soil samples before the adsorption experiments is presented in fig 2 in the spectra the typical band at 3620 cm 1 could be related to the stretching mode of the oh bands likely indicating the presence of free surface adsorbed water vithanage et al 2013 and the band at 1630 cm 1 could be ascribed to the oh vibrations of aromatic and carboxylates of humic substances piccolo et al 1992 the band at 1030 cm 1 could be related to the sio vibrations of silicate mineral guo et al 2013 the band at 797 cm 1 accompanies an inflexion at 779 cm 1 indicating the existence of quartz the band at 533 cm 1 could be the al o si deformation of montmorillonite medina et al 2017 3 2 effect of soil components on cd adsorption the distribution coefficient k d expresses the ratio of the element s concentration in the solid phase to that in the solution phase after a specified reaction time eq 1 the larger the value of k d the easier its adsorption by the soil and the less migratory k d can readily compare the adsorption capacity of different soils for a certain heavy metal under the same experimental conditions 1 k d c 0 c e c e v m q e c e where c e is the element s concentration in the supernatant solution after a specified reaction time mg l 1 c 0 is the initial concentration of the element in the solution mg l 1 v is the solution volume ml m is the soil mass g and q e is the element s concentration in the soil mg kg 1 3 2 1 effect of organic matter soil organic matter exhibits high cation exchange capacity cec values and has a vast variety of functional groups which mainly affect the adsorption behavior of cd in soil by ion exchange surface complexation and precipitation bradl 2004 after removal of organic matter the adsorption capacity of cd decreased by 0 4 c0 50 mg l 1 to 7 8 c0 30 mg l 1 or 4 on average compared to untreated soil table 3 k d decreased 1 3 c0 50 mg l 1 to 25 2 c0 30 mg l 1 or 11 8 on average compared to untreated soil table 4 therefore the removal of organic matter reduces the adsorption capacity of cd fig 3 the ability of soil to absorb cd is generally reduced after the removal of organic matter this may be because the latter results in the reduction of the cation exchange sites on the surface of the soil jiao et al 2005 however several studies also reported that removal of organic matter had little effect on cd adsorption reid and mcduffie 1981 petruzelli et al 1978 the effect of organic matter on cd adsorption depends mainly on the content and forms of the former zhao et al 2014 studied two different types of purple paddy soil and found that the soil with a high content of organic matter had a lower cd adsorption after the removal of organic matter wang and chen 1991 found that when organic matter covered the surface of clay minerals the specific surface area of the soil was reduced after the organic matter was removed this led to the decrease in the number of the adsorption sites and reduced the cd adsorption capacity however if organic matter is present within the interlayer of the 2 1 expanding clay minerals it will prevent cd from approaching the adsorption sites in the interlayer the removal of organic matter also leads to only a small loss of the specific surface area therefore it has little effect on cd adsorption 3 2 2 effect of free fe oxides free fe oxides in soils generally provide specific adsorption sites for metal ions bradl 2004 due to the differences in physicochemical characteristics of the soil the adsorption capacity of cd is often different after removal of free fe oxides using the dcb method li et al 2015 removal of free fe oxides in the studied soil increased the adsorption capacity of cd fig 3 compared to untreated soil the adsorption capacity of cd increased from 27 2 c0 10 mg l 1 to 82 5 c0 200 mg l 1 or by 45 5 on average table 3 k d increased from 547 8 c0 50 mg l 1 to 1670 2 c0 200 mg l 1 or by 923 8 on average table 4 there may be three reasons for the latter 1 generally fe oxides in soil have a positive charge and the removal of fe oxide coatings on the soil surface reduces the zero points of charges zpc exposing the negative surface charge sites were previously combined with the fe oxides li et al 2015 and 2 the removal of free fe oxide coatings crystalline and non crystalline exposes the layered silicate minerals and oh on the surface of the silicate minerals can form hydroxide precipitates meoh 2 with metal ions agbenin and olojo 2004 3 it is also possible that cd can form cd citrate with residual citrate and organic ligands can promote the adsorption of metal ions if the soil surface has strong affinity for metal ligand complexes mcbride 1985 3 2 3 effect of mn oxides mn oxides generally exist in the soil as nodules coatings scattered weakly crystallized aggregates etc xiong et al 2007 they generally have a lower zpc strong acidic sites and larger specific surface areas these characteristics provide them with a strong ability to adsorb metal ions post 1999 removal of mn oxides from the soil reduced the adsorption capacity of cd fig 3 compared to untreated soil the adsorption capacity of cd decreased from 28 2 c0 200 mg l 1 to 39 4 c0 100 mg l 1 or by 32 4 on average table 3 k d decreased from 45 c0 200 mg l 1 to 64 1 c0 50 mg l 1 or by 59 4 on average table 4 therefore compared with organic matter and free fe oxides mn oxides were more favorable for cd adsorption in the studied soil 3 3 effect of solution chemistry conditions on cd adsorption 3 3 1 effect of solution ph since the soil in the study area is acidic the initial solution ph of the experiment was set between 2 and 7 fig 4 shows the relationship between the adsorption capacity of cd and the ph of the solution as the initial ph from 2 to 3 the adsorption capacity of cd increased sharply from 52 4 to 442 mg kg 1 an increase of 743 5 while k d increased from 1 9 to 55 9 l kg 1 an increase of 2842 1 thereafter when the ph continued to increase the adsorption capacity of cd has no significant change the variation in adsorption capacity with ph may be attributed to competing adsorption sites on soil surfaces between cd and h3o when the ph is low the amount of h3o can be several times greater than that of metal ions and the surface of the adsorbent is more easily covered by h3o resulting in a reduction in metal ion adsorption capacity when the ph increases h3o gradually leave the adsorption site and are replaced by metal ions which similar to that of exchange interactions h cd2 gupta and bhattacharyya 2008 when adsorption reaches equilibrium the ph of the equilibrium solution tends to return to the ph of the soil the regression of the ph concentrated between 4 5 and 5 slightly lower than the actual ph of the soil this regression trend of the ph may be caused by the buffering effect of the soil on acid and alkali the phpzc of the soil was identified as the ph at which the 0 1 m hno3 titration curves of different soil masses 0 15 0 25 and 0 35 g suspended in 0 03 m nano3 at ph 12 0 converged with that of the reactive blank solution öztürk et al 2014 the phpzc of the soil obtained through this method was 2 80 when the ph was higher than phpzc the surface of the soil was negatively charged this was beneficial for the electrostatic adsorption of cd in addition the adsorption of cd at a ph lower than phpzc is observed in this experiment this may be because the surface of the soil still has a few negative sites when the ph is lower than phpzc kim 2014 in addition to the electrostatic force ion exchange and complexation were also reported as important factors that affect the adsorption of cationic metals by the adsorbent fiol and villaescusa 2009 3 3 2 effect of ionic strength the ionic strength of the background electrolytes also affects the adsorption of cd the commonly used background electrolytes include nano3 kno3 ca no3 2 nac1 cac12 generally nano3 is the most used because the radius of the univalent na ion is smaller than that of the bivalent ca2 ion moreover the radii of ca2 and cd2 are similar therefore the influence of ca2 on cd2 adsorption is greater than that of na cl has been shown to have a greater influence on cd2 adsorption than no3 for example temminghoff et al 1995 found that when the ion strength of cano3 and nano3 increased from 0 003 to 0 3 mol l 1 the cd adsorption capacity decreased by 60 and 25 respectively furthermore neither nitrate nor sodium salts precipitate easily therefore nano3 was selected as the background electrolyte for this experiment as fig 5 shows for the same initial concentration of cd the adsorption capacity of cd table 5 and kd table 6 decreased gradually as the ionic strength increased from 0 001 mol l 1 nano3 to 0 1 mol l 1 nano3 the adsorption capacity of cd decreased from 37 8 c0 10 mg l 1 to 58 5 c0 50 mg l 1 while k d decreased from 72 7 c0 200 mg l 1 to 88 7 c0 10 mg l 1 for the same ionic strength as the initial concentration of cd increased the adsorption capacity of cd increased from 762 4 i 0 1 m to 1275 i 0 01 m while k d decreased 65 2 i 0 01 m to 89 8 i 0 001 m ionic strength affects cd adsorption in the following ways 1 the increase in the ionic strength can compete with cd for sites on the surface of the soil wang et al 2013 the reactions of cd with sites i e sioh aloh feoh mnoh h2a h2b on the soil surface are shown below in terms of clay minerals eqs 2 4 fe mn oxides 5 7 and organic matter 8 11 choi 1995 unlabelled table sioh cd2 sio cd2 h 2 sioh cd2 h2o sio cdoh 2h 3 aloh cd2 alocd h 4 feoh cd2 feocd h 5 mnoh cd2 mnocd h 6 mnoh cd2 h2o mnocdoh 2h 7 h2a cd2 cdha h 8 h2a cd2 cda 2h 9 h2b cd2 cdhb h 10 h2b cd2 cdb 2h 11 2 the increase in the ionic strength can reduce the activity of metal ions due to the increased concentration of accompanying anions in the electrolyte solution which can result in the formation of soluble and stable complexes with heavy metals these complexes are not easily adsorbed by the solid soil components malamis and katsou 2013 3 3 3 effect of background electrolytes fig 6 shows the effect of different background cations on cd adsorption it can be seen that the background cations can significantly affect the cd adsorption the effect of background cations on adsorption capacity table 7 and the distribution coefficient k d table 8 at the same initial concentration are in the following order ca2 mg2 k na the effect of background cations on cd adsorption can be seen as a competition for adsorption sites on the soil surface with cd hu et al 2014 as for the effect of monovalent cations on cd adsorption k is greater than na which may be related to the radii of hydration of these two cations where the radius of k is smaller than that of na i e na 2 76 å and k 2 32 å the smaller the hydration radius the easier it is to interact with the functional groups on the soil surface hu et al 2014 such that the effect of k on cd adsorption is greater than that of na pan et al 2011 studied th iv adsorbed by sodium bentonite and dong et al 2012 studied 109cd ii adsorbed by γ al2o3 and both came to the same conclusion the effects of divalent mg2 and ca2 on cd adsorption were greater than that of monovalent na and k there are mainly three reasons for the latter firstly increasing the background cation valence causes the decrease in the negative potential in the plane of adsorption therefore reducing the adsorption of cd loganathan et al 2012 secondly the divalent background cations can occupy twice the number of adsorption sites by forming so 2 mg ca pan et al 2011 thirdly the electrostatic attraction of divalent cations on the soil surface is greater than that of monovalent cations hu et al 2014 fig 7 show the effect of different anions on cd adsorption according to the experimental results the difference between the effect of anions no3 so4 2 cl on cd adsorption table 7 is less than for cations for the same initial concentration of cd k d cl k d so4 2 k d no3 table 8 and therefore the effect of background anions on cd adsorption are in the following order cl so4 2 no3 there are mainly two reasons for the latter 1 no3 so4 2 and cl could form anion soluble metal water complexes in solution insofar as so4 2 and cl complex readily with cd2 zhao et al 2003 and 2 compared with no3 cl more readily forms idiocratic sorption on the soil surface and occupies more ionic exchange sites than no3 dai et al 2013 fan et al 2008 3 4 adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics 3 4 1 adsorption thermodynamics the physicochemical properties of metal ions in the aqueous environment were directly affected by temperature the cd adsorption isotherms at 293 15 301 15 and 313 15 k are shown in fig 8 the figure shows that the adsorption isotherm at low temperature is lower than that at high temperature that is the adsorption capacity of cd increases with rising temperature this may be attributed to the fact that high temperature favors the diffusion of metal ions in the internal pores of the sorbent and on the external surface of the solid liquid interface wang et al 2019 the values of entropy δs0 and enthalpy δh0 were calculated from the slopes and intercepts of the plot of lnkd vs 1 t fig 8 by eq 12 the gibbs free energy δg0 was calculated by eq 13 pan et al 2011 12 ln k d δ s 0 r δ h 0 rt 13 δ g 0 δ h 0 t δ s 0 where r 8 3145 j mol 1 k 1 is the ideal gas constant and t k is the kelvin temperature the calculated results are presented in table 9 as the table 9 shows the values of δh0 are positive which indicates the overall process of adsorption of cd is endothermic while the values of δg0 are negative which indicates that under the experimental conditions the adsorption of cd is a spontaneous process δg0 decreases with increasing temperature which means that higher temperatures are more conducive to the adsorption of cd δs0 is positive which indicates an affinity of soil towards cd in the solutions suggesting probable structural changes in the adsorbents chen and wang 2006 3 4 2 adsorption kinetics the kinetics process of cd adsorption is shown in fig 9 the adsorption percentage was calculated using the following equation 14 adsorption c 0 c e c 0 100 as fig 9 a shows the adsorption of cd increase rapidly in the first 30 min the adsorption reached 84 1 c0 10 mg l 1 and 62 6 c0 100 mg l 1 between 30 min and 24 h the adsorption changed only slightly the rapid adsorption velocity and high adsorption percentage indicate that surface complexation or chemisorption contributes more to cd adsorption rather than physical adsorption on the soil fan et al 2008 the pseudo second order rate model was used to describe the kinetics of the adsorption chen and wang 2006 as follows 15 t q t 1 2 k q e 2 1 q e t where q t mg g 1 is the adsorption capacity of cd on soil after a specified reaction time t min k g mg 1 h 1 is the pseudo second order rate constant of adsorption and q e mg g 1 is the equilibrium adsorption capacity linear plot feature of t qt vs t is presented in fig 9 b the values of k and q e as calculated from the intercept and slope are given in table 10 r2 0 9999 is very close to 1 suggesting that a pseudo second order rate model is suitable to describe the cd adsorption process and chemical sorption probably serves as the rate controlling step ho and mckay 2000 according to the langmuir equation zhao et al 2014 the adsorption capacity of cd of the studied soil was 2 58 mg g 1 from table 11 the adsorption capacity of different cd adsorbents varies greatly this may be related to the mineral composition surface structure morphology surface area and related properties of the adsorbents öztürk et al 2014 4 conclusions in this study selective chemical extraction and adsorption experiments results revealed that organic matter and mn oxides specially the latter can enhance the adsorption of cd but free fe oxides may hinder the adsorption of cd in soil the adsorption capacity rapidly increases in the ph range of 2 3 and does not change significantly in the ph range of 3 7 the adsorption capacity of cd decreases gradually as ionic strength increases the effect of the background electrolyte divalent cations ca2 and mg2 is greater than that of the monovalent cations k and na where ca2 has the greatest effect and na has the least the effect of the anion no3 is smaller than those of so4 2 and cl and there is no significant difference between the effects of so4 2 and cl the adsorption of cd on soil is a spontaneous endothermic process and a pseudo second order rate model is suitable to describe the process of cd adsorption well the conclusions of this study amplify the understanding of the mechanism of cd adsorption in the studied soil and provide supporting data for the management of the mine s acid mine water discharge and the use of chemical especially ca containing fertilizers it is necessary to study the surface characteristics and mechanism of cd adsorption by the soil which removed free fe oxides via the dcb method and use soil without free fe oxides as an adsorbent with which to conduct research on a remediation technology for the cd contaminated soil in the study area acknowledgment thanks to hongtao li for his help in the

different concentrations of cd were configured with cd no3 2 4h2o the ratio of soil to water was 1 20 in all adsorption tests the ionic strength of all experiments was 0 01 m except for the experiments associated with the influence of ionic strength the ph of all the experiments were adjusted to a ph value of 5 28 0 2 using hno3 and naoh except for the experiments of ph influence the temperature of all experiments was 25 0 2 c except for the experiments with regard to the influence of temperature all experiments were conducted with a constant agitation at 180 rpm for 24 h except for the kinetic experiment for the influence of different background electrolytes the background electrolytes were 0 01 m solution for the cations k na ca2 and mg2 and anions so4 2 no3 and cl after adsorption the liquid phases and solid phase was separated by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 min the supernatants were filtered through a 0 45 μm needle filter the concentration of cd was analyzed by aas ggx 9 beijing haiguang instrument co china all experimental data and statistical analyses were processed using microsoft excel and the relative errors p 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 xrd and ftir analyses fig 1 is the xrd pattern of the alluvial soil the main mineral are quartz muscovite and feldspar the characteristic peaks of clay minerals aren t obvious probably because the clay minerals are poorly crystallized resulting in low and broad diffraction peaks it is also that clay minerals possible be coated by other soil components causing the diffraction peaks of clay minerals disappear xiong 1985 ft ir spectra of the studied soil samples before the adsorption experiments is presented in fig 2 in the spectra the typical band at 3620 cm 1 could be related to the stretching mode of the oh bands likely indicating the presence of free surface adsorbed water vithanage et al 2013 and the band at 1630 cm 1 could be ascribed to the oh vibrations of aromatic and carboxylates of humic substances piccolo et al 1992 the band at 1030 cm 1 could be related to the sio vibrations of silicate mineral guo et al 2013 the band at 797 cm 1 accompanies an inflexion at 779 cm 1 indicating the existence of quartz the band at 533 cm 1 could be the al o si deformation of montmorillonite medina et al 2017 3 2 effect of soil components on cd adsorption the distribution coefficient k d expresses the ratio of the element s concentration in the solid phase to that in the solution phase after a specified reaction time eq 1 the larger the value of k d the easier its adsorption by the soil and the less migratory k d can readily compare the adsorption capacity of different soils for a certain heavy metal under the same experimental conditions 1 k d c 0 c e c e v m q e c e where c e is the element s concentration in the supernatant solution after a specified reaction time mg l 1 c 0 is the initial concentration of the element in the solution mg l 1 v is the solution volume ml m is the soil mass g and q e is the element s concentration in the soil mg kg 1 3 2 1 effect of organic matter soil organic matter exhibits high cation exchange capacity cec values and has a vast variety of functional groups which mainly affect the adsorption behavior of cd in soil by ion exchange surface complexation and precipitation bradl 2004 after removal of organic matter the adsorption capacity of cd decreased by 0 4 c0 50 mg l 1 to 7 8 c0 30 mg l 1 or 4 on average compared to untreated soil table 3 k d decreased 1 3 c0 50 mg l 1 to 25 2 c0 30 mg l 1 or 11 8 on average compared to untreated soil table 4 therefore the removal of organic matter reduces the adsorption capacity of cd fig 3 the ability of soil to absorb cd is generally reduced after the removal of organic matter this may be because the latter results in the reduction of the cation exchange sites on the surface of the soil jiao et al 2005 however several studies also reported that removal of organic matter had little effect on cd adsorption reid and mcduffie 1981 petruzelli et al 1978 the effect of organic matter on cd adsorption depends mainly on the content and forms of the former zhao et al 2014 studied two different types of purple paddy soil and found that the soil with a high content of organic matter had a lower cd adsorption after the removal of organic matter wang and chen 1991 found that when organic matter covered the surface of clay minerals the specific surface area of the soil was reduced after the organic matter was removed this led to the decrease in the number of the adsorption sites and reduced the cd adsorption capacity however if organic matter is present within the interlayer of the 2 1 expanding clay minerals it will prevent cd from approaching the adsorption sites in the interlayer the removal of organic matter also leads to only a small loss of the specific surface area therefore it has little effect on cd adsorption 3 2 2 effect of free fe oxides free fe oxides in soils generally provide specific adsorption sites for metal ions bradl 2004 due to the differences in physicochemical characteristics of the soil the adsorption capacity of cd is often different after removal of free fe oxides using the dcb method li et al 2015 removal of free fe oxides in the studied soil increased the adsorption capacity of cd fig 3 compared to untreated soil the adsorption capacity of cd increased from 27 2 c0 10 mg l 1 to 82 5 c0 200 mg l 1 or by 45 5 on average table 3 k d increased from 547 8 c0 50 mg l 1 to 1670 2 c0 200 mg l 1 or by 923 8 on average table 4 there may be three reasons for the latter 1 generally fe oxides in soil have a positive charge and the removal of fe oxide coatings on the soil surface reduces the zero points of charges zpc exposing the negative surface charge sites were previously combined with the fe oxides li et al 2015 and 2 the removal of free fe oxide coatings crystalline and non crystalline exposes the layered silicate minerals and oh on the surface of the silicate minerals can form hydroxide precipitates meoh 2 with metal ions agbenin and olojo 2004 3 it is also possible that cd can form cd citrate with residual citrate and organic ligands can promote the adsorption of metal ions if the soil surface has strong affinity for metal ligand complexes mcbride 1985 3 2 3 effect of mn oxides mn oxides generally exist in the soil as nodules coatings scattered weakly crystallized aggregates etc xiong et al 2007 they generally have a lower zpc strong acidic sites and larger specific surface areas these characteristics provide them with a strong ability to adsorb metal ions post 1999 removal of mn oxides from the soil reduced the adsorption capacity of cd fig 3 compared to untreated soil the adsorption capacity of cd decreased from 28 2 c0 200 mg l 1 to 39 4 c0 100 mg l 1 or by 32 4 on average table 3 k d decreased from 45 c0 200 mg l 1 to 64 1 c0 50 mg l 1 or by 59 4 on average table 4 therefore compared with organic matter and free fe oxides mn oxides were more favorable for cd adsorption in the studied soil 3 3 effect of solution chemistry conditions on cd adsorption 3 3 1 effect of solution ph since the soil in the study area is acidic the initial solution ph of the experiment was set between 2 and 7 fig 4 shows the relationship between the adsorption capacity of cd and the ph of the solution as the initial ph from 2 to 3 the adsorption capacity of cd increased sharply from 52 4 to 442 mg kg 1 an increase of 743 5 while k d increased from 1 9 to 55 9 l kg 1 an increase of 2842 1 thereafter when the ph continued to increase the adsorption capacity of cd has no significant change the variation in adsorption capacity with ph may be attributed to competing adsorption sites on soil surfaces between cd and h3o when the ph is low the amount of h3o can be several times greater than that of metal ions and the surface of the adsorbent is more easily covered by h3o resulting in a reduction in metal ion adsorption capacity when the ph increases h3o gradually leave the adsorption site and are replaced by metal ions which similar to that of exchange interactions h cd2 gupta and bhattacharyya 2008 when adsorption reaches equilibrium the ph of the equilibrium solution tends to return to the ph of the soil the regression of the ph concentrated between 4 5 and 5 slightly lower than the actual ph of the soil this regression trend of the ph may be caused by the buffering effect of the soil on acid and alkali the phpzc of the soil was identified as the ph at which the 0 1 m hno3 titration curves of different soil masses 0 15 0 25 and 0 35 g suspended in 0 03 m nano3 at ph 12 0 converged with that of the reactive blank solution öztürk et al 2014 the phpzc of the soil obtained through this method was 2 80 when the ph was higher than phpzc the surface of the soil was negatively charged this was beneficial for the electrostatic adsorption of cd in addition the adsorption of cd at a ph lower than phpzc is observed in this experiment this may be because the surface of the soil still has a few negative sites when the ph is lower than phpzc kim 2014 in addition to the electrostatic force ion exchange and complexation were also reported as important factors that affect the adsorption of cationic metals by the adsorbent fiol and villaescusa 2009 3 3 2 effect of ionic strength the ionic strength of the background electrolytes also affects the adsorption of cd the commonly used background electrolytes include nano3 kno3 ca no3 2 nac1 cac12 generally nano3 is the most used because the radius of the univalent na ion is smaller than that of the bivalent ca2 ion moreover the radii of ca2 and cd2 are similar therefore the influence of ca2 on cd2 adsorption is greater than that of na cl has been shown to have a greater influence on cd2 adsorption than no3 for example temminghoff et al 1995 found that when the ion strength of cano3 and nano3 increased from 0 003 to 0 3 mol l 1 the cd adsorption capacity decreased by 60 and 25 respectively furthermore neither nitrate nor sodium salts precipitate easily therefore nano3 was selected as the background electrolyte for this experiment as fig 5 shows for the same initial concentration of cd the adsorption capacity of cd table 5 and kd table 6 decreased gradually as the ionic strength increased from 0 001 mol l 1 nano3 to 0 1 mol l 1 nano3 the adsorption capacity of cd decreased from 37 8 c0 10 mg l 1 to 58 5 c0 50 mg l 1 while k d decreased from 72 7 c0 200 mg l 1 to 88 7 c0 10 mg l 1 for the same ionic strength as the initial concentration of cd increased the adsorption capacity of cd increased from 762 4 i 0 1 m to 1275 i 0 01 m while k d decreased 65 2 i 0 01 m to 89 8 i 0 001 m ionic strength affects cd adsorption in the following ways 1 the increase in the ionic strength can compete with cd for sites on the surface of the soil wang et al 2013 the reactions of cd with sites i e sioh aloh feoh mnoh h2a h2b on the soil surface are shown below in terms of clay minerals eqs 2 4 fe mn oxides 5 7 and organic matter 8 11 choi 1995 unlabelled table sioh cd2 sio cd2 h 2 sioh cd2 h2o sio cdoh 2h 3 aloh cd2 alocd h 4 feoh cd2 feocd h 5 mnoh cd2 mnocd h 6 mnoh cd2 h2o mnocdoh 2h 7 h2a cd2 cdha h 8 h2a cd2 cda 2h 9 h2b cd2 cdhb h 10 h2b cd2 cdb 2h 11 2 the increase in the ionic strength can reduce the activity of metal ions due to the increased concentration of accompanying anions in the electrolyte solution which can result in the formation of soluble and stable complexes with heavy metals these complexes are not easily adsorbed by the solid soil components malamis and katsou 2013 3 3 3 effect of background electrolytes fig 6 shows the effect of different background cations on cd adsorption it can be seen that the background cations can significantly affect the cd adsorption the effect of background cations on adsorption capacity table 7 and the distribution coefficient k d table 8 at the same initial concentration are in the following order ca2 mg2 k na the effect of background cations on cd adsorption can be seen as a competition for adsorption sites on the soil surface with cd hu et al 2014 as for the effect of monovalent cations on cd adsorption k is greater than na which may be related to the radii of hydration of these two cations where the radius of k is smaller than that of na i e na 2 76 å and k 2 32 å the smaller the hydration radius the easier it is to interact with the functional groups on the soil surface hu et al 2014 such that the effect of k on cd adsorption is greater than that of na pan et al 2011 studied th iv adsorbed by sodium bentonite and dong et al 2012 studied 109cd ii adsorbed by γ al2o3 and both came to the same conclusion the effects of divalent mg2 and ca2 on cd adsorption were greater than that of monovalent na and k there are mainly three reasons for the latter firstly increasing the background cation valence causes the decrease in the negative potential in the plane of adsorption therefore reducing the adsorption of cd loganathan et al 2012 secondly the divalent background cations can occupy twice the number of adsorption sites by forming so 2 mg ca pan et al 2011 thirdly the electrostatic attraction of divalent cations on the soil surface is greater than that of monovalent cations hu et al 2014 fig 7 show the effect of different anions on cd adsorption according to the experimental results the difference between the effect of anions no3 so4 2 cl on cd adsorption table 7 is less than for cations for the same initial concentration of cd k d cl k d so4 2 k d no3 table 8 and therefore the effect of background anions on cd adsorption are in the following order cl so4 2 no3 there are mainly two reasons for the latter 1 no3 so4 2 and cl could form anion soluble metal water complexes in solution insofar as so4 2 and cl complex readily with cd2 zhao et al 2003 and 2 compared with no3 cl more readily forms idiocratic sorption on the soil surface and occupies more ionic exchange sites than no3 dai et al 2013 fan et al 2008 3 4 adsorption thermodynamics and kinetics 3 4 1 adsorption thermodynamics the physicochemical properties of metal ions in the aqueous environment were directly affected by temperature the cd adsorption isotherms at 293 15 301 15 and 313 15 k are shown in fig 8 the figure shows that the adsorption isotherm at low temperature is lower than that at high temperature that is the adsorption capacity of cd increases with rising temperature this may be attributed to the fact that high temperature favors the diffusion of metal ions in the internal pores of the sorbent and on the external surface of the solid liquid interface wang et al 2019 the values of entropy δs0 and enthalpy δh0 were calculated from the slopes and intercepts of the plot of lnkd vs 1 t fig 8 by eq 12 the gibbs free energy δg0 was calculated by eq 13 pan et al 2011 12 ln k d δ s 0 r δ h 0 rt 13 δ g 0 δ h 0 t δ s 0 where r 8 3145 j mol 1 k 1 is the ideal gas constant and t k is the kelvin temperature the calculated results are presented in table 9 as the table 9 shows the values of δh0 are positive which indicates the overall process of adsorption of cd is endothermic while the values of δg0 are negative which indicates that under the experimental conditions the adsorption of cd is a spontaneous process δg0 decreases with increasing temperature which means that higher temperatures are more conducive to the adsorption of cd δs0 is positive which indicates an affinity of soil towards cd in the solutions suggesting probable structural changes in the adsorbents chen and wang 2006 3 4 2 adsorption kinetics the kinetics process of cd adsorption is shown in fig 9 the adsorption percentage was calculated using the following equation 14 adsorption c 0 c e c 0 100 as fig 9 a shows the adsorption of cd increase rapidly in the first 30 min the adsorption reached 84 1 c0 10 mg l 1 and 62 6 c0 100 mg l 1 between 30 min and 24 h the adsorption changed only slightly the rapid adsorption velocity and high adsorption percentage indicate that surface complexation or chemisorption contributes more to cd adsorption rather than physical adsorption on the soil fan et al 2008 the pseudo second order rate model was used to describe the kinetics of the adsorption chen and wang 2006 as follows 15 t q t 1 2 k q e 2 1 q e t where q t mg g 1 is the adsorption capacity of cd on soil after a specified reaction time t min k g mg 1 h 1 is the pseudo second order rate constant of adsorption and q e mg g 1 is the equilibrium adsorption capacity linear plot feature of t qt vs t is presented in fig 9 b the values of k and q e as calculated from the intercept and slope are given in table 10 r2 0 9999 is very close to 1 suggesting that a pseudo second order rate model is suitable to describe the cd adsorption process and chemical sorption probably serves as the rate controlling step ho and mckay 2000 according to the langmuir equation zhao et al 2014 the adsorption capacity of cd of the studied soil was 2 58 mg g 1 from table 11 the adsorption capacity of different cd adsorbents varies greatly this may be related to the mineral composition surface structure morphology surface area and related properties of the adsorbents öztürk et al 2014 4 conclusions in this study selective chemical extraction and adsorption experiments results revealed that organic matter and mn oxides specially the latter can enhance the adsorption of cd but free fe oxides may hinder the adsorption of cd in soil the adsorption capacity rapidly increases in the ph range of 2 3 and does not change significantly in the ph range of 3 7 the adsorption capacity of cd decreases gradually as ionic strength increases the effect of the background electrolyte divalent cations ca2 and mg2 is greater than that of the monovalent cations k and na where ca2 has the greatest effect and na has the least the effect of the anion no3 is smaller than those of so4 2 and cl and there is no significant difference between the effects of so4 2 and cl the adsorption of cd on soil is a spontaneous endothermic process and a pseudo second order rate model is suitable to describe the process of cd adsorption well the conclusions of this study amplify the understanding of the mechanism of cd adsorption in the studied soil and provide supporting data for the management of the mine s acid mine water discharge and the use of chemical especially ca containing fertilizers it is necessary to study the surface characteristics and mechanism of cd adsorption by the soil which removed free fe oxides via the dcb method and use soil without free fe oxides as an adsorbent with which to conduct research on a remediation technology for the cd contaminated soil in the study area acknowledgment thanks to hongtao li for his help in the

1521,in recent years there has been a growth in the number of products containing ag nanoparticles agnps in many areas and their use suggests that the water soil environment may be exposed to the contaminant with different ag species therefore the sorption of two ag forms i e ag i ions and nanoparticles agnps on clay minerals montmorillonite and kaolinite and iron oxyhydr oxides ferrihydrite as a function of solution mineral ratio 100 1 250 1 500 1 solution ph 3 0 5 5 and 7 0 and initial ag concentration 0 1 100 mg dm3 was studied using batch method in addition the binding strength mobility of the bonded ag species was researched the results show a great sorption potential of clay minerals for both ag forms and lower sorption capacity of ferrihydrite in particular for ag i ions the maximum sorption capacities of montmorillonite kaolinite and ferrihydrite estimated from three parameter isotherm model of sips were 94 39 mg g 117 8 mg g and 26 48 mg g for agnps and 17 92 mg g 21 14 mg g and 3 072 mg g for ag i ions respectively aggregation process plays an important role in sorption and mobility of agnps the sequential extraction study indicated different binding mechanisms of the ag forms onto the clay minerals and ferrihydrite which depended on the active sites of minerals as well as the ag species nature in the solution ag i was weakly bound by clay minerals but presence of iron oxyhydr oxides decreased the ag i mobility and bioavailability on the other hand agnps bound with the active centers of minerals in a very strong way and were not able to release into water the study of the binding of ag forms by clay minerals and oxyhydr oxides allows to determine the influence of their physicochemical and structural properties including e g pore size on ag sorption these results allow these properties to be taken into account in the study of environmental samples including waters and soils moreover the results showed that in the study of behavior of ag forms in contact with the minerals in addition to the sorption capacity the susceptibility to their release is very important studies on sorption desorption of agnps and ag i ions as a form of oxidation of agnps is important for understanding the transport and fate of the ag species in soil sediments and surface water because of different their behavior in contact with the minerals graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ag nanoparticles clay minerals iron oxyhydr oxides sorption sequential extraction 1 introduction due to the rapid nanotechnology expansion and growing range of nanomaterials nanometals nanometal oxides in production and development from the beginning of the 21st century it is essential to take their potential impacts on humans and environment into consideration silver ag is the most common nano material listed in various products its popularity is caused by its special antimicrobial properties fabrega et al 2011 windler et al 2013 the ag nanoparticles agnps are present in over 250 consumer products such as domestic devices fridges vacuum cleaners air conditioning paints and varnish textiles fabrics and clothes sportswear t shirts and socks plastics cosmetics and detergents and also medical products surgical gowns dressing bandages catheters infusion systems medical textiles fabrega et al 2011 krzyżewska et al 2016 additionally because of high electrical and thermal conductivity they are increasingly being applied in the microelectronics areas zhang et al 2016 the estimated global production of ag nanoparticles agnps amounts to 400 tons annually pourzahedi and eckelman 2015 during washing abrading or discarding of agnps containing products ag can leak into wastewater enriched wastewater stream in silver afterwards ag can reach wastewater treatment facilities and finally end up in surface water bodies that may be used as sources of drinking water benn and westerhoff 2008 geranio et al 2009 tugulea et al 2014 moreover ag may enter groundwater through the contact between surface water and groundwater agnps may be released into the aquatic system and soils also from sewage sludge used as a fertilizer and from the air in the aerosol form pachapur et al 2016 the use of agnps containing products suggests that the water soil environment may be exposed to the contaminant with different ag species depending on the environmental conditions and the particles properties kaegi et al 2013 mcgillicuddy et al 2017 ag can enter the aquatic environment in the form of isolated nanoparticles nanoparticle aggregates or soluble monovalent ions ag i benn and westerhoff 2008 geranio et al 2009 in aquatic environment agnps undergo physical and chemical transformation they can be aggregated and hetero aggregated in the presence of minerals wang et al 2019 one of the most important steps of agnps transformation is release of ag i ion according to reaction between dissolved molecular oxygen and nanosilver in water described by the following equation agnp 0 1 4o 2 h aq ag 1 2h 2 o the monovalent ion does not hydrolyze appreciably in solution and is considered to be a mild oxidizing agent depending on the chemistry of the water and the presence of ions chloride sulfide the following may be formed products such as silver chloride agcl ag2s ag2o and ag i complexes e g agcl in sea water ag2s may not be the most thermodynamically stable form of silver compounds but it still will persist in aquatic environments due to its intensely slow reaction kinetics zhang et al 2016 co occurring na ca2 and k may also compete with ag i for the sorption and or the cations may enhance aggregation of agnps wang et al 2015 both ag forms ions and nanoparticles are toxic to the aquatic and terrestrial microorganisms upon release to the environment agnps will accumulate in natural soils suspension and sediment posing potential risks to the environment ecosystem and human health the toxicity of agnps to organisms depend on the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles size grain morphology kind of coating their concentration and soil sediments properties during agnps translocation ag i ions can release from agnps resulting in oxidative stress through disturbing cell function causing phytotoxicity by binding to cell components and modifying their activities sakamoto et al 2015 since agnps can be taken up and accumulated in plants they can further pose a risk to human health through invading the food chain and ultimately transferring to the human body stable isotope analysis indicated a close correlation between the ag content in the prey and that in their corresponding predators demonstrating the impact of agnps on ecological receptors and food chains yan and chen 2019 moreover co occurring contaminants interact with agnps suggesting nanoparticles as centers for organic and inorganic co contaminants therefore transport sorption desorption precipitation dissolution and transformation are important aspects for the assessment of the environmental abraham et al 2013 wang et al 2015 neukum 2018 wang et al 2018 the ag transport and behavior in the environmental systems are controlled by changes in the colloidal stability and their interactions with different surface active centers in surface and groundwater priya et al 2013 the sorption by the sediment constituents is one of the most important processes controlling the ag amount retained on the surface of minerals and determining the ag mobility and bioavailability in the aquatic environment ag can uptake on active centers of minerals building the suspended and river sediments when chloride and sulfide ion concentrations in water is low the most effective minerals are secondary minerals such as clay minerals kaolinite montmorillonite illite and oxyhydr oxides of iron ferrihydrite goethite forming during the weathering of primary minerals clay minerals belong to the anisotropic phyllosilicate minerals family their basic structural elements are two dimensional arrays of silicon oxygen tetrahedral and aluminum or magnesium oxygen hydroxyl octahedral a representative of 2 1 type phyllosilicate type is montmorillonite mt and of 1 1 type is kaolinite kaol the structure and chemical composition exchangeable ions silanol si oh or aluminol al2 oh groups at the particle edges and a small crystallite size of the clay minerals are responsible for several of their unique properties such as a large chemically active specific surface area high cation exchange capacity cec and interlamellar surfaces with unusual hydration characteristics ijagbemi et al 2009 tamayo et al 2012 another group of minerals building the sediments in low temperature oxic environments is constituted by iron oxyhydr oxides ferrihydrite goethite with a poor crystalline structure and high surface area guo and barnard 2013 colombo et al 2017 wang et al 2019 they exist as separate particles or surface coating material other mineral particles agnps are the new components in real practice there is not much information on the sorption release of ag species in soil water environment and the fate and behavior of agnps are not well understood the designed study into the ag species sorption by clay and iron oxyhydr oxides minerals and its release as nanoparticles and ions is important for understanding the transport and fate of the ag species in sediments and surface and groundwater the aim of this work was to understand ag i agnps sorption in aquatic systems specially in natural porous media such as minerals building sediment and water suspension interactions of two ag species agnps and ag i as the form of nano silver oxidation with the active centers of montmorillonite kaolinite and ferrihydrite were investigated it was also conducted to examine the mobility and bioavailability of the sorbed forms the sorption mechanisms of ag on the minerals were analyzed with consideration for their physicochemical properties and sorption isotherms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the following clay fractions particle diameter 2 μm were obtained from raw clays with

cornell 2000 and cornell and schwertmann 2003 2 2 methods for determining mineral properties the micromorphology structures and chemical compositions of clay minerals and iron oxyhydr oxides before

drc e 6100 perkin elmer depending on the ag concentration calibrations with four standards at the concentrations between 0 and 3 mg dm3 yielded the optimal linearity r2 0 99 the results allowed for selecting the best conditions for the optimal sorption i e maximum sorption capacity and removal efficiency the effect of initial concentration of ag forms on sorption capacity of the minerals and removal efficiency of ag forms was performed for the initial ag concentrations of 0 1 100 mg dm3 under the best ph and volume of solution conditions obtained in the previous experiment the prepared suspensions were equilibrated with the same procedures as for the previous studies moreover the uv vis spectroscopy cary 50 scan spectrometer varian was used to measure the agnps concentration in the solution for samples at the higher initial concentration 10 mg dm3 the ultrapure water utilized for all the solutions and dilutions was obtained from the milliq system millipore billerica ma usa the sorbed amount of ag onto the mineral phase was calculated according to the following equation 1 q c 0 c eq v m mg g and its removal efficiency from the solution from equation 2 re c 0 c eq c 0 100 where q amount of ag sorbed onto minerals mg g re removal efficiency of ag from the solution c0 ceq initial and equilibrium concentrations of ag in the solution mg dm3 m mineral mass g v solution

suspensions under equilibrium conditions were measured with a ph meter equipped with a combined glass electrode all the sorption samples were studied three times and the mean values are used 2 4 estimation of isotherm parameters by non linear regression two parameter isotherm models such as freundlich freundlich 1906 langmuir langmuir 1916 dubinin radushkevich dubinin 1960 and three parameter isotherm models such as sips sips 1948 were used for modeling sorption isotherm data the correlation of experimental results to an sorption model can help to understand the mechanisms of sorption and the heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface the equations of isotherm models were show in table a1 in appendix a supplementary information this provides a mathematically rigorous method for determining isotherm parameters using the original form of the isotherm equation non linear estimate based on the levenberg marquardt method statistica ver 9 0 software was used in order to evaluate the fit of the isotherm to the experimental data besides the determination coefficient r2 three non linear error functions were examined foo and hameed 2010 and in each case a set of isotherm parameters were determined by minimizing the respective error function across the concentration range studied table a2 the determination coefficients r2 showed the fit between experimental data and isotherm equations while the non linear error functions indicated the fit between the experimental and predicted values of sorption capacity 2 5 desorption and ability to release of sorbed ag species the sequential extraction procedure developed for the ag species by coutris et al 2012 was used to assess the partitioning of ag species sorbed onto the examined minerals at ph 5 5 l s 250 1 and c0 100 mg dm3 for practically monomineral materials the ag distributions in the fraction method provide information only on the main binding sites and the ag binding strength to the mineral and helps to determine the susceptibility to the release of the sorbed ag forms from weakly bond e0 e1 to very strong bond e4 e6 table a3 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of studied minerals the particles of mt showed regular shape and similar size and format to the sheet typical for phyllosilicates sem micrographs fig 2a and the eds analysis showed the following composition al2o3 26 1 sio2 75 5 cao 1 9 mgo 4 5 fe2o3 2 9 and k2o 1 1 the particles of kaol are mostly associated in the face face silica face alumina face manner fig 2b and the eds analysis showed nearly 1 1 atomic distribution of al2o3 49 5 and sio2 49 8 with trace amounts of k2o 0 3 the sem observation of the synthesized fh exhibits pure material without any impurities and homogenous material with a strong aggregation degree typical for fh fig 2c the x ray diffractograms of mt kaol and fh are presented in fig 3 mt sample was monomineral and belonged to the almg montmorillonite sucha and kraus 1998 its presence was recognized due to the characteristic interplanar distances dhkl 15 42 5 11 3 06 å and the strongest reflection shift towards the lower 2 theta angle 17 10 å on the glycolated sample diffractograms the reflection positions of 8 57 and 5 63 å indicate that the share of illite packages in the mt structure did not exceed 5 the position of the most intense reflection on diffractograms 15 42 å fig 3 indicates that the major cations in the inter package space were ca2 and mg2 the mineral composition of the kaol was dominated by kaolinite with trace amounts of illite and quartz fig 3 the kaol presence was observed due to the characteristic reflection on diffractograms with interplanar distances dhkl 7 16 3 58 2 39 å and their disappearance after the sample calcination the x ray diffraction pattern analysis in the range of 19 24 of a non oriented specimen showed that this kaol belonged to an ordered internal structure of kaol type tc illite was identified due to the weak reflection dhkl 10 10 and 3 34 å which creates coincidence with the strongest quartz reflex whose presence confirms an additional reflection of 4 26 å the diffractogram of synthesized iron oxyhydr oxide clearly shows that the only phase was fh with characteristic wide and asymmetric peaks at dhkl 2 5 and 1 5 å fig 3 cornell and schwertmann 2003 mt belongs to mesoporous solids with bottle shaped pores narrow entrance into a wide interior and pores formed between two planes of the varying slope it is confirmed by the isotherm close to type iv with hysteresis loop type b omission the isotherm the pore volume distribution suggests that the studied mineral had mainly pores with a diameter of approx 4 01 nm and was homogeneous the analyses conducted with the n2 sorption desorption revealed that the bet surface area of mt was 54 81 m2 g and the porosity determined with the mercury porosimeter was 60 64 table a4 kaol had a low specific surface area 11 81 m2 g the isotherm does not have a hysteresis loop which is characteristic for mesoporous materials omission the isotherm it is possible to make a conclusion about the low microporosity possibly macroporosity of the material this is indicated by the plot of the pore volume distribution where the values are very small generally low porosity on the y axis the kaol porosity was 70 69 which implies macroporosity pore diameter of fh was 1 89 nm and indicated that material was dominated by micropores the total pore volume was 0 175 cm3 g table a4 the specific surface area of fh was 296 m2 g which matched very well the results usually obtained for fh schwertmann and cornell 2000 cornell and schwertmann 2003 the cec of 1 013 mmol g and 0 2038 mmol g for mt and kaol respectively were consistent with the cec usually found for smectites 0 60 1 50 mmol g essington 2004 and kaolinite 0 028 0 228 mmol g ma and eggleton 1999 cec of fh was very low 0 0930 mmol g table a5 due to the lack of the aluminum compounds in the studied fh the entire exchangeable acidity value was constituted by the h concentration the ph value for the minerals ranged between 3 90 fh and 7 57 mt the phpzc values of the minerals were 6 1 for mt 4 5 for kaol and 7 35 for fh table a5 the minerals were positively charged due to the protonation of the surface when the solution ph was lower than their phpzc values and negatively charged due to the deprotonation of the surface when the solution ph was higher than the phpzc according to the following reactions 3 si oh h si oh 2 or al 2 oh h al 2 oh 2 ph ph pzc 4 si oh si o h or al 2 oh al 2 o h ph ph pzc 3 2 sorption experiment 3 2 1 effect of the volume of solution and ph the influence of the solution volume mineral amount l s and solution ph on the sorption q and removal efficiency re of ag species for the studied minerals is given in fig 4 a b the results show an increasing trend in the ag i ions and agnps sorption with an increasing l s ratio for all the minerals continuous lines in fig 4 which was in accordance with eq 1 at the same time a decreasing trend in the re of the ag i ions for all the minerals was observed dotted lines in fig 4a for agnps it was only seen for fh however the re values of the agnps for the clay minerals depended on the mineral dose only slightly and were on the level of 99 0 5 96 0 8 with increasing l s ratio less surface area was available for sorption due to the decrease in number of active sites on the adsorbent surface which made the penetration of metal ions to the sorption sites more difficult igberase et al 2014 the results of the ph effect on the mineral sorption capacity demonstrate that ph was an important factor mainly in the sorption of the ag i ions since h or oh in the solution affected the mineral surface charge moreover the h and na ions coming from the hno3 or naoh solution used to adjust the initial ph solution to 3 0 and 5 5 or 7 0 respectively may have competed with ag for the sorption at lower and higher ph levels respectively the sorption capacity of minerals for the ag i at the initial concentration of 100 mg dm3 was the highest at ph 5 5 it was observed that the difference between the sorption capacity of the minerals at ph 3 0 and 5 0 was higher than at ph 5 5 and 7 0 as ph lowered the h ions played an important role in the sorption processes and competed with the ag i ions for the sorption sites in the adsorbent they also hindered the ag ion binding and caused an increase in the mineral surface positive charge resulting from the proton sorption on the other hand the na ions competed with the ag i ions for the sorption centers at higher ph at higher ph the negative charge of surface also increased which resulted from the dissociation reaction of the surface functional groups in order to determine the h and na ion role in the ag sorption process two important factor characterizing ion properties must be taken into account i e values of the catledge s ionic potential ratio of element ionic valance z to its ionic radius r and the hydration energy of the ag i h and na cations igwe and abia 2007 the ionic potential value equal to 8 69 nm 1 10 nm 1 and 8 47 nm 1 respectively for the ag i h3o and na shows that the polarizability of the ag i and their affinity towards function groups such as oh were weaker than for the h and stronger than for na the finding demonstrates that the na ions can affected sorption ag i weaker than h moreover the ion hydration energy 490 kj mol for ag i 1090 kj mol for h and 410 kj mol for na ions indicated that the na ion will be more hydrolyzed than ag and h and affected the ag i sorption weaker than h smith 1977 on the other hand the ph solution effect on the agnps sorption was not observed the best conditions for the ag i sorption process were ph 5 5 and l s 250 1 for agnps the values were ph 5 5 and l s 500 1 for further research ph 5 5 and l s 250 1 were selected so as to conduct the sorption desorption of both ag species under the same conditions 3 2 2 sorption capacity of studied minerals the results of the ag sorption onto different mineral phases in the equilibrium concentration function removal efficiency of the ag forms vs initial concentration of ag as well as the values of the final ph in solution vs the equilibrium ag concentration in the solution are given in fig 5 the results indicate that the ag sorption depended on i initial ag concentration ii ag species in the solution and iii type of active centers in minerals at the lower initial ag concentration 0 1 20 mg dm3 the uptake of both ag forms was high and independent of the concentration initial part of curves in fig 5a and kind of the mineral the removal efficiency re of ag was close to 100 fig 5b with an increasing initial concentration of agnps 25 100 mg dm3 a higher differences in ag sorption was observed mt and kaol presented similar behavior towards agnps the maximum sorption capacity was 25 69 2 56 mg g and 25 32 2 12 mg g respectively with re equal to 99 80 0 21 and 98 35 0 34 respectively the fh sorption capacity was slightly lower at the maximum initial concentration it was 22 81 1 75 mg g with re of 88 49 0 24 in all the cases the final ph was higher than mt kaol or similar to fh the initial value of 5 5 and eh potential ranged from 243 4 to 291 3 mv the binding process was above the phpzc values of the clay minerals and below the phpzc of fh table a5 surface of fh posses a positive charge that suggests that iron oxyhydr oxide is favorable site for agnps uptake and electrostatic attractions predominate between negatively charged agnps and positively charged fh however a significantly larger size of agnp up to 18 nm than ag i ion about 0 115 nm causes that the ag nanoparticels cannot enter fh micropores 1 89 nm thereby reducing sorption efficiency especially at high agnps concentrations wang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 observed that the retention of pvp agnps in studied soils was significantly positively correlated with iron oxides content the clay mineral surface charge during the agnps sorption was negative which makes it impossible for them to bind agnps through electrostatic bonds the sorption of ag i ions onto the minerals at concentrations varying from 25 to 100 mg dm3 was lower than the sorption of agnps in particular for fh the maximum sorption capacity values for mt kaol and fh for the ag i ions were 15 39 1 46 mg g 20 72 1 81 mg g and 2 80 0 12 mg g respectively at re values of 50 05 0 34 mt 67 38 0 42 kaol and 9 11 0 09 fh after the sorption process the ph value ranged between 7 17 and 7 03 mt 7 6 7 53 kaol and 4 09 4 24 fh fig 5 it indicates the ag i ions were bound by the clay minerals under neutral mt weakly alkaline kaol or acidic fh ph moreover eh potential was higher than for agnps and ranged from 347 9 to 404 7 mv the good buffering capacity of the clay minerals leads to the ph increase in the equilibrium solutions above their mt and kaol phpzc for fh the ph value was below its phpzc and its surface charge was positive and electrostatic repulsion existed with ag i ions it proves also that there were h ions besides ag i ions in the fh suspension the h ions may compete with the ag ions for the sorption sites and affect and maintain the surface positive charge such conditions may influence the low sorption capacity of fh for the ag i ions the results suggest that the presence of oxyhydr oxides of iron in river sediments and soil may decrease the sorption of ag i ions however under natural conditions due to the chemisorption of anions by iron oxides silicates phosphates and the lowering of the isoelectric point this effect may be lower pieczara and rzepa 2016 when the sorption capacity of minerals for the ag i ions was shown in the mmol g units and compared with the cec for minerals the calculation results indicated that the sorption capacity was below for mt and fh or close to kaol their cec table a5 constantino et al 2017 determined the maximum sorption capacity of two bentonites for ag i at the level of 57 13 mg g and 32 51 mg g for the following conditions adsorbent dose of 20 g dm3 and initial ag i concentration of 1000 mg dm3 the results indicated that the laboratory conditions differed largely from the conditions determined for this study the significantly higher sorption capacity of the two bentonites in the constantino s experiment was caused by the initial solution 10 fold higher and possible complete saturation of the sorption capacity for both bentonites on the other hand the sorption capacities of kaol and fh for agnps were above their cec values only for mt the value was below its cec due to the strong affinity of metal cations towards mt it must be remembered that the research was conducted only up to the initial agnps concentration 100 mg dm3 for which the plateau on the sorption curve was not obtained the high sorption of agnps onto minerals suggests high affinity of nanoparticles for the mineral surface likewise a higher agnps concentration and relatively high concentration of the clay suspension may facilitate the agnps aggregation and sorption of this form on the clay mineral surface the sem image for the clay minerals with sorbed agnps shows that the size of agnps sorbed on the mineral surface were significantly larger than the agnps in the initial solution 8 18 nm the finding confirms the nanoparticle aggregation in presence of the minerals fig 6 the aggregation process plays a significant role in the nanoparticle transformations and depends on critical coagulation concentration aggregation attachment efficiency capping agents agnps preparation methods and salinity ionic strength and ph eh conditions of the environment dastafkan et al 2015 dwivedi et al 2015 and it is thermodynamically favorable process zhang et al 2016 oromieh 2011 also observed the aggregation process for the sorption of agnps onto sandy soil already at the agnps concentration of 2 5 mg dm3 according to wang et al 2019 main sorption mechanism of agnps onto iron oxides is heteroaggregation of agnps goethite hematite in addition aggregation agnp agnp heteroaggregation with iron oxides also reduced dissolution of agnps because at acidic and neutral ph values ferrihydrite is positively charged it is expected that electrostatic attraction with negatively charged agnps should prevail therefore favoring heteroaggregation as the dominant process of fh agnps interactions wang et al 2019 moreover agnps did not undergo oxidation to the ag i ions because the agnps concentration in the final solution measured with the uv vis spectrophotometer was on the similar level as the concentration measured with the aas spectrophotometer and conditions during sorption were weakly oxidizing eh 243 4 291 3 mv according to liu and hurt 2010 the agnps oxidation in neutral mineral soil solutions plays only a minor role and the highest release of ag i is observed at low ph 3 3 sorption isotherm the values of isotherm models parameters obtained using the non linear fitting analysis as well as values of determination coefficient and non linear error functions are summarized in table a6 the relationship between experimental results and calculated isotherm is shown in fig 7 according to table a6 values of determination coefficient r2 are good for freundlich isotherm 0 9622 0 9971 estimated values of kf are higher for agnps sorption on the minerals and indicated higher sorption intensity of nanoparticles values of 1 n closed to 1 for sorption of agnps onto mt and kaol indicated linear sorption and the value of 1 n 1 indicated that chemical sorption occurred for the ag i ions onto the studied minerals as well as agnps on fh the process was favorable under studied conditions banach et al 2016 the langmuir model very well simulates the sorption isotherms of the studied ag species table a6 the langmuir constant kl varied with sorbent surface chemistry and ag forms and was higher for clay minerals than for fh and for sorption of ag i ions on clay minerals than for agnps and for sorption of agnps on fh than ag i the results indicated that the affinity of the clay minerals surface for ag i and bonding energy are much higher than those of fh because of the different structural characteristics of the minerals the values of the maximum sorption capacity ql are higher than the theoretical qmax values for all ag species mineral systems moreover the maximum sorption capacity values were 6 8 times higher than the experimental sorption for agnps on clay minerals which indicates that the sorption isotherm plateau was not reached very high values of coefficients of determination r2 0 991 for all the tested systems suggest monolayer sorption the dubinin radushkevich model describes with adequately the equilibrium data at values of r2 0 9800 estimated values of qd expressed in mg g were higher than the experimental values moreover mean free energy values e for the sorption of the ag i ions onto mt kaol and fh were 13 74 17 41 and 11 91 kj mol respectively and were higher than for agnps sorption 8 82 8 97 and 10 72 kj mol the typical range of bonding energy for ion exchange mechanisms is 8 16 kj mol indicating that chemisorption may play a significant role in the sorption process on the determination coefficient and non linear error functions values table a6 the sips equation seems better than that of langmuir model the maximum sorption capacities qs for ag i ion bonding were higher than those obtained using the langmuir isotherm the parameter ks change in the same manner as the constants kl of the equation of langmuir model moreover values of ms parameter were closed to 1 for sorption of agnps onto clay minerals which suggests reducing the sips equation to the langmuir equation low values of error function confirm this transformation on the other hand differences between values of experimental and calculated according to langmuir and freundlich models show that at lower initial concentration freundlich model is better for characterization of sorption process but at higher initial concentration sorption run according to langmuir model the results obtained using the studied equations show that the best fitted sorption isotherm models for ag i ions and agnps uptake onto studied minerals and agnps on fh were determined to be in the order sips langmuir dubinin radushkevich freundlich moreover it was conducted that the all using equations very good describe the experimental equilibrium data of agnps sorption onto clay minerals fig 7 according to priya et al 2013 the possibility of using a nonlinear isotherm for the agnps sorption from the suspension depends on its stability the sorption of agnps from stable suspensions was nonlinear and best described with the langmuir isotherm however in the case of the agnps sorption from an unstable suspension the sorption isotherms did not follow any classical sorption models which suggests an interplay between aggregation and sorption abraham et al 2013 3 4 release of sorbed ag species and their binding mechanism the ag release results based on the sequential extraction show that the ag binding strength depended on the kind of active sites in minerals and ag forms in the solution fig 8 it can be observed that the sorbed agnps were found mainly in the e4 fraction ranged from 67 05 mt to 82 53 kaol and ranged from 13 61 kaol to 80 11 fh in e5 fraction in the mobile fractions e0 e2 the agnps were bound from 0 11 to 5 99 the results demonstrate that agnps were strongly bound with minerals especially with fh and suggest strong retention in soil and sediments torrent et al 2019 on the other hand the ag i ions were bound in a weaker way than agnps they were bound with the clay minerals mainly in the mobile fractions e1 e2 the ag i ions sorbed onto mt bound in the exchangeable e1 fraction 83 76 and in the e2 fraction though to a lower extent 8 88 only small ag i amounts were detected in the e4 and e5 fractions the ag i ions sorbed onto kaol were bound mainly in the e1 11 78 and e2 80 35 fractions other fractions contained small ag amounts in contrast the ag i ions sorbed onto fh were bound mainly in the e3 68 5 and e1 15 1 fractions the results point out that the fh presence may decrease the ag i ion mobility from the solid phase and also toxicity and bioavailability to living organisms li et al 2004 moreover ag sorbed by the minerals was found in the e0 water soluble fraction which indicates that ag may be bound in the pores of the solid phase mineral pores at a low level varying from 1 23 fh to 7 45 mt the ag i distribution in the fractions was in good agreement with the kind of active centers of minerals mt is a 2 1 clay mineral chemical structure i e na ca 0 33 al mg 2 si4o10 oh2n h2o with two kinds of active centers and may adsorb the ag i cations with two mechanisms 1 cation exchange at the permanent negative charge of external basal surfaces or interlayer region of mt fraction e1 ijagbemi et al 2009 x 2 ca 2 2ag 4 h 2 o x 2 2ag h 2 o 2 ca 2 2 formation of the ag hydroxyl surface complex of the cation and silanol si oh or aluminol al2 oh groups at the particle edges fraction e2 brady et al 1996 s o ag 2h 2 o s o ag h 2 o 2 the distribution pattern of the sorbed ag i ions in both fractions arose from the different affinity of ca2 in the active center in mt the affinity for ca2 was greater in the interlayer space than on the edges on the other hand kaol a 1 1 clay mineral consists of one tetrahedral sheet fused to an octahedral sheet at the chemical formula of al4 si4o10 oh8 and includes a tight interlayer structure it sorbed the ag i ions as a formation of the ag hydroxyl surface complex between the ag i ion and the silanol or aluminol groups at the particle edges e2 fraction sari et al 2007 gu and evans 2008 according to brady et al 1996 the bonds between the ag i ions and negatively charged basal plane surfaces of the kaol particles should be taken into consideration in the sorption mechanism onto kaol the basal and edge kaol surfaces carry different types of functional groups as the surface charge density of the edge is significantly greater when compared to the surface charge densities of the siloxane face and alumina face of the kaol particles at high ph gupta et al 2011 the sequential extraction results did not distinguish these kind of centers on the other hand solely silanol groups bound the ag i ions in the observed ph of 4 to 8 fig 5c as their silica tetrahedral face was negatively charged at ph 4 the aluminol octahedral face is positively charged at ph 8 gupta and miller 2010 in contrast the aluminol groups in clay minerals played a significant role in the agnps binding because nanoparticles were negatively charged under the elaborated conditions at the solution ph 6 5 dastafkan et al 2015 and could be bound by the aluminol groups of the clay minerals on the other hand the silica surfaces were negatively charged under the conditions resulting in the net repulsive electrostatics with the negative charge of agnps under the conditions thio et al 2012 other active centers for sorption in kaol included exchangeable cations that could occupy the external basal kaol surfaces e1 the measured cec value for kaol table a5 was 0 2038 mmol g which denotes the presence of exchangeable cations in its structure and minor contribution of the ion exchange mechanism to the sorption process it confirms the involvement of the e1 fraction of 11 17 in the ag i binding by kaol the variable charge of ferrihydrite fh is due the protonation of the singly and triply coordinated surface groups whereas the doubly coordinated groups are mainly present as fe2oh3 hiemstra 2013 fh bound the ag i ions in the form of complex compounds with formula of fe2oag3 the weak binding strength of the ag i ions and clay mineral active centers and ease to be removed from the clay minerals show that the ag i ions formed outer sphere complexes the ag i ions have two water molecules in the linear form in their first hydration sphere ohtaki 1981 and are not directly bound to the mineral surface the results show that the contribution of the sorbed ag i ions to the bioavailable fraction was high the sorbed ag i may be transferred into the food chain through gradual leaching into water this process may be followed by the uptake by water plants and fish during the water chemistry changes on the other hand agnps were bound with the active centers of all the researched minerals in a very strong way and were not able to release into water an important consequence of the reaction is the reduction in bioavailability and potential risk of agnps in the water environment 4 conclusions the study investigated the sorption capacities of montmorillonite kaolinite and ferrihydrite ph solution 3 0 5 5 7 0 solution l mineral s ratio 100 1 250 500 1 and initial concentration of ag 0 1 100 mg dm3 effect on the uptake of two ag species ag i and agnps and ag mobility an increasing trend in the ag i ions and agnps sorption with an increasing l s ratio for all minerals was observed values of ph was an important factor mainly in the sorption of the ag i ions since h or oh in the solution affected the mineral surface charge the results show a great sorption potential of clay minerals for both ag forms and lower sorption capacity of fh for ag i ions at the lower initial ag concentration ranging from 0 1 mg dm3 to 20 mg dm3 the uptake of both ag forms was high and independent of the initial concentration and kind of the mineral and the removal efficiency of ag was close to 100 the estimated maximum sorption capacities changed according to the kaol mt fh order and it was 117 8 mg g 94 39 mg g and 26 48 mg g for agnps and 21 14 mg g 17 92 mg g and 3 072 mg g for ag i ions respectively the best fitted sorption isotherm models for ag i ions and agnps were determined to be in the order sips langmuir dubinin radushkevich freundlich these results suggest that the mechanism of ag binding is complex and does not follow the ideal monolayer adsorption moreover the agnps aggregation was observed during the sorption process research on the release of the sorbed agnps indicated that they were strongly bound with minerals especially with fh and suggest strong retention in soil and sediments ag i ions were bound with the montmorillonite and kaolinite mainly in the mobile fractions with two mechanisms cation exchange at the permanent negative charge of external basal surfaces or interlayer region and formation of the ag hydroxyl surface complex of the cation and groups at the particle edges respectively fh bound the ag i ions in the non mobile form of complex compounds with formula of fe2oag3 the contribution of the sorbed ag i ions to the bioavailable fraction of clay minerals was high but iron oxyhydr oxides decreased the ag i mobility 5 recommendations for further study the study of behavior of agnps and ag i ions in presence of montmorillonite kaolinite and ferrihydrite presented in article was performed from solution at low ionic strength of 1 5 mm of sodium nitrate nano3 therefore it is postulated to evaluation of effect of ionic strength with na and ca2 on sorption desorption of ag species on clay minerals and oxyhydr oxides at the other laboratory parameters as in the article different ionic strength will simulate different saline of solution at the same time na and ca2 will show effect of monovalent and divalent competing ion on uptake of ag forms acknowledgements the study was financially supported by the national science center

1521,in recent years there has been a growth in the number of products containing ag nanoparticles agnps in many areas and their use suggests that the water soil environment may be exposed to the contaminant with different ag species therefore the sorption of two ag forms i e ag i ions and nanoparticles agnps on clay minerals montmorillonite and kaolinite and iron oxyhydr oxides ferrihydrite as a function of solution mineral ratio 100 1 250 1 500 1 solution ph 3 0 5 5 and 7 0 and initial ag concentration 0 1 100 mg dm3 was studied using batch method in addition the binding strength mobility of the bonded ag species was researched the results show a great sorption potential of clay minerals for both ag forms and lower sorption capacity of ferrihydrite in particular for ag i ions the maximum sorption capacities of montmorillonite kaolinite and ferrihydrite estimated from three parameter isotherm model of sips were 94 39 mg g 117 8 mg g and 26 48 mg g for agnps and 17 92 mg g 21 14 mg g and 3 072 mg g for ag i ions respectively aggregation process plays an important role in sorption and mobility of agnps the sequential extraction study indicated different binding mechanisms of the ag forms onto the clay minerals and ferrihydrite which depended on the active sites of minerals as well as the ag species nature in the solution ag i was weakly bound by clay minerals but presence of iron oxyhydr oxides decreased the ag i mobility and bioavailability on the other hand agnps bound with the active centers of minerals in a very strong way and were not able to release into water the study of the binding of ag forms by clay minerals and oxyhydr oxides allows to determine the influence of their physicochemical and structural properties including e g pore size on ag sorption these results allow these properties to be taken into account in the study of environmental samples including waters and soils moreover the results showed that in the study of behavior of ag forms in contact with the minerals in addition to the sorption capacity the susceptibility to their release is very important studies on sorption desorption of agnps and ag i ions as a form of oxidation of agnps is important for understanding the transport and fate of the ag species in soil sediments and surface water because of different their behavior in contact with the minerals

socks plastics cosmetics and detergents and also medical products surgical gowns dressing bandages catheters infusion systems medical textiles fabrega et al 2011 krzyżewska et al 2016 additionally because of high electrical and thermal conductivity they are increasingly being applied in the microelectronics areas zhang et al 2016 the estimated global production of ag nanoparticles agnps amounts to 400 tons annually pourzahedi and eckelman 2015 during washing abrading or discarding of agnps containing products ag can leak into wastewater enriched wastewater stream in silver afterwards ag can reach wastewater treatment facilities and finally end up in surface water bodies that may be used as sources of drinking water benn and westerhoff 2008 geranio et al 2009 tugulea et al 2014 moreover ag may enter groundwater through the contact between surface water and groundwater agnps may be released into the aquatic system and soils also from sewage sludge used as a fertilizer and from the air in the aerosol form pachapur et al 2016 the use of agnps containing products suggests that the water soil environment may be exposed to the contaminant with different ag species depending on the environmental conditions and the particles properties kaegi et al 2013 mcgillicuddy et al 2017 ag can enter the aquatic environment in the form of isolated nanoparticles nanoparticle aggregates or soluble monovalent ions ag i benn and westerhoff 2008 geranio et al 2009 in aquatic environment agnps undergo physical and chemical transformation they can be aggregated and hetero aggregated in the presence of minerals wang et al 2019 one of the most important steps of agnps transformation is release of ag i ion according to reaction between dissolved molecular oxygen and nanosilver in water described by the following equation agnp 0 1 4o 2 h aq ag 1 2h 2 o the monovalent ion does not hydrolyze appreciably in solution and is considered to be a mild oxidizing agent depending on the chemistry of the water and the presence of ions chloride sulfide the following may be formed products such as silver chloride agcl ag2s ag2o and ag i complexes e g agcl in sea water ag2s may not be the most thermodynamically stable form of silver compounds but it still will persist in aquatic environments due to its intensely slow reaction kinetics zhang et al 2016 co occurring na ca2 and k may also compete with ag i for the sorption and or the cations may enhance aggregation of agnps wang et al 2015 both ag forms ions and nanoparticles are toxic to the aquatic and terrestrial microorganisms upon release to the environment agnps will accumulate in natural soils suspension and sediment posing potential risks to the environment ecosystem and human health the toxicity of agnps to organisms depend on the physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles size grain morphology kind of coating their concentration and soil sediments properties during agnps translocation ag i ions can release from agnps resulting in oxidative stress through disturbing cell function causing phytotoxicity by binding to cell components and modifying their activities sakamoto et al 2015 since agnps can be taken up and accumulated in plants they can further pose a risk to human health through invading the food chain and ultimately transferring to the human body stable isotope analysis indicated a close correlation between the ag content in the prey and that in their corresponding predators demonstrating the impact of agnps on ecological receptors and food chains yan and chen 2019 moreover co occurring contaminants interact with agnps suggesting nanoparticles as centers for organic and inorganic co contaminants therefore transport sorption desorption precipitation dissolution and transformation are important aspects for the assessment of the environmental abraham et al 2013 wang et al 2015 neukum 2018 wang et al 2018 the ag transport and behavior in the environmental systems are controlled by changes in the colloidal stability and their interactions with different surface active centers in surface and groundwater priya et al 2013 the sorption by the sediment constituents is one of the most important processes controlling the ag amount retained on the surface of minerals and determining the ag mobility and bioavailability in the aquatic environment ag can uptake on active centers of minerals building the suspended and river sediments when chloride and sulfide ion concentrations in water is low the most effective minerals are secondary minerals such as clay minerals kaolinite montmorillonite illite and oxyhydr oxides of iron ferrihydrite goethite forming during the weathering of primary minerals clay minerals belong to the anisotropic phyllosilicate minerals family their basic structural elements are two dimensional arrays of silicon oxygen tetrahedral and aluminum or magnesium oxygen hydroxyl octahedral a representative of 2 1 type phyllosilicate type is montmorillonite mt and of 1 1 type is kaolinite kaol the structure and chemical composition exchangeable ions silanol si oh or aluminol al2 oh groups at the particle edges and a small crystallite size of the clay minerals are responsible for several of their unique properties such as a large chemically active specific surface area high cation exchange capacity cec and interlamellar surfaces with unusual hydration characteristics ijagbemi et al 2009 tamayo et al 2012 another group of minerals building the sediments in low temperature oxic environments is constituted by iron oxyhydr oxides ferrihydrite goethite with a poor crystalline structure and high surface area guo and barnard 2013 colombo et al 2017 wang et al 2019 they exist as separate particles or surface coating material other mineral particles agnps are the new components in real practice there is not much information on the sorption release of ag species in soil water environment and the fate and behavior of agnps are not well understood the designed study into the ag species sorption by clay and iron oxyhydr oxides minerals and its release as nanoparticles and ions is important for understanding the transport and fate of the ag species in sediments and surface and groundwater the aim of this work was to understand ag i agnps sorption in aquatic systems specially in natural porous media such as minerals building sediment and water suspension interactions of two ag species agnps and ag i as the form of nano silver oxidation with the active centers of montmorillonite kaolinite and ferrihydrite were investigated it was also conducted to examine the mobility and bioavailability of the sorbed forms the sorption mechanisms of ag on the minerals were analyzed with consideration for their physicochemical properties and sorption isotherms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the following clay fractions particle diameter 2 μm were obtained from raw clays with

cornell 2000 and cornell and schwertmann 2003 2 2 methods for determining mineral properties the micromorphology structures and chemical compositions of clay minerals and iron oxyhydr oxides before

a three solution mineral ratio l s 100 1 250 1 and 500 1 at concentration of ag in solution 100 mg dm3 the stock solution of agnps was a commercial solution with the following properties ph 6 95 eh

32 18 mg dm3 which provided the reducing conditions and stabilization of agnps the presence of agnps in the solution was determined with the transmission electron microscope analysis tecnai f20 twin fei company and the result is given in fig 1 the ag solutions at concentration 100 mg dm3 were prepared through diluting stock solution 1000 mg ag dm3 prepared from nitrate salt agno3 or agnps of 150 mg dm3 the ph value in the ag i ion solution was adjusted with the 0 1 m hno3 or 0 1 m naoh solution to obtain the values of 3 0 5 5 and 7 0 respectively for the solutions containing agnps at concentration of 100 mg dm3 the ph values were adjusted with the 0 1 m acetic acid or 0 1 m naoh the ionic strength was 1 5 mm of sodium nitrate nano3 for both ag forms the suspensions were agitated in a horizontal shaker 130 rpm for the equilibrium time of 24 h to obtain the equilibrium condition afterwards the samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 12 850 g avanti j 25 beckman coulter to separate the solution finally they were filtered through the 0 22 μm cellulose ester membranes millipore billerica ma usa the ag concentrations in the initial and equilibrium solutions were measured with the flame atomic absorption spectrometry method avanta pm spectrometer gbc with ag hollow cathode lamp at λ 328 1 nm and the air acetylene flame for atomization or by the icp ms spectrometry elan drc e 6100 perkin elmer depending on the ag concentration calibrations with four standards at the concentrations between 0 and 3 mg dm3 yielded the optimal linearity r2 0 99 the results allowed for selecting the best conditions for the optimal sorption i e maximum sorption capacity and removal efficiency the effect of initial concentration of ag forms on sorption capacity of the minerals and removal efficiency of ag forms was performed for the initial ag concentrations of 0 1 100 mg dm3 under the best ph and volume of solution conditions obtained in the previous experiment the prepared suspensions were equilibrated with the same procedures as for the previous studies moreover the uv vis spectroscopy cary 50 scan spectrometer varian was used to measure the agnps concentration in the solution for samples at the higher initial concentration 10 mg dm3 the ultrapure water utilized for all the solutions and dilutions was obtained from the milliq system millipore billerica ma usa the

suspensions under equilibrium conditions were measured with a ph meter equipped with a combined glass electrode all the sorption samples were studied three times and the mean values are used 2 4 estimation of isotherm parameters by non linear regression two parameter isotherm models such as freundlich freundlich 1906 langmuir langmuir 1916 dubinin radushkevich dubinin 1960 and three parameter isotherm models such as sips sips 1948 were used for modeling sorption isotherm data the correlation of experimental results to an sorption model can help to understand the mechanisms of sorption and the heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface the equations of isotherm models were show in table a1 in appendix a supplementary information this provides a mathematically rigorous method for determining isotherm parameters using the original form of the isotherm equation non linear estimate based on the levenberg marquardt method statistica ver 9 0 software was used in order to evaluate the fit of the isotherm to the experimental data besides the determination coefficient r2 three non linear error functions were examined foo and hameed 2010 and in each case a set of isotherm parameters were determined by minimizing the respective error function across the concentration range studied table a2 the determination coefficients r2 showed the fit between experimental data and isotherm equations while the non linear error functions indicated the fit between the experimental and predicted values of sorption capacity 2 5 desorption and ability to release of sorbed ag species the sequential extraction procedure developed for the ag species by coutris et al 2012 was used to assess the partitioning of ag species sorbed onto the examined minerals at ph 5 5 l s 250 1 and c0 100 mg dm3 for practically monomineral materials the ag distributions in the fraction method provide information only on the main binding sites and the ag binding strength to the mineral and helps to determine the susceptibility to the release of the sorbed ag forms from weakly bond e0 e1 to very strong bond e4 e6 table a3 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical properties of studied minerals the particles of mt showed regular shape and similar size and format to the sheet typical for phyllosilicates sem micrographs fig 2a and the eds analysis showed the following composition al2o3 26 1 sio2 75 5 cao 1 9 mgo 4 5 fe2o3 2 9 and k2o 1 1 the particles of kaol are mostly associated in the face face silica face alumina face manner fig 2b and the eds analysis showed nearly 1 1 atomic distribution of al2o3 49 5 and sio2 49 8 with trace amounts of k2o 0 3 the sem observation of the synthesized fh exhibits pure material without any impurities and homogenous material with a strong aggregation degree typical for fh fig 2c the x ray diffractograms of mt kaol and fh are presented in fig 3 mt sample was monomineral and belonged to the almg montmorillonite sucha and kraus 1998 its presence was recognized due to the characteristic interplanar distances dhkl 15 42 5 11 3 06 å and the strongest reflection shift towards the lower 2 theta angle 17 10 å on the glycolated sample diffractograms the reflection positions of 8 57 and 5 63 å indicate that the share of illite packages in the mt structure did not exceed 5 the position of the most intense reflection on diffractograms 15 42 å fig 3 indicates that the major cations in the inter package space were ca2 and mg2 the mineral composition of the kaol was dominated by kaolinite with trace amounts of illite and quartz fig 3 the kaol presence was observed due to the characteristic reflection on diffractograms with interplanar distances dhkl 7 16 3 58 2 39 å and their disappearance after the sample calcination the x ray diffraction pattern analysis in the range of 19 24 of a non oriented specimen showed that this kaol belonged to an ordered internal structure of kaol type tc illite was identified due to the weak reflection dhkl 10 10 and 3 34 å which creates coincidence with the strongest quartz reflex whose presence confirms an additional reflection of 4 26 å the diffractogram of synthesized iron oxyhydr oxide clearly shows that the only phase was fh with characteristic wide and asymmetric peaks at dhkl 2 5 and 1 5 å fig 3 cornell and schwertmann 2003 mt belongs to mesoporous solids with bottle shaped pores narrow entrance into a wide interior and pores formed between two planes of the varying slope it is confirmed by the isotherm close to type iv with hysteresis loop type b omission the isotherm the pore volume distribution suggests that the studied mineral had mainly pores with a diameter of approx 4 01 nm and was homogeneous the analyses conducted with the n2 sorption desorption revealed that the bet surface area of mt was 54 81 m2 g and the porosity determined with the mercury porosimeter was 60 64 table a4 kaol had a low specific surface area 11 81 m2 g the isotherm does not have a hysteresis loop which is characteristic for mesoporous materials omission the isotherm it is possible to make a conclusion about the low microporosity possibly macroporosity of the material this is indicated by the plot of the pore volume distribution where the values are very small generally low porosity on the y axis the kaol porosity was 70 69 which implies macroporosity pore diameter of fh was 1 89 nm and indicated that material was dominated by micropores the total pore volume was 0 175 cm3 g table a4 the specific surface area of fh was 296 m2 g which matched very well the results usually obtained for fh schwertmann and cornell 2000 cornell and schwertmann 2003 the cec of 1 013 mmol g and 0 2038 mmol g for mt and kaol respectively were consistent with the cec usually found for smectites 0 60 1 50 mmol g essington 2004 and kaolinite 0 028 0 228 mmol g ma and eggleton 1999 cec of fh was very low 0 0930 mmol g table a5 due to the lack of the aluminum compounds in the studied fh the entire exchangeable acidity value was constituted by the h concentration the ph value for the minerals ranged between 3 90 fh and 7 57 mt the phpzc values of the minerals were 6 1 for mt 4 5 for kaol and 7 35 for fh table a5 the minerals were positively charged due to the protonation of the surface when the solution ph was lower than their phpzc values and negatively charged due to the deprotonation of the surface when the solution ph was higher than the phpzc according to the following reactions 3 si oh h si oh 2 or al 2 oh h al 2 oh 2 ph ph pzc 4 si oh si o h or al 2 oh al 2 o h ph ph pzc 3 2 sorption experiment 3 2 1 effect of the volume of solution and ph the influence of the solution volume mineral amount l s and solution ph on the sorption q and removal efficiency re of ag species for the studied minerals is given in fig 4 a b the results show an increasing trend in the ag i ions and agnps sorption with an increasing l s ratio for all the minerals continuous lines in fig 4 which was in accordance with eq 1 at the same time a decreasing trend in the re of the ag i ions for all the minerals was observed dotted lines in fig 4a for agnps it was only seen for fh however the re values of the agnps for the clay minerals depended on the mineral dose only slightly and were on the level of 99 0 5 96 0 8 with increasing l s ratio less surface area was available for sorption due to the decrease in number of active sites on the adsorbent surface which made the penetration of metal ions to the sorption sites more difficult igberase et al 2014 the results of the ph effect on the mineral sorption capacity demonstrate that ph was an important factor mainly in the sorption of the ag i ions since h or oh in the solution affected the mineral surface charge moreover the h and na ions coming from the hno3 or naoh solution used to adjust the initial ph solution to 3 0 and 5 5 or 7 0 respectively may have competed with ag for the sorption at lower and higher ph levels respectively the sorption capacity of minerals for the ag i at the initial concentration of 100 mg dm3 was the highest at ph 5 5 it was observed that the difference between the sorption capacity of the minerals at ph 3 0 and 5 0 was higher than at ph 5 5 and 7 0 as ph lowered the h ions played an important role in the sorption processes and competed with the ag i ions for the sorption sites in the adsorbent they also hindered the ag ion binding and caused an increase in the mineral surface positive charge resulting from the proton sorption on the other hand the na ions competed with the ag i ions for the sorption centers at higher ph at higher ph the negative charge of surface also increased which resulted from the dissociation reaction of the surface functional groups in order to determine the h and na ion role in the ag sorption process two important factor characterizing ion properties must be taken into account i e values of the catledge s ionic potential ratio of element ionic valance z to its ionic radius r and the hydration energy of the ag i h and na cations igwe and abia 2007 the ionic potential value equal to 8 69 nm 1 10 nm 1 and 8 47 nm 1 respectively for the ag i h3o and na shows that the polarizability of the ag i and their affinity towards function groups such as oh were weaker than for the h and stronger than for na the finding demonstrates that the na ions can affected sorption ag i weaker than h moreover the ion hydration energy 490 kj mol for ag i 1090 kj mol for h and 410 kj mol for na ions indicated that the na ion will be more hydrolyzed than ag and h and affected the ag i sorption weaker than h smith 1977 on the other hand the ph solution effect on the agnps sorption was not observed the best conditions for the ag i sorption process were ph 5 5 and l s 250 1 for agnps the values were ph 5 5 and l s 500 1 for further research ph 5 5 and l s 250 1 were selected so as to conduct the sorption desorption of both ag species under the same conditions 3 2 2 sorption capacity of studied minerals the results of the ag sorption onto different mineral phases in the equilibrium concentration function removal efficiency of the ag forms vs initial concentration of ag as well as the values of the final ph in solution vs the equilibrium ag concentration in the solution are given in fig 5 the results indicate that the ag sorption depended on i initial ag concentration ii ag species in the solution and iii type of active centers in minerals at the lower initial ag concentration 0 1 20 mg dm3 the uptake of both ag forms was high and independent of the concentration initial part of curves in fig 5a and kind of the mineral the removal efficiency re of ag was close to 100 fig 5b with an increasing initial concentration of agnps 25 100 mg dm3 a higher differences in ag sorption was observed mt and kaol presented similar behavior towards agnps the maximum sorption capacity was 25 69 2 56 mg g and 25 32 2 12 mg g respectively with re equal to 99 80 0 21 and 98 35 0 34 respectively the fh sorption capacity was slightly lower at the maximum initial concentration it was 22 81 1 75 mg g with re of 88 49 0 24 in all the cases the final ph was higher than mt kaol or similar to fh the initial value of 5 5 and eh potential ranged from 243 4 to 291 3 mv the binding process was above the phpzc values of the clay minerals and below the phpzc of fh table a5 surface of fh posses a positive charge that suggests that iron oxyhydr oxide is favorable site for agnps uptake and electrostatic attractions predominate between negatively charged agnps and positively charged fh however a significantly larger size of agnp up to 18 nm than ag i ion about 0 115 nm causes that the ag nanoparticels cannot enter fh micropores 1 89 nm thereby reducing sorption efficiency especially at high agnps concentrations wang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 observed that the retention of pvp agnps in studied soils was significantly positively correlated with iron oxides content the clay mineral surface charge during the agnps sorption was negative which makes it impossible for them to bind agnps through electrostatic bonds the sorption of ag i ions onto the minerals at concentrations varying from 25 to 100 mg dm3 was lower than the sorption of agnps in particular for fh the maximum sorption capacity values for mt kaol and fh for the ag i ions were 15 39 1 46 mg g 20 72 1 81 mg g and 2 80 0 12 mg g respectively at re values of 50 05 0 34 mt 67 38 0 42 kaol and 9 11 0 09 fh after the sorption process the ph value ranged between 7 17 and 7 03 mt 7 6 7 53 kaol and 4 09 4 24 fh fig 5 it indicates the ag i ions were bound by the clay minerals under neutral mt weakly alkaline kaol or acidic fh ph moreover eh potential was higher than for agnps and ranged from 347 9 to 404 7 mv the good buffering capacity of the clay minerals leads to the ph increase in the equilibrium solutions above their mt and kaol phpzc for fh the ph value was below its phpzc and its surface charge was positive and electrostatic repulsion existed with ag i ions it proves also that there were h ions besides ag i ions in the fh suspension the h ions may compete with the ag ions for the sorption sites and affect and maintain the surface positive charge such conditions may influence the low sorption capacity of fh for the ag i ions the results suggest that the presence of oxyhydr oxides of iron in river sediments and soil may decrease the sorption of ag i ions however under natural conditions due to the chemisorption of anions by iron oxides silicates phosphates and the lowering of the isoelectric point this effect may be lower pieczara and rzepa 2016 when the sorption capacity of minerals for the ag i ions was shown in the mmol g units and compared with the cec for minerals the calculation results indicated that the sorption capacity was below for mt and fh or close to kaol their cec table a5 constantino et al 2017 determined the maximum sorption capacity of two bentonites for ag i at the level of 57 13 mg g and 32 51 mg g for the following conditions adsorbent dose of 20 g dm3 and initial ag i concentration of 1000 mg dm3 the results indicated that the laboratory conditions differed largely from the conditions determined for this study the significantly higher sorption capacity of the two bentonites in the constantino s experiment was caused by the initial solution 10 fold higher and possible complete saturation of the sorption capacity for both bentonites on the other hand the sorption capacities of kaol and fh for agnps were above their cec values only for mt the value was below its cec due to the strong affinity of metal cations towards mt it must be remembered that the research was conducted only up to the initial agnps concentration 100 mg dm3 for which the plateau on the sorption curve was not obtained the high sorption of agnps onto minerals suggests high affinity of nanoparticles for the mineral surface likewise a higher agnps concentration and relatively high concentration of the clay suspension may facilitate the agnps aggregation and sorption of this form on the clay mineral surface the sem image for the clay minerals with sorbed agnps shows that the size of agnps sorbed on the mineral surface were significantly larger than the agnps in the initial solution 8 18 nm the finding confirms the nanoparticle aggregation in presence of the minerals fig 6 the aggregation process plays a significant role in the nanoparticle transformations and depends on critical coagulation concentration aggregation attachment efficiency capping agents agnps preparation methods and salinity ionic strength and ph eh conditions of the environment dastafkan et al 2015 dwivedi et al 2015 and it is thermodynamically favorable process zhang et al 2016 oromieh 2011 also observed the aggregation process for the sorption of agnps onto sandy soil already at the agnps concentration of 2 5 mg dm3 according to wang et al 2019 main sorption mechanism of agnps onto iron oxides is heteroaggregation of agnps goethite hematite in addition aggregation agnp agnp heteroaggregation with iron oxides also reduced dissolution of agnps because at acidic and neutral ph values ferrihydrite is positively charged it is expected that electrostatic attraction with negatively charged agnps should prevail therefore favoring heteroaggregation as the dominant process of fh agnps interactions wang et al 2019 moreover agnps did not undergo oxidation to the ag i ions because the agnps concentration in the final solution measured with the uv vis spectrophotometer was on the similar level as the concentration measured with the aas spectrophotometer and conditions during sorption were weakly oxidizing eh 243 4 291 3 mv according to liu and hurt 2010 the agnps oxidation in neutral mineral soil solutions plays only a minor role and the highest release of ag i is observed at low ph 3 3 sorption isotherm the values of isotherm models parameters obtained using the non linear fitting analysis as well as values of determination coefficient and non linear error functions are summarized in table a6 the relationship between experimental results and calculated isotherm is shown in fig 7 according to table a6 values of determination coefficient r2 are good for freundlich isotherm 0 9622 0 9971 estimated values of kf are higher for agnps sorption on the minerals and indicated higher sorption intensity of nanoparticles values of 1 n closed to 1 for sorption of agnps onto mt and kaol indicated linear sorption and the value of 1 n 1 indicated that chemical sorption occurred for the ag i ions onto the studied minerals as well as agnps on fh the process was favorable under studied conditions banach et al 2016 the langmuir model very well simulates the sorption isotherms of the studied ag species table a6 the langmuir constant kl varied with sorbent surface chemistry and ag forms and was higher for clay minerals than for fh and for sorption of ag i ions on clay minerals than for agnps and for sorption of agnps on fh than ag i the results indicated that the affinity of the clay minerals surface for ag i and bonding energy are much higher than those of fh because of the different structural characteristics of the minerals the values of the maximum sorption capacity ql are higher than the theoretical qmax values for all ag species mineral systems moreover the maximum sorption capacity values were 6 8 times higher than the experimental sorption for agnps on clay minerals which indicates that the sorption isotherm plateau was not reached very high values of coefficients of determination r2 0 991 for all the tested systems suggest monolayer sorption the dubinin radushkevich model describes with adequately the equilibrium data at values of r2 0 9800 estimated values of qd expressed in mg g were higher than the experimental values moreover mean free energy values e for the sorption of the ag i ions onto mt kaol and fh were 13 74 17 41 and 11 91 kj mol respectively and were higher than for agnps sorption 8 82 8 97 and 10 72 kj mol the typical range of bonding energy for ion exchange mechanisms is 8 16 kj mol indicating that chemisorption may play a significant role in the sorption process on the determination coefficient and non linear error functions values table a6 the sips equation seems better than that of langmuir model the maximum sorption capacities qs for ag i ion bonding were higher than those obtained using the langmuir isotherm the parameter ks change in the same manner as the constants kl of the equation of langmuir model moreover values of ms parameter were closed to 1 for sorption of agnps onto clay minerals which suggests reducing the sips equation to the langmuir equation low values of error function confirm this transformation on the other hand differences between values of experimental and calculated according to langmuir and freundlich models show that at lower initial concentration freundlich model is better for characterization of sorption process but at higher initial concentration sorption run according to langmuir model the results obtained using the studied equations show that the best fitted sorption isotherm models for ag i ions and agnps uptake onto studied minerals and agnps on fh were determined to be in the order sips langmuir dubinin radushkevich freundlich moreover it was conducted that the all using equations very good describe the experimental equilibrium data of agnps sorption onto clay minerals fig 7 according to priya et al 2013 the possibility of using a nonlinear isotherm for the agnps sorption from the suspension depends on its stability the sorption of agnps from stable suspensions was nonlinear and best described with the langmuir isotherm however in the case of the agnps sorption from an unstable suspension the sorption isotherms did not follow any classical sorption models which suggests an interplay between aggregation and sorption abraham et al 2013 3 4 release of sorbed ag species and their binding mechanism the ag release results based on the sequential extraction show that the ag binding strength depended on the kind of active sites in minerals and ag forms in the solution fig 8 it can be observed that the sorbed agnps were found mainly in the e4 fraction ranged from 67 05 mt to 82 53 kaol and ranged from 13 61 kaol to 80 11 fh in e5 fraction in the mobile fractions e0 e2 the agnps were bound from 0 11 to 5 99 the results demonstrate that agnps were strongly bound with minerals especially with fh and suggest strong retention in soil and sediments torrent et al 2019 on the other hand the ag i ions were bound in a weaker way than agnps they were bound with the clay minerals mainly in the mobile fractions e1 e2 the ag i ions sorbed onto mt bound in the exchangeable e1 fraction 83 76 and in the e2 fraction though to a lower extent 8 88 only small ag i amounts were detected in the e4 and e5 fractions the ag i ions sorbed onto kaol were bound mainly in the e1 11 78 and e2 80 35 fractions other fractions contained small ag amounts in contrast the ag i ions sorbed onto fh were bound mainly in the e3 68 5 and e1 15 1 fractions the results point out that the fh presence may decrease the ag i ion mobility from the solid phase and also toxicity and bioavailability to living organisms li et al 2004 moreover ag sorbed by the minerals was found in the e0 water soluble fraction which indicates that ag may be bound in the pores of the solid phase mineral pores at a low level varying from 1 23 fh to 7 45 mt the ag i distribution in the fractions was in good agreement with the kind of active centers of minerals mt is a 2 1 clay mineral chemical structure i e na ca 0 33 al mg 2 si4o10 oh2n h2o with two kinds of active centers and may adsorb the ag i cations with two mechanisms 1 cation exchange at the permanent negative charge of external basal surfaces or interlayer region of mt fraction e1 ijagbemi et al 2009 x 2 ca 2 2ag 4 h 2 o x 2 2ag h 2 o 2 ca 2 2 formation of the ag hydroxyl surface complex of the cation and silanol si oh or aluminol al2 oh groups at the particle edges fraction e2 brady et al 1996 s o ag 2h 2 o s o ag h 2 o 2 the distribution pattern of the sorbed ag i ions in both fractions arose from the different affinity of ca2 in the active center in mt the affinity for ca2 was greater in the interlayer space than on the edges on the other hand kaol a 1 1 clay mineral consists of one tetrahedral sheet fused to an octahedral sheet at the chemical formula of al4 si4o10 oh8 and includes a tight interlayer structure it sorbed the ag i ions as a formation of the ag hydroxyl surface complex between the ag i ion and the silanol or aluminol groups at the particle edges e2 fraction sari et al 2007 gu and evans 2008 according to brady et al 1996 the bonds between the ag i ions and negatively charged basal plane surfaces of the kaol particles should be taken into consideration in the sorption mechanism onto kaol the basal and edge kaol surfaces carry different types of functional groups as the surface charge density of the edge is significantly greater when compared to the surface charge densities of the siloxane face and alumina face of the kaol particles at high ph gupta et al 2011 the sequential extraction results did not distinguish these kind of centers on the other hand solely silanol groups bound the ag i ions in the observed ph of 4 to 8 fig 5c as their silica tetrahedral face was negatively charged at ph 4 the aluminol octahedral face is positively charged at ph 8 gupta and miller 2010 in contrast the aluminol groups in clay minerals played a significant role in the agnps binding because nanoparticles were negatively charged under the elaborated conditions at the solution ph 6 5 dastafkan et al 2015 and could be bound by the aluminol groups of the clay minerals on the other hand the silica surfaces were negatively charged under the conditions resulting in the net repulsive electrostatics with the negative charge of agnps under the conditions thio et al 2012 other active centers for sorption in kaol included exchangeable cations that could occupy the external basal kaol surfaces e1 the measured cec value for kaol table a5 was 0 2038 mmol g which denotes the presence of exchangeable cations in its structure and minor contribution of the ion exchange mechanism to the sorption process it confirms the involvement of the e1 fraction of 11 17 in the ag i binding by kaol the variable charge of ferrihydrite fh is due the protonation of the singly and triply coordinated surface groups whereas the doubly coordinated groups are mainly present as fe2oh3 hiemstra 2013 fh bound the ag i ions in the form of complex compounds with formula of fe2oag3 the weak binding strength of the ag i ions and clay mineral active centers and ease to be removed from the clay minerals show that the ag i ions formed outer sphere complexes the ag i ions have two water molecules in the linear form in their first hydration sphere ohtaki 1981 and are not directly bound to the mineral surface the results show that the contribution of the sorbed ag i ions to the bioavailable fraction was high the sorbed ag i may be transferred into the food chain through gradual leaching into water this process may be followed by the uptake by water plants and fish during the water chemistry changes on the other hand agnps were bound with the active centers of all the researched minerals in a very strong way and were not able to release into water an important consequence of the reaction is the reduction in bioavailability and potential risk of agnps in the water environment 4 conclusions the study investigated the sorption capacities of montmorillonite kaolinite and ferrihydrite ph solution 3 0 5 5 7 0 solution l mineral s ratio 100 1 250 500 1 and initial concentration of ag 0 1 100 mg dm3 effect on the uptake of two ag species ag i and agnps and ag mobility an increasing trend in the ag i ions and agnps sorption with an increasing l s ratio for all minerals was observed values of ph was an important factor mainly in the sorption of the ag i ions since h or oh in the solution affected the mineral surface charge the results show a great sorption potential of clay minerals for both ag forms and lower sorption capacity of fh for ag i ions at the lower initial ag concentration ranging from 0 1 mg dm3 to 20 mg dm3 the uptake of both ag forms was high and independent of the initial concentration and kind of the mineral and the removal efficiency of ag was close to 100 the estimated maximum sorption capacities changed according to the kaol mt fh order and it was 117 8 mg g 94 39 mg g and 26 48 mg g for agnps and 21 14 mg g 17 92 mg g and 3 072 mg g for ag i ions respectively the best fitted sorption isotherm models for ag i ions and agnps were determined to be in the order sips langmuir dubinin radushkevich freundlich these results suggest that the mechanism of ag binding is complex and does not follow the ideal monolayer adsorption moreover the agnps aggregation was observed during the sorption process research on the release of the sorbed agnps indicated that they were strongly bound with minerals especially with fh and suggest strong retention in soil and sediments ag i ions were bound with the montmorillonite and kaolinite mainly in the mobile fractions with two mechanisms cation exchange at the permanent negative charge of external basal surfaces or interlayer region and formation of the ag hydroxyl surface complex of the cation and groups at the particle edges respectively fh bound the ag i ions in the non mobile form of complex compounds with formula of fe2oag3 the contribution of the sorbed ag i ions to the bioavailable fraction of clay minerals was high but iron oxyhydr oxides decreased the ag i mobility 5 recommendations for further study the study of behavior of agnps and ag i ions in presence of montmorillonite kaolinite and ferrihydrite presented in article was performed from solution at low ionic strength of 1 5 mm of sodium nitrate nano3 therefore it is postulated to evaluation of effect of ionic strength with na and ca2 on sorption desorption of ag species on clay minerals and oxyhydr oxides at the other laboratory parameters as in the article different ionic strength will simulate different saline of solution at the same time na and ca2 will show effect of monovalent and divalent competing ion on uptake of ag forms acknowledgements the study was financially supported by the national science center

1522,surfactant solutions have been frequently studied for soil remediation however since they are expensive massive consumption of surfactant solution can constrain their application surfactant microbubbles or colloidal gas aphrons cgas can serve as cost effective alternatives of surfactant solution because the use of cgas reduce the amount of surfactant consumption moreover cgas can also improve the contact with the contaminated environment due to their unique surface properties e g containing 40 70 of gas small size large interfacial areas water like flow properties and buoyant rise velocities in this review paper the properties and flow character of cgas in soil matrix reviewed due to their relevance to soil remediation process a comprehensive overview of the application of cgas in flushing off organic pollutants and heavy metals and carrying oxygen bacteria and dissolved materials for soil remediation were provided this paper also highlighted the limitation of cgas application and important future research scopes keywords surfactant colloidal gas aphrons soil flushing in situ bioremediation 1 introduction since the widespread of pollutants in soil would pose threaten to human health and ecological security clean up pollutants from contaminated soil is needed surfactants surface active agents have emerged as promising tools for soil remediation surfactants have been widely employed in contaminated site for their ability in flushing off pollutant e g organic pollutants heavy metals and radionuclides from soil khalladi et al 2009 liang et al 2017 pennell et al 1996 svab et al 2009 and promoting biodegradation of organic pollutants aronstein et al 1991 bezza and nkhalambayausi chirwa 2016 li and zhu 2012 zhang et al 2013 these applications makes good use of the properties of surfactant reducing of interfacial tension hamzah et al 2018 enhancing phase transfer of pollutant from soil to pseudo aqueous phase and increasing bioavailability of organic pollutants aronstein et al 1991 bezza and nkhalambayausi chirwa 2016 li and zhu 2012 zhang et al 2013 however surfactant solution is expensive and the great consumption of surfactant solution for soil remediation may limit the commercial use of such remediation method boonamnuayvitaya et al 2009 jackson et al 1998 mukhopadhyay et al 2015 a surfactant microbubble or colloidal gas aphron cga is a surfactant bound gas bubble with a diameter ranging from 10 to 100 μm sebba 1985 the structure of single microbubble was first proposed by sebba 1987 fig 1 namely a microbubble suspension cgas comprise a large number of minute spherical gas bubbles encapsulated in a soapy liquid film in an aqueous surfactant solution cgas have emerged as promising alternatives of surfactant solution because i a gas content ranging from 40 to 70 feng et al 2009 jauregi and varley 1999 park et al 2009 sebba 1987 which requires less surfactant solution for soil remediation thereby effectively lowering down the overall cost boonamnuayvitaya et al 2009 jackson et al 1998 mukhopadhyay et al 2015 ii small size 10 100 μm and water like flow properties can enable them to penetrate low permeability area in soil jauregi et al 1997 jauregi et al 2000 save and pangarkar 1994 sebba 1971 iii large interfacial areas which can serve as reservoirs for contaminates and bacteria jauregi and varley 1999 parker 1989 wan and wilson 1994 iv buoyant rise velocities mukhopadhyay et al 2015 based on these properties cgas have been studied for their potentials in physically removing organic pollutants and heavy metals from contaminated soil mukhopadhyay et al 2015 roy et al 1995a roy et al 1995b roy et al 1994 as well as delivering and dispersing oxygen bacteria and dissolved materials for soil remediation however the potential effectiveness of cgas in soil remediation is affected by the characters of cgas e g stability size distribution gas hold up the properties of soil i e pore size the distribution of cgas bacteria and nanoparticles in porous media different types of surfactant can generate cgas with different properties for example cgas generated from anionic surfactant e g sodium lauryl ether sulfate and sodium dodecyl sulfate are more stable than those generated using nonionic tergitol e g tween 20 and triton x 100 ding et al 2013 shen et al 2011 in column experiments the anionic surfactant cgas demonstrates slightly better ability for carrying nanoparticles than cgas of nonionic surfactant ding et al 2013 shen et al 2011 the pore size of porous meida not only affect the distribution of cgas but also affect their efficiency as carrier for instance when delivering nanoparticles to the column cgas are more efficient in columns with coarse pore size ranges from 0 18 0 51 mm than in columns with finer pore size ranges from 0 09 0 18 mm ding et al 2013 in contrast one study found that cgas were better able to penetrate columns with finer sand ranges from 0 10 0 20 mm than sand with coarse pore size 0 20 0 57 mm su et al 2014 bacteria transport by cgas is reliant on the adhesion tendency of bacterial suspension to sand particles and air water interfaces the preferential sorption of bacteria to the air liquid interfaces rather than the solid water interfaces can contribute to the enhancement of transport and dispersion of bacteria ripley et al 2002 wan and wilson 1994 both hydrophilic and hydrophobic bacteria show preferential sorption onto gas water interfaces over solid water interfaces wan and wilson 1994 while for the sorption on soil hydrophobic bacteria have a stronger affinity than hydrophilic bacteria chen and zhu 2004 huysman and verstraete 1993 hydrophobic bacteria also have a greater adhesion tendency to gas liquid interfaces than do hydrophilic bacteria ripley et al 2002 wan et al 1994 thus the objective of this review is to expose the reader to the properties of cgas describe the transport behaviours of cgas in microscale in porous media and provide the research work carried out in soil remediation using cgas 2 cgas characterization stability size distribution and gas hold up are the most commonly characterized properties for the application of cgas in soil remediation 2 1 stability with regard to soil remediation stable cgas can enable soil penetration thus flushing off pollutants or delivering bacteria oxygen nutrients and dissolved materials for soil remediation the stability of cgas refers to its ability to resist collapse and can be quantified as the time required for half of the cgas to collapse half time or one tenth of drained liquid life t0 1 banifatemi et al 2016 sadeghialiabadi and amiri 2015 various factors e g the surfactant type and concentration electrolyte concentration cgas processing parameters ph and the presence of dissolved or suspended solutes in the solution and nanoparticle are found to affect the stability of cgas surfactant type and concentration are key parameters determining the stability of cgas at ph 7 the cgas of anionic rhamnolipid has a half time of 461 s which is greater than the half time of nonionic tergitol cgas 383 s feng et al 2009 other studies found similar results that cgas of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate sodium lauryl sulphase sls are more stable than cgas of other types of surfactant cationic surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride ctac dodecyl trimethyl ammoniumchloride dtac and nonionic surfactant alcohol ethoxylates polyoxyethene triglyceride save and pangarkar 1994 tabzar et al 2015 increasing surfactant concentration from 0 1 to 61 mm the half time of cgas raises from 60 to 758 s accordingly jauregi et al 1997 which is consistent with other observations feng et al 2009 jauregi et al 1997 matsushita et al 1992 that the stability of cgas increased with rising surfactant concentration the greater stability of cgas at higher surfactant concentration is due to the greater electrostatic repulsion between adjacent bubbles and higher viscosity jauregi et al 1997 yan et al 2005 in terms of electrolyte concentration of surfactant solution cgas stability reduces with increasing electrolyte concentration amiri and woodburn 1990 feng et al 2009 jauregi et al 1997 save and pangarkar 1994 at ph 6 adding 1000 g l 1 sodium chloride results in the stability of rhamnolipid cgas decreasing from 495 to 440 s and its stability further decreases to 429 s with increasing the concentration of sodium chloride to 3000 mg l 1 feng et al 2009 the reduction in cgas stability is related to the smaller electrostatic repulsion between adjacent as a result of the compressed electrical double layer bubbles under higher electrolyte concentration jauregi et al 1997 while at ph 7 and 8 the effect of sodium chloride is insignificant the cgas generation process is another parameter affecting the stability of cgas rhamnolipid cgas generated by a flat spinning disc mixer have a half time of 466 s compared to 325 s using a propeller mixer feng 2009 the position and disc size for sheering cgas also can affect the stability of cgas the sheering disc is recommended to locate 2 cm under the liquid surface lee et al 2005 and more stable cgas can be generated using a spinning disc with larger diameter sadeghialiabadi and amiri 2015 the increase of stirring speed generally increase the stability of cgas bhatia et al 2005 matsushita et al 1992 the duration of mixing process also affects the stability of cgas save and pangarkar 1994 found that the stability of cgas fluctuates slightly during the mixing time of 1 to 5 min but remains constant for mixing time beyond 5 min while the rise of temperature decreases the stability of cgas yan et al 2005 studies on the effect of ph on the stability of cgas have not obtained consistent results some studies found the change of ph does not significantly affect the stability of cgas jauregi et al 1997 save and pangarkar 1994 while amiri and woodburn 1990 and feng et al 2009 found that the stability of cgas decreases with increasing ph various additives are employed to increase the stability of cgas dai and deng 2003 studied the stability of htac cgas with the addition of sodium silicate and found the suitable ph scale 7 10 and sodium silicate addition between 0 15 and 0 25 m for generating stable cgas amiri and sadeghialiabadi 2014 investigated the stability of sds and nonyl phenol ethoxylate 20 npe20 cgas in the presence of montmorillonite nanoparticles and found that the addition of montmorillonite nanoparticles to cgas delays the coalescence of cgas thus increases their stability 2 2 size distribution the size of cgas ranges from 10 to 100 μm according to sebba 1985 feng et al 2009 found that the majority diameter of bubbles lies in the range of 20 140 μm the size of cgas affect their stability namely larger bubbles are more stable than small bubbles various methods have been employed to measure the size distribution of cgas among these methods laser diffraction chaphalkar et al 1993 couto et al 2009b kommalapati et al 1996 light microscopes and image analysis feng et al 2009 jauregi et al 1997 save and pangarkar 1994 are the most frequently used measurement methods similar to the stability of cgas their size is also affected by the following factors i e surfactant type and concentration mixing speed ionic strength and the presence of other molecules chaphalkar et al 1993 and kommalapati et al 1996 found that cgas generated from nonionic surfactants are smaller than these produced from ionic surfactants due to the fact that nonionic surfactants are more likely compressed higher surfactant concentration results in smaller mean bubble size feng et al 2009 kommalapati et al 1996 while kommalapati et al 1996 found the effect of surfactant concentration is less significate when it is above critical micelle concentration cmc cgas generated under higher mixing speed have smaller size for example basu and malpani 2001 found that the mean diameter of cgas reduces from 75 to 22 μm with increasing mixing speed from 4000 to 8000 rpm meanwhile the additives flotigam and sodium oleate would reduce bubble sizes from to μm couto et al 2009b 2 3 gas hold up for cgas the gas hold up is defined as the volume fraction of gas to the total volume of cgas the gas volume is equal to the difference between the total volume of cgas and the final liquid volume gas hold up can potentially be used to quantify the capacity of the cgas in carrying oxygen for bioremediation cgas normally displays a gas hold up ability ranging from 40 to 70 feng et al 2009 sebba 1987 subramaniam et al 1990 3 flow of cgas in porous media knowledge of the flow characteristics of cgas in porous media is needed when cgas are applied to soil remediation studies have simulated cgas transport in one dimensional porous media and identified the parameters that affect the transport of cgas considering the properties of cgas i e small size stable and strong their transport in porous media can be treated as colloid transport alizadeh and khamehchi 2017 wan et al 2001 the transport cgas in one dimensional homogeneous porous media has been simulated using one dimensional convention and dispersion equation as follows alizadeh and khamehchi 2017 wan et al 2001 1 r c t d 2 c z 2 v 0 c z k a c where c is the cgas concentration l 3 r is the retardation factor t is the time v 0 is the pore water velocity inside the column l t 1 d is the dispersion coefficient l2 t 1 k a is the pseudo first order rate coefficient for attachment t 1 two approaches can be used to estimate these unknown transport parameters d r and k a in the first approach the transport parameters are obtained by fitting the experiment data through the nonlinear regression model based on the modified levenberg marquardt method routines rnlin and r2lin international mathematical and statistical libraries houston texas 1997 wan et al 2001 the total number of cgas in the influent and effluent is considered in the first approach in the second approach the value of the attachment coefficients k a is estimated using the filtration theory wan et al 2001 yao et al 1971 the study of cgas transport in two or three dimensional porous media has not yet been reported so far laboratory experiments are also conducted to understand the flow character of cgas in porous media choi et al 2008 visualized the flow patterns of cgas in porous media and found that cgas are separated into a liquid and gas phase immediately after injection where liquid phase showes greater movement than gas phase however distinct transport behaviours of cgas are observed by couto et al 2009a where the size and gas hold up of the cgas present a similar value before and after the flushing experiments in soil columns therefore there is a need to identify the parameters that affect cgas transport in porous media the bubble size grain size flow rate permeability porosity of soil and pressure drop are found to be important factors determining cgas transport wan et al 2001 found that cgas transport is greatly affected by grain size for bubble size ranged from 0 7 to 20 μm complete cgas recovery is obtained from effluents of the coarse 415 500 μm sand as compared to 80 and 30 of cgas recovered from the medium 150 212 μm and fine 53 103 μm sands respectively alizadeh and khamehchi 2017 found that the increase in the ratio of the bubble size to the grain size on the penetration of cgas reduces the traveling distance of cgas alizadeh and khamehchi 2017 also analyzed the effect of permeability and effective porosity of soil and found that the cgas can travel farther with the increase of these values flow rate is another parameter that affects the transport of cgas comparing to cgas recovery under a flow rate of 1 pore volume h 1 a greater percentage of cgas is recovered from the column under a flow rate of 0 02 pore volume h 1 wan et al 2001 pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of the column also plays a role in cgas transport the increase of pressure difference facilitates the transport of cgas which is possibly due to the reduction of cgas size and increase in the driving force for cgas flow under higher pressure difference alizadeh and khamehchi 2017 4 applications and mechanism of cgas in soil remediation cgas have been widely studied for its potential in soil remediation for example physically remove organic pollutants and heavy metals from contaminated soil as well as carry and disperse oxygen nutrients bacteria and dissolved materials for soil remediation fig 2 these applications make good use of the unique properties of cgas including 1 small size jauregi et al 2000 2 large interfacial areas jauregi and varley 1999 parker 1989 3 relatively high stability 4 and the fact that particles can adsorb on the cgas surfaces wan and wilson 1994 4 1 cgas as an agent for soil flushing the cga suspensions demonstrate water like viscosities which make them suitable for pumping without significant deterioration cgas have been applied to physically remove the organic contaminants and heavy metals 4 1 1 removal of organic pollutants roy et al 1992 compared the performance of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate ddbs cgas to surfactant solution in flushing a 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid 2 4 d soil in down flow mode the removal percent of 2 4 d by cgas is comparable to surfactant solution however in terms of the efficiency of per gram of surfactant solution per gram of surfactant solution in the cgas removes significantly more 2 4 d than surfactant solution roy et al 1994 also studied the use of cgas in flushing off oily waste a dense non aqueous phase liquid from soil in columns the performance of cgas prepared from sds solution was compared with surfactant solution and water under three different flow modes in the down flow mode sds cgas remove higher percentage of oily waste 56 than either sds solution 47 or water 43 a lower proportion of total oily waste is recovered by cgas from the soil column with a value of 47 and 49 by switching the flow mode to up flow and horizontal modes respectively roy et al 1994 also studied the effect of surfactant concentration on the performance of sds cgas however the increase of surfactant concentration from 8 mm to 30 mm does not further enhance the recovery of oily waste by either sds cgas or solution roy et al 1994 further studied the removal of specific pollutants in the oily waste volatiles tetrachloroethene 1 1 2 2 tetra chloroethane and l l l trichloroethane and base neutrals hexachlorobenzene and hexachlorobutadiene the recovery of volatiles by sds cgas is significantly greater than that of sds solution and water for example after 4 liquid pore volumes 25 of tetrachloroethene is recovered by cgas while only 0 5 and 2 is removed by sds solution and water respectively for base neutrals their removal efficiency by sds cgas is 7 11 higher than sds solution to do so the higher removal rate of volatiles than base neutrals is possibly attributed to the phase separation of the sds cgas during transport in the soil as the sds cgas collapses to gas and liquid phase after traveling a short distance in the soil the released gas may carry the volatile oily waste and float upwards thereby enhancing their removal roy et al 1995a again compared the efficiency of sds cgas sds solution and water in flushing residual levels of automatic transmission fluid atf a light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl from a superfund site soil in down flow and up flow modes in the down flow mode sds cgas 8 mm sds solution 8 mm and water removes 50 42 and 20 of atf from soil after washing with 6 pore volumes in the up flow mode the percentage of atf removed by sds cgas 8 mm and sds solution 8 mm is comparable around 41 while water elutes out 33 of atf from the soil sds cgas performes better in down flow mode than in up flow mode and increasing the surfactant concentration does not increase the removal rate correspondingly which are consistent with the results in removing oily waste by using cgas roy et al 1994 cgas are employed to flush naphthalene from soil roy et al 1995b the efficiency of the cgas and solution of nonionic tergitol cationic hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide htab and anionic sds are compared among these surfactants nonionic tergitol is the most effective flushing agent in the form of cgas and solution because cationic htab strongly adsorbs on the negatively charged soil matrix and sds precipitated as ca ds 2 through ionic exchange after flushing the column with 6 liquid pore volumes the concentration of tergitol solution at 0 15 20 and 50 mm removes 3 30 and 66 of naphthalene while 1 11 and 51 of naphthalene are removed by cgas produced from those solutions tergitol cgas is less efficient than tergitol solution possibly attributes to the channelling soil pore clogging due to dispersion of soil colloids by cgas and reduction of hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix kommalapati et al 1998 employed a soapnut cgas in flushing hexachlorophene hcb in soil columns in a down flow mode at low hcb concentration 30 μg and 60 μg of hcb are removed by soapnut cgas and solution 0 05 after 12 pore volumes increasing surfactant concentration from 0 05 to 0 1 the hcb removal by soapnut cgas and solution are comparable which is around 120 μg at high hcb concentration 0 05 soapnut cgas and solution removes an identical amount of hcb around 190 μg after 12 pore volumes while 0 1 soapnut cgas and solution flushed out 670 and 890 μg of hcb respectively only 8 μg of hcb are removed by water flush in the soil contaminated with high concentration hcb boonamnuayvitaya et al 2009 studied the application of biononex a commercially available and biodegradable surfactant in removing pyrene from columns packed with pyrene loaded pumice particle in a down flow mode in the form of cgas and solution at the same surfactant concentration the biononex cgas elute higher percentage of pyrene out of the column compares with biononex solution to do so after flushing 20 h for example at a volume concentration of 3 biononex solution removes 47 of pyrene and 53 of pyrene is removed by its cgas the removal efficiency of pyrene raises with the increase in concentration of biononex solution e g biononex cgas and solution removed 78 and 68 pyrene at a volume concentration of 7 comparing to biononex cgas and solution pure water is the least effective eluting agent removes 11 of pyrene the percent removal of pyrene by biononex cgas is almost twice of that of biononex solution within the initial 2 h the advantage of using cgas is not obvious afterwards in terms of the usage of liquid volume in the flushing experiments within the same time period the amount of surfactant solution consumed by cgas is half of that used in surfactant solution treatment couto et al 2009a compared the efficiency of cgas regular foam and solution of sds in remediating the sandy soil contaminated by diesel oil in a down flow mode compared to regular foam and solution of sds cgas is the most effective fluid in removing diesel oil showing 96 88 and 37 of diesel oil is removed by cgas regular foam and sds solution under the same condition respectively the highest oil removal efficiency by cgas is related to their greatest interfacial areas and the closer contact between cgas and contaminants the integrity of cgas during the column flushing is preserved as the size and gas hold up of the cgas presented a similar value before and after the flushing experiments the best practice for these three flushing agents to remove diesel oil is obtained under different conditions for example the removal rate of diesel oil by sds solution is promoted under higher initial oil concentration greater particle diameter and lower flushing velocity the efficiency of regular foam in removing diesel oil is favoured in the presence of larger soil particle the removal efficiency of cgas is improved with higher rotation speeds da rosa et al 2015 studied the soil flushing by synthesis surfactants sds and ctab and biosurfactant rhamnolipid cgas as well as compared performance of cgas to surfactant solutions in a down flow mode the remediation experiments are conducted in columns packed with sandy soil containing 5 diesel oil and petroleum under the same experiment condition diesel oil is more likely removed from the column compared to petroleum due to the carbon chains of diesel is smaller than that of petroleum han et al 2009 the removal rate of diesel oil and petroleum accounts for 17 80 and 11 93 when water is employed as the flushing agent compared to the water treatment the use of surfactant cgas and surfactant solution promote the removal of both contaminants the comparison made between surfactant cgas and surfactant solution reveals that surfactant cgas perform better than surfactant solution in removing diesel oil and petroleum except the remediation of petroleum by ctab for surfactant solution prepared at critical micelle concentration sds cgas are the most efficient fluid for removing diesel oil 62 90 compared to ctab 31 21 and rhamnolipid 22 11 cgas while the use of rhamnolipid cgas 46 27 achieves higher petroleum removal rate than sds 44 26 and ctab 14 41 cgas with the increase of rhamnolipid concentration from 0 1 to 1 g l 1 the efficiency of diesel oil removed by rhamnolipid cgas greatly increases from 22 55 to 37 42 while a decrease in the petroleum removal rate is obtained from 46 27 to 42 16 4 1 2 removal of heavy metal mukhopadhyay et al 2015 compared the performance of surfactant sds and soapnut cgas to their solutions in flushing an iron rich soil contaminated by low levels of arsenic as 85 63 mg kg no significant advantage in removing arsenic is observed when using surfactant cgas compared to surfactant solution for both surfactants after the treatment time of 48 min however in terms of the usage of surfactant solution within the same treatment time utilizing cgas reduces the amount of surfactant solution required for soil remediation as cgas contains 35 of air in the experiments involving cgas soapnut cgas are more efficient than sds cgas in removing arsenic from the soil and their efficiency heavily depend on the flow modes for example a slightly greater ratio of total arsenic is removed by 1 soapnut cgas around 38 at ph 6 in a down flow mode compared to that of 20 mm sds cgas 31 switch the flushing mode to up flow the arsenic removal is enhanced and a greater advantage of using 1 soapnut cgas than sds cgas is observed where 1 soapnut and 20 mm sds cgas remove approximately 65 5 and 35 4 of arsenic respectively the greater arsenic removal efficiency obtained in the up flow mode is possibly attributed to the higher buoyancy of cgas when they are introduced from the bottom of the column the removal efficient of arsenic by cgas at ph 5 is almost comparable to these obtained at ph 6 indicating that the correlation between ph and arsenic removal efficiency is weak surfactant concentration also play a role in affecting the efficiency of cgas increasing surfactant concentration can promote the removal of arsenic by cgas generated from both surfactant except the use of soapnut cgas in down mode similar effect of soapnut concentration on the efficiency of cgas is also found in another separate work of mukhopadhyay et al 2017 4 1 3 summary in most of the studies utilizing cgas as flushing agent to remove pollutants surfactant cgas perform better than conventional surfactant foam and solution in terms of pollutant removal rate and required surfactant solution amount the efficiency of pollutant removal by cgas is affected by the following parameters surfactant type and concentration flushing mode the structure and concentration of contaminate and soil properties the mechanism of cgas cgas enhanced soil flushing for organic pollutants and heavy metals is illustrated in fig 3 and the following specific mechanism are involved i phase separation of cgas during the transport of cgas in the soil matrix cgas are separated into gaseous and liquid phase the volatiles contaminates can be removed with the gas phase while the base neutral pollutants are more likely removed by the liquid phase ii the displacement and dispersion of pollutants are due to the lowered surface interface tension in the presence of cgas iii micellar solubilization or higher interfacial area leads to closer contact between remediation fluid and contaminant favoring mobilization of the contaminant and its removal 4 2 cgas as carriers cgas comprise a large number of minute spherical gas bubbles encapsulated in a soapy liquid film in an aqueous surfactant solution have gas content ranging from 40 to 70 feng et al 2009 jauregi and varley 1999 park et al 2009 sebba 1987 and are found to increase oxygen transfer for fermentations in liquid solution kaster et al 1990 moreover microorganism prefers to attach to the air liquid interfaces rather than to the solid water interfaces ripley et al 2002 wan and wilson 1994 therefore cgas has the potential to carry oxygen bacteria and dissolved materials to contaminated sites for the purpose of enhancing bioremediation 4 2 1 oxygen 4 2 1 1 oxygen delivery cgas have potential to stimulate the aerobic biodegradation of organic pollutants in oxygen limited substrate as cgas could penetrate the subsurface and greatly increase the dissolved oxygen in water li et al 2014 cgas have been shown to promote the aerobic degradation of organic pollutants such as phenol michelsen et al 1984 p xylene jenkins et al 1993 and phenanthrene choi et al 2009 park et al 2009 in artificial sandy columns by delivering oxygen michelsen et al 1984 studied the degradation of phenol by using sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate cgas the combination of cgas pseudomonas putida and nutrients was injected into the sand contaminated by phenol 62 of the total phenol is degraded within 24 h the comparison of bubble adhesion to different surfaces golf course sand pea gravel oyster shells and standard epa soil reveal that cgas can adhere to sand and other soil matrices and retain for a long period of time the adhesion behaviour of cgas to soil matrix may alter the soil environment from anaerobic to aerobic jenkins et al 1993 studied in situ biodegradation of p xylene by pseudomonas putida in the presence of nadbs and tergitol 15 5 12 cgas containing 125 mg oxygen in a soil column cgas are intermittently injected into the column namely cgas are introduced when the oxygen level declined the p xylene concentration drops immediately to a value below the detectable limit after injecting cgas and its concentration remains low till injected oxygen is depleted the oxygen balance in the column is calculated after the degradation p xylene biodegradation utilized 69 9 of the total injected oxygen 14 of the total injected oxygen may be consumed during the degradation of surfactants if the surfactants is biodegradable 4 6 of the total injected oxygen is accounted for vent loss 5 1 of the total injected oxygen is dissolved in the water and the unknown loss accounted for 6 4 of total injected oxygen rothmel et al 1998 carried out an experiment on the degradation of trichloroethylene tce with the treatment of steol cs 330 cgas 0 1 using a cgas artificial ground water cgas flush 75 of tce is flushed out of the column and residual tce concentration distributed in a range of 22 470 μg g though the column followed by treating the residual tce with cgas and tce degrading bacteria env 435 95 99 of the residual tce is degraded choi et al 2009 investigated the degradation of phenanthrene 100 mg kg in sand columns using burkholderia cepacia rph1 sphingobium yanoikuyae b1 and sphingomonas paucimobilis epa505 the oxygen level in the column declines from 20 to 5 within 5 days after injecting 3 pore volumes of cgas approximately 34 4 51 5 and 38 9 of initial phenanthrene is removed in 8 days in the columns inoculated with burkholderia cepacia rph1 sphingobium yanoikuyae b1 and sphingomonas paucimobilis epa505 respectively however 15 of initial phenanthrene is completely degraded according to the stoichiometric calculation based on the reduction of oxygen level in the column choi et al 2009 also injected 3 pore volumes of cgas into the column every 7 days over a period of 21 days and found that 75 3 of initial phenanthrene can be removed by burkholderia cepacia rph1 a bench scale column study compared the efficiency of saponin cgas and solution in the degradation of phenanthrene by burkholderia cepacia rph1 park et al 2009 after 21 days incubation columns purged with cgas obtaines a degradation of phenanthrene up to 30 while no degradation occurres in columns treated with surfactant solution at the same concentration in the cgas treated columns a gas phase concentration of 84 is detected at the bottom of the column and its value declines with the increase of column depth where 28 and 9 of gas phase concentration is obtained at the middle and top of the columns respectively due to the variation in gas phase concentration along the columns the relative residual of phenanthrene decreases from 80 to 40 at the bottom of the columns after the treatment period while a slight increase in relative residual of phenanthrene is detected at the top of columns 4 2 1 2 oxygen transfer of cgas some studies have investigated the oxygen transfer of cgas in batch and identified the factors that limit the oxygen transfer efficiency dai et al 2004 studied the oxygen transfer by the aid of cgas and analyzed the effect of stirring velocity surfactant type and concentration and temperature four surfactants sds hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride htac nonylphenol ethoxylate np 10 and potassium mono lauryl phosphate mapk are used to generate cgas among all surfactants sds cgas has the best performance in enhancing oxygen mass transfer where 2 75 g l 1 sds cgas can enhance the value of the mass transfer of oxygen kla by a factor of 3 compared to surfactant free system with the increase of surfactant concentration kla changes according to different type of surfactant where kla increased for sds cgas decreases for mapk cgas increases for htac cgas up to the concentration of 0 363 mg l 1 and then decreases while the concentration of np 10 cgas does not affect the value of kla accelerating the stirring speed from 5000 to 8000 rpm kla increases from 2 5 to 4 5 s 1 due to the stronger bubble turbulence in the liquid and higher surface renewal velocity produced under higher stirring speed in the temperature range of 288 to 308 k kla increases dramatically with the raise of temperature due to greater molecular diffusion under higher temperature oxygen solubility decreases beyond the temperature of 308 k the effect of temperature is less significant accordingly li et al 2013 prepared micro nano bubbles with an averaged diameter of 50 μm and compared their oxygen transfer efficiency to macro bubbles in the batch studies the using of micro nano bubbles achieves a peak value of dissolved oxygen of 120 after 10 min which is higher than macro bubbles around 15 salinity also plays a role in affecting the oxygen transfer efficiency of micro nano bubbles where the salinity of 0 7 g l is found to be the optimal salt concentration for oxygen transfer similar results on the effect of bubble size are obtained in by li et al 2014 showing that the reduction in the bubble size promots the oxygen transfer process studies also have simulated the oxygen transfer process in the presence of cgas worden and bredwell 1998 developed a dynamic model for numerically solving the mass transfer of individual bubbles this model considers the mass transfer resistance in the surfactant shell bubble shrinkage changes in the gas pressure and composition inside the bubble and changes in the concentration profile in the liquid surrounding the bubble among these parameters bubble shrinkage is predicted to be significant on a time scale of seconds the average coefficient can describe experimental systems as the comparable time averaged values are relatively constant over a wide range of bubble radius 4 2 2 bacteria delivery besides delivering oxygen to the contaminated site cgas also has the potential to be the carrier of bacteria during inculcating of bacteria to contaminated sites some studies have investigated the efficiency of cgas as bacterial carrier choi et al 2009 jackson et al 1998 park et al 2009 rothmel et al 1998 rothmel et al 1998 studied the transport of env 435 in column with the aid of water surfactant solution and surfactant cgas three surfactants tergitol 15 s 12 steol cs 300 and biosoft d 40 were utilized the addition of surfactant solution 0 05 promotes the mobility of env 435 compared to water runs as 61 62 bacteria are recovered with surfactant solution addition while water flush recovers only 28 of bacteria comparing to the efficiency of cgas produced from the same surfactant 0 05 steol cs 330 cgas is the most efficient agent for delivering bacteria with bacterial recovery of 85 followed by tergitol 15 s 12 59 and biosoft d 40 29 cgas increasing steol cs 330 concentration from 0 05 to 0 1 does not further enhance the bacterial mobility accordingly jackson et al 1998 investigated the transport of psendomonas psendoalcaligenes with ddbs cgas in steel columns packed with a sandy clay loam bacterial suspension is introduced in a down flow mode followed by flushing the column with deionized water ddbs solution or ddbs cgas at a flow rate of 0 16 cm min after eluting 5 pore volumes of eluting agent into the column bacterial distribution within the column is analyzed using bacterial density bacterial density in water and surfactant solution runs shows similar pattern namely the greatest bacterial density is found at 5 cm from the inlet and its value decreases rapidly with the increase of traveling distance while bacterial distribution produced by cgas fluctuates along the column where a rapid decrease in the bacterial density is found at 5 to 13 cm from the inlet followed by an increase in bacterial density at 13 to 15 cm afterwards the bacterial density slightly decreases and reaches a plateau at 20 cm in terms of the bacterial density obtained in the effluent bacterial density obtained in the cgas treatment is around 1 5 orders of magnitude higher than those treated with the same surfactant solution after eluting with 2 5 pore volumes of surfactant solution choi et al 2009 also compared the transport of burkholderia cepacia rph1 in saponin cgas and solution although a similar pattern in the breakthrough curves of bacterial transport in cgas and solution are observed a greater ratio of total injected bacteria is recovered in the cgas aided transport cgas elutes out 42 of total injected bacteria while only 8 of total injected bacteria are recovered by using surfactant solution park et al 2009 also studied the transport of burkholderia cepacia rph1in column and found that the distribution of bacteria throughout the column with the aid of cgas is uniform 4 2 3 dissolved materials mattigod et al 2010 utilized cgas as a carrier of dissolved phosphate for in situ immobilization of radionuclide uranium u in sediments the sediments contain 300 mg kg u at a specific location less than 3 of the total u is leachable from the immobilized zone confirming feasibility of using cgas as the carrier for in situ immobilization of u mukhopadhyay et al 2017 also used soapnut cgas as the carrier of phosphate for flushing off arsenic in soil column as phosphate can promote the mobility of arsenic compared to the removal rate of arsenic by soapnut cgas up to 70 the soapnut carrying phosphate removes up to 95 arsenic indicating that cgas could delivery phosphate into the column 4 2 4 summary in studies used cgas as the carrier of oxygen bacteria and dissolved materials type and concentration of surfactant are the essential considered parameters for evaluating the efficiency of cgas the mechanism of cgas cgas enhanced soil flushing for organic pollutants and heavy metals is illustrated in fig 4 and the specific meachinsms are i cgas can penetrate low permeable soil and the phase separation of cgas release oxygen to the low oxygen area ii increasing the bioavailability hydrophobic pollutants iii cgas are able to create channels within the soil matrix thereby enhance the transport of bacteria 5 limitations and future prospect there is few more works need to be done in the future to enhance our knowledge of the potential application of cgas for soil remediation 1 studies have simulated the transport of cgas in one dimensional porous media and investigated parameters affected cgas transport however to understand the mechanism of cgas aided soil remediation future studies need to scale up and simulate the cgas transport in two or three dimensional porous media as well as field application 2 for the applications of cgas as flushing medium carrier of oxygen bacteria and dissolved materials in soil remediation the following aspects need to be done in the future i for the use of cgas as the flushing agent to physically remove organic pollutant and heavy metal these applications have comprehensively investigated the parameters that affect the efficiency of soil flushing thus a possible area of future research is adjusting the surfactant type surfactant concentration cgas generation method and ionic strength of solution for specific soil matrix and contaminant structure thereby promoting the flushing efficacy of cgas thus enhancing pollutant removal ii for cgas aided bacterial transport the hydrophobicity of bacteria is another parameter needed to be considered because bacteria with different hydrophobicity had different affinity to the gas water interfaces and solid water interfaces although both hydrophilic and hydrophobic bacteria show preferential sorption onto gas water interfaces over solid water interfaces wan and wilson 1994 hydrophobic bacteria have a stronger affinity to soil particles than hydrophilic bacteria chen and zhu 2004 huysman and verstraete 1993 and hydrophobic bacteria also have a greater adhesion tendency to gas liquid interfaces than hydrophilic bacteria ripley et al 2002 wan and wilson 1994 therefore the effects of bacterial hydrophobicity on the efficiency of cgas as bacterial carrier need to be studied in the future work iii similar to the transport of cgas the applications of cgas as flushing medium carrier of oxygen bacteria and dissolved materials in soil remediation also have been frequently conducted on small scale and batch system but have never been applied at large scale or in the field therefore there is an essential need for more studies to scale up the application of cgas for soil remediation in the future 3 considering the low ecological toxicity and biodegradable nature of biosurfactants abalos et al 2004 nitschke et al 2005 rebello et al 2014 the application of cgas generated from biosurfactants to remediate contaminated soils will be the focus in the future knowledge of all of these factors has the potential to advance and stimulate soil remediation 6 good conclusions surfactant cgas has emerged as a cost effective and environmental alternative of surfactant solution for soil remediation due to their unique properties in the present manuscript the fundamental properties of cgas and the flow of cgas in soil matrix have been reviewed and the applications of cgas for soil remediation of contaminated soil have been reviewed and discussed the properties of colloidal gas aphron can be influenced by various factors i e surfactant type and concentration electrolyte concentration generation parameters ph the presence of dissolved or suspended other molecules in the solution factors e g bubble size grain size of soil flow rate permeability porosity of soil and pressure drop determines cgas transport in porous media surfactant cgas have potential application in physically removing organic pollutants and heavy metal delivering microorganism and oxygen for bioremediation of contaminates soil and transporting d dissolved solutes for contaminants immobilization and removal the main mechanisms involved in the remediation processes include increasing the mobilization of pollutants the phase separation of cgas micellar solubilization the displacement and dispersion of pollutant the ability to carry oxygen microorganisms and dissolved materials for the industrial application of cgas in soil remediation more knowledge is required scaling up the flow and application of cgas should be scaled up to pilot scale matching surfactant cgas with contaminants under specific conditions selecting the suitable bacteria type and surfactant cgas for bioremediation and investigating the application of cgas produced from biosurfactant are the

1522,surfactant solutions have been frequently studied for soil remediation however since they are expensive massive consumption of surfactant solution can constrain their application surfactant microbubbles or colloidal gas aphrons cgas can serve as cost effective alternatives of surfactant solution because the use of cgas reduce the amount of surfactant consumption moreover cgas can also improve the contact with the contaminated environment due to their unique surface properties e g containing 40 70 of gas small size large interfacial areas water like flow properties and buoyant rise velocities in this review paper the properties and flow character of cgas in soil matrix reviewed due to their relevance to soil remediation process a comprehensive overview of the application of cgas in flushing off organic pollutants and heavy metals and carrying oxygen bacteria and dissolved materials for soil remediation were provided this paper also highlighted the limitation of cgas application and important future research scopes keywords surfactant colloidal gas aphrons soil flushing in situ bioremediation 1 introduction since the widespread of pollutants in soil would pose threaten to human health and ecological security clean up pollutants from contaminated soil is needed surfactants surface active agents have emerged as promising tools for soil remediation surfactants have been widely employed in contaminated site for their ability in flushing off pollutant e g organic pollutants heavy metals and radionuclides from soil khalladi et al 2009 liang et al 2017 pennell et al 1996 svab et al 2009 and promoting biodegradation of organic pollutants aronstein et al 1991 bezza and nkhalambayausi chirwa 2016 li and zhu 2012 zhang et al 2013 these applications makes good use of the properties of surfactant reducing of interfacial tension hamzah et al 2018 enhancing phase transfer of pollutant from soil to pseudo aqueous phase and increasing bioavailability of organic pollutants aronstein et al 1991 bezza and nkhalambayausi chirwa 2016 li and zhu 2012 zhang et al 2013 however surfactant solution is expensive and the great consumption of surfactant solution for soil remediation may limit the commercial use of such remediation method boonamnuayvitaya et al 2009 jackson et al 1998 mukhopadhyay et al 2015 a surfactant microbubble or colloidal gas aphron cga is a surfactant bound gas bubble with a diameter ranging from 10 to 100 μm sebba 1985 the structure of single microbubble was first proposed by sebba 1987 fig 1 namely a microbubble suspension cgas comprise a large number of minute spherical gas bubbles encapsulated in a soapy liquid film in an aqueous surfactant solution cgas have emerged as promising alternatives of surfactant solution because i a gas content ranging from 40 to 70 feng et al 2009 jauregi and varley 1999 park et al 2009 sebba 1987 which requires less surfactant solution for soil remediation thereby effectively lowering down the overall cost boonamnuayvitaya et al 2009 jackson et al 1998 mukhopadhyay et al 2015 ii small size 10 100 μm and water like flow properties can enable them to penetrate low permeability area in soil jauregi et al 1997 jauregi et al 2000 save and pangarkar 1994 sebba 1971 iii large interfacial areas which can serve as reservoirs for contaminates and bacteria jauregi and varley 1999 parker 1989 wan and wilson 1994 iv buoyant rise velocities mukhopadhyay et al 2015 based on these properties cgas have been studied for their potentials in physically removing organic pollutants and heavy metals from contaminated soil mukhopadhyay et al 2015 roy et al 1995a roy et al 1995b roy et al 1994 as well as delivering and dispersing oxygen bacteria and dissolved materials for soil remediation however the potential effectiveness of cgas in soil remediation is affected by the characters of cgas e g stability size distribution gas hold up the properties of soil i e pore size the distribution of cgas bacteria and nanoparticles in porous media different types of surfactant can generate cgas with different properties for example cgas generated from anionic surfactant e g sodium lauryl ether sulfate and sodium dodecyl sulfate are more stable than those generated using nonionic tergitol e g tween 20 and triton x 100 ding et al 2013 shen et al 2011 in column experiments the anionic surfactant cgas demonstrates slightly better ability for carrying nanoparticles than cgas of nonionic surfactant ding et al 2013 shen et al 2011 the pore size of porous meida not only affect the distribution of cgas but also affect their efficiency as carrier for instance when delivering nanoparticles to the column cgas are more efficient in columns with coarse pore size ranges from 0 18 0 51 mm than in columns with finer pore size ranges from 0 09 0 18 mm ding et al 2013 in contrast one study found that cgas were better able to penetrate columns with finer sand ranges from 0 10 0 20 mm than sand with coarse pore size 0 20 0 57 mm su et al 2014 bacteria transport by cgas is reliant on the adhesion tendency of bacterial suspension to sand particles and air water interfaces the preferential sorption of bacteria to the air liquid interfaces rather than the solid water interfaces can contribute to the enhancement of transport and dispersion of bacteria ripley et al 2002 wan and wilson 1994 both hydrophilic and hydrophobic bacteria show preferential sorption onto gas water interfaces over solid water interfaces wan and wilson 1994 while for the sorption on soil hydrophobic bacteria have a stronger affinity than hydrophilic bacteria chen and zhu 2004 huysman and verstraete 1993 hydrophobic bacteria also have a greater adhesion tendency to gas liquid interfaces than do hydrophilic bacteria ripley et al 2002 wan et al 1994 thus the objective of this review is to expose the reader to the properties of cgas describe the transport behaviours of cgas in microscale in porous media and provide the research work carried out in soil remediation using cgas 2 cgas characterization stability size distribution and gas hold up are the most commonly characterized properties for the application of cgas in soil remediation 2 1 stability with regard to soil remediation stable cgas can enable soil penetration thus flushing off pollutants or delivering bacteria oxygen nutrients and dissolved materials for soil remediation the stability of cgas refers to its ability to resist collapse and can be quantified as the time required for half of the cgas to collapse half time or one tenth of drained liquid life t0 1 banifatemi et al 2016 sadeghialiabadi and amiri 2015 various factors e g the surfactant type and concentration electrolyte concentration cgas processing parameters ph and the presence of dissolved or suspended solutes in the solution and nanoparticle are found to affect the stability of cgas surfactant type and concentration are key parameters determining the stability of cgas at ph 7 the cgas of anionic rhamnolipid has a half time of 461 s which is greater than the half time of nonionic tergitol cgas 383 s feng et al 2009 other studies found similar results that cgas of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate sodium lauryl sulphase sls are more stable than cgas of other types of surfactant cationic surfactant cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride ctac dodecyl trimethyl ammoniumchloride dtac and nonionic surfactant alcohol ethoxylates polyoxyethene triglyceride save and pangarkar 1994 tabzar et al 2015 increasing surfactant concentration from 0 1 to 61 mm the half time of cgas raises from 60 to 758 s accordingly jauregi et al 1997 which is consistent with other observations feng et al 2009 jauregi et al 1997 matsushita et al 1992 that the stability of cgas increased with rising surfactant concentration the greater stability of cgas at higher surfactant concentration is due to the greater electrostatic repulsion between adjacent bubbles and higher viscosity jauregi et al 1997 yan et al 2005 in terms of electrolyte concentration of surfactant solution cgas stability reduces with increasing electrolyte concentration amiri and woodburn 1990 feng et al 2009 jauregi et al 1997 save and pangarkar 1994 at ph 6 adding 1000 g l 1 sodium chloride results in the stability of rhamnolipid cgas decreasing from 495 to 440 s and its stability further decreases to 429 s with increasing the concentration of sodium chloride to 3000 mg l 1 feng et al 2009 the reduction in cgas stability is related to the smaller electrostatic repulsion between adjacent as a result of the compressed electrical double layer bubbles under higher electrolyte concentration jauregi et al 1997 while at ph 7 and 8 the effect of sodium chloride is insignificant the cgas generation process is another parameter affecting the stability of cgas rhamnolipid cgas generated by a flat spinning disc mixer have a half time of 466 s compared to 325 s using a propeller mixer feng 2009 the position and disc size for sheering cgas also can affect the stability of cgas the sheering disc is recommended to locate 2 cm under the liquid surface lee et al 2005 and more stable cgas can be generated using a spinning disc with larger diameter sadeghialiabadi and amiri 2015 the increase of stirring speed generally increase the stability of cgas bhatia et al 2005 matsushita et al 1992 the duration of mixing process also affects the stability of cgas save and pangarkar 1994 found that the stability of cgas fluctuates slightly during the mixing time of 1 to 5 min but remains constant for mixing time beyond 5 min while the rise of temperature decreases the stability of cgas yan et al 2005 studies on the effect of ph on the stability of cgas have not obtained consistent results some studies found the change of ph does not significantly affect the stability of cgas jauregi et al 1997 save and pangarkar 1994 while amiri and woodburn 1990 and feng et al 2009 found that the stability of cgas decreases with increasing ph various additives are employed to increase the stability of cgas dai and deng 2003 studied the stability of htac cgas with the addition of sodium silicate and found the suitable ph scale 7 10 and sodium silicate addition between 0 15 and 0 25 m for generating stable cgas amiri and sadeghialiabadi 2014 investigated the stability of sds and nonyl phenol ethoxylate 20 npe20 cgas in the presence of montmorillonite nanoparticles and found that the addition of montmorillonite nanoparticles to cgas delays the coalescence of cgas thus increases their stability 2 2 size distribution the size of cgas ranges from 10 to 100 μm according to sebba 1985 feng et al 2009 found that the majority diameter of bubbles lies in the range of 20 140 μm the size of cgas affect their stability namely larger bubbles are more stable than small bubbles various methods have been employed to measure the size distribution of cgas among these methods laser diffraction chaphalkar et al 1993 couto et al 2009b kommalapati et al 1996 light microscopes and image analysis feng et al 2009 jauregi et al 1997 save and pangarkar 1994 are the most frequently used measurement methods similar to the stability of cgas their size is also affected by the following factors i e surfactant type and concentration mixing speed ionic strength and the presence of other molecules chaphalkar et al 1993 and kommalapati et al 1996 found that cgas generated from nonionic surfactants are smaller than these produced from ionic surfactants due to the fact that nonionic surfactants are more likely compressed higher surfactant concentration results in smaller mean bubble size feng et al 2009 kommalapati et al 1996 while kommalapati et al 1996 found the effect of surfactant concentration is less significate when it is above critical micelle concentration cmc cgas generated under higher mixing speed have smaller size for example basu and malpani 2001 found that the mean diameter of cgas reduces from 75 to 22 μm with increasing mixing speed from 4000 to 8000 rpm meanwhile the additives flotigam and sodium oleate would reduce bubble sizes from to μm couto et al 2009b 2 3 gas hold up for cgas the gas hold up is defined as the volume fraction of gas to the total volume of cgas the gas volume is equal to the difference between the total volume of cgas and the final liquid volume gas hold up can potentially be used to quantify the capacity of the cgas in carrying oxygen for bioremediation cgas normally displays a gas hold up ability ranging from 40 to 70 feng et al 2009 sebba 1987 subramaniam et al 1990 3 flow of cgas in porous media knowledge of the flow characteristics of cgas in porous media is needed when cgas are applied to soil remediation studies have simulated cgas transport in one dimensional porous media and identified the parameters that affect the transport of cgas considering the properties of cgas i e small size stable and strong their transport in porous media can be treated as colloid transport alizadeh and khamehchi 2017 wan et al 2001 the transport cgas in one dimensional homogeneous porous media has been simulated using one dimensional convention and dispersion equation as follows alizadeh and khamehchi 2017 wan et al 2001 1 r c t d 2 c z 2 v 0 c z k a c where c is the cgas concentration l 3 r is the retardation factor t is the time v 0 is the pore water velocity inside the column l t 1 d is the dispersion coefficient l2 t 1 k a is the pseudo first order rate coefficient for attachment t 1 two approaches can be used to estimate these unknown transport parameters d r and k a in the first approach the transport parameters are obtained by fitting the experiment data through the nonlinear regression model based on the modified levenberg marquardt method routines rnlin and r2lin international mathematical and statistical libraries houston texas 1997 wan et al 2001 the total number of cgas in the influent and effluent is considered in the first approach in the second approach the value of the attachment coefficients k a is estimated using the filtration theory wan et al 2001 yao et al 1971 the study of cgas transport in two or three dimensional porous media has not yet been reported so far laboratory experiments are also conducted to understand the flow character of cgas in porous media choi et al 2008 visualized the flow patterns of cgas in porous media and found that cgas are separated into a liquid and gas phase immediately after injection where liquid phase showes greater movement than gas phase however distinct transport behaviours of cgas are observed by couto et al 2009a where the size and gas hold up of the cgas present a similar value before and after the flushing experiments in soil columns therefore there is a need to identify the parameters that affect cgas transport in porous media the bubble size grain size flow rate permeability porosity of soil and pressure drop are found to be important factors determining cgas transport wan et al 2001 found that cgas transport is greatly affected by grain size for bubble size ranged from 0 7 to 20 μm complete cgas recovery is obtained from effluents of the coarse 415 500 μm sand as compared to 80 and 30 of cgas recovered from the medium 150 212 μm and fine 53 103 μm sands respectively alizadeh and khamehchi 2017 found that the increase in the ratio of the bubble size to the grain size on the penetration of cgas reduces the traveling distance of cgas alizadeh and khamehchi 2017 also analyzed the effect of permeability and effective porosity of soil and found that the cgas can travel farther with the increase of these values flow rate is another parameter that affects the transport of cgas comparing to cgas recovery under a flow rate of 1 pore volume h 1 a greater percentage of cgas is recovered from the column under a flow rate of 0 02 pore volume h 1 wan et al 2001 pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of the column also plays a role in cgas transport the increase of pressure difference facilitates the transport of cgas which is possibly due to the reduction of cgas size and increase in the driving force for cgas flow under higher pressure difference alizadeh and khamehchi 2017 4 applications and mechanism of cgas in soil remediation cgas have been widely studied for its potential in soil remediation for example physically remove organic pollutants and heavy metals from contaminated soil as well as carry and disperse oxygen nutrients bacteria and dissolved materials for soil remediation fig 2 these applications make good use of the unique properties of cgas including 1 small size jauregi et al 2000 2 large interfacial areas jauregi and varley 1999 parker 1989 3 relatively high stability 4 and the fact that particles can adsorb on the cgas surfaces wan and wilson 1994 4 1 cgas as an agent for soil flushing the cga suspensions demonstrate water like viscosities which make them suitable for pumping without significant deterioration cgas have been applied to physically remove the organic contaminants and heavy metals 4 1 1 removal of organic pollutants roy et al 1992 compared the performance of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate ddbs cgas to surfactant solution in flushing a 2 4 dichlorophenoxy acetic acid 2 4 d soil in down flow mode the removal percent of 2 4 d by cgas is comparable to surfactant solution however in terms of the efficiency of per gram of surfactant solution per gram of surfactant solution in the cgas removes significantly more 2 4 d than surfactant solution roy et al 1994 also studied the use of cgas in flushing off oily waste a dense non aqueous phase liquid from soil in columns the performance of cgas prepared from sds solution was compared with surfactant solution and water under three different flow modes in the down flow mode sds cgas remove higher percentage of oily waste 56 than either sds solution 47 or water 43 a lower proportion of total oily waste is recovered by cgas from the soil column with a value of 47 and 49 by switching the flow mode to up flow and horizontal modes respectively roy et al 1994 also studied the effect of surfactant concentration on the performance of sds cgas however the increase of surfactant concentration from 8 mm to 30 mm does not further enhance the recovery of oily waste by either sds cgas or solution roy et al 1994 further studied the removal of specific pollutants in the oily waste volatiles tetrachloroethene 1 1 2 2 tetra chloroethane and l l l trichloroethane and base neutrals hexachlorobenzene and hexachlorobutadiene the recovery of volatiles by sds cgas is significantly greater than that of sds solution and water for example after 4 liquid pore volumes 25 of tetrachloroethene is recovered by cgas while only 0 5 and 2 is removed by sds solution and water respectively for base neutrals their removal efficiency by sds cgas is 7 11 higher than sds solution to do so the higher removal rate of volatiles than base neutrals is possibly attributed to the phase separation of the sds cgas during transport in the soil as the sds cgas collapses to gas and liquid phase after traveling a short distance in the soil the released gas may carry the volatile oily waste and float upwards thereby enhancing their removal roy et al 1995a again compared the efficiency of sds cgas sds solution and water in flushing residual levels of automatic transmission fluid atf a light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl from a superfund site soil in down flow and up flow modes in the down flow mode sds cgas 8 mm sds solution 8 mm and water removes 50 42 and 20 of atf from soil after washing with 6 pore volumes in the up flow mode the percentage of atf removed by sds cgas 8 mm and sds solution 8 mm is comparable around 41 while water elutes out 33 of atf from the soil sds cgas performes better in down flow mode than in up flow mode and increasing the surfactant concentration does not increase the removal rate correspondingly which are consistent with the results in removing oily waste by using cgas roy et al 1994 cgas are employed to flush naphthalene from soil roy et al 1995b the efficiency of the cgas and solution of nonionic tergitol cationic hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide htab and anionic sds are compared among these surfactants nonionic tergitol is the most effective flushing agent in the form of cgas and solution because cationic htab strongly adsorbs on the negatively charged soil matrix and sds precipitated as ca ds 2 through ionic exchange after flushing the column with 6 liquid pore volumes the concentration of tergitol solution at 0 15 20 and 50 mm removes 3 30 and 66 of naphthalene while 1 11 and 51 of naphthalene are removed by cgas produced from those solutions tergitol cgas is less efficient than tergitol solution possibly attributes to the channelling soil pore clogging due to dispersion of soil colloids by cgas and reduction of hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix kommalapati et al 1998 employed a soapnut cgas in flushing hexachlorophene hcb in soil columns in a down flow mode at low hcb concentration 30 μg and 60 μg of hcb are removed by soapnut cgas and solution 0 05 after 12 pore volumes increasing surfactant concentration from 0 05 to 0 1 the hcb removal by soapnut cgas and solution are comparable which is around 120 μg at high hcb concentration 0 05 soapnut cgas and solution removes an identical amount of hcb around 190 μg after 12 pore volumes while 0 1 soapnut cgas and solution flushed out 670 and 890 μg of hcb respectively only 8 μg of hcb are removed by water flush in the soil contaminated with high concentration hcb boonamnuayvitaya et al 2009 studied the application of biononex a commercially available and biodegradable surfactant in removing pyrene from columns packed with pyrene loaded pumice particle in a down flow mode in the form of cgas and solution at the same surfactant concentration the biononex cgas elute higher percentage of pyrene out of the column compares with biononex solution to do so after flushing 20 h for example at a volume concentration of 3 biononex solution removes 47 of pyrene and 53 of pyrene is removed by its cgas the removal efficiency of pyrene raises with the increase in concentration of biononex solution e g biononex cgas and solution removed 78 and 68 pyrene at a volume concentration of 7 comparing to biononex cgas and solution pure water is the least effective eluting agent removes 11 of pyrene the percent removal of pyrene by biononex cgas is almost twice of that of biononex solution within the initial 2 h the advantage of using cgas is not obvious afterwards in terms of the usage of liquid volume in the flushing experiments within the same time period the amount of surfactant solution consumed by cgas is half of that used in surfactant solution treatment couto et al 2009a compared the efficiency of cgas regular foam and solution of sds in remediating the sandy soil contaminated by diesel oil in a down flow mode compared to regular foam and solution of sds cgas is the most effective fluid in removing diesel oil showing 96 88 and 37 of diesel oil is removed by cgas regular foam and sds solution under the same condition respectively the highest oil removal efficiency by cgas is related to their greatest interfacial areas and the closer contact between cgas and contaminants the integrity of cgas during the column flushing is preserved as the size and gas hold up of the cgas presented a similar value before and after the flushing experiments the best practice for these three flushing agents to remove diesel oil is obtained under different conditions for example the removal rate of diesel oil by sds solution is promoted under higher initial oil concentration greater particle diameter and lower flushing velocity the efficiency of regular foam in removing diesel oil is favoured in the presence of larger soil particle the removal efficiency of cgas is improved with higher rotation speeds da rosa et al 2015 studied the soil flushing by synthesis surfactants sds and ctab and biosurfactant rhamnolipid cgas as well as compared performance of cgas to surfactant solutions in a down flow mode the remediation experiments are conducted in columns packed with sandy soil containing 5 diesel oil and petroleum under the same experiment condition diesel oil is more likely removed from the column compared to petroleum due to the carbon chains of diesel is smaller than that of petroleum han et al 2009 the removal rate of diesel oil and petroleum accounts for 17 80 and 11 93 when water is employed as the flushing agent compared to the water treatment the use of surfactant cgas and surfactant solution promote the removal of both contaminants the comparison made between surfactant cgas and surfactant solution reveals that surfactant cgas perform better than surfactant solution in removing diesel oil and petroleum except the remediation of petroleum by ctab for surfactant solution prepared at critical micelle concentration sds cgas are the most efficient fluid for removing diesel oil 62 90 compared to ctab 31 21 and rhamnolipid 22 11 cgas while the use of rhamnolipid cgas 46 27 achieves higher petroleum removal rate than sds 44 26 and ctab 14 41 cgas with the increase of rhamnolipid concentration from 0 1 to 1 g l 1 the efficiency of diesel oil removed by rhamnolipid cgas greatly increases from 22 55 to 37 42 while a decrease in the petroleum removal rate is obtained from 46 27 to 42 16 4 1 2 removal of heavy metal mukhopadhyay et al 2015 compared the performance of surfactant sds and soapnut cgas to their solutions in flushing an iron rich soil contaminated by low levels of arsenic as 85 63 mg kg no significant advantage in removing arsenic is observed when using surfactant cgas compared to surfactant solution for both surfactants after the treatment time of 48 min however in terms of the usage of surfactant solution within the same treatment time utilizing cgas reduces the amount of surfactant solution required for soil remediation as cgas contains 35 of air in the experiments involving cgas soapnut cgas are more efficient than sds cgas in removing arsenic from the soil and their efficiency heavily depend on the flow modes for example a slightly greater ratio of total arsenic is removed by 1 soapnut cgas around 38 at ph 6 in a down flow mode compared to that of 20 mm sds cgas 31 switch the flushing mode to up flow the arsenic removal is enhanced and a greater advantage of using 1 soapnut cgas than sds cgas is observed where 1 soapnut and 20 mm sds cgas remove approximately 65 5 and 35 4 of arsenic respectively the greater arsenic removal efficiency obtained in the up flow mode is possibly attributed to the higher buoyancy of cgas when they are introduced from the bottom of the column the removal efficient of arsenic by cgas at ph 5 is almost comparable to these obtained at ph 6 indicating that the correlation between ph and arsenic removal efficiency is weak surfactant concentration also play a role in affecting the efficiency of cgas increasing surfactant concentration can promote the removal of arsenic by cgas generated from both surfactant except the use of soapnut cgas in down mode similar effect of soapnut concentration on the efficiency of cgas is also found in another separate work of mukhopadhyay et al 2017 4 1 3 summary in most of the studies utilizing cgas as flushing agent to remove pollutants surfactant cgas perform better than conventional surfactant foam and solution in terms of pollutant removal rate and required surfactant solution amount the efficiency of pollutant removal by cgas is affected by the following parameters surfactant type and concentration flushing mode the structure and concentration of contaminate and soil properties the mechanism of cgas cgas enhanced soil flushing for organic pollutants and heavy metals is illustrated in fig 3 and the following specific mechanism are involved i phase separation of cgas during the transport of cgas in the soil matrix cgas are separated into gaseous and liquid phase the volatiles contaminates can be removed with the gas phase while the base neutral pollutants are more likely removed by the liquid phase ii the displacement and dispersion of pollutants are due to the lowered surface interface tension in the presence of cgas iii micellar solubilization or higher interfacial area leads to closer contact between remediation fluid and contaminant favoring mobilization of the contaminant and its removal 4 2 cgas as carriers cgas comprise a large number of minute spherical gas bubbles encapsulated in a soapy liquid film in an aqueous surfactant solution have gas content ranging from 40 to 70 feng et al 2009 jauregi and varley 1999 park et al 2009 sebba 1987 and are found to increase oxygen transfer for fermentations in liquid solution kaster et al 1990 moreover microorganism prefers to attach to the air liquid interfaces rather than to the solid water interfaces ripley et al 2002 wan and wilson 1994 therefore cgas has the potential to carry oxygen bacteria and dissolved materials to contaminated sites for the purpose of enhancing bioremediation 4 2 1 oxygen 4 2 1 1 oxygen delivery cgas have potential to stimulate the aerobic biodegradation of organic pollutants in oxygen limited substrate as cgas could penetrate the subsurface and greatly increase the dissolved oxygen in water li et al 2014 cgas have been shown to promote the aerobic degradation of organic pollutants such as phenol michelsen et al 1984 p xylene jenkins et al 1993 and phenanthrene choi et al 2009 park et al 2009 in artificial sandy columns by delivering oxygen michelsen et al 1984 studied the degradation of phenol by using sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate cgas the combination of cgas pseudomonas putida and nutrients was injected into the sand contaminated by phenol 62 of the total phenol is degraded within 24 h the comparison of bubble adhesion to different surfaces golf course sand pea gravel oyster shells and standard epa soil reveal that cgas can adhere to sand and other soil matrices and retain for a long period of time the adhesion behaviour of cgas to soil matrix may alter the soil environment from anaerobic to aerobic jenkins et al 1993 studied in situ biodegradation of p xylene by pseudomonas putida in the presence of nadbs and tergitol 15 5 12 cgas containing 125 mg oxygen in a soil column cgas are intermittently injected into the column namely cgas are introduced when the oxygen level declined the p xylene concentration drops immediately to a value below the detectable limit after injecting cgas and its concentration remains low till injected oxygen is depleted the oxygen balance in the column is calculated after the degradation p xylene biodegradation utilized 69 9 of the total injected oxygen 14 of the total injected oxygen may be consumed during the degradation of surfactants if the surfactants is biodegradable 4 6 of the total injected oxygen is accounted for vent loss 5 1 of the total injected oxygen is dissolved in the water and the unknown loss accounted for 6 4 of total injected oxygen rothmel et al 1998 carried out an experiment on the degradation of trichloroethylene tce with the treatment of steol cs 330 cgas 0 1 using a cgas artificial ground water cgas flush 75 of tce is flushed out of the column and residual tce concentration distributed in a range of 22 470 μg g though the column followed by treating the residual tce with cgas and tce degrading bacteria env 435 95 99 of the residual tce is degraded choi et al 2009 investigated the degradation of phenanthrene 100 mg kg in sand columns using burkholderia cepacia rph1 sphingobium yanoikuyae b1 and sphingomonas paucimobilis epa505 the oxygen level in the column declines from 20 to 5 within 5 days after injecting 3 pore volumes of cgas approximately 34 4 51 5 and 38 9 of initial phenanthrene is removed in 8 days in the columns inoculated with burkholderia cepacia rph1 sphingobium yanoikuyae b1 and sphingomonas paucimobilis epa505 respectively however 15 of initial phenanthrene is completely degraded according to the stoichiometric calculation based on the reduction of oxygen level in the column choi et al 2009 also injected 3 pore volumes of cgas into the column every 7 days over a period of 21 days and found that 75 3 of initial phenanthrene can be removed by burkholderia cepacia rph1 a bench scale column study compared the efficiency of saponin cgas and solution in the degradation of phenanthrene by burkholderia cepacia rph1 park et al 2009 after 21 days incubation columns purged with cgas obtaines a degradation of phenanthrene up to 30 while no degradation occurres in columns treated with surfactant solution at the same concentration in the cgas treated columns a gas phase concentration of 84 is detected at the bottom of the column and its value declines with the increase of column depth where 28 and 9 of gas phase concentration is obtained at the middle and top of the columns respectively due to the variation in gas phase concentration along the columns the relative residual of phenanthrene decreases from 80 to 40 at the bottom of the columns after the treatment period while a slight increase in relative residual of phenanthrene is detected at the top of columns 4 2 1 2 oxygen transfer of cgas some studies have investigated the oxygen transfer of cgas in batch and identified the factors that limit the oxygen transfer efficiency dai et al 2004 studied the oxygen transfer by the aid of cgas and analyzed the effect of stirring velocity surfactant type and concentration and temperature four surfactants sds hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium chloride htac nonylphenol ethoxylate np 10 and potassium mono lauryl phosphate mapk are used to generate cgas among all surfactants sds cgas has the best performance in enhancing oxygen mass transfer where 2 75 g l 1 sds cgas can enhance the value of the mass transfer of oxygen kla by a factor of 3 compared to surfactant free system with the increase of surfactant concentration kla changes according to different type of surfactant where kla increased for sds cgas decreases for mapk cgas increases for htac cgas up to the concentration of 0 363 mg l 1 and then decreases while the concentration of np 10 cgas does not affect the value of kla accelerating the stirring speed from 5000 to 8000 rpm kla increases from 2 5 to 4 5 s 1 due to the stronger bubble turbulence in the liquid and higher surface renewal velocity produced under higher stirring speed in the temperature range of 288 to 308 k kla increases dramatically with the raise of temperature due to greater molecular diffusion under higher temperature oxygen solubility decreases beyond the temperature of 308 k the effect of temperature is less significant accordingly li et al 2013 prepared micro nano bubbles with an averaged diameter of 50 μm and compared their oxygen transfer efficiency to macro bubbles in the batch studies the using of micro nano bubbles achieves a peak value of dissolved oxygen of 120 after 10 min which is higher than macro bubbles around 15 salinity also plays a role in affecting the oxygen transfer efficiency of micro nano bubbles where the salinity of 0 7 g l is found to be the optimal salt concentration for oxygen transfer similar results on the effect of bubble size are obtained in by li et al 2014 showing that the reduction in the bubble size promots the oxygen transfer process studies also have simulated the oxygen transfer process in the presence of cgas worden and bredwell 1998 developed a dynamic model for numerically solving the mass transfer of individual bubbles this model considers the mass transfer resistance in the surfactant shell bubble shrinkage changes in the gas pressure and composition inside the bubble and changes in the concentration profile in the liquid surrounding the bubble among these parameters bubble shrinkage is predicted to be significant on a time scale of seconds the average coefficient can describe experimental systems as the comparable time averaged values are relatively constant over a wide range of bubble radius 4 2 2 bacteria delivery besides delivering oxygen to the contaminated site cgas also has the potential to be the carrier of bacteria during inculcating of bacteria to contaminated sites some studies have investigated the efficiency of cgas as bacterial carrier choi et al 2009 jackson et al 1998 park et al 2009 rothmel et al 1998 rothmel et al 1998 studied the transport of env 435 in column with the aid of water surfactant solution and surfactant cgas three surfactants tergitol 15 s 12 steol cs 300 and biosoft d 40 were utilized the addition of surfactant solution 0 05 promotes the mobility of env 435 compared to water runs as 61 62 bacteria are recovered with surfactant solution addition while water flush recovers only 28 of bacteria comparing to the efficiency of cgas produced from the same surfactant 0 05 steol cs 330 cgas is the most efficient agent for delivering bacteria with bacterial recovery of 85 followed by tergitol 15 s 12 59 and biosoft d 40 29 cgas increasing steol cs 330 concentration from 0 05 to 0 1 does not further enhance the bacterial mobility accordingly jackson et al 1998 investigated the transport of psendomonas psendoalcaligenes with ddbs cgas in steel columns packed with a sandy clay loam bacterial suspension is introduced in a down flow mode followed by flushing the column with deionized water ddbs solution or ddbs cgas at a flow rate of 0 16 cm min after eluting 5 pore volumes of eluting agent into the column bacterial distribution within the column is analyzed using bacterial density bacterial density in water and surfactant solution runs shows similar pattern namely the greatest bacterial density is found at 5 cm from the inlet and its value decreases rapidly with the increase of traveling distance while bacterial distribution produced by cgas fluctuates along the column where a rapid decrease in the bacterial density is found at 5 to 13 cm from the inlet followed by an increase in bacterial density at 13 to 15 cm afterwards the bacterial density slightly decreases and reaches a plateau at 20 cm in terms of the bacterial density obtained in the effluent bacterial density obtained in the cgas treatment is around 1 5 orders of magnitude higher than those treated with the same surfactant solution after eluting with 2 5 pore volumes of surfactant solution choi et al 2009 also compared the transport of burkholderia cepacia rph1 in saponin cgas and solution although a similar pattern in the breakthrough curves of bacterial transport in cgas and solution are observed a greater ratio of total injected bacteria is recovered in the cgas aided transport cgas elutes out 42 of total injected bacteria while only 8 of total injected bacteria are recovered by using surfactant solution park et al 2009 also studied the transport of burkholderia cepacia rph1in column and found that the distribution of bacteria throughout the column with the aid of cgas is uniform 4 2 3 dissolved materials mattigod et al 2010 utilized cgas as a carrier of dissolved phosphate for in situ immobilization of radionuclide uranium u in sediments the sediments contain 300 mg kg u at a specific location less than 3 of the total u is leachable from the immobilized zone confirming feasibility of using cgas as the carrier for in situ immobilization of u mukhopadhyay et al 2017 also used soapnut cgas as the carrier of phosphate for flushing off arsenic in soil column as phosphate can promote the mobility of arsenic compared to the removal rate of arsenic by soapnut cgas up to 70 the soapnut carrying phosphate removes up to 95 arsenic indicating that cgas could delivery phosphate into the column 4 2 4 summary in studies used cgas as the carrier of oxygen bacteria and dissolved materials type and concentration of surfactant are the essential considered parameters for evaluating the efficiency of cgas the mechanism of cgas cgas enhanced soil flushing for organic pollutants and heavy metals is illustrated in fig 4 and the specific meachinsms are i cgas can penetrate low permeable soil and the phase separation of cgas release oxygen to the low oxygen area ii increasing the bioavailability hydrophobic pollutants iii cgas are able to create channels within the soil matrix thereby enhance the transport of bacteria 5 limitations and future prospect there is few more works need to be done in the future to enhance our knowledge of the potential application of cgas for soil remediation 1 studies have simulated the transport of cgas in one dimensional porous media and investigated parameters affected cgas transport however to understand the mechanism of cgas aided soil remediation future studies need to scale up and simulate the cgas transport in two or three dimensional porous media as well as field application 2 for the applications of cgas as flushing medium carrier of oxygen bacteria and dissolved materials in soil remediation the following aspects need to be done in the future i for the use of cgas as the flushing agent to physically remove organic pollutant and heavy metal these applications have comprehensively investigated the parameters that affect the efficiency of soil flushing thus a possible area of future research is adjusting the surfactant type surfactant concentration cgas generation method and ionic strength of solution for specific soil matrix and contaminant structure thereby promoting the flushing efficacy of cgas thus enhancing pollutant removal ii for cgas aided bacterial transport the hydrophobicity of bacteria is another parameter needed to be considered because bacteria with different hydrophobicity had different affinity to the gas water interfaces and solid water interfaces although both hydrophilic and hydrophobic bacteria show preferential sorption onto gas water interfaces over solid water interfaces wan and wilson 1994 hydrophobic bacteria have a stronger affinity to soil particles than hydrophilic bacteria chen and zhu 2004 huysman and verstraete 1993 and hydrophobic bacteria also have a greater adhesion tendency to gas liquid interfaces than hydrophilic bacteria ripley et al 2002 wan and wilson 1994 therefore the effects of bacterial hydrophobicity on the efficiency of cgas as bacterial carrier need to be studied in the future work iii similar to the transport of cgas the applications of cgas as flushing medium carrier of oxygen bacteria and dissolved materials in soil remediation also have been frequently conducted on small scale and batch system but have never been applied at large scale or in the field therefore there is an essential need for more studies to scale up the application of cgas for soil remediation in the future 3 considering the low ecological toxicity and biodegradable nature of biosurfactants abalos et al 2004 nitschke et al 2005 rebello et al 2014 the application of cgas generated from biosurfactants to remediate contaminated soils will be the focus in the future knowledge of all of these factors has the potential to advance and stimulate soil remediation 6 good conclusions surfactant cgas has emerged as a cost effective and environmental alternative of surfactant solution for soil remediation due to their unique properties in the present manuscript the fundamental properties of cgas and the flow of cgas in soil matrix have been reviewed and the applications of cgas for soil remediation of contaminated soil have been reviewed and discussed the properties of colloidal gas aphron can be influenced by various factors i e surfactant type and concentration electrolyte concentration generation parameters ph the presence of dissolved or suspended other molecules in the solution factors e g bubble size grain size of soil flow rate permeability porosity of soil and pressure drop determines cgas transport in porous media surfactant cgas have potential application in physically removing organic pollutants and heavy metal delivering microorganism and oxygen for bioremediation of contaminates soil and transporting d dissolved solutes for contaminants immobilization and removal the main mechanisms involved in the remediation processes include increasing the mobilization of pollutants the phase separation of cgas micellar solubilization the displacement and dispersion of pollutant the ability to carry oxygen microorganisms and dissolved materials for the industrial application of cgas in soil remediation more knowledge is required scaling up the flow and application of cgas should be scaled up to pilot scale matching surfactant cgas with contaminants under specific conditions selecting the suitable bacteria type and surfactant cgas for bioremediation and investigating the application of cgas produced from biosurfactant are the

1523,the nitrogen dynamics in a subsurface infiltration system sis are affected by many factors including temperature system design and feed water quality which are not easily quantified in this study a column experiment was conducted to simulate an sis the hydrus 1d software package was used to investigate and quantify the factors that affect nitrate transport in an sis three treatments were carried out based on different hydraulic conditions including continuous wetting cw wetting drying wd and a specific hydraulic loading rate sh the effects of hydraulic conditions and temperature on nitrate transformation were investigated the model was calibrated and validated using two year experimental data simulations of cumulative outflow volume and nitrate concentration fitted well with the observations among the three siss the denitrification rate was greatest under unsaturated conditions at high water temperature the denitrification rate constant had an exponential relationship with temperature an empirical formula describing this relationship was developed and validated in the sis the results showed that the sh column attained the greatest nitrate removal efficiency mainly due to its low hydraulic loading and long retention time overall the results showed that hydrus 1d adequately simulated nitrate transport through the soil column under different temperature and hydraulic conditions in an sis the fate of nitrate was directly controlled by the water temperature and hydraulic conditions keywords subsurface infiltration system denitrification hydrus 1d temperature nitrate 1 introduction artificial water recharge with effluents from secondary or tertiary water treatment can be carried out through spreading in infiltration basins which is known as a subsurface infiltration system sis an sis is capable of processing a wide range of pollutants in feed water with low maintenance and energy costs and is therefore widely used for removal of contaminants from reclaimed water in addition the performance of an sis is strongly influenced by various factors including hydraulic conditions temperature soil texture feed water quality and the soil microbial community bertelkamp et al 2014 jiang et al 2017 liang et al 2019 various n transformation processes occur in an infiltration system mostly through microbial activities that can be predicted from first order reaction kinetics but are complex due to their coupled nature and their control by soil environmental conditions such as soil water content and temperature in the infiltration system nitrification and denitrification are the major nitrogen transformation processes denitrification is highly variable in time and space due to the variability of its controlling factors such as the level of saturation of the soil column feed water quality and temperature chen et al 2015 hanson et al 2006 mekala and nambi 2016 denitrification is a microbial process in which nitrate is reduced ultimately producing molecular nitrogen n2 through a series of intermediate gaseous nitrogen oxide products zhang et al 2017 the rate of denitrification varies considerably across the soil infiltration system among the 15 important factors affecting denitrification temperature is the most important determinant of the biochemical reaction of no3 n considering the biochemical characteristics of nitrogen fischer and whalen 2005 stanford et al 1975 pang et al 2015 showed that low temperature limits denitrification in constructed wetlands the acclimatization capacity of denitrifiers varies with temperature under long term alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions zhang et al 2017 benoit et al 2015 observed a sigmoid function in n2o emissions due to coupled denitrification and nitrification benoit et al 2015 moreover denitrification depends on temperature which differs among sites and microbial populations focht and verstraete 1977 another factor the soil volumetric water content is a key factor that strongly affects n dynamics in soil it affects physical processes such as permeability and diffusivity borken and matzner 2009 mostafa and van geel 2012 as well as microbial activity skopp et al 1990 in the subsurface environment impacting not only water and oxygen o2 supply but also the diffusion of substrates enzymes microbial biomass growth and metabolism tiedje et al 1981 curtin et al 2012 reported an indirect influence of the soil volumetric water content on substrates and a direct impact on microbes a third factor moisture content has the capacity to shift the microbial community composition in both wet and dry soils previous studies have clearly demonstrated dynamic shifts among various biochemical n transformation pathways depending upon the soil moisture berlin et al 2015 mekala and nambi 2016 rubol et al 2012 schindlbacher et al 2004 understanding the factors that control the biogeochemical processes of the nitrogen cycle and the kinetics of nitrate transformations is essential and will provide useful insights to improve the performance of subsurface infiltration systems for the treatment of reclaimed water or wastewater however quantifying where when and to what extent denitrification occurs is difficult groffman et al 2006 hoang et al 2017 seitzinger et al 2006 direct measurement of denitrification at river basins or on large regional scales is not feasible numerical models can be used to simulate the impact of most soils and their hydraulic characteristics on effluent flow and solute transport in soils and to define unsaturated and saturated soil zones hoang et al 2017 in particular the hydrus model offers a wide range of applications migration of water and solutes can be simulated comprehensively with this model which requires minimal input data and produces reliable results hydrus has been widely applied to analyses of the movement of water and solutes in variably saturated media simunek et al 2008 a series of soil columns carried out at laboratory scale was compared with simulation results from the hydrus 1d model the main objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of hydraulic conditions and temperature on nitrate transport and its driving mechanisms and 2 to establish the quantitative relationship between the denitrification rate and temperature 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and observations the present study was conducted in soil columns of 120 cm height and 20 cm internal diameter fig 1 as shown in fig 1 a mariotte bottle was placed at the top of the column with a simple tap to prevent excess flow and ensure uniform water input a porous baffle was used at the bottom of the column to prevent the leaching of fine soil particles the column was packed with loam soil taken from an experimental site in beijing 116 32 e 39 26 n the sampled soil was air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve prior to packing the organic matter content soil particle size distribution and dry bulk density under field conditions of this sample are shown in table 1 the soil column was packed corresponding to the field profile in increments of 2 cm the interface between layers was mixed during packing to minimize heterogeneity the height of the packed soil was 100 cm the mean bulk density of the packed soil was 1 50 g cm 3 and its porosity was around 0 42 three soil columns were packed simultaneously in the same manner all three soil columns achieved the same final bulk density 1 50 g cm 3 the soil particle size distribution was analyzed using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern uk three sets of soil conditions were used first the continuous wetting condition was designated cw in column cw reclaimed water was continuously fed under 8 cm of hydraulic head second the condition of 2 d of wetting and 5 d of drying was designated wd in column wd reclaimed water was ponded to a depth of 8 cm for 2 days and then removed immediately subsequent to the removal of ponding water the soil column was left to dry for 5 days lastly reclaimed water was supplied to the third soil column designated sh at a specific hydraulic loading rate using a syringe pump in column sh reclaimed water was fed at an average rate of 0 41 cm d 1 the general characteristics of each column are shown in table 2 prior to the experimental treatment the soil columns were saturated and then flushed from the top after the flushing process reclaimed water was supplied from the top of the column the experiment was carried out over 2 years the experiments were performed in the laboratory at water temperatures ranging from 15 c to 31 c with seasonal variations in the room temperature the temperature treatments were approximately 17 20 21 26 28 and 30 c for the first 360 days of the experimental period followed by 300 days at approximately 24 21 18 and 20 c the simulation stages used for the calibration and validation periods were divided based on temperature the simulation stages carried out at different temperatures are shown in table 3 the experiment data from the first year 0 360 days s1 s6 were used for the calibration process and data from the second year 380 660 days s7 s10 were used for the validation process the feed water was collected quarterly from a wastewater treatment plant and stored in an opaque water tank at room temperature the average nitrate no3 n ammonium nh4 n and total nitrogen tn concentrations in the reclaimed water were 15 3 0 2 and 17 9 mg l 1 respectively during the experiment period the temporal variations of the no3 n and nh4 n concentrations in the reclaimed water are presented in fig 2 effluent samples were collected from the columns biweekly at various depths 20 40 60 and 90 cm with a vacuum pump and sampling bottle spatial and temporal series of samples were collected and analyzed for no3 n nh4 n and tn concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n were measured using the uv absorbance spectrophotometer method jh756 uv vis spectrophotometer china wei et al 2002 the concentration of tn was determined using the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method jh756 uv vis spectrophotometer china thermometer readings were recorded during the sampling period the amount of outflow from the soil columns was also measured during the initial stage of the experiment a breakthrough curve experiment with chloride ion was conducted along with a transport experiment for assessing dispersion processes a tracer test was conducted in column cw prior to the application of reclaimed water in the later experimental stage organic matter was observed in the three siss 2 2 simulation software the mathematical model for predicting water flow and transport of nitrogen species in the variably saturated subsurface infiltration system is described in this section vertical movement of water in soil under one dimensional saturated unsaturated conditions can be described by richard s model as expressed in eq 1 1 θ t z k h h z 1 where h is the pressure head l k h is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 t is the time t and z is the vertical coordinate l with positive values increasing downward to solve richard s equation the following constitutive relationships are required these relations were proposed by van genuchten 1980 and are stated in eqs 2 4 2 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 3 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 αh n m h 0 θ s h 0 4 k h k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 h 0 k s h 0 where θ is the water content l3 l 3 s e is the effective saturation θ s is the saturated water content l3 l 3 θ r is the residual water content l3 l 3 k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 and α n and m are fitting parameters the value of m is a function of that of n as m 1 1 n solute transport in soil under one dimensional variably saturated conditions can be described by the convection diffusion equation based on the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n in the reclaimed water the nh4 n concentration was less than 0 5 mg l 1 and thus nitrification could be ignored in the sis to simplify the model formulation in this section we consider only no3 n as the main nitrogen species and denitrification as the key reaction driving the nitrogen cycle in the sis one dimensional vertical mass transport and transformation of no3 n under transient flow and variably saturated soil conditions are described in eq 5 5 θ c n o 3 t ρ b s n o 3 t z θd c n o 3 z q c no 3 z f where no3 n is the concentration of nitrate ml 3 d d m τ q α l d is the

water and a solid medium soil 2 3 model setup calibration and validation soil water content and nitrate transport were computed for a soil profile of 100 cm depth the vertical one dimensional soil domain was discretized into 202 nodes the simulation domain setup was similar for the three columns a schematic diagram of the soil domain with the initial and boundary conditions is shown in fig 3 the initial condition for water content was defined as saturation with continuous wetting prior to experimental treatment the initial solute concentration was zero according to analysis of effluent samples simulations were performed separately for each temperature the initial concentration at time 0 was defined as 0 and the initial concentration of each subsequent simulation i e at various temperatures equaled the final concentration of the previous simulation the upper boundary conditions were a constant pressure head for column cw time variable boundary conditions with a constant head for column wd and time variable boundary conditions with a constant flux for column sh the bottom boundary was a seepage face for the cw wd and sh columns the van genuchten 1980 analytical model without hysteresis was used to determine the soil hydraulic properties the galerkin finite element method was employed to solve the water flow equation the initial soil hydraulic parameters were estimated from the bulk density 1 50 g cm 1 and the percentages of sand silt and clay table 1 using the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 as shown in table 4 due to the multiple components present in the reclaimed water and the preferential flow in soil columns the estimated soil hydraulic parameters do not fully represent the actual soil properties therefore the parameters were calibrated under different hydraulic conditions to improve simulation of the water flow mekala and nambi 2016 tan et al 2014 for the calibration period k s values were optimized at different stages for all columns the other parameters θ s α and n were optimized during the calibration period but had the same values for all columns from s1 to s6 additionally θ r and l remained at their initial estimated values during all stages the optimized hydraulic parameters were directly applied in the validation period nitrate was assumed to undergo denitrification during the infiltration process in the sis nitrate is easily leached from soil due to its negative charge thus the adsorption coefficient k d is negligible denitrification is affected by nitrate availability water temperature organic carbon availability and dissolved oxygen do beauchamp et al 1989 we assumed that nitrate availability do and organic carbon were not major factors affecting denitrification the denitrification rate was modified to reflect the effects of various test temperatures and hydraulic conditions on nitrate transport solute parameters were calibrated by comparing the measured and simulated nitrate concentrations in the soil water at different depths in the soil columns with the objective of minimizing the differences between the measured and simulated nitrate concentrations in this study the value of α l table 4 was obtained using the cxtfit2 1 model according to the breakthrough curve experiment results fig 4 as shown in table 4 the diffusion coefficient used for no3 n in water was 1 68 cm2 d 1 based on li et al 2011 the denitrification rates in the test soil were initially obtained from the literature or simulations and were then calibrated during the calibration procedure during the validation period s7 s10 calibrated soil hydraulic parameters were used in the model the denitrification rates at different temperatures were determined based on the calibrated relationship during the calibration period the relationships between the denitrification rate and temperature at various depths were deduced that is a separate formula was obtained for each soil layer based on these formulas the denitrification rate was calculated and was then applied for the validation period model performance was evaluated by comparing the measured and simulated values in the soil using various quantitative measures of uncertainty such as the relative error re normalized root mean square error nrmse and index of agreement d 7 re o i p i p i 100 8 nrmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 o 9 d 1 i n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 where n is the number of parameters p i is the predicted value o i is the observed value and o is the mean observed value generally for a perfect match between measured and simulated values nrmse 0 the closer d is to 1 the more accurate the model results 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the cumulative outflow volume was used to calibrate hydraulic parameters calibration was carried out until the observed data closely matched the model predictions in the cw wd and sh columns we compared the simulated cumulative outflow volume results with the measured values and then ran the model multiple times using modified soil hydraulic parameters until a close fit to the measured cumulative outflow volume was obtained the optimized soil hydraulic parameters used in the model for the calibration period are shown in table 5 table 6 shows comparisons of the measured and simulated cumulative outflow volumes for the calibration period in the sis the relative errors were 1 97 cw 0 24 wd and 1 20 sh all were less than 5 these results indicated that the input hydraulic parameters used were appropriate for simulating water movement in soil columns the calibrated nitrate transport and reaction parameters based on the experimental data collected under all hydraulic conditions are presented in table 7 as shown in fig 5 the simulation results are in good agreement with data measured during the calibration period the measured values of nitrate indicate that nitrate concentrations in the soil columns were driven by the denitrification process the nrmse and d values were calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of the calibrated parameters table 8 3 2 denitrification rate constant for the three siss the effluent nitrate concentration at various depths was lower than the influent nitrate concentration and nitrate removal efficiency increased with increasing temperature data not shown these results indicate that the denitrification rate increased as temperature increased from 17 c to 30 c during the calibration period additionally as noted above organic carbon dissolved oxygen and the c n ratio were not the dominant factors affecting denitrification in the siss therefore the relationship between the denitrification rate constant and temperature was determined separately for each of the three siss as shown in fig 6 the denitrification rate constant varied with the hydraulic conditions notably the denitrification rate constant in column sh was highest among the three systems mainly due to its lower hydraulic loading and corresponding longer hydraulic retention time moreover the denitrification rate constant varied with the soil depth mainly due to the organic matter contents of the three siss in column cw the denitrification rate constant was generally high in the upper layer 0 20 cm table 5 correspondingly the organic matter content was higher in the top layer the organic matter contents in the layers were 1 79 0 20 cm 1 12 20 40 cm 1 27 40 60 cm and 1 21 60 90 cm in column wd the denitrification rate constant at the bottom was higher than that at the top or middle of the column the organic matter contents in the layers were 1 11 1 10 1 17 and 1 32 respectively in column sh the denitrification rate constant was elevated at the bottom of the column where the organic matter content was correspondingly high the organic matter contents of the layers were 1 06 1 01 1 11 and 1 28 respectively an exponential correlation between the denitrification rate constant and temperature was found for all three hydraulic conditions for column cw μ w 1 0 0006e0 1472t r 2 0 9745 p 01 for column wd μ w 1 0 0019e0 1057t r 2 0 9667 p 01 and for column sh μ w 1 0 0027e0 1251t r 2 0 9492 p 01 the denitrification rate varied markedly with temperature in all three systems for column cw the average removal efficiencies of nitrate were 20 at 17 c and 94 at 30 c the denitrification rate constant at 17 c was 7 5 times higher than that at 30 c for column wd the removal efficiencies of nitrate were 51 at 17 c and 98 at 30 c the denitrification rate constant at 17 c was 4 1 times higher than that at 30 c for column sh the removal efficiencies of nitrate were 64 at 17 c and 99 at 30 c and the denitrification rate constant at 17 c was 4 3 times higher than that at 30 c the highest average denitrification rate constant was 0 099 d 1 in column sh at 30 c and the lowest denitrification rate constant was 0 007 d 1 in column cw at 17 c indicating that a lower hydraulic loading rate and higher temperature can increase the denitrification rate in siss 3 3 model validation the observed cumulative outflow volumes and nitrate concentrations were used to validate the model meanwhile the derived relationship between temperature and the denitrification rate constant was verified under different hydraulic conditions during the validation period comparisons between the measured and simulated nitrate concentrations at depths of 20 40 60 and 90 cm are presented in fig 7 for column cw the nitrate concentration calculated with the calibrated hydrus model provided a good match to the measured nitrate concentration the simulated nitrate concentrations aligned well with observations with d and nrmse values in the ranges of 0 2 0 8 and 0 09 0 4 respectively table 9 as shown in fig 7 a several marked concentration fluctuations at 396 458 and 548 d could be attributed mainly to changes in influent nitrate concentrations fig 2 as shown in fig 7a a b the nitrate concentration generally decreased with increasing soil depth from 20 to 90 cm for column cw the average nitrate concentration was 16 7 mg l 1 in the reclaimed water 14 4 mg l 1 at a depth of 20 cm and 13 3 mg l 1 at a depth of 90 cm these results show that nitrate removal occurred mainly in the upper soil layer as shown in fig 7 the model simulated the nitrate concentration for column wd moderately well the simulated nitrate concentrations were in good accordance with observations with d and nrmse values in the ranges of 0 57 0 92 and 0 05 0 33 respectively table 9 the variation in the nitrate concentration with time in column wd differed from that in column cw as the denitrification rate is related to the moisture content hanson et al 2006 hassan et al 2008 in contrast with the results in column cw a longer hydraulic retention time and a higher denitrification rate contributed to lower nitrate concentrations in column wd as shown in fig 6c for column sh the simulated nitrate concentrations matched the observations well with d and nrmse ranges of 0 67 0 80 and 0 11 0 18 respectively table 9 the results showed that the simulated nitrate concentrations at depths of 40 and 60 cm were slightly underestimated the hydraulic loading rate was relatively low in column sh meaning that the sampling process can affect dispersion which in turn impacts the actual residence time and denitrification process thus small differences were observed between the measured and simulated nitrate concentrations due to interference from the sampling process in this case the simulated and measured concentrations and variations in nitrate concentrations differed significantly from those in columns cw and wd the nitrate concentration was 17 0 mg l 1 in the reclaimed water 13 8 mg l 1 at the depth of 20 cm and 1 27 mg l 1 at the depth of 90 cm this difference was mainly attributed to the longer hydraulic retention time and the complete denitrification that occurred in column sh 3 4 effects of temperature and hydraulic conditions based on the hypotheses and results presented above denitrification was the major nitrate transformation process that occurred in this experiment nitrate removal through denitrification in the sis was investigated under different temperature and hydraulic conditions the removal efficiency of nitrate increased with the temperature 15 30 c under all hydraulic conditions based on the simulation results the denitrification rate constant can be predicted through curve fitting water temperature has long been recognized to affect the denitrification rate bremner and shaw 1958 beauchamp et al 1989 the effect of temperature on the reaction rate of biological processes is often expressed as 10 r t r 20 θ t 20 where r 20 is the reaction rate at 20 c r t is the reaction rate at a water temperature of t and θ is the temperature activity coefficient metcalf and eddy 1979 jørgensen 1994 for this sis the temperature activity coefficient was determined to be in the range of 1 08 1 16 these values are very similar to those obtained by other researchers bachand and horne 2000 found that the water temperature could affect the denitrification rate and nitrate removal rate linearly decreasing temperature from 26 c to 12 c produced a temperature activity coefficient in the range of 1 15 1 18 metcalf and eddy 1979 reported temperature activity coefficients between 1 0 and 1 14 for various biological processes kadlec and knight 1996 estimated the temperature activity coefficient for nitrate reduction as 1 09 based on a review of wetlands treatment methods and related technologies the denitrification rate does not continue to increase at high temperature previous studies have reported that denitrification is typically inhibited when temperatures reach 40 c due to inactivation of microorganisms differences among the denitrification rate constants of the siss in this study were due to differences in the hydraulic conditions the average hydraulic loading rate was 2 65 cm d 1 in column cw 0 74 cm d 1 in column wd and 0 41 cm d 1 in column sh the highest denitrification rate constant and nitrate removal efficiency occurred in column sh which was attributed to the lower hydraulic loading and longer retention time of that column in that case nitrate was retained and fully transformed within the soil column these results indicate that a lower hydraulic loading rate promotes denitrification in an unsaturated sis 3 5 nitrogen mass balance the nitrogen mass balance in the three systems throughout the experiment is presented in table 10 in the sis the main nitrate behaviors were biochemical activities especially denitrification remaining in the columns and leaching out of the columns based on the influent nitrate concentration and the hydraulic loading rate the total nitrate inputs were 7682 2791 and 953 mg for the cw wd and sh columns respectively the amounts of nitrate remaining in the soil were 24 9 23 5 and 21 3 mg in the cw wd and sh columns respectively the amounts of nitrate leached out of the columns were 3227 533 and 44 mg respectively nitrate loss was determined from the total nitrate input and the amounts of nitrate remaining in the soil and in the effluent note that the n leaching losses were driven by percolation in the sis nitrate removal was mainly attributable to denitrification showing that the hypothesis of the model was reasonable 4 summary and conclusion the hydrus 1d model was used to describe n transport and transformations in siss under different hydraulic conditions two year laboratory experiments were conducted under three hydraulic conditions at various temperatures the model was calibrated and validation showed good accordance between water movement and the nitrate concentration simulations in the three siss and the observed data the model simulations were in good agreement with the observed values the simulation results provide details about the soil water and n regime as well as n transport through the soil profile of the sis and can be used for estimations of n leaching the nitrate removal efficiency increased with increasing temperature this result can be attributed to the relationship between temperature and the denitrification rate constant a positive exponential correlation was found between the denitrification coefficient and the water temperature the denitrification coefficient was derived from the model simulations and laboratory experiments and ranged from 0 024 d 1 to 0 048 d 1 in cw from 0 0244 d 1 to 0 105 d 1 in wd and from 0 083 d 1 to 0 1394 d 1 in sh with temperatures between 17 c and 30 c temperature activity coefficients were in the range of 1 08 1 16 in the siss used in this study the highest removal efficiency occurred in column sh attributed to a long water retention time and saturated soil these results indicate that an unsaturated sis with either cyclic wetting and drying or a specific hydraulic loading rate enhanced the soil denitrification process due to alternation of oxidizing and reducing conditions expanding on previous research on denitrification in infiltration systems our results emphasizes the crucial roles of temperature and the hydraulic conditions in controlling the denitrification rate this information could be valuable for sis design

1523,the nitrogen dynamics in a subsurface infiltration system sis are affected by many factors including temperature system design and feed water quality which are not easily quantified in this study a column experiment was conducted to simulate an sis the hydrus 1d software package was used to investigate and quantify the factors that affect nitrate transport in an sis three treatments were carried out based on different hydraulic conditions including continuous wetting cw wetting drying wd and a specific hydraulic loading rate sh the effects of hydraulic conditions and temperature on nitrate transformation were investigated the model was calibrated and validated using two year experimental data simulations of cumulative outflow volume and nitrate concentration fitted well with the observations among the three siss the denitrification rate was greatest under unsaturated conditions at high water temperature the denitrification rate constant had an exponential relationship with temperature an empirical formula describing this relationship was developed and validated in the sis the results showed that the sh column attained the greatest nitrate removal efficiency mainly due to its low hydraulic loading and long retention time overall the results showed that hydrus 1d adequately simulated nitrate transport through the soil column under different temperature and hydraulic conditions in an sis the fate of nitrate was directly controlled by the water temperature and hydraulic conditions keywords subsurface infiltration system denitrification hydrus 1d temperature nitrate 1 introduction artificial water recharge with effluents from secondary or tertiary water treatment can be carried out through spreading in infiltration basins which is known as a subsurface infiltration system sis an sis is capable of processing a wide range of pollutants in feed water with low maintenance and energy costs and is therefore widely used for removal of contaminants from reclaimed water in addition the performance of an sis is strongly influenced by various factors including hydraulic conditions temperature soil texture feed water quality and the soil microbial community bertelkamp et al 2014 jiang et al 2017 liang et al 2019 various n transformation processes occur in an infiltration system mostly through microbial activities that can be predicted from first order reaction kinetics but are complex due to their coupled nature and their control by soil environmental conditions such as soil water content and temperature in the infiltration system nitrification and denitrification are the major nitrogen transformation processes denitrification is highly variable in time and space due to the variability of its controlling factors such as the level of saturation of the soil column feed water quality and temperature chen et al 2015 hanson et al 2006 mekala and nambi 2016 denitrification is a microbial process in which nitrate is reduced ultimately producing molecular nitrogen n2 through a series of intermediate gaseous nitrogen oxide products zhang et al 2017 the rate of denitrification varies considerably across the soil infiltration system among the 15 important factors affecting denitrification temperature is the most important determinant of the biochemical reaction of no3 n considering the biochemical characteristics of nitrogen fischer and whalen 2005 stanford et al 1975 pang et al 2015 showed that low temperature limits denitrification in constructed wetlands the acclimatization capacity of denitrifiers varies with temperature under long term alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions zhang et al 2017 benoit et al 2015 observed a sigmoid function in n2o emissions due to coupled denitrification and nitrification benoit et al 2015 moreover denitrification depends on temperature which differs among sites and microbial populations focht and verstraete 1977 another factor the soil volumetric water content is a key factor that strongly affects n dynamics in soil it affects physical processes such as permeability and diffusivity borken and matzner 2009 mostafa and van geel 2012 as well as microbial activity skopp et al 1990 in the subsurface environment impacting not only water and oxygen o2 supply but also the diffusion of substrates enzymes microbial biomass growth and metabolism tiedje et al 1981 curtin et al 2012 reported an indirect influence of the soil volumetric water content on substrates and a direct impact on microbes a third factor moisture content has the capacity to shift the microbial community composition in both wet and dry soils previous studies have clearly demonstrated dynamic shifts among various biochemical n transformation pathways depending upon the soil moisture berlin et al 2015 mekala and nambi 2016 rubol et al 2012 schindlbacher et al 2004 understanding the factors that control the biogeochemical processes of the nitrogen cycle and the kinetics of nitrate transformations is essential and will provide useful insights to improve the performance of subsurface infiltration systems for the treatment of reclaimed water or wastewater however quantifying where when and to what extent denitrification occurs is difficult groffman et al 2006 hoang et al 2017 seitzinger et al 2006 direct measurement of denitrification at river basins or on large regional scales is not feasible numerical models can be used to simulate the impact of most soils and their hydraulic characteristics on effluent flow and solute transport in soils and to define unsaturated and saturated soil zones hoang et al 2017 in particular the hydrus model offers a wide range of applications migration of water and solutes can be simulated comprehensively with this model which requires minimal input data and produces reliable results hydrus has been widely applied to analyses of the movement of water and solutes in variably saturated media simunek et al 2008 a series of soil columns carried out at laboratory scale was compared with simulation results from the hydrus 1d model the main objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of hydraulic conditions and temperature on nitrate transport and its driving mechanisms and 2 to establish the quantitative relationship between the denitrification rate and temperature 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus and observations the present study was conducted in soil columns of 120 cm height and 20 cm internal diameter fig 1 as shown in fig 1 a mariotte bottle

water and a solid medium soil 2 3 model setup calibration and validation soil water content and nitrate transport were computed for a soil profile of 100 cm depth the vertical one dimensional soil domain was discretized into 202 nodes the simulation domain setup was similar for the three columns a schematic diagram of the soil domain with the initial and boundary conditions is shown in fig 3 the initial condition for water content was defined as saturation with continuous wetting prior to experimental treatment the initial solute concentration was zero according to analysis of effluent samples simulations were performed separately for each temperature the initial concentration at time 0 was defined as 0 and the initial concentration of each subsequent simulation i e at various temperatures equaled the final concentration of the previous simulation the upper boundary conditions were a constant pressure head for column cw time variable boundary conditions with a constant head for column wd and time variable boundary conditions with a constant flux for column sh the bottom boundary was a seepage face for the cw wd and sh columns the van genuchten 1980 analytical model without hysteresis was used to determine the soil hydraulic properties the galerkin finite element method was employed to solve the water flow equation the initial soil hydraulic parameters were estimated from the bulk density 1 50 g cm 1 and the percentages of sand silt and clay table 1 using the rosetta pedotransfer functions schaap et al 2001 as shown in table 4 due to the multiple components present in the reclaimed water and the preferential flow in soil columns the estimated soil hydraulic parameters do not fully represent the actual soil properties therefore the parameters were calibrated under different hydraulic conditions to improve simulation of the water flow mekala and nambi 2016 tan et al 2014 for the calibration period k s values were optimized at different stages for all columns the other parameters θ s α and n were optimized during the calibration period but had the same values for all columns from s1 to s6 additionally θ r and l remained at their initial estimated values during all stages the optimized hydraulic parameters were directly applied in the validation period nitrate was assumed to undergo denitrification during the infiltration process in the sis nitrate is easily leached from soil due to its negative charge thus the adsorption coefficient k d is negligible denitrification is affected by nitrate availability water temperature organic carbon availability and dissolved oxygen do beauchamp et al 1989 we assumed that nitrate availability do and organic carbon were not major factors affecting denitrification the denitrification rate was modified to reflect the effects of various test temperatures and hydraulic conditions on nitrate transport solute parameters were calibrated by comparing the measured and simulated nitrate concentrations in the soil water at different depths in the soil columns with the objective of minimizing the differences between the measured and simulated nitrate concentrations in this study the value of α l table 4 was obtained using the cxtfit2 1 model according to the breakthrough curve experiment results fig 4 as shown in table 4 the diffusion coefficient used for no3 n in water was 1 68 cm2 d 1 based on li et al 2011 the denitrification rates in the test soil were initially obtained from the literature or simulations and were then calibrated during the calibration procedure during the validation period s7 s10 calibrated soil hydraulic parameters were used in the model the denitrification rates at different temperatures were determined based on the calibrated relationship during the calibration period the relationships between the denitrification rate and temperature at various depths were deduced that is a separate formula was obtained for each soil layer based on these formulas the denitrification rate was calculated and was then applied for the validation period model performance was evaluated by comparing the measured and simulated values in the soil using various quantitative measures of uncertainty such as the relative error re normalized root mean square error nrmse and index of agreement d 7 re o i p i p i 100 8 nrmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 o 9 d 1 i n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 where n is the number of parameters p i is the predicted value o i is the observed value and o is the mean observed value generally for a perfect match between measured and simulated values nrmse 0 the closer d is to 1 the more accurate the model results 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration the cumulative outflow volume was used to calibrate hydraulic parameters calibration was carried out until the observed data closely matched the model predictions in the cw wd and sh columns we compared the simulated cumulative outflow volume results with the measured values and then ran the model multiple times using modified soil hydraulic parameters until a close fit to the measured cumulative outflow volume was obtained the optimized soil hydraulic parameters used in the model for the calibration period are shown in table 5 table 6 shows comparisons of the measured and simulated cumulative outflow volumes for the calibration period in the sis the relative errors were 1 97 cw 0 24 wd and 1 20 sh all were less than 5 these results indicated that the input hydraulic parameters used were appropriate for simulating water movement in soil columns the calibrated nitrate transport and reaction parameters based on the experimental data collected under all hydraulic conditions are presented in table 7 as shown in fig 5 the simulation results are in good agreement with data measured during the calibration period the measured values of nitrate indicate that nitrate concentrations in the soil columns were driven by the denitrification process the nrmse and d values were calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of the calibrated parameters table 8 3 2 denitrification rate constant for the three siss the effluent nitrate concentration at various depths was lower than the influent nitrate concentration and nitrate removal efficiency increased with increasing temperature data not shown these results indicate that the denitrification rate increased as temperature increased from 17 c to 30 c during the calibration period additionally as noted above organic carbon dissolved oxygen and the c n ratio were not the dominant factors affecting denitrification in the siss therefore the relationship between the denitrification rate constant and temperature was determined separately for each of the three siss as shown in fig 6 the denitrification rate constant varied with the hydraulic conditions notably the denitrification rate constant in column sh was highest among the three systems mainly due to its lower hydraulic loading and corresponding longer hydraulic retention time moreover the denitrification rate constant varied with the soil depth mainly due to the organic matter contents of the three siss in column cw the denitrification rate constant was generally high in the upper layer 0 20 cm table 5 correspondingly the organic matter content was higher in the top layer the organic matter contents in the layers were 1 79 0 20 cm 1 12 20 40 cm 1 27 40 60 cm and 1 21 60 90 cm in column wd the denitrification rate constant at the bottom was higher than that at the top or middle of the column the organic matter contents in the layers were 1 11 1 10 1 17 and 1 32 respectively in column sh the denitrification rate constant was elevated at the bottom of the column where the organic matter content was correspondingly high the organic matter contents of the layers were 1 06 1 01 1 11 and 1 28 respectively an exponential correlation between the denitrification rate constant and temperature was found for all three hydraulic conditions for column cw μ w 1 0 0006e0 1472t r 2 0 9745 p 01 for column wd μ w 1 0 0019e0 1057t r 2 0 9667 p 01 and for column sh μ w 1 0 0027e0 1251t r 2 0 9492 p 01 the denitrification rate varied markedly with temperature in all three systems for column cw the average removal efficiencies of nitrate were 20 at 17 c and 94 at 30 c the denitrification rate constant at 17 c was 7 5 times higher than that at 30 c for column wd the removal efficiencies of nitrate were 51 at 17 c and 98 at 30 c the denitrification rate constant at 17 c was 4 1 times higher than that at 30 c for column sh the removal efficiencies of nitrate were 64 at 17 c and 99 at 30 c and the denitrification rate constant at 17 c was 4 3 times higher than that at 30 c the highest average denitrification rate constant was 0 099 d 1 in column sh at 30 c and the lowest denitrification rate constant was 0 007 d 1 in column cw at 17 c indicating that a lower hydraulic loading rate and higher temperature can increase the denitrification rate in siss 3 3 model validation the observed cumulative outflow volumes and nitrate concentrations were used to validate the model meanwhile the derived relationship between temperature and the denitrification rate constant was verified under different hydraulic conditions during the validation period comparisons between the measured and simulated nitrate concentrations at depths of 20 40 60 and 90 cm are presented in fig 7 for column cw the nitrate concentration calculated with the calibrated hydrus model provided a good match to the measured nitrate concentration the simulated nitrate concentrations aligned well with observations with d and nrmse values in the ranges of 0 2 0 8 and 0 09 0 4 respectively table 9 as shown in fig 7 a several marked concentration fluctuations at 396 458 and 548 d could be attributed mainly to changes in influent nitrate concentrations fig 2 as shown in fig 7a a b the nitrate concentration generally decreased with increasing soil depth from 20 to 90 cm for column cw the average nitrate concentration was 16 7 mg l 1 in the reclaimed water 14 4 mg l 1 at a depth of 20 cm and 13 3 mg l 1 at a depth of 90 cm these results show that nitrate removal occurred mainly in the upper soil layer as shown in fig 7 the model simulated the nitrate concentration for column wd moderately well the simulated nitrate concentrations were in good accordance with observations with d and nrmse values in the ranges of 0 57 0 92 and 0 05 0 33 respectively table 9 the variation in the nitrate concentration with time in column wd differed from that in column cw as the denitrification rate is related to the moisture content hanson et al 2006 hassan et al 2008 in contrast with the results in column cw a longer hydraulic retention time and a higher denitrification rate contributed to lower nitrate concentrations in column wd as shown in fig 6c for column sh the simulated nitrate concentrations matched the observations well with d and nrmse ranges of 0 67 0 80 and 0 11 0 18 respectively table 9 the results showed that the simulated nitrate concentrations at depths of 40 and 60 cm were slightly underestimated the hydraulic loading rate was relatively low in column sh meaning that the sampling process can affect dispersion which in turn impacts the actual residence time and denitrification process thus small differences were observed between the measured and simulated nitrate concentrations due to interference from the sampling process in this case the simulated and measured concentrations and variations in nitrate concentrations differed significantly from those in columns cw and wd the nitrate concentration was 17 0 mg l 1 in the reclaimed water 13 8 mg l 1 at the depth of 20 cm and 1 27 mg l 1 at the depth of 90 cm this difference was mainly attributed to the longer hydraulic retention time and the complete denitrification that occurred in column sh 3 4 effects of temperature and hydraulic conditions based on the hypotheses and results presented above denitrification was the major nitrate transformation process that occurred in this experiment nitrate removal through denitrification in the sis was investigated under different temperature and hydraulic conditions the removal efficiency of nitrate increased with the temperature 15 30 c under all hydraulic conditions based on the simulation results the denitrification rate constant can be predicted through curve fitting water temperature has long been recognized to affect the denitrification rate bremner and shaw 1958 beauchamp et al 1989 the effect of temperature on the reaction rate of biological processes is often expressed as 10 r t r 20 θ t 20 where r 20 is the reaction rate at 20 c r t is the reaction rate at a water temperature of t and θ is the temperature activity coefficient metcalf and eddy 1979 jørgensen 1994 for this sis the temperature activity coefficient was determined to be in the range of 1 08 1 16 these values are very similar to those obtained by other researchers bachand and horne 2000 found that the water temperature could affect the denitrification rate and nitrate removal rate linearly decreasing temperature from 26 c to 12 c produced a temperature activity coefficient in the range of 1 15 1 18 metcalf and eddy 1979 reported temperature activity coefficients between 1 0 and 1 14 for various biological processes kadlec and knight 1996 estimated the temperature activity coefficient for nitrate reduction as 1 09 based on a review of wetlands treatment methods and related technologies the denitrification rate does not continue to increase at high temperature previous studies have reported that denitrification is typically inhibited when temperatures reach 40 c due to inactivation of microorganisms differences among the denitrification rate constants of the siss in this study were due to differences in the hydraulic conditions the average hydraulic loading rate was 2 65 cm d 1 in column cw 0 74 cm d 1 in column wd and 0 41 cm d 1 in column sh the highest denitrification rate constant and nitrate removal efficiency occurred in column sh which was attributed to the lower hydraulic loading and longer retention time of that column in that case nitrate was retained and fully transformed within the soil column these results indicate that a lower hydraulic loading rate promotes denitrification in an unsaturated sis 3 5 nitrogen mass balance the nitrogen mass balance in the three systems throughout the experiment is presented in table 10 in the sis the main nitrate behaviors were biochemical activities especially denitrification remaining in the columns and leaching out of the columns based on the influent nitrate concentration and the hydraulic loading rate the total nitrate inputs were 7682 2791 and 953 mg for the cw wd and sh columns respectively the amounts of nitrate remaining in the soil were 24 9 23 5 and 21 3 mg in the cw wd and sh columns respectively the amounts of nitrate leached out of the columns were 3227 533 and 44 mg respectively nitrate loss was determined from the total nitrate input and the amounts of nitrate remaining in the soil and in the effluent note that the n leaching losses were driven by percolation in the sis nitrate removal was mainly attributable to denitrification showing that the hypothesis of the model was reasonable 4 summary and conclusion the hydrus 1d model was used to describe n transport and transformations in siss under different hydraulic conditions two year laboratory experiments were conducted under three hydraulic conditions at various temperatures the model was calibrated and validation showed good accordance between water movement and the nitrate concentration simulations in the three siss and the observed data the model simulations were in good agreement with the observed values the simulation results provide details about the soil water and n regime as well as n transport through the soil profile of the sis and can be used for estimations of n leaching the nitrate removal efficiency increased with increasing temperature this result can be attributed to the relationship between temperature and the denitrification rate constant a positive exponential correlation was found between the denitrification coefficient and the water temperature the denitrification coefficient was derived from the model simulations and laboratory experiments and ranged from 0 024 d 1 to 0 048 d 1 in cw from 0 0244 d 1 to 0 105 d 1 in wd and from 0 083 d 1 to 0 1394 d 1 in sh with temperatures between 17 c and 30 c temperature activity coefficients were in the range of 1 08 1 16 in the siss used in this study the highest removal efficiency occurred in column sh attributed to a long water retention time and saturated soil these results indicate that an unsaturated sis with either cyclic wetting and drying or a specific hydraulic loading rate enhanced the soil denitrification process due to alternation of oxidizing and reducing conditions expanding on previous research on denitrification in infiltration systems our results emphasizes the crucial roles of temperature and the hydraulic conditions in controlling the denitrification rate this information could be valuable for sis design

1524,sand column experiments were performed under saturated conditions to investigate impact of humic acid ha on attachment of nc60 nanoparticles nps in nacl and cacl2 at ionic strengths iss from 1 mm to 100 mm and subsequent detachment via reducing solution is the attachment increased with increasing is due to reduced repulsive derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo interaction energy and accordingly increased retention in primary energy wells more attachments occurred in cacl2 compared to nacl because ca2 exhibited greater charge screen ability and served as a bridging agent between the nps and sand surfaces the presence of ha significantly reduced nc60 nps attachment on sand surfaces especially on nanoscale physical heterogeneities in 10 mm nacl and 1 mm cacl2 because of enhanced electrostatic and steric repulsions interestingly although the ha did not cause reduction of attachment in 100 mm nacl and 10 mm cacl2 compared to the case in absence of ha the ha caused weak attachment of nc60 on sand surfaces and then much more significant detachment by decreasing is the ha did not alter both attachment and detachment in 100 mm cacl2 because the ca2 at the high concentration caused formation of very stable complex of ha and nps and strong interaction of the complex with the sand surfaces via cation bridge our study highlighted that the ha can not only enhance the transport of nps by inhibiting attachment as revealed in the literature but also by the continuous capture and release of the nps from surfaces in subsurface environments keywords nc60 nanoparticles colloid humic acid porous media transport 1 introduction buckminsterfullerene c60 a hydrophobic molecule consists of 60 carbon atoms with a spherical cage like structure kroto et al 1985 li et al 2008 the nc60 bears unique physicochemical characteristics such as antioxidation and high electron affinity chen and elimelech 2006 qu et al 2012 therefore the c60 has gained a variety of applications including personal care products pharmaceuticals and new high strength materials qu et al 2012 zhang et al 2014a 2014b haftka et al 2015 mcnew and leboeuf 2016 the c60 can be synthesized in factories or generated in highly energetic nature events e g lightning discharges klaine et al 2008 zhang et al 2012a 2012b haftka et al 2015 sanchís et al 2018 the production and use of c60 has caused its distribution in subsurface environments sanchís et al 2012 sanchís et al 2015 li et al 2015 although the c60 has extremely low solubility in water surface of the c60 can obtain negative charges in aqueous systems and stable nanoscale aggregates nc60 will be formed li et al 2008 the resulting nc60 nanoparticles nps persist in the environment because they are resistant to biodegradation kümmerer et al 2011 however the nc60 nps were reported to be toxic to microbes chae et al 2010 animals oberdorster 2004 and human cells dhawan et al 2006 in addition the nc60 nps can absorb a variety of inorganic and organic pollutants and carry them to transport as a vehicle i e the so called colloid facilitated transport of pollutants li et al 2002 yang et al 2006 lin et al 2010 bai et al 2013 therefore it is critical to understanding the mechanisms governing the nc60 nps transport in the subsurface environments such as soil porous media for accurately evaluating their environmental risks various studies chen and elimelech 2006 2007 2008 li et al 2008 tong et al 2010 wang et al 2010 2012 2016a chen et al 2012 have examined the nc60 nps deposition on collector surfaces and their transport in porous media these studies consistently showed that deposition of nc60 nps can be qualitatively explained by the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory for example increasing solution ionic strength is reduces repulsive energy barrier hence the nc60 nps readily transport over the energy barrier at a higher is and attach at primary energy minima wang et al 2016a the presence of nanoscale physical asperities npas and charge heterogeneities can locally reduce the interaction energy barrier and increase nc60 nps deposition in primary minima li et al 2008 2017 tong et al 2010 shen et al 2018 2019a 2019b however the nc60 nps deposited atop npas at primary minima can spontaneously detach even by brownian diffusion because the npas can significantly reduce primary minimum depth and the adhesion acting on the nps wang et al 2016b the secondary minima were shallow for the nc60 nps which may not cause the immobilization at the energy wells li et al 2008 the detachment of nc60 nps in porous media has also been examined in the literature cheng et al 2005 wang et al 2008 hedayati et al 2016 for example hedayati et al 2016 examined transport of nc60 nps in silica sand packed columns they found that the nc60 nps were detached by injection of deionized di water and the amount of release of nc60 nps was influenced by the is at which the nc60 nps were attached wang et al 2008 showed that to fulfill substantial detachment of nc60 nps retained in 100 to 140 mesh ottawa sand required both decrease of solution is and significant increase of ph this indicated that the nc60 nps were initially attached at deep primary minima in addition to perturbation of solution chemistry cheng et al 2005 illustrated that a sudden increase of flow rate could also cause the detachment of nc60 nps as a major component of natural organic matter humic acid ha is ubiquitous in soil and sediment environments li et al 2018 consequently the ha and nc60 nps likely encounter in the porous soil and sediments chae et al 2012 it has been widely reported that the presence of ha reduced aggregation of nc60 nps due to increase of electrostatic and steric repulsions between the nps chen and elimelech 2007 hyung et al 2007 duncan et al 2008 xie et al 2008 chae et al 2012 yang et al 2013 jung et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a 2014b li et al 2018 due to a similar reason the ha enhanced the transport of nc60 nps by reducing attachment on collector surfaces chen and elimelech 2008 qu et al 2012 wang et al 2012 mcnew and leboeuf 2016 however the impact of ha on nc60 nps aggregation and attachment was regulated by is and cation valence franchi and o melia 2003 chen and elimelech 2008 chae et al 2012 qu et al 2012 mcnew and leboeuf 2016 while the aforementioned studies significantly improved knowledge of the mechanisms controlling the nc60 nps attachment in porous media very little attention has been paid to examining the influence of ha on detachment of nc60 nps i e the opposite mechanism of attachment the coupled influence of ha and solution chemistry makes the nc60 nps detachment even more complex and requires investigation this study through carrying out saturated sand column experiments systematically examined the impact of ha on nc60 nps attachment in different electrolyte solutions nacl and cacl2 with different iss and subsequent detachment by is reduction we found that while the ha reduced deposition of nc60 nps it also caused a fraction of nc60 nps weakly attached on sand surfaces and then released upon solution is reduction the detachment of nc60 nps by the ha was more significant if the nps were initially deposited in nacl at higher iss but was completely inhibited in cacl2 at high iss the findings in this study have important implication to water and wastewater filtration using membranes and developing mathematical models for predicting mobility of nps in subsurface environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 quartz sand quartz sand with sizes between 210 μm and 297 μm was used as collectors to pack the columns which was obtained from sigma aldrich st louis missouri united states the approach of zhuang et al 2005 was used to clean the sand grains surface morphologies of the cleaned sand were measured via a hitachi s4300 scanning electron microscope sem hitachi corp tokyo japan the fine fraction of the sand was isolated via sonication and used to determine zeta potentials in nacl and cacl2 at different solution iss via a zetaplus brookhaven instruments corp holtesville new york zhou et al 2011 wang et al 2016a 2 2 fullerene nps suspension fullerene c60 powder 99 9 purity produced by sigma aldrich st louis missouri united states was used the method used to prepare the nc60 nps stock suspension can be found in our previous study wang et al 2016a briefly the total organic carbon toc of the prepared nc60 nps stock suspension was determined to be 9 mg l 1 using a toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan the nc60 nps influent suspensions for column experiments were prepared by adding the nc60 stock suspension into nacl or cacl2 electrolyte solution at different iss the resulting iss of the influent suspensions were 1 mm 10 mm or 100 mm with the concentration of nc60 to be 1 8 mg l 1 by diluting the stock solution the dynamic light scattering zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd southborough massachusetts united states was used to measure the sizes and zeta potentials of the nc60 nps in the influent suspensions at different chemical conditions the zeta potentials of the nc60 nps were determined using a zetaplus analyzer brookhaven instruments corp holtesville new york united states 2 3 humic acid suspension similar to chen and elimelech 2007 the humic acid suspension was obtained by adding 50 mg of humic acid powder sigma aldrich st louis missouri united states in 100 ml di water the suspension was stirred for 24 h under dark conditions and passed through a 0 22 μm filter membrane using the toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan toc content of the humic acid suspension was determined to be 210 mg l 1 the ha was added into some nc60 nps suspensions to result in a concentration of 5 mg l 1 of the ha for zeta potential measurements and column transport experiments 2 4 column transport experiments acrylic columns 3 cm inner diameter and 10 cm long were adopted to implement the column experiments the method of wang et al 2016a was used to pack the columns briefly a wet packing method was used to ensure saturation of the column systems the sand was slowly added into the columns filled with water with gentle vibrations to avoid layering and air entrapment the porosities of the columns were calculated to be 0 36 by using the mass of the sand and assuming sand density of 2 65 g cm 3 a darcy velocity of 4 32 m d 1 was employed for all column transport experiments to standardize the physicochemical conditions of the column systems background nacl or cacl2 electrolyte solution at ph 7 adjusted using 0 1 mm nahco3 was first injected into the columns upward for over 20 pore volumes pvs then the column was flushed with 10 pvs of nc60 nps influent suspension with or without ha 1 8 mg l 1 of nc60 and 5 mg l 1 of ha at ph 7 denoted as phase 1 5 pvs of np free electrolyte solution phase 2 and finally di water phase 3 this three step procedure has been widely employed in previous studies shen et al 2012 wang et al 2016b li et al 2017 to examine colloid attachment and detachment in porous media effluent suspensions of the column experiments were collected by an automatic collector bsz 100 huxi instrument corp shanghai china and the concentration of nc60 nps was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometry du series 800 beckman instruments inc fullerton california united states at a wavelength of 550 nm the effluents at high iss were sonicated to ensure the monodispersion before the measurements 2 5 calculation of dlvo interaction energies to reveal the mechanisms controlling nc60 nps attachment and detachment it is necessary to determine the dlvo interaction energies between the nps and the sand surfaces ryam and elimelech 1996 ninham 1999 hoek and agarwal 2006 wang et al 2008 the surface element integration sei technique developed by bhattacharjee and elimelech 1997 was employed for performance of the interaction energy calculations note that the derjaguin da approach has been traditionally used to calculate the interaction energies this approach however contains several assumptions in the calculations as have been summarized in shen et al 2019a specifically the da approach did not consider the curvature effect of particle surface and assumed that the interaction energy for a particle is only due to a small region of the particle surface that is closet to the interacting surface the sei technique has overcome the limitations existing in the da approach and can give accurate calculations of interaction energy for colloids even at nanoscale lin and wiesner 2012 the total dlvo energy was taken as a sum of van der waals vdw attractive interaction energy electrical double layer dl interaction energy and short range repulsion the short range repulsion was included by determining born br repulsion as adopted in previous studies hoek and agarwal 2006 bradford and torkzaban 2013 seetha et al 2015 shen et al 2018 the nc60 nps were assumed to be spherical and the sand surface was taken as plate the use of sei technique to calculate energies for sphere plate interaction can be referred to previous studies wang et al 2016a 2016b li et al 2017 shen et al 2018 briefly surfaces of both a np and sand were discretized into small area elements the vdw dl and br differential interaction energies between each pair of area elements on the np and sand surfaces were determined using the expressions developed by hamaker 1937 hogg et al 1966 and oliveira 1997 respectively summing of the vdw dl and br differential interaction energies for all pairs of area elements resulted in the total interaction energy for a nc60 np considerable wedge like depressions existed in the sand surfaces as will be shown later in the paper to reveal the role of the wedge like depressions in nc60 nps attachment the depressions were represented by two intersecting half planes and the interaction force between a nc60 np and the model concave surface was determined fig 1 li et al 2017 has shown detailed procedure for calculating interaction force for the aforementioned interaction configuration briefly the cartesian coordinate system was used for the interaction configuration in fig 1 the z axis passed through the line where the two half planar surfaces intersect and the two intersecting half planar surfaces were bisected by the y z plane the total forces along the x f x and y direction f y were equal to f 1 cos α 2 f 2 cos α 2 and f 1 sin α 2 f 2 sin α 2 respectively where α is the angle between the two half planes and f 1 and f 2 are the interaction forces between the nc60 np and the left and right half planar surface respectively the values of f 1 or f 2 were determined using the sei technique the calculation procedure was the same as that for determining interaction energy shown in the previous section however differential vdw dl and bl forces between area elements were determined li et al 2017 instead of calculating differential interaction energies as will be showing in the following the nc60 nps were aggregated at high iss however we still used the sizes of the primary particles of the nc60 aggregates for interaction energy calculations at the high iss this is because the colloidal interaction energy for aggregated particles was similar to those of the primary particles but was much smaller than that for an equivalent sphere e g a sphere with the same volume as that of the aggregate lin and wiesner 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of nc60 nps and collectors the nc60 nps used had the same properties as those used in our previous study wang et al 2016a which were spherical in shape with slight angular features accord to transmission electron microscope tem examinations table 1 shows measured zeta potentials of nc60 nps and collector grains and sizes of the nps in electrolyte solutions at different iss with or without ha the zeta potentials were negative for both the nps and sand grains under all chemical conditions except at 100 mm cacl2 the existence of positive zeta potentials in cacl2 at the high is was due to sorption of ca2 on the np and sand surfaces causing charge reversal kuznar and elimelech 2004 the presence of ha caused more negative zeta potentials of the nps and sand grains which is in agreement with the results in previous studies dhawan et al 2006 chen and elimelech 2007 zhang et al 2014a 2014b lin et al 2017 this is because adsorption of the ha onto the nc60 nps and sand surfaces increased the negative charges and accordingly resulted in more negative zeta potentials zhang et al 2009 qu et al 2012 wang et al 2012 previous studies xie et al 2008 qu et al 2012 showed that the ha increased stability of nc60 nps suspensions and reduced the sizes of nc60 nps aggregates by increasing electrostatic and steric repulsions indeed the results in table 1 showed that the sizes of the nc60 nps were similar at all iss in nacl if the ha was present due to inhibition of aggregation while the size of the nc60 nps increased with increasing is in nacl without ha however the size of the nc60 nps still increased with increasing is in cacl2 even if the ha was present this is likely due to the formation of the complexes of ha and nps via cation bridge chen and elimelech 2007 as will be shown later by sem examinations in the paper reticular complexes on the sand surfaces were formed in cacl2 3 2 attachment of nc60 nps fig 2 presents breakthrough curves btcs for the nc60 nps by plotting the value of c c 0 as a function of pv where c and c 0 are effluent and influent np concentrations respectively in phase 1 the nc60 nps were attached on sand surfaces in nacl or cacl2 at different iss higher is caused more attachments of nc60 nps as have been observed in previous studies chen and elimelech 2006 2007 2008 li et al 2008 chae et al 2012 qu et al 2012 bai et al 2013 mcnew and leboeuf 2015 2016 the results confirmed that the nc60 can acquire negative surface charge although the mechanism is still unclear to date and the attachment of the nc60 was controlled by the electrostatic interaction in the electrolytes chen and elimelech 2006 the increase of attachment with is can be qualitatively explained by the energy calculations in fig 3 and table 2 specifically increasing is reduces repulsive energy barrier and thereby increases attachment in primary energy wells at a given is the nc60 nps attachment was more in cacl2 than in nacl this is because the ca2 was more effective for screening the dl repulsion and can link the nps to the sand surfaces i e the cation bridge effect schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 it should be noted that the attachment of nc60 nps in the sand cannot be quantitatively explained by the interaction energy calculations for instance the calculations showed that the interaction energy barriers were much greater than the average kinetic energy of a colloid 1 5 kt k is boltzmann constant t is absolute temperature in nacl at is 10 mm and in cacl2 at 1 mm these large repulsive energy barriers essentially inhibit the approach of nc60 nps to primary wells of interaction energy profiles thus attach at primary energy minima cannot occur under these chemical conditions the prediction by the calculations however was in contrast to the aforementioned experimental observations the sem images fig 4 showed that the sand surfaces were very rough which contained considerable npas the npas can increase primary minimum attachment by locally reducing repulsive energy barrier under unfavorable conditions shen et al 2012a 2012b zou et al 2015 rasmuson et al 2017 in addition the sand surfaces may bear charges different from those of bulk sand surfaces shen et al 2015 li et al 2017 the primary minimum attachment can be further enhanced if the npas bear charges different from those of bulk collector surfaces i e physical and chemical heterogeneities are coupled the reason is that the existence of chemical heterogeneity can increase the depth of primary minimum which could compensate for the reduction effect of npas on primary minimum depth bradford and torkzaban 2013 shen et al 2018 2019a colloids cannot be immobilized if the primary energy wells are very shallow due to existence of brownian diffusion in addition to the npas fig 4 shows that the sand surfaces also contained large wedge like depressions to interpret the role of the wedge like depression in nc60 nps attachment and detachment the interaction forces between a nc60 np and the depression were calculated using the method in materials and methods fig 5 shows the maps of f x and f y for a nc60 np interacting with the depression on the x y plane in 1 10 and 100 mm nacl the force maps were generated by changing the x y positions of the np in a rasterized manner in the dark areas the forces were ignored because they could not be determined due to physical overlap between the nc60 np and the surface the scale bar to the top of each plot indicates the forces in units of 10 12 n fig 5 shows that when the np is close to the tip of the concave surface the repulsive energy barrier could be eliminated even at low iss e g 1 mm this is because the repulsion between the np and a half surface was eliminated by the repulsion from the other half surface in the opposite direction therefore the nc60 nps were favored to be attached in primary minima at the locations of concave surfaces where the repulsive energy barrier was eliminated in addition to surface physical and heterogeneities aggregation of nc60 nps see fig 4 may also increase retention of the nc60 nps taghavy et al 2015 babakhani 2019 while the aggregation of colloids does not significantly alter the interaction energies lin and wiesner 2012 it could increase retention via enhanced sedimentation and straining porubcan and xu 2011 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 notably the calculated secondary minima depths were much smaller than the average kinetic energy of a colloid hence the secondary minima should not play a significant role in nc60 nps attachment similarly li et al 2008 showed that the secondary minimum depths were extremely small for the nc60 nps which had minor influence on the deposition of nc60 nps in sand porous media fig 2 shows that ha reduced the deposition of nc60 nps attachment in the sand as shown in table 1 the zeta potentials of both nc60 nps and sand surface were increased when the ha was present accordingly the dl repulsion and interaction energy barrier were increased by the presence of ha see fig 3 and table 2 causing reduction of the attachment in primary minima in addition the presence of ha increases steric repulsion chen and elimelech 2008 zhang et al 2013 yang et al 2019 which can reduce or even eliminate primary energy well table 2 and thus decrease attachment in primary minima wang et al 2016b it should be mentioned that the reduced attachment by the ha was only significant in 10 mm nacl and 1 mm cacl2 there was only a minor reduction of attachment of the nps by the ha in 1 mm nacl no influence of attachment by the ha existed in nacl at 100 mm and in cacl2 at 10 mm and 100 mm i e complete attachment both in the presence and absence of ha two reasons may explain above minor influence of ha on nc60 nps attachment at 1 mm nacl first the ha had low sorption on surfaces of the nc60 nps and sand in nacl at this low is qu et al 2012 second the nc60 nps were attached in sites where deep primary minima existed at this is the nps could still attach at these energy wells even if these primary minima were decreased to a certain degree due to the electrostatic and steric repulsion by the ha one possible attachment site is large charge heterogeneity which can significantly reduce or even eliminate the large energy barrier that exist at low solution iss and cause very deep primary energy wells shen et al 2013 in addition fig 5 shows that the interaction energy barrier and primary minimum depth can also be decreased and increased at concave surfaces respectively li et al 2017 conducted column experiments and sem examinations showing that colloids were preferentially attached in primary minima at large charge heterogeneities and or concave surfaces at low solution iss the primary minimum was very shallow or even absent in the interaction energy profiles atop the npas without charge heterogeneities copresent at low iss shen et al 2012a 2019a bradford and torkzaban 2013 therefore the nc60 nps attachment on npas may not be significant at 1 mm nacl in 10 mm nacl and 1 mm cacl2 solutions the npas may become available for attachment of nc60 nps if the primary minima were increased to be deep enough to immobilize nps however the attachment at the npas was readily influenced by the ha specifically the npas may be again unfavorable for attachment if the primary minimum were decreased by the ha wang et al 2016a 2016b this could explain why the ha caused significant transport of nc60 nps at 10 mm nacl and 1 mm cacl2 whereas nearly complete deposition occurred when the ha was absent in nacl at 100 mm and in cacl2 at 10 mm and 100 mm the primary minima were further increased atop npas which could immobilize the nps even in the presence of ha therefore complete attachment occurred under these chemical conditions both in the presence and absence of ha 3 3 detachment of nc60 nps in phase 2 of fig 2 the nc60 nps that were unattached in pore water were displaced out of the columns by injection of np free electrolyte solution small tails existed in the btcs in 1 mm and 10 mm nacl with ha present which were probably due to spontaneous release of the nc60 nps from primary minima through brownian diffusion the spontaneous release from primary minimum could occur when the decreased primary minimum depths by both npas and ha were comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid wang et al 2016a 2016b note that if there were nc60 nps attached at shallow secondary energy wells they could also spontaneously detach by brownian diffusion and cause the btc tails li et al 2005 shen et al 2016a 2016b in phase 3 of btcs in fig 2 the flush of di water caused a fraction of attached nc60 nps released as denoted by the peaks in the btcs it has been traditionally regarded that only colloids that were attached at secondary energy wells could be detached by is reduction because the secondary minimum depth decreases with decreasing is hahn and o melia 2004 hahn et al 2004 colloid attachment in primary minimum is irreversible because the primary energy wells are deep at all solution iss these viewpoints however were based on interaction energy calculations for colloid planar surface interactions recent studies shen et al 2012a 2019a bradford and torkzaban 2013 zou et al 2015 torkzaban and bradford 2016 showed that colloids attached atop npas can also be detached from primary energy minima by is reduction this is because the npas can reverse the trend for the variation of the primary minimum depth with solution is shen et al 2019a specifically the primary minimum depth can decrease with decreasing solution is with the presence of npas the primary minimum can even disappear from interaction energy profiles at low iss due to the npas in this case the interaction energy decreases monotonically with separation distance and the colloid experiences repulsive forces at all separation distances wang et al 2019 therefore the colloids initially attached atop npas at high iss via primary minimum association will be detached at the low iss it should be noted that nanoscale charge heterogeneity has also been frequently used to explain the detachment by is reduction pazmino et al 2014 rasmuson et al 2017 these studies indicate that detachment of colloids from nanoscale chemical heterogeneity could occur because the repulsion between a colloid and bulk surface may exceed the attraction between the colloid and chemical heterogeneity at low iss shen et al 2018 however demonstrated that whether the surface charge heterogeneity is present on surfaces or not does not change the trend for the variation of primary minimum depth with the solution is i e the increase of primary minimum depth with decreasing is in fact the nanoscale surface chemical heterogeneity increases the primary minimum depth at all solution iss under unfavorable conditions causing the attachment at primary minima even more irreversible therefore the detachment of nc60 nps by reduction of is should be mainly due to npas the absence of detachment for the nc60 nps initally attached at 100 mm cacl2 indicates that the nc60 nps could not be released even if they were initially attached atop npas this is likely due to the reason that the high concentration of ca2 resulted in strong interactions of the nc60 nps with the npas via cation bridge as shown in fig 2 and table 3 more detachment of nc60 nps occurred in phase 3 if they were initially attached in the presence of ha under all conditions except in 100 mm cacl2 the results clearly indicate that the ha not only inhibited attachment i e increase of c c 0 in phase 1 of btcs but also caused more weak attachments the nc60 nps via the weak adhesions were subsequently detached by is reduction table 2 shows that the presence of ha reduced the depths of primary minima and accordingly adhesive forces and torques the ha can even cause the decrease of primary minimum depth with decreasing solution is for the colloid planar surface interactions due to exerting steric repulsions i e similar to the npa effects wang et al 2016a 2016b the nc60 nps would be detached with lowering is if the adhesive torques were overcome by hydrodynamic torques wang et al 2016a the reduction of primary minimum depth and adhesive force torque by ha could assist the detachment of colloids attached especially atop npas specifically previous studies bradford et al 2013 shen et al 2015 2019a showed that the variation of densities and curvatures of npas caused a distribution of primary minimum depth the nc60 nps that remained attached at low iss atop some npas may be detached if the ha was present and the adhesive torques were reduced to be smaller than hydrodynamic torques the increased detachment by ha could also be due to the enhanced disaggregation of the aggregated nc60 nps this is because the presence of ha could cause decrease of primary minimum depth with is reduction for the colloid colloid interaction in the presence the steric repulsion omar et al 2014 shen et al 2019a the absence of nc60 nps detachment at 100 mm cacl2 indicates that the presence of ca2 with high concentrations caused very stable complex of nc60 nps and ha see fig 4 and strong interactions between the complex and surfaces schijven and hassanizadeh 2002 chen and elimelech 2007 2008 zhang et al 2012 chen et al 2014 4 conclusions through carrying out column experiments under saturated conditions we found that the ha reduced the attachment of nc60 nps in sand particularly on npas however the influence of ha on attachment was dependent on solution chemistry specifically the reduction of attachment was significant only in 10 mm nacl and 1 mm cacl2 there was no influence of ha on the attachment in 100 mm nacl and 10 and 100 mm cacl2 i e complete attachment both in the absence and presence of ha the reduction of attachment was attributed to the decrease of attachment atop some npas where the primary minimum wells were shallow and the attachment was readily influenced by the ha at 100 mm nacl and 10 and 100 mm cacl2 the primary minima became deep atop the npas even in the presence of ha and thus no influence of ha on attachment was observed the detachment was more upon reduction of solution is if the nc60 nps were initially attached in the present of ha under all chemical conditions expect at 100 mm cacl2 the results indicate that ha caused a fraction of nc60 nps weakly attached on sand surfaces via primary minimum association and then detached by reducing solution is however very stable complex of ha and nc60 nps existed and the interaction of the complex with the sand surfaces was strong at 100 mm cacl2 causing no detachment the attachment was also irreversible on large charge heterogeneities or concave surfaces due to deep primary minimum wells at all iss the aforementioned reversible attachment at primary minima by ha could cause the travel distance of nps very long in subsurface environments by continuous capture and release e g when multiple rainfall events occur as such the mobilization of the nps will be underestimated in the presence of ha if the mathematic model e g the convection diffusion equation incorporating a term of first order kinetic interaction with a reduced rate coefficient only considers the inhibited attachment in addition when using membranes for water treatment attached colloids on membrane surfaces in formal treatment may detach during the next treatment with the assistance of ha causing the water contaminations therefore our work has important implication to accurate prediction of fate and transport of nps and np associated contaminants in subsurface environment and use of membranes for water and wastewater treatment declarations of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41671222 41922047 and national key

1524,sand column experiments were performed under saturated conditions to investigate impact of humic acid ha on attachment of nc60 nanoparticles nps in nacl and cacl2 at ionic strengths iss from 1 mm to 100 mm and subsequent detachment via reducing solution is the attachment increased with increasing is due to reduced repulsive derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo interaction energy and accordingly increased retention in primary energy wells more attachments occurred in cacl2 compared to nacl because ca2 exhibited greater charge screen ability and served as a bridging agent between the nps and sand surfaces the presence of ha significantly reduced nc60 nps attachment on sand surfaces especially on nanoscale physical heterogeneities in 10 mm nacl and 1 mm cacl2 because of enhanced electrostatic and steric repulsions interestingly although the ha did not cause reduction of attachment in 100 mm nacl and 10 mm cacl2 compared to the case in absence of ha the ha caused weak attachment of nc60 on sand surfaces and then much more significant detachment by decreasing is the ha did not alter both attachment and detachment in 100 mm cacl2 because the ca2 at the high concentration caused formation of very stable complex of ha and nps and strong interaction of the complex with the sand surfaces via cation bridge our study highlighted that the ha can not only enhance the transport of nps by inhibiting attachment as revealed in the literature but also by the continuous capture and release of the nps from surfaces in subsurface environments keywords nc60 nanoparticles colloid humic acid porous media transport 1 introduction buckminsterfullerene c60 a hydrophobic molecule consists of 60 carbon atoms with a spherical cage like structure kroto et al 1985 li et al 2008 the nc60 bears unique physicochemical characteristics such as antioxidation and high electron affinity chen and elimelech 2006 qu et al 2012 therefore the c60 has gained a variety of applications including personal care products pharmaceuticals and new high strength materials qu et al 2012 zhang et al 2014a 2014b haftka et al 2015 mcnew and leboeuf 2016 the c60 can be synthesized in factories or generated in highly energetic nature events e g lightning discharges klaine et al 2008 zhang et al 2012a 2012b haftka et al 2015 sanchís et al 2018 the production and use of c60 has caused its distribution in subsurface environments sanchís et al 2012 sanchís et al 2015 li et al 2015 although the c60 has extremely low solubility in water surface of the c60 can obtain negative charges in aqueous systems and stable nanoscale aggregates nc60 will be formed li et al 2008 the resulting nc60 nanoparticles nps persist in the environment because they are resistant to biodegradation kümmerer et al 2011 however the nc60 nps were reported to be toxic to microbes chae et al 2010 animals oberdorster 2004 and human cells dhawan et al 2006 in addition the nc60 nps can absorb a variety of inorganic and organic pollutants and carry them to transport as a vehicle i e the so called colloid facilitated transport of pollutants li et al 2002 yang et al 2006 lin et al 2010 bai et al 2013 therefore it is critical to understanding the mechanisms governing the nc60 nps transport in the subsurface environments such as soil porous media for accurately evaluating their environmental risks various studies chen and elimelech 2006 2007 2008 li et al 2008 tong et al 2010 wang et al 2010 2012 2016a chen et al 2012 have examined the nc60 nps deposition on collector surfaces and their transport in porous media these studies consistently showed that deposition of nc60 nps can be qualitatively explained by the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory for example increasing solution ionic strength is reduces repulsive energy barrier hence the nc60 nps readily transport over the energy barrier at a higher is and attach at primary energy minima wang et al 2016a the presence of nanoscale physical asperities npas and charge heterogeneities can locally reduce the interaction energy barrier and increase nc60 nps deposition in primary minima li et al 2008 2017 tong et al 2010 shen et al 2018 2019a 2019b however the nc60 nps deposited atop npas at primary minima can spontaneously detach even by brownian diffusion because the npas can significantly reduce primary minimum depth and the adhesion acting on the nps wang et al 2016b the secondary minima were shallow for the nc60 nps which may not cause the immobilization at the energy wells li et al 2008 the detachment of nc60 nps in porous media has also been examined in the literature cheng et al 2005 wang et al 2008 hedayati et al 2016 for example hedayati et al 2016 examined transport of nc60 nps in silica sand packed columns they found that the nc60 nps were detached by injection of deionized di water and the amount of release of nc60 nps was influenced by the is at which the nc60 nps were attached wang et al 2008 showed that to fulfill substantial detachment of nc60 nps retained in 100 to 140 mesh ottawa sand required both decrease of solution is and significant increase of ph this indicated that the nc60 nps were initially attached at deep primary minima in addition to perturbation of solution chemistry cheng et al 2005 illustrated that a sudden increase of flow rate could also cause the detachment of nc60 nps as a major component of natural organic matter humic acid ha is ubiquitous in soil and sediment environments li et al 2018 consequently the ha and nc60 nps likely encounter in the porous soil and sediments chae et al 2012 it has been widely reported that the presence of ha reduced aggregation of nc60 nps due to increase of electrostatic and steric repulsions between the nps chen and elimelech 2007 hyung et al 2007 duncan et al 2008 xie et al 2008 chae et al 2012 yang et al 2013 jung et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a 2014b li et al 2018 due to a similar reason the ha enhanced the transport of nc60 nps by reducing attachment on collector surfaces chen and elimelech 2008 qu et al 2012 wang et al 2012 mcnew and leboeuf 2016 however the impact of ha on nc60 nps aggregation and attachment was regulated by is and cation valence franchi and o melia 2003 chen and elimelech 2008 chae et al 2012 qu et al 2012 mcnew and leboeuf 2016 while the aforementioned studies significantly improved knowledge of the mechanisms controlling the nc60 nps attachment in porous media very little attention has been paid to examining the influence of ha on detachment of nc60 nps i e the opposite mechanism of attachment the coupled influence of ha and solution chemistry makes the nc60 nps detachment even more complex and requires investigation this study through carrying out saturated sand column experiments systematically examined the impact of ha on nc60 nps attachment in different electrolyte solutions nacl and cacl2 with different iss and subsequent detachment by is reduction we found that while the ha reduced deposition of nc60 nps it also caused a fraction of nc60 nps weakly attached on sand surfaces and then released upon solution is reduction the detachment of nc60 nps by the ha was more significant if the nps were initially deposited in nacl at higher iss but was completely inhibited in cacl2 at high iss the findings in this study have important implication to water and wastewater filtration using membranes and developing mathematical models for predicting mobility of nps in subsurface environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 quartz sand quartz sand with sizes between 210 μm and 297 μm was used as collectors to pack the columns which was obtained from sigma aldrich st louis missouri united states the approach of zhuang et al 2005 was used to clean the sand grains surface morphologies of the cleaned sand were measured via a hitachi s4300 scanning electron microscope sem hitachi corp tokyo japan the fine fraction of the sand was isolated via sonication and used to determine zeta potentials in nacl and cacl2 at different solution iss via a zetaplus brookhaven instruments corp holtesville new york zhou et al 2011 wang et al 2016a 2 2 fullerene nps suspension fullerene c60 powder 99 9 purity produced by sigma aldrich st louis missouri united states was used the method used to prepare the nc60 nps stock suspension can be found in our previous study wang et al 2016a briefly the total organic carbon toc of the prepared nc60 nps stock suspension was determined to be 9 mg l 1 using a toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan the nc60 nps influent suspensions for column experiments were prepared by adding the nc60 stock suspension into nacl or cacl2 electrolyte solution at different iss the resulting iss of the influent suspensions were 1 mm 10 mm or 100 mm with the concentration of nc60 to be 1 8 mg l 1 by diluting the stock solution the dynamic light scattering zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd southborough massachusetts united states was used to measure the sizes and zeta potentials of the nc60 nps in the influent suspensions at different chemical conditions the zeta potentials of the nc60 nps were determined using a zetaplus analyzer brookhaven instruments corp holtesville new york united states 2 3 humic acid suspension similar to chen and elimelech 2007 the humic acid suspension was obtained by adding 50 mg of humic acid powder sigma aldrich st louis missouri united states in 100 ml di water the suspension was stirred for 24 h under dark conditions and passed through a 0 22 μm filter membrane using the toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan toc content of the humic acid suspension was determined to be 210 mg l 1 the ha was added into some nc60 nps suspensions to result in a concentration of 5 mg l 1 of the ha for zeta potential measurements and column transport experiments 2 4 column transport experiments acrylic columns 3 cm inner diameter and 10 cm long were adopted to implement the column experiments the method of wang et al 2016a was used to pack the columns briefly a wet packing method was used to ensure saturation of the column systems the sand was slowly added into the columns filled with water with gentle vibrations to avoid layering and air entrapment the porosities of the columns were calculated to be 0 36 by using the mass of the sand and assuming sand density of 2 65 g cm 3 a darcy velocity of 4 32 m d 1 was employed for all column transport experiments to standardize the physicochemical conditions of the column systems background nacl or cacl2 electrolyte solution at ph 7 adjusted using 0 1 mm nahco3 was first injected into the columns upward for over 20 pore volumes pvs then the column was flushed with 10 pvs of nc60 nps influent suspension with or without ha 1 8 mg l 1 of nc60 and 5 mg l 1 of ha at ph 7 denoted as phase 1 5 pvs of np free electrolyte solution phase 2 and finally di water phase 3 this three step procedure has been widely employed in previous studies shen et al 2012 wang et al 2016b li et al 2017 to examine colloid attachment and detachment in porous media effluent suspensions of the column experiments were collected by an automatic collector bsz 100 huxi instrument corp shanghai china and the concentration of nc60 nps was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometry du series 800 beckman instruments inc fullerton california united states at a wavelength of 550 nm the effluents at high iss were sonicated to ensure the monodispersion before the measurements 2 5 calculation of dlvo interaction energies to reveal the mechanisms controlling nc60 nps attachment and detachment it is necessary to determine the dlvo interaction energies between the nps and the sand surfaces ryam and elimelech 1996 ninham 1999 hoek and agarwal 2006 wang et al 2008 the surface element integration sei technique developed by bhattacharjee and elimelech 1997 was employed for performance of the interaction energy calculations note that the derjaguin da approach has been traditionally used to calculate the interaction energies this approach however contains several assumptions in the calculations as have been summarized in shen et al 2019a specifically the da approach did not consider the curvature effect of particle surface and assumed that the interaction energy for a particle is only due to a small region of the particle surface that is closet to the interacting surface the sei technique has overcome the limitations existing in the da approach and can give accurate calculations of interaction energy for colloids even at nanoscale lin and wiesner 2012 the total dlvo energy was taken as a sum of van der waals vdw attractive interaction energy electrical double layer dl interaction energy and short range repulsion the short range repulsion was included by determining born br repulsion as adopted in previous studies hoek and agarwal 2006 bradford and torkzaban 2013 seetha et al 2015 shen et al 2018 the nc60 nps were assumed to be spherical and the sand surface was taken as plate the use of sei technique to calculate energies for sphere plate interaction can be referred to previous studies wang et al 2016a 2016b li et al 2017 shen et al 2018 briefly surfaces of both a np and sand were discretized into small area elements the vdw dl and br differential interaction energies between each pair of area elements on the np and sand surfaces were determined using the expressions developed by hamaker 1937 hogg et al 1966 and oliveira 1997 respectively summing of the vdw dl and br differential interaction energies for all pairs of area elements resulted in the total interaction energy for a nc60 np considerable wedge like depressions existed in the sand surfaces as will be shown later in the paper to reveal the role of the wedge like depressions in nc60 nps attachment the depressions were represented by two intersecting half planes and the interaction force between a nc60 np and the model concave surface was determined fig 1 li et al 2017 has shown detailed procedure for calculating interaction force for the aforementioned interaction configuration briefly the cartesian coordinate system was used for the interaction configuration in fig 1 the z axis passed through the line where the two half planar surfaces intersect and the two intersecting half planar surfaces were bisected by the y z plane the total forces along the x f x and y direction f y were equal to f 1 cos α 2 f 2 cos α 2 and f 1 sin α 2 f 2 sin α 2 respectively where α is the angle between the two half planes and f 1 and f 2 are the interaction forces between the nc60 np and the left and right half planar surface respectively the values of f 1 or f 2 were determined using the sei technique the calculation procedure was the same as that for determining interaction energy shown in the previous section however differential vdw dl and bl forces between area elements were determined li et al 2017 instead of calculating differential interaction energies as will be showing in the following the nc60 nps were aggregated at high iss however we still used the sizes of the primary particles of the nc60 aggregates for interaction energy calculations at the high iss this is because the colloidal interaction energy for aggregated particles was similar to those of the primary particles but was much smaller than that for an equivalent sphere e g a sphere with the same volume as that of the aggregate lin and wiesner 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of nc60 nps and collectors the nc60 nps used had the same properties as those used in our previous study wang et al 2016a which were spherical in shape with slight angular features accord to transmission electron microscope tem examinations table 1 shows measured zeta potentials of nc60 nps and collector grains and sizes of the nps in electrolyte solutions at different iss with or without ha the zeta potentials were negative for both the nps and sand grains under all chemical conditions except at 100 mm cacl2 the existence of positive zeta potentials in cacl2 at the high is was due to sorption of ca2 on the np and sand surfaces causing charge reversal kuznar and elimelech 2004 the presence of ha caused more negative zeta potentials of the nps and sand grains which is in agreement with the results in previous studies dhawan et al 2006 chen and elimelech 2007 zhang et al 2014a 2014b lin et al 2017 this is because adsorption of the ha onto the nc60 nps and sand surfaces increased the negative charges and accordingly resulted in more negative zeta potentials zhang et al 2009 qu et al 2012 wang et al 2012 previous studies xie et al 2008 qu et al 2012 showed that the ha increased stability of nc60 nps suspensions and reduced the sizes of nc60 nps aggregates by increasing electrostatic and steric repulsions indeed the results in table 1 showed that the sizes of the nc60 nps were similar at all iss in nacl if the ha was present due to inhibition of aggregation while the size of the nc60 nps increased with increasing is in nacl without ha however the size of the nc60 nps still increased with increasing is in cacl2 even if the ha was present this is likely due to the formation of the complexes of ha and nps via cation bridge chen and elimelech 2007 as will be shown later by sem examinations in the paper reticular complexes on the sand surfaces were formed in cacl2 3 2 attachment of nc60 nps fig 2 presents breakthrough curves btcs for the nc60 nps by plotting the value of c c 0 as a function of pv where c and c 0 are effluent and influent np concentrations respectively in phase 1 the nc60 nps were attached on sand surfaces in nacl or cacl2 at different iss higher is caused more attachments of nc60 nps as have been observed in previous studies chen and elimelech 2006 2007 2008 li et al 2008 chae et al 2012 qu et al 2012 bai et al 2013 mcnew and leboeuf 2015 2016 the results confirmed that the nc60 can acquire negative surface charge although the mechanism is still unclear to date and the attachment of the nc60 was controlled by the electrostatic interaction in the electrolytes chen and elimelech 2006 the increase of attachment with is can be qualitatively explained by the energy calculations in fig 3 and table 2 specifically increasing is reduces repulsive energy barrier and thereby increases attachment in primary energy wells at a given is the nc60 nps attachment was more in cacl2 than in nacl this is because the ca2 was more effective for screening the dl repulsion and can link the nps to the sand surfaces i e the cation bridge effect schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 it should be noted that the attachment of nc60 nps in the sand cannot be quantitatively explained by the interaction energy calculations for instance the calculations showed that the interaction energy barriers were much greater than the average kinetic energy of a colloid 1 5 kt k is boltzmann constant t is absolute temperature in nacl at is 10 mm and in cacl2 at 1 mm these large repulsive energy barriers essentially inhibit the approach of nc60 nps to primary wells of interaction energy profiles thus attach at primary energy minima cannot occur under these chemical conditions the prediction by the calculations however was in contrast to the aforementioned experimental observations the sem images fig 4 showed that the sand surfaces were very rough which contained considerable npas the npas can increase primary minimum attachment by locally reducing repulsive energy barrier under unfavorable conditions shen et al 2012a 2012b zou et al 2015 rasmuson et al 2017 in addition the sand surfaces may bear charges different from those of bulk sand surfaces shen et al 2015 li et al 2017 the primary minimum attachment can be further enhanced if the npas bear charges different from those of bulk collector surfaces i e physical and chemical heterogeneities are coupled the reason is that the existence of chemical heterogeneity can increase the depth of primary minimum which could compensate for the reduction effect of npas on primary minimum depth bradford and torkzaban 2013 shen et al 2018 2019a colloids cannot be immobilized if the primary energy wells are very shallow due to existence of brownian diffusion in addition to the npas fig 4 shows that the sand surfaces also contained large wedge like depressions to interpret the role of the wedge like depression in nc60 nps attachment and detachment the interaction forces between a nc60 np and the depression were calculated using the method in materials and methods fig 5 shows the maps of f x and f y for a nc60 np interacting with the depression on the x y plane in 1 10 and 100 mm nacl the force maps were generated by changing the x y positions of the np in a rasterized manner in the dark areas the forces were ignored because they could not be determined due to physical overlap between the nc60 np and the surface the scale bar to the top of each plot indicates the forces in units of 10 12 n fig 5 shows that when the np is close to the tip of the concave surface the repulsive energy barrier could be eliminated even at low iss e g 1 mm this is because the repulsion between the np and a half surface was eliminated by the repulsion from the other half surface in the opposite direction therefore the nc60 nps were favored to be attached in primary minima at the locations of concave surfaces where the repulsive energy barrier was eliminated in addition to surface physical and heterogeneities aggregation of nc60 nps see fig 4 may also increase retention of the nc60 nps taghavy et al 2015 babakhani 2019 while the aggregation of colloids does not significantly alter the interaction energies lin and wiesner 2012 it could increase retention via enhanced sedimentation and straining porubcan and xu 2011 chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 notably the calculated secondary minima depths were much smaller than the average kinetic energy of a colloid hence the secondary minima should not play a significant role in nc60 nps attachment similarly li et al 2008 showed that the secondary minimum depths were extremely small for the nc60 nps which had minor influence on the deposition of nc60 nps in sand porous media fig 2 shows that ha reduced the deposition of nc60 nps attachment in the sand as shown in table 1 the zeta potentials of both nc60 nps and sand surface were increased when the ha was present accordingly the dl repulsion and interaction energy barrier were increased by the presence of ha see fig 3 and table 2 causing reduction of the attachment in primary minima in addition the presence of ha increases steric repulsion chen and elimelech 2008 zhang et al 2013 yang et al 2019 which can reduce or even eliminate primary energy well table 2 and thus decrease attachment in primary minima wang et al 2016b it should be mentioned that the reduced attachment by the ha was only significant in 10 mm nacl and 1 mm cacl2 there was only a minor reduction of attachment of the nps by the ha in 1 mm nacl no influence of attachment by the ha existed in nacl at 100 mm and in cacl2 at 10 mm and 100 mm i e complete attachment both in the presence and absence of ha two reasons may explain above minor influence of ha on nc60 nps attachment at 1 mm nacl first the ha had low sorption on surfaces of the nc60 nps and sand in nacl at this low is qu et al 2012 second the nc60 nps were attached in sites where deep primary minima existed at this is the nps could still attach at these energy wells even if these primary minima were decreased to a certain degree due to the electrostatic and steric repulsion by the ha one possible attachment site is large charge heterogeneity which can significantly reduce or even eliminate the large energy barrier that exist at low solution iss and cause very deep primary energy wells shen et al 2013 in addition fig 5 shows that the interaction energy barrier and primary minimum depth can also be decreased and increased at concave surfaces respectively li et al 2017 conducted column experiments and sem examinations showing that colloids were preferentially attached in primary minima at large charge heterogeneities and or concave surfaces at low solution iss the primary minimum was very shallow or even absent in the interaction energy profiles atop the npas without charge heterogeneities copresent at low iss shen et al 2012a 2019a bradford and torkzaban 2013 therefore the nc60 nps attachment on npas may not be significant at 1 mm nacl in 10 mm nacl and 1 mm cacl2 solutions the npas may become available for attachment of nc60 nps if the primary minima were increased to be deep enough to immobilize nps however the attachment at the npas was readily influenced by the ha specifically the npas may be again unfavorable for attachment if the primary minimum were decreased by the ha wang et al 2016a 2016b this could explain why the ha caused significant transport of nc60 nps at 10 mm nacl and 1 mm cacl2 whereas nearly complete deposition occurred when the ha was absent in nacl at 100 mm and in cacl2 at 10 mm and 100 mm the primary minima were further increased atop npas which could immobilize the nps even in the presence of ha therefore complete attachment occurred under these chemical conditions both in the presence and absence of ha 3 3 detachment of nc60 nps in phase 2 of fig 2 the nc60 nps that were unattached in pore water were displaced out of the columns by injection of np free electrolyte solution small tails existed in the btcs in 1 mm and 10 mm nacl with ha present which were probably due to spontaneous release of the nc60 nps from primary minima through brownian diffusion the spontaneous release from primary minimum could occur when the decreased primary minimum depths by both npas and ha were comparable to the average kinetic energy of a colloid wang et al 2016a 2016b note that if there were nc60 nps attached at shallow secondary energy wells they could also spontaneously detach by brownian diffusion and cause the btc tails li et al 2005 shen et al 2016a 2016b in phase 3 of btcs in fig 2 the flush of di water caused a fraction of attached nc60 nps released as denoted by the peaks in the btcs it has been traditionally regarded that only colloids that were attached at secondary energy wells could be detached by is reduction because the secondary minimum depth decreases with decreasing is hahn and o melia 2004 hahn et al 2004 colloid attachment in primary minimum is irreversible because the primary energy wells are deep at all solution iss these viewpoints however were based on interaction energy calculations for colloid planar surface interactions recent studies shen et al 2012a 2019a bradford and torkzaban 2013 zou et al 2015 torkzaban and bradford 2016 showed that colloids attached atop npas can also be detached from primary energy minima by is reduction this is because the npas can reverse the trend for the variation of the primary minimum depth with solution is shen et al 2019a specifically the primary minimum depth can decrease with decreasing solution is with the presence of npas the primary minimum can even disappear from interaction energy profiles at low iss due to the npas in this case the interaction energy decreases monotonically with separation distance and the colloid experiences repulsive forces at all separation distances wang et al 2019 therefore the colloids initially attached atop npas at high iss via primary minimum association will be detached at the low iss it should be noted that nanoscale charge heterogeneity has also been frequently used to explain the detachment by is reduction pazmino et al 2014 rasmuson et al 2017 these studies indicate that detachment of colloids from nanoscale chemical heterogeneity could occur because the repulsion between a colloid and bulk surface may exceed the attraction between the colloid and chemical heterogeneity at low iss shen et al 2018 however demonstrated that whether the surface charge heterogeneity is present on surfaces or not does not change the trend for the variation of primary minimum depth with the solution is i e the increase of primary minimum depth with decreasing is in fact the nanoscale surface chemical heterogeneity increases the primary minimum depth at all solution iss under unfavorable conditions causing the attachment at primary minima even more irreversible therefore the detachment of nc60 nps by reduction of is should be mainly due to npas the absence of detachment for the nc60 nps initally attached at 100 mm cacl2 indicates that the nc60 nps could not be released even if they were initially attached atop npas this is likely due to the reason that the high concentration of ca2 resulted in strong interactions of the nc60 nps with the npas via cation bridge as shown in fig 2 and table 3 more detachment of nc60 nps occurred in phase 3 if they were initially attached in the presence of ha under all conditions except in 100 mm cacl2 the results clearly indicate that the ha not only inhibited attachment i e increase of c c 0 in phase 1 of btcs but also caused more weak attachments the nc60 nps via the weak adhesions were subsequently detached by is reduction table 2 shows that the presence of ha reduced the depths of primary minima and accordingly adhesive forces and torques the ha can even cause the decrease of primary minimum depth with decreasing solution is for the colloid planar surface interactions due to exerting steric repulsions i e similar to the npa effects wang et al 2016a 2016b the nc60 nps would be detached with lowering is if the adhesive torques were overcome by hydrodynamic torques wang et al 2016a the reduction of primary minimum depth and adhesive force torque by ha could assist the detachment of colloids attached especially atop npas specifically previous studies bradford et al 2013 shen et al 2015 2019a showed that the variation of densities and curvatures of npas caused a distribution of primary minimum depth the nc60 nps that remained attached at low iss atop some npas may be detached if the ha was present and the adhesive torques were reduced to be smaller than hydrodynamic torques the increased detachment by ha could also be due to the enhanced disaggregation of the aggregated nc60 nps this is because the presence of ha could cause decrease of primary minimum depth with is reduction for the colloid colloid interaction in the presence the steric repulsion omar et al 2014 shen et al 2019a the absence of nc60 nps detachment at 100 mm cacl2 indicates that the presence of ca2 with high concentrations caused very stable complex of nc60 nps and ha see fig 4 and strong interactions between the complex and surfaces schijven and hassanizadeh 2002 chen and elimelech 2007 2008 zhang et al 2012 chen et al 2014 4 conclusions through carrying out column experiments under saturated conditions we found that the ha reduced the attachment of nc60 nps in sand particularly on npas however the influence of ha on attachment was dependent on solution chemistry specifically the reduction of attachment was significant only in 10 mm nacl and 1 mm cacl2 there was no influence of ha on the attachment in 100 mm nacl and 10 and 100 mm cacl2 i e complete attachment both in the absence and presence of ha the reduction of attachment was attributed to the decrease of attachment atop some npas where the primary minimum wells were shallow and the attachment was readily influenced by the ha at 100 mm nacl and 10 and 100 mm cacl2 the primary minima became deep atop the npas even in the presence of ha and thus no influence of ha on attachment was observed the detachment was more upon reduction of solution is if the nc60 nps were initially attached in the present of ha under all chemical conditions expect at 100 mm cacl2 the results indicate that ha caused a fraction of nc60 nps weakly attached on sand surfaces via primary minimum association and then detached by reducing solution is however very stable complex of ha and nc60 nps existed and the interaction of the complex with the sand surfaces was strong at 100 mm cacl2 causing no detachment the attachment was also irreversible on large charge heterogeneities or concave surfaces due to deep primary minimum wells at all iss the aforementioned reversible attachment at primary minima by ha could cause the travel distance of nps very long in subsurface environments by continuous capture and release e g when multiple rainfall events occur as such the mobilization of the nps will be underestimated in the presence of ha if the mathematic model e g the convection diffusion equation incorporating a term of first order kinetic interaction with a reduced rate coefficient only considers the inhibited attachment in addition when using membranes for water treatment attached colloids on membrane surfaces in formal treatment may detach during the next treatment with the assistance of ha causing the water contaminations therefore our work has important implication to accurate prediction of fate and transport of nps and np associated contaminants in subsurface environment and use of membranes for water and wastewater treatment declarations of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41671222 41922047 and national key
