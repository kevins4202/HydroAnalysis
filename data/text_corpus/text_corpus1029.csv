5145,during a storm event rainfall intensity rarely remains uniform but rather shows radical temporal variation given the time window w within a storm the maximum rainfall intensity over w namely iw decreases as w increases our analysis of individual storm events using ground measurements of 1 minute temporal resolution reveals that the iw w relationship follows either a single or broken power law such scale invariance is likely associated with known fractal or multi fractal characteristics of rainfall structure in broken power law events two power law exponents of βm at minute time scale and βh at hourly time scale are fitted for segments separated by the characteristic time τ mostly βm βh implying the persistence of high rainfall concentration prior to τ this reflects the characteristics of convective storms and the range of τ agrees with the known time span of convective storm duration the more concentrated storm event exhibits the stronger persistence a smaller βm prior to τ and the faster moisture depletion a greater βh thereafter the knowledge gained from this study provides important implications to the existing design storm formula often called the mononobe

discrete variable by nature for the exact description of rainfall the number of raindrops should be counted over a certain time duration and area further the specification such as the shape and volume of each drop shall be examined for completeness during the free fall a drop even deforms due to the drag force which adds further complexity although such details can be measured with various types of disdrometers e g knollenberg 1970 löffler mang and joss 2000 their practical applications are limited in most practices rainfall has simply been measured by its depth and such tradition has continued over centuries e g wada 1911 the rainfall depth is defined as the accumulated rainfall in the unit of length at a specific location over a certain time period during a storm event a raindrop may not fall on the exact spot where a previous drop fell therefore a certain spatial integration albeit it can be as small as the surface area of a rain gauge is also necessary to measure the rainfall depth hence a single value of the rainfall depth is an outcome of spatio temporal integration treating the accumulated rainfall depth x as a continuous variable the instantaneous rainfall intensity or rain rate can be expressed as its time derivative i e x dx dt where t is the time fig 1 the inverse of this definition states x xdt however this continuum concept is illusionary the increment of rain depth occurs at an instant when each raindrop touches the ground strictly speaking the instantaneous rainfall intensity can be only either infinity when raindrop touches the ground or zero during the time interval between raindrops touching the same ground therefore x should be a step function to detect such a step function we need rain gauges with virtually unlimited time resolution because this is impractical the continuum concept of fig 1 is often adopted to obtain the maximum rainfall depth π w for the given time window of width w we seek the niche where the rainfall depth for the given w becomes the maximum while moving the time window across the whole storm duration ζ fig 1b in other words the start time of the time window s 0 s ζ w is determined to yield the maximum rainfall depth as follows 1 π w s s w xdt in practice rainfall depth is recorded as discrete time series with the time interval δt note that such discrete recording should be distinguished from the discrete nature of the rainfall rather the discrete recording partly stems from the physical limitation in the measurement resolution of the instrument and is often preferred for practical reasons let us state the cumulative rainfall depth at the time step j an integer as xj then the corresponding rainfall intensity xj can be approximated as the increment of rain depth over δt i e xj xj xj 1 δt for j 1 x0 0 taking the backward difference scheme here xj is an averaged intensity over δt and shall be distinguished from the instantaneous rainfall intensity which is either or 0 modifying equation 1 we can seek the maximum rainfall depth for a given time window from the discrete series as 2 π n w δ t j j s j s n w x j δ t from here on we use js and nw as integers corresponding to their counterparts in equation 1 as s js δt and w nw δt they range as 0 js n ζ nw and 1 nw n ζ where the rainfall duration ζ is also expressed as integer times of δt i e ζ n ζδt the maximum rainfall intensity for w nw δt is given as iw π w w as shown here and in equation 2 π w or iw is a function of w in section 3 we investigate the function iw i e how it varies with w 2 2 minimum inter event time mit owing to the discrete nature of the rainfall a non rainy time interval exists between consecutive raindrops if the interval is shorter than the time resolution δt the non rainy period is invisible in the time series however intermittences greater than δt are clearly marked in the hyetograph as illustrated in fig 1 the period between ta and tb such period is shown as a plateau or constant x no increase in cumulative rainfall depth in fig 1a or zero x in fig 1b one may treat such record as two independent events before ta and after tb in the example shown in fig 1 otherwise one may consider the intermittence as a temporary pause within a single storm if the non rainy period is considered short to reduce subjectivity in that decision a certain reference time duration to which the non rainy duration can be compared is required this is referred to as the inter event time definition joo et al 2014 yoo et al 2015 we shall define the minimum inter event time mit e g dunkerley 2008 ignaccolo and de michele 2010 medina cobo et al 2016 as the criterion to separate adjacent rainfall events defining mit is difficult and arguable at one extreme we can define a sufficiently short mit so that every raindrop can be treated as an individual event ideally the mit needs to be long enough to include raindrops from the same meteorological origin in a single event while it shall be sufficiently short to distinguish an event from another of separate genesis defining such a quantitative standard is challenging in literature the mit has been decided and adopted depending on purposes for example llasat 2001 used 1 hour mit to delineate the convective storms tsubo et al 2005 identified rainfall events with 3 hour mit to develop a rainfall disaggregation model to estimate soil erosivity induced by rainfall 6 hour mit has been adopted wischmeier and smith 1978 in this study above three mit criteria are adopted we investigate whether the choice of mit affects the iw w relationship 3 characteristics of rainfall data to be analyzed 3 1 study sites and data we used the automated synoptic observing system asos data for 6 years between jan 1 2014 and dec 31 2019 provided by the korea meteorological administration korean asos adopts high accuracy weighing rain gauges with minimal incremental value of either 0 1 or 0 5 mm in the original cumulative rainfall data the data are digitized in 1 minute interval δt only 0 1 mm data are used in this study for the given period such high resolution data are available at 20 stations which are almost evenly distributed across south korea fig 2 to extract clear intra storm variability the storm events for our analysis should be sufficiently big one may define a big storm event on the basis of its total rainfall depth noted as p here fig 1 or its mean rainfall intensity noted as i ζ p ζ given our interest of the intra storm variability storm events for our analysis should possess a wide spectrum of rainfall intensity within a storm also the storm should last for a long duration and so the window width w can widely vary in this regard we selected storm events on the basis of the total rainfall depth the rainfall depth of 80 mm has been popularly adopted as a threshold to categorize heavy rainfall events in south korea e g jung et al 2011 in addition we considered 40 and 60 mm as well so three minimum depth thresholds mdt in total by doing so we aimed to study any effect of this arbitrary threshold on the iw w relationship the number of selected events decreases as the mdt increases table 1 in fact events selected for a greater mdt are all included in the event sets for smaller mdts e g events selected with mdt 40 mm include events with mdt 60 or 80 mm recall that we also adopted three mit criteria one may postulate that adopting a shorter mit would yield a greater number of selected events however data screening more often resulted in the opposite for a shorter mit a smaller number of events are selected table 1 this is because many small events truncated by the mit criteria fail to satisfy the mdt and so are removed 3 2 characteristics of storm events before we dive into the intra storm variability we first overview the general characteristics of storm events analyzed in this study given the event duration ζ the total rainfall depth of the event is x ζ in the discrete expression note that x ζ πζ the special case when w ζ we briefly express this quantity as p i e p x ζ πζ storm events analyzed in this study show wide ranges of total depth p duration ζ and mean intensity i ζ p ζ fig 3 a shows the relationship between p and ζ for 849 events selected with mit 180 min while the relationship shows a large scatter events appear to be located within a triangular domain surrounded by upper and lower bounds the lower bound implies events with the minimum ζ for given p forming the line of most concentrated storm events the minimum ζ tends to increase with p such tendency can be considered reasonable in that an event with a greater depth p is expected to have a longer duration ζ meanwhile the maximum ζ tends to slightly decrease with p i e max ζ p 0 2 the relationship between p and mean rainfall intensity i ζ is also scattered in a triangular domain fig 3b the lower bound is the line connecting events of the minimum i ζ for given p these events correspond to the maximum ζ for given p shown in fig 3a as max ζ p 0 2 from the definition of i ζ p ζ therefore the lower bound line becomes min i ζ p p 0 2 p 1 2 the upper bound i e the maximum i ζ for given p tends to decrease with p following a power law the maximum i ζ is defined as the given p divided by the minimum ζ which increases with p as min ζ p 1 3 fig 3a hence max i ζ p p 1 3 p 0 3 other sets of events with mit 60 and 360 min essentially show the same features although the exponents of fitted lines slightly differ 4 power law iw w relationships 4 1 single versus broken power laws we found that iw decreases with growing w in all cases interestingly the trend is well fitted as a power law i e iw w β fig 4 a this is a clear indicator of the scale free characteristic residing in the intra storm variability kang 2019 note that the similar behavior was found at two australian sites having distinct climatic conditions dunkerley 2008 in fig 4 the point a refers to i δ t which is the maximum rainfall intensity corresponding to w δt while the instantaneous rainfall intensity should be in theory the value of i δ t forms the measurable peak intensity within the given rainfall event as we adopted δt 1 min we briefly express i δ t as i 1 using this expression the power law fitted in fig 4a can be stated as 3 i w i 1 w β 1 w ζ the point b in fig 4 corresponds to i ζ where w is the maximum i e ζ which shall be the event mean rainfall intensity p ζ as summarized in table 1 rainfall events with a greater mdt tend to exhibit greater i 1 and i ζ also shown in fig 3 the power law scaling often exhibits a sudden shift when w reaches the transition time τ i e w τ shown as the point t in fig 4b and 4c we produced iw w plot for each storm event and τ is identified geometrically from the graph i e t is obtained as the point farthest from the straight line connecting points a and b dashed green line in fig 4b and 4c power regression has been conducted for two segments of w τ and τ w yielding two exponents of βm minute time scale and βh hourly time scale respectively an event of which the difference between fitted βm and βh is less than 5 is classified as a single power law event fig 4a and equation 3 for more than 80 of total events the difference is greater than 5 for them the relationship can be modeled as 4 i w i 1 w β m 1 w τ i τ w τ β h τ w ζ where i τ is the maximum rainfall intensity over τ from here on these are referred to as broken power law events in summary intra storm variability can be classified into two types single and broken power laws fig 4 most events in this study follow the broken power law for majority of them we found βm βh β values for single power law events are found to be between βm and βh of broken power law events table 1 insignificant fraction of broken power law events shows βm βh their hyetographs are characterized with a distinct peak which is rapidly declining over time high βm combined with the long lasting low intensity drizzle low βh they are referred to as the inverse events and separated from the rest broken power law events in this study for the rest of this paper we focus on the broken power law events broken power law events are important because they not only account for majority of storm events but also can produce severe flooding statistically broken power law events have greater mean intensity i ζ than single power law events table 1 they also exhibit greater peak intensity i 1 the greatest i 1 among all events analyzed is recorded as 3 2 mm min found in a broken power law event the greatest i 1 1 8 mm min out of single power law events is about a half of the value 3 2 mm min mentioned above notably broken power law events show slow decay in peak intensity reflected as small βm which indicates the persistent and concentrated rainfall which is prone to trigger flooding 4 2 convective storm characteristics reflected in the broken power law model many earlier studies have suggested that rainfall structure can be better described with multi fractal framework than mono fractal e g harris et al 1996 svensson et al 1996 tessier et al 1996 menabde et al 1997 sivakumar 2000 our broken power law model is in line with the multi fractal notion below we discuss about the physical origin that brings the scaling transition in broken power law events the decrease rate of iw with w is mild until w reaches τ i e βm is mostly less than 0 2 table 1 and fig 4b as the time window widens beyond τ iw decreases at much greater rates i e βm βh the small βm implies that intensive rainfall persists up to τ the time scale at which the rapid atmospheric moisture depletion is initiated this short lasting intensive rainfall could be attributed to the convective shower we found in most broken power law events that τ is around 17 min table 1 which roughly agrees with the maximum duration of convective storms reported in earlier studies e g chaudhry et al 1996 our postulation about the linkage between the broken power law and the storm generation mechanism is in accordance with earlier studies the scaling transition has also been reported by bougadis and adamowski 2006 in their study on idf curves where they claimed that the different scaling at two time scales is attributed to the storm dynamics i e either convective short time scale or frontal longer time scale storms later a stochastic rainfall generation model to reproduce such distinct characteristics at two time scales has been proposed e g langousis and veneziano 2007 it was shown that the exceedance probability distribution of rainfall intensity differs between stratiform and convective storms stratiform storms show the clear power law distribution while the distributions of convective storms deviates from the power law berg et al 2013 to identify convective storm events from rainfall data llasat 2001 proposed the following metric 5 γ 1 p j 1 n ζ θ j x j where θj is heaviside function which is either unity if xj c or zero if xj c for a given threshold rainfall intensity c for a given c an event yielding a greater γ value indicates a more concentrated storm supposedly a convective storm as stated earlier the broken power law is postulated to reflect the nature of convective storms therefore γ likely exhibits a certain correlation with βm and βh i e a highly concentrated storm event should yield a high γ a small βm and a large βh here the plausible correlations among γ βm and βh are investigated with our broken power law events fig 5 we adopted c 0 8 mm min the same threshold value used by llasat 2001 for their analysis of spanish data events within which the intensity xj never reached c about 39 of broken power law events for mit 180 min yield zero γ and are removed from the graph as shown in fig 5 the level of rainfall concentration γ is indeed associated with βm as well as βh this association is also well exhibited for other sets of events with mit 60 and 360 min not shown here a smaller βm implies slower decay of peak rainfall intensity which is reflected as a greater γ this would deplete a large portion of moisture and so the declining after τ tends to be rapid i e a greater βh see fig 4b therefore βh is positively related with γ for broken power law events the rainfall depth up to τ π τ indicates the depth of the concentrated storm in this regard we propose the proportion of π τ to the total rainfall depth p i e π τ p as another metric dimensionless to express the degree of rainfall concentration similar to γ as expected π τ p shows clear correlations with βm and βh i e an event with a high π τ p exhibits a small βm and a large βh fig 5b on the same token these metrics γ π τ p βm and βh exhibit the seasonal variation fig 6 south korea experiences strong seasonality in precipitation i e most intensive events are concentrated in summer june august such seasonality is reflected as a smaller βm and greater γ πτ p and βh in summer fig 6 it is found that the average of fitted power law exponent values β βm βh tend to vary with mit and mdt because storm events are differently selected depending on these criteria table 1 for a given mit βm tends to decrease i e less attenuation or persistence in intensity as a more rigid threshold of total depth greater mdt is chosen while the influence of mdt on β or βh is unclear as a longer mit is chosen ζ tends to increase the mean intensity i ζ tends to reduce and the fitted values of βm tend to increase these tendencies are considered reasonable in that a greater βm indicates the less concentration in table 1 βh tends to increase as a longer mit is chosen this trend may appear opposite to our argument described earlier with figs 5 and 6 however such a high βh is an artifact due to greater intermittences included in data as mit grows 4 3 implications for design storms the broken power law phenomenon can be an important reference for the determination of design storms it is noteworthy to revisit an old formula below during the era when high resolution rainfall record was rarely available a formula was proposed to estimate the maximum rainfall depth over hourly time scale w from a daily rainfall depth ζ fixed as 24 h as 6 π w π ζ ζ ζ w 2 3 w to the best of authors knowledge this formula first appears in mononobe 1933 later the formula has been utilized for an arbitrary duration ζ e g na and yoo 2018 in this sense equation 6 can be understood as a simple equation for rainfall downscaling it can also be considered as a design storm formula because it can be used to generate a series of rainfall intensity iw π w w for varying w in engineering practices design hyetograph is also generated by allocating the calculated series of iw following a unimodal distribution e g yoo et al 2015 an intriguing point is that the single power law model equation 3 is identical to this old formula rewriting equation 6 gives iw i ζ ζ2 3 w 2 3 which follows the single power law iw w β equation 3 with a fixed β in this regard our study provides certain observation based supports to this old method nevertheless mononobe formula has been known to overestimate peak rainfall intensity e g kang et al 2013 we claim that this overestimation problem is due to the nature of the single power law as this method was originally to estimate hourly scale rainfall intensity from daily rainfall depth the intra storm variability at finer timescale was beyond the focus our analysis utilizing 1 minute resolution data discovered the scale transition at sub hourly timescale which requires broken power law here we demonstrate the difference in the estimated peak intensity i 1 between the single power law mononobe equation 6 and the broken power law equation 4 for the real event shown in fig 4b the original hyetograph of this event shown in fig 7 a has i 1 1 3 mm min taking parameter values from the storm record ζ 565 min πζ 59 2 mm the mononobe equation 6 yields i 1 7 3 mm min significant overestimation to apply the broken power law equation 4 additional parameters are also taken from the observation β m 0 18 βh 0 48 τ 18 min i 1 generated by equation 4 is 0 9 mm min much closer to the record we also demonstrate synthetic hyetographs by allocating iw series calculated by equations 6 and 4 following unimodal distribution fig 7b and 7c although further study is necessary for design hyetographs we found these results promising so we suggest that using the broken power law model for design storm generation and allocating the outcome with multimodal distribution could provide a reasonable alternative for design hyetograph generation 5 concluding remarks in this study we report the scale free relationships within a storm expressed as the power law between the maximum rainfall intensity and a time window width we claim two kinds of single and broken power laws where most events in our study follows the latter berg et al 2013 showed distinct probability density functions between stratiform and convective storms we postulate that such difference is associated with single versus broken power laws reported here for broken power law events we identified two scaling exponents for segments separated at the transition time τ namely βm and βh whereas mostly βm βh we claim that the first segment up to τ is linked to the life of the convective storm cell in this regard τ could be critical for flood forecast purpose in our analysis with the korean data τ is about 17 min we also investigated any spatial patterns in the model parameters τ βm βh for 20 stations across south korea no statistically meaningful patterns are found yet and it needs further study with more data our findings carry not only scientific messages but also potential usefulness in engineering practices the scaling transition at sub hourly time scale shown as the broken power law explains the known issue of the mononobe formula i e the overestimation of the peak intensity when small time scale is used further the multi fractal nature shown here provides an opportunity for a better temporal downscaling of rainfall records in the context of changing climate rainfall characteristics are expected to change as well e g semenov and bengtsson 2002 trenberth et al 2003 many studies suggest that the extreme rainfall intensity would probably increase in accordance with the warmer climate lenderink and meijgaard 2008 kunkel et al 2013 prein et al 2017 naturally the intra storm variability is also subject to change under changing climate such change would be reflected in parameters of the proposed model it has been claimed that convective storms are sensitively affected by the temperature rise berg et al 2013 notably several studies that have estimated future changes in idf curves e g mailhot et al 2007 so et al 2017 suggested that rainfall intensity for a shorter duration is expected to increase further under the warmer climate compared to the case of a longer duration this implies that the gap between minute time scale βm and hourly time scale βh could be widen which could result in a greater decline after τ or greater βh credit

discrete nature of the rainfall a non rainy time interval exists between consecutive raindrops if the interval is shorter than the time resolution δt the non rainy period is invisible in the time series however intermittences greater than δt are clearly marked in the hyetograph as illustrated in fig 1 the period between ta and tb such period is shown as a plateau or constant x no increase in cumulative rainfall depth in fig 1a or zero x in fig 1b one may treat such record as two independent events before ta and after tb in the example shown in fig 1 otherwise one may consider the intermittence as a temporary pause within a single storm if the non rainy period is considered short to reduce subjectivity in that decision a certain reference time duration to which the non rainy duration can be compared is required this is referred to as the inter event time definition joo et al 2014 yoo et al 2015 we shall define the minimum inter event time mit e g dunkerley 2008 ignaccolo and de michele 2010 medina cobo et al 2016 as the criterion to separate adjacent rainfall events defining mit is difficult and arguable at one extreme we can define a sufficiently short mit so that every raindrop can be treated as an individual event ideally the mit needs to be long enough to include raindrops from the same meteorological origin in a single event while it shall be sufficiently short to distinguish an event from another of separate genesis defining such a quantitative standard is challenging in literature the mit has been decided and adopted depending on purposes for example llasat 2001 used 1 hour mit to delineate the convective storms tsubo et al 2005 identified rainfall events with 3 hour mit to develop a rainfall disaggregation model to estimate soil erosivity induced by rainfall 6 hour mit has been adopted wischmeier and smith 1978 in this study above three mit criteria are adopted we investigate whether the choice of mit affects the iw w relationship 3 characteristics of rainfall data to be analyzed 3 1 study sites and data we used the automated synoptic observing system asos data for 6 years between jan 1 2014 and dec 31 2019 provided by the korea meteorological administration korean asos adopts high accuracy weighing rain gauges with minimal incremental value of either 0 1 or 0 5 mm in the original cumulative rainfall data the data are digitized in 1 minute interval δt only 0 1 mm data are used in this study for the given period such high resolution data are available at 20 stations which are almost evenly distributed across south korea fig 2 to extract clear intra storm variability the storm events for our analysis should be sufficiently big one may define a big storm event on the basis of its total rainfall depth noted as p here fig 1 or its mean rainfall intensity noted as i ζ p ζ given our interest of the intra storm variability storm events for our analysis should possess a wide spectrum of rainfall intensity within a storm also the storm should last for a long duration and so the window width w can widely vary in this regard we selected storm events on the basis of the total rainfall depth the rainfall depth of 80 mm has been popularly adopted as a threshold to categorize heavy rainfall events in south korea e g jung et al 2011 in addition we considered 40 and 60 mm as well so three minimum depth thresholds mdt in total by doing so we aimed to study any effect of this arbitrary threshold on the iw w relationship the number of selected events decreases as the mdt increases table 1 in fact events selected for a greater mdt are all included in the event sets for smaller mdts e g events selected with mdt 40 mm include events with mdt 60 or 80 mm recall that we also adopted three mit criteria one may postulate that adopting a shorter mit would yield a greater number of selected events however data screening more often resulted in the opposite for a shorter mit a smaller number of events are selected table 1 this is because many small events truncated by the mit criteria fail to satisfy the mdt and so are removed 3 2 characteristics of storm events before we dive into the intra storm variability we first overview the general characteristics of storm events analyzed in this study given the event duration ζ the total rainfall depth of the event is x ζ in the discrete expression note that x ζ πζ the special case when w ζ we briefly express this quantity as p i e p x ζ πζ storm events analyzed in this study show wide ranges of total depth p duration ζ and mean intensity i ζ p ζ fig 3 a shows the relationship between p and ζ for 849 events selected with mit 180 min while the relationship shows a large scatter events appear to be located within a triangular domain surrounded by upper and lower bounds the lower bound implies events with the minimum ζ for given p forming the line of most concentrated storm events the minimum ζ tends to increase with p such tendency can be considered reasonable in that an event with a greater depth p is expected to have a longer duration ζ meanwhile the maximum ζ tends to slightly decrease with p i e max ζ p 0 2 the relationship between p and mean rainfall intensity i ζ is also scattered in a triangular domain fig 3b the lower bound is the line connecting events of the minimum i ζ for given p these events correspond to the maximum ζ for given p shown in fig 3a as max ζ p 0 2 from the definition of i ζ p ζ therefore the lower bound line becomes min i ζ p p 0 2 p 1 2 the upper bound i e the maximum i ζ for given p tends to decrease with p following a power law the maximum i ζ is defined as the given p divided by the minimum ζ which increases with p as min ζ p 1 3 fig 3a hence max i ζ p p 1 3 p 0 3 other sets of events with mit 60 and 360 min essentially show the same features although the exponents of fitted lines slightly differ 4 power law iw w relationships 4 1 single versus broken power laws we found that iw decreases with growing w in all cases interestingly the trend is well fitted as a power law i e iw w β fig 4 a this is a clear indicator of the scale free characteristic residing in the intra storm variability kang 2019 note that the similar behavior was found at two australian sites having distinct climatic conditions dunkerley 2008 in fig 4 the point a refers to i δ t which is the maximum rainfall intensity corresponding to w δt while the instantaneous rainfall intensity should be in theory the value of i δ t forms the measurable peak intensity within the given rainfall event as we adopted δt 1 min we briefly express i δ t as i 1 using this expression the power law fitted in fig 4a can be stated as 3 i w i 1 w β 1 w ζ the point b in fig 4 corresponds to i ζ where w is the maximum i e ζ which shall be the event mean rainfall intensity p ζ as summarized in table 1 rainfall events with a greater mdt tend to exhibit greater i 1 and i ζ also shown in fig 3 the power law scaling often exhibits a sudden shift when w reaches the transition time τ i e w τ shown as the point t in fig 4b and 4c we produced iw w plot for each storm event and τ is identified geometrically from the graph i e t is obtained as the point farthest from the straight line connecting points a and b dashed green line in fig 4b and 4c power regression has been conducted for two segments of w τ and τ w yielding two exponents of βm minute time scale and βh hourly time scale respectively an event of which the difference between fitted βm and βh is less than 5 is classified as a single power law event fig 4a and equation 3 for more than 80 of total events the difference is greater than 5 for them the relationship can be modeled as 4 i w i 1 w β m 1 w τ i τ w τ β h τ w ζ where i τ is the maximum rainfall intensity over τ from here on these are referred to as broken power law events in summary intra storm variability can be classified into two types single and broken power laws fig 4 most events in this study follow the broken power law for majority of them we found βm βh β values for single power law events are found to be between βm and βh of broken power law events table 1 insignificant fraction of broken power law events shows βm βh their hyetographs are characterized with a distinct peak which is rapidly declining over time high βm combined with the long lasting low intensity drizzle low βh they are referred to as the inverse events and separated from the rest broken power law events in this study for the rest of this paper we focus on the broken power law events broken power law events are important because they not only account for majority of storm events but also can produce severe flooding statistically broken power law events have greater mean intensity i ζ than single power law events table 1 they also exhibit greater peak intensity i 1 the greatest i 1 among all events analyzed is recorded as 3 2 mm min found in a broken power law event the greatest i 1 1 8 mm min out of single power law events is about a half of the value 3 2 mm min mentioned above notably broken power law events show slow decay in peak intensity reflected as small βm which indicates the persistent and concentrated rainfall which is prone to trigger flooding 4 2 convective storm characteristics reflected in the broken power law model many earlier studies have suggested that rainfall structure can be better described with multi fractal framework than mono fractal e g harris et al 1996 svensson et al 1996 tessier et al 1996 menabde et al 1997 sivakumar 2000 our broken power law model is in line with the multi fractal notion below we discuss about the physical origin that brings the scaling transition in broken power law events the decrease rate of iw with w is mild until w reaches τ i e βm is mostly less than 0 2 table 1 and fig 4b as the time window widens beyond τ iw decreases at much greater rates i e βm βh the small βm implies that intensive rainfall persists up to τ the time scale at which the rapid atmospheric moisture depletion is initiated this short lasting intensive rainfall could be attributed to the convective shower we found in most broken power law events that τ is around 17 min table 1 which roughly agrees with the maximum duration of convective storms reported in earlier studies e g chaudhry et al 1996 our postulation about the linkage between the broken power law and the storm generation mechanism is in accordance with earlier studies the scaling transition has also been reported by bougadis and adamowski 2006 in their study on idf curves where they claimed that the different scaling at two time scales is attributed to the storm dynamics i e either convective short time scale or frontal longer time scale storms later a stochastic rainfall generation model to reproduce such distinct characteristics at two time scales has been proposed e g langousis and veneziano 2007 it was shown that the exceedance probability distribution of rainfall intensity differs between stratiform and convective storms stratiform storms show the clear power law distribution while the distributions of convective storms deviates from the power law berg et al 2013 to identify convective storm events from rainfall data llasat 2001 proposed the following metric 5 γ 1 p j 1 n ζ θ j x j where θj is heaviside function which is either unity if xj c or zero if xj c for a given threshold rainfall intensity c for a given c an event yielding a greater γ value indicates a more concentrated storm supposedly a convective storm as stated earlier the broken power law is postulated to reflect the nature of convective storms therefore γ likely exhibits a certain correlation with βm and βh i e a highly concentrated storm event should yield a high γ a small βm and a large βh here the plausible correlations among γ βm and βh are investigated with our broken power law events fig 5 we adopted c 0 8 mm min the same threshold value used by llasat 2001 for their analysis of spanish data events within which the intensity xj never reached c about 39 of broken power law events for mit 180 min yield zero γ and are removed from the graph as shown in fig 5 the level of rainfall concentration γ is indeed associated with βm as well as βh this association is also well exhibited for other sets of events with mit 60 and 360 min not shown here a smaller βm implies slower decay of peak rainfall intensity which is reflected as a greater γ this would deplete a large portion of moisture and so the declining after τ tends to be rapid i e a greater βh see fig 4b therefore βh is positively related with γ for broken power law events the rainfall depth up to τ π τ indicates the depth of the concentrated storm in this regard we propose the proportion of π τ to the total rainfall depth p i e π τ p as another metric dimensionless to express the degree of rainfall concentration similar to γ as expected π τ p shows clear correlations with βm and βh i e an event with a high π τ p exhibits a small βm and a large βh fig 5b on the same token these metrics γ π τ p βm and βh exhibit the seasonal variation fig 6 south korea experiences strong seasonality in precipitation i e most intensive events are concentrated in summer june august such seasonality is reflected as a smaller βm and greater γ πτ p and βh in summer fig 6 it is found that the average of fitted power law exponent values β βm βh tend to vary with mit and mdt because storm events are differently selected depending on these criteria table 1 for a given mit βm tends to decrease i e less attenuation or persistence in intensity as a more rigid threshold of total depth greater mdt is chosen while the influence of mdt on β or βh is unclear as a longer mit is chosen ζ tends to increase the mean intensity i ζ tends to reduce and the fitted values of βm tend to increase these tendencies are considered reasonable in that a greater βm indicates the less concentration in table 1 βh tends to increase as a longer mit is chosen this trend may appear opposite to our argument described earlier with figs 5 and 6 however such a high βh is an artifact due to greater intermittences included in data as mit grows 4 3 implications for design storms the broken power law phenomenon can be an important reference for the determination of design storms it is noteworthy to revisit an old formula below during the era when high resolution rainfall record was rarely available a formula was proposed to estimate the maximum rainfall depth over hourly time scale w from a daily rainfall depth ζ fixed as 24 h as 6 π w π ζ ζ ζ w 2 3 w to the best of authors knowledge this formula first appears in mononobe 1933 later the formula has been utilized for an arbitrary duration ζ e g na and yoo 2018 in this sense equation 6 can be understood as a simple equation for rainfall downscaling it can also be considered as a design storm formula because it can be used to generate a series of rainfall intensity iw π w w for varying w in engineering practices design hyetograph is also generated by allocating the calculated series of iw following a unimodal distribution e g yoo et al 2015 an intriguing point is that the single power law model equation 3 is identical to this old formula rewriting equation 6 gives iw i ζ ζ2 3 w 2 3 which follows the single power law iw w β equation 3 with a fixed β in this regard our study provides certain observation based supports to this old method nevertheless mononobe formula has been known to overestimate peak rainfall intensity e g kang et al 2013 we claim that this overestimation problem is due to the nature of the single power law as this method was originally to estimate hourly scale rainfall intensity from daily rainfall depth the intra storm variability at finer timescale was beyond the focus our analysis utilizing 1 minute resolution data discovered the scale transition at sub hourly timescale which requires broken power law here we demonstrate the difference in the estimated peak intensity i 1 between the single power law mononobe equation 6 and the broken power law equation 4 for the real event shown in fig 4b the original hyetograph of this event shown in fig 7 a has i 1 1 3 mm min taking parameter values from the storm record ζ 565 min πζ 59 2 mm the mononobe equation 6 yields i 1 7 3 mm min significant overestimation to apply the broken power law equation 4 additional parameters are also taken from the observation β m 0 18 βh 0 48 τ 18 min i 1 generated by equation 4 is 0 9 mm min much closer to the record we also demonstrate synthetic hyetographs by allocating iw series calculated by equations 6 and 4 following unimodal distribution fig 7b and 7c although further study is necessary for design hyetographs we found these results promising so we suggest that using the broken power law model for design storm generation and allocating the outcome with multimodal distribution could provide a reasonable alternative for design hyetograph generation 5 concluding remarks in this study we report the scale free relationships within a storm expressed as the power law between the maximum rainfall intensity and a time window width we claim two kinds of single and broken power laws where most events in our study follows the latter berg et al 2013 showed distinct probability density functions between stratiform and convective storms we postulate that such difference is associated with single versus broken power laws reported here for broken power law events we identified two scaling exponents for segments separated at the transition time τ namely βm and βh whereas mostly βm βh we claim that the first segment up to τ is linked to the life of the convective storm cell in this regard τ could be critical for flood forecast purpose in our analysis with the korean data τ is about 17 min we also investigated any spatial patterns in the model parameters τ βm βh for 20 stations across south korea no statistically meaningful patterns are found yet and it needs further study with more data our findings carry not only scientific messages but also potential usefulness in engineering practices the scaling transition at sub hourly time scale shown as the broken power law explains the known issue of the mononobe formula i e the overestimation of the peak intensity when small time scale is used further the multi fractal nature shown here provides an opportunity for a better temporal downscaling of rainfall records in the context of changing climate rainfall characteristics are expected to change as well e g semenov and bengtsson 2002 trenberth et al 2003 many studies suggest that the extreme rainfall intensity would probably increase in accordance with the warmer climate lenderink and meijgaard 2008 kunkel et al 2013 prein et al 2017 naturally the intra storm variability is also subject to change under changing climate such change would be reflected in parameters of the proposed model it has been claimed that convective storms are sensitively affected by the temperature rise berg et al 2013 notably several studies that have estimated future changes in idf curves e g mailhot et al 2007 so et al 2017 suggested that rainfall intensity for a shorter duration is expected to increase further under the warmer climate compared to the case of a longer duration this implies that the gap between minute time scale βm and hourly time scale βh could be widen which could result in a greater decline after τ or greater βh credit

5146,the source region of the yangtze river sryr located on the eastern tibetan plateau is an essential part of the asian water tower and plays an important role in the downstream water resources significant changes in frozen ground caused by increases in air temperature have been widely reported in the past several decades which has greatly affected regional runoff this study evaluated the spatiotemporal variations in frozen ground and hydrological components by utilizing a geomorphology based eco hydrological model gbehm and investigated the reasons for runoff changes based on the budyko framework the results showed that the area with an elevation range of 4700 4800 m located in the permafrost region was the main source area of runoff generation from 1981 to 2015 compared with the permafrost region the seasonally frozen ground sfg region had a larger ratio of annual evapotranspiration to annual precipitation although the aridity indices in the two regions were very similar from 1981 to 2015 the mean value of the maximum frozen depth of sfg mfdsfg decreased by 12 3 cm 10 a and the mean value of the active layer thickness alt of permafrost increased by 4 2 cm 10 a the annual runoff in the sfg region decreased while that in the permafrost region increased runoff change was more sensitive to precipitation change in the higher altitude regions that were mainly covered by permafrost than in the lower altitude regions that were mainly covered by the sfg while the evapotranspiration change in the transition zone was more sensitive to climate change an abrupt change in the annual runoff time series was detected in 1989 2004 and 2004 in the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively and the annual runoff change from period 1 1981 to change point to period 2 change point 1 to 2015 were 25 7 mm 33 8 mm and 25 8 mm respectively frozen ground degradation contributed changes of 15 0 mm 8 8 mm and 11 6 mm to the annual runoff in the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively this result implied that frozen ground degradation had a negative impact on regional runoff in the sryr these findings deepen our understanding of frozen ground and its hydrological changes and are helpful for water resource management in the sryr keywords the source region of the yangtze river climate change frozen ground change runoff change distributed eco hydrological model 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp known as the asian water tower contains the headwaters of the yangtze river the yellow river the mekong river the brahmaputra river and many other asian rivers which supply water for approximately 1 4 billion people immerzeel et al 2010 frozen ground and glaciers are widely distributed on the tp due to its low air temperature liu et al 2015 ye et al 2013 in the past several decades the air temperature on the tp has risen more significantly than the average value in the northern hemisphere duan and xiao 2015 zhong et al 2011 under climate warming the tp has experienced significant changes including the decrease in ice storage and degradation of frozen ground cheng and jin 2013 kang et al 2010 the cryospheric changes have remarkably affected the hydrological processes and downstream water supply liu et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 due to the loss of glacier area a decrease in future runoff is projected despite an increase in rainfall immerzeel et al 2010 frozen ground degradation enlarges the soil storage capacity cuo et al 2015 niu et al 2011 qiu and jane 2012 and may account for the runoff decrease qiu and jane 2012 frozen ground has two main categories permafrost and seasonally frozen ground permafrost refers to the sub surface material with a temperature of less than or equal to 0 c during at least two consecutive years gruber 2012 while seasonally frozen ground refers to ground that freezes and thaws during a single year wang et al 2019 the frozen ground on the tp has undergone evident degradation and the area of permafrost has declined from 1 50 106 km2 in the 1970 s to 1 05 106 km2 in 2012 cheng and jin 2013 frozen ground degradation including the thickening of the active layer thickness alt of permafrost the thinning of the maximum frozen depth of the seasonally frozen ground mfdsfg and the degradation of permafrost into the seasonally frozen ground has considerable influences on the hydrological processes by changing the soil surface albedo enhancing the infiltration and enlarging the soil storage capacity cuo et al 2015 wang et al 2018b to analyze the frozen ground changes and hydrological changes previous studies widely utilized distributed hydrological models that considered the freezing thawing processes of frozen ground such as the variable infiltration capacity vic model cuo et al 2015 community land model clm oleson et al 2010 mke she bosson et al 2012 and water and energy budget based distributed hydrological model web dhm wang et al 2010 however most of these models regard frozen ground as a static layer or characterize flow routing with linear schemes therefore these models can hardly consider the dynamics of frozen ground and the associated hydrological processes qin et al 2017 yang et al 2015a and gao et al 2016 proposed a geomorphology based eco hydrological model gbehm that describes the details of flow routing and fully couples cryospheric processes with hydrological processes and this model has been successfully applied in many regions such as the upper heihe river basin hrb gao et al 2016 gao et al 2018 wang et al 2018b and the source region of the yellow river basin qin et al 2017 to simulate historical and future processes the yangtze river is the longest river in china discharges as much as 960 billion m3 into the east china sea and provides water for approximately 0 4 billion people within the watershed yang et al 2015b as one of the major rivers originating from the tp the source region of the yangtze river sryr is also widely covered with frozen ground and most of which is permafrost zou et al 2017 however the sryr has experienced frozen ground degradation and glacier retreat in recent decades guo and wang 2013 yao et al 2012 yao et al 2014 the runoff in the sryr significantly decreased from the 1980s to the 1990s and increased from the 1990s to the 2000s guo et al 2019 several studies have attempted to understand the cryospheric and hydrological changes in the sryr some studies cuo et al 2015 han et al 2019 liu et al 2009a zhao et al 2019 have illustrated the cryospheric changes in the sryr such as changes in snow and glaciers however these studies have rarely considered the total runoff change in the entire sryr some studies have investigated the reasons for runoff changes based on conceptual models guo et al 2019 liu et al 2019 however these studies ignored the influence of frozen ground change on runoff change in addition the sryr spans a large elevation range and has great spatial variations in terms of precipitation and air temperature trends liu et al 2009b which may result in variations in runoff changes among different elevation zones additionally because the sryr contains both permafrost and seasonally frozen ground the hydrological processes and responses to climate change may vary in the two regions due to the differences in the seasonal permeability freezing thawing processes and exchange processes between groundwater and the subsurface carey and debeer 2008 evans and ge 2017 hayashi 2013 distinguishing the hydrological changes among different elevations and between two regions with different types of frozen ground can enhance our understanding of the runoff change and the role of frozen ground on runoff change this study aims to clarify the spatiotemporal variations in frozen ground and hydrological components and the influences of frozen ground degradation on runoff change in the sryr over the past 35 years based on a distributed model gbehm the objectives of this study are to i evaluate the spatial variability of the hydrological components in the sryr during 1981 2015 ii distinguish the different hydrological responses to climate change and frozen ground change in different regions from 1981 to 2015 and iii quantitatively analyze the reasons for runoff changes in the seasonally frozen ground sfg region permafrost region and entire sryr with considering the possible influences of frozen ground in the results section section 4 the model is first validated and based on the simulations the long term average values of the hydrological components among different elevation zones and in different types of frozen ground regions are provided furthermore we illustrated the inter annual changes in frozen ground and hydrological components in the sryr and assessed the different hydrological responses to climate change and frozen ground change in different elevation zones and the two types of frozen ground regions finally we quantitatively analyzed the reasons for runoff changes in the different types of regions with considering the influences of frozen ground change 2 study area and data 2 1 source region of the yangtze river the sryr of which the outlet is the zhimenda hydrological station fig 1 originates from the hinterland of the tp and covers an area of 137 704 km2 guo et al 2019 the sryr is located at elevations ranging from 3500 m to 6600 m with a mean value of 4760 m and it is low lying from the west to the east jarvis et al 2008 due to the high altitude and low air temperature the composition of the study area is 80 permafrost region and 20 sfg region zou et al 2017 and glaciers are widely distributed at elevations above 5500 m fig 1 from 1981 to 2015 the mean annual precipitation in the sryr was approximately 400 mm shen and xiong 2016 and the mean annual discharge at the zhimenda station was approximately 13 8 billion m3 most of the precipitation evaporated in the sryr of which the runoff coefficient i e the ratio of the mean annual runoff to the mean annual precipitation was only approximately 0 20 from 1986 to 2009 yao et al 2014 2 2 data the forcing data

spatially interpolated from gauge observations using the climatology based optimal method provided by shen and xiong 2016 based on the angular distance weighting method which considers the change in temperature with elevation yang et al 2004 the observations of other climatic data were spatially interpolated to produce 2 5 km gridded datasets based on the daily climatic data hourly forcing data were estimated using specific algorithms details of these algorithms can be found in gao et al 2016 the digital elevation model dem with a resolution of 90 m used in this study was obtained from the

station during 1981 2015 were used the observations of frozen ground depth at two cma meteorological stations qumalai and zhiduo in the study area which were manually measured by a standard frozen soil apparatus buried in the meteorological field were available during 1982 2015 and 1981 2015 respectively the distribution map of permafrost on the tp produced by zou et al 2017 which was developed using the temperature at the top of the permafrost model based on in situ observations and modis lst was utilized for the validation of the permafrost distribution simulated by the model the global land evapotranspiration amsterdam model gleam a global dataset with a resolution of 0 25 was used to evaluate the rationality of the simulations this global evapotranspiration product first calculated the potential evapotranspiration based on the priestley taylor approach with the reanalysis data and satellite based data as input information and then multiplied the potential evapotranspiration by a stress factor s ranging between 0 and 1 to obtain the actual evapotranspiration martens et al 2017 3 methods 3 1 model description and evaluation this study employed the gbehm to simulate the eco hydrological changes in the sryr gao et al 2016 the gbehm uses a sub grid parameterization approach to describe the topography yang et al 2015a each grid is represented by a number of hillslope valley systems hillslope is the basic unit of the eco hydrological simulation which includes water and heat transfers in the vegetation canopy snow glacier and soil layers gao et al 2018 the water flow pathways on a hillslope include surface sub surface and groundwater yang et al 2015a in this study the catchment was discretized by a 2 5 km grid system and divided into 261 sub catchments soil freezing and thawing processes in the model are calculated based on the energy balance in the soil layer gao et al 2018 the energy balance equation is as follows 1 c s t t ρ i l f θ i t z λ s t z ρ l

is the energy from rainfall w m 2 more details of the model can be found in gao et al 2016 snowmelt is another important constituent of runoff in cold regions han et al 2019 qi et al 2019 wang et al 2017 in the model snow cover is divided into multiple layers the number of snow layers and the thickness of each layer is a function of snow depth oleson et al 2010 snow processes are simulated using mass and energy balance methods of which the physical schemes are similar to those of the sntherm model jordan 1991 snowpack model bartelt and lehning 2002 and crocus model vionnet et al 2012 the solar radiation transfer in the snow layers and the snow albedo are simulated using the snow ice and aerosol radiation snicar model flanner et al 2007 more details can be found in gao et al 2018 and li et al 2019 the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation s t w is calculated based on the equations advised by sughya 1991 3 s t w 1 0 5 exp 2 2 1 1 t w 1 3 t w 1 1 c 0 5 exp 2 2 1 1 t w 1 3 t w 1 1 c the wet bulb temperature t w is calculated as follows 4 t w 0 584 t a 0 875 e 5 32 where t a is the mean air temperature and e is the water vapor pressure at the temperate of t w we used the observed runoff to calibrate the model the main parameters that needed to be manually calibrated included the slope of the river channel cross section and the saturated hydraulic conductivity at the surface and bottom after calibration we evaluated the performance in simulating river discharge frozen ground and evapotranspiration the simulated frozen ground depth was validated using the site observations and the simulated et was evaluated with the et from gleam we chose the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias as indicators of measuring the model performance in terms of simulating river discharge moriasi et al 2007 the r2 and root mean square error rmse were utilized to evaluate the model performance in terms of the frozen ground and evapotranspiration simulations these evaluation indicators are defined as follows 5 nse 1 t 1 t r t obs r t sim 2 t 1 t r t obs r obs 2 6 pbias t 1 t r t obs r t sim t 1 t r t obs 7 r 2 1 t 1 t r t

r obs is the average value of the observed runoff during time period t 3 2 abrupt change detection this study used order cluster analysis to detect abrupt change in the annual runoff time series the order cluster analysis explores the possible change point by miming the sum of squares of deviations before and after a specific year liu et al 2019 v t the sum of squares of deviations divided by the year t is calculated as follows huang 1995 9 v t i 1 t r i r 1 i t 1 n r i r 2 where r i is the runoff in year i and r 1 and r 2 are the average values before and after year t respectively the year when the value of v t reaches the minimum is the possible change point to verify the possible change point the t test was utilized to test whether there was a significant difference in the mean values before and after the possible change point the formula for the t test is as follows zheng et al 2007 10 t x 1 x 2 i s 1 n 1 1 n 2 11 s n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 where x i s and n i are the mean standard variation and size of the two independent samples i 1 2 respectively the degree of freedom in the t test is n 1 n 2 2 if the calculated t value is larger than the critical value t α the point can be accepted as a change point at the significance level of α the degree of freedom is 33 and α is 0 05 in this study therefore the critical value is 2 04 3 3 runoff change analysis based on the budyko framework in addition to the numerical simulations we employed the budyko framework to quantify the regional runoff change caused by precipitation potential evapotranspiration and frozen ground degradation the budyko framework states that the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation can be written as a function of the aridity index the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation at the mean annual time scale budyko 1974 the expression of the budyko framework obtained empirically by choudhury 1999 and derived analytically by yang et al 2008 is as follows 12 e p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n where e is the mean annual actual evapotranspiration p is the mean annual precipitation e0 is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration and parameter n represents the catchment characteristics yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 which are also related to precipitation intensity and seasonality donohue et al 2012 milly 1994 combining eq 12 with the long term water balance equation the runoff can be written as follows 13 r p p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n o r r p 1 e 0 p n 1 1 n based on the concept of climate elasticity xu et al 2014 yang and yang 2011 zheng et al 2009 the precipitation elasticity of runoff is defined as ε p dr r dp p and the potential evapotranspiration elasticity of runoff ε e 0 and the catchment landscape characteristic elasticity of runoff ε n are defined as ε e 0 dr r d e 0 e 0 and ε n dr r dn n respectively therefore to understand the causes the runoff change can be written as follows 14 δ r ε p δ p p r ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 r ε n δ n n r the equations for calculating the elasticities of runoff can be found in xu et al 2014 the parameter n is estimated based on the mean annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff using eq 13 in this study e 0 was calculated with the penman monteith equation recommended by the fao allen et al 1998 frozen ground degradation may affect parameter n by changing the landscape conditions and influencing the hydraulic characteristics such as water storage niu et al 2016 wang et al 2018a and soil water content walvoord and kurylyk 2016 in addition parameter n may be influenced by vegetation coverage zhang et al 2016 rainfall intensity and snowfall proportion donohue et al 2012 milly 1994 zhang et al 2015 therefore parameter n can be estimated as follows 15 n a i v i b where n is the parameter of the budyko curve v i is the explanatory variable a i is the regression coefficient and b is the intercept we considered the lai snowfall proportion rainfall intensity and frozen ground depth alt in the permafrost region and the sryr and maximum frozen depth in the sfg region as possible explanatory factors and utilized the stepwise regression method to find variables with significant influences on parameter n by spss version 20 0 software the alt of the permafrost was used to indicate the frozen ground in the sryr because most of the basin was covered with permafrost the change in parameter n caused by the frozen ground change from period 1 to period 2 can be estimated as follows 16 δ n f f alt m f d s f g a 2 f alt m f d s f g a 1 when establishing the regression equations by spss forward selection and backward elimination were combined in the forward selection the variable with the smallest p value p 0 05 of f testing was first selected then the variable in the remaining candidate variables with the smallest p value p 0 05 of partial f testing taking into account variables already in the model was selected and this step was repeated until no p value of remaining candidate variables was smaller than 0 05 in backward elimination after adding one more variable the variable with a p value of f testing larger than 0 10 was removed from the regression equation 4 results 4 1 validation of the hydrological model fig 2 shows the comparison of the simulated monthly runoff and the observations at the zhimenda station from 1981 to 1990 calibration period and from 1991 to 2015 validation period the nse r2 and pbias values for the calibration period were 0 83 0 92 and 2 1 respectively and for the validation period were 0 86 0 94 and 4 3 which indicated good performance these results indicated that the simulated monthly river discharge generally reproduced the variations in the observations fig 3 shows the time series of the simulated and observed monthly frozen ground depths at two cma meteorological stations i e zhiduo and qumalai and the comparison of monthly evapotranspiration from gleam and gbehm at the basin scale during the period of 1981 2015 comparisons between the monthly et from gleam and gbhm at the grid scale are shown in fig s2 in the supplementary material the et from gbehm and gleam were consistent with the rmse value of 8 mm and r2 value of 0 95 at the basin scale and the means of the spatial distributions of r2 rmse and pbias values were 0 82 12 10 mm and 8 respectively there was good agreement between the simulated frozen ground depth and observations i e the r2 and rmse values were 0 96 and 22 mm at the zhiduo station and 0 91 and 37 mm at the qumalai station respectively this result meant that the simulations successfully captured the observed freezing and thawing processes of frozen ground fig 4 represents the distribution of permafrost and seasonally frozen ground in different periods and the area degraded from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground during the two periods the distribution map of the frozen ground types during 2001 2015 was generally consistent with the previous permafrost map of the tp zou et al 2017 the simulated permafrost area during 2001 2015 was 108 940 km2 which was very close to the value of 108 490 km2 calculated from zou s map therefore the performance of the distributed model gbehm in simulating the monthly river discharge monthly evapotranspiration and frozen ground depth was generally acceptable for the further analysis of hydrological process changes frozen ground changes and interaction between them in the study area 4 2 spatial variability of water balance components generally the mean annual precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and runoff coefficient during 1981 2015 decreased from southeast to northwest as shown in fig 5 annual precipitation ranged from 236 mm to 687 mm with a mean value of 414 mm and a standard deviation value of 82 mm while the annual actual evapotranspiration was between 11 mm and 481 mm with a mean value of 321 mm and a standard deviation value of 47 mm the range of annual runoff was 7 905 mm and the mean value and standard deviation value were 96 mm and 87 mm respectively the annual runoff coefficient the ratio of runoff to precipitation in one grid was between 0 02 and 2 20 and the mean value and standard deviation value were 0 21 and 0 16 respectively the runoff coefficient in some glacier regions was greater than 1 which was due to significant glacier retreat 4 2 1 changes in the water balance components with elevation the changes in the area runoff volume mean annual precipitation actual evapotranspiration runoff and runoff coefficient with elevation are shown in fig 6 as the elevation rose the precipitation in the study area initially increased and then decreased with a minimum value achieved at elevations of 4500 m 4600 m while the actual evapotranspiration always decreased the runoff slightly initially decreased and then increased with a minimum value achieved at elevations of 4400 4500 m combined with the area distribution the runoff volume was largest in the elevation range of 4700 4800 m which was mainly located in the permafrost region fig 6 shows that the runoff coefficient remained approximately stable below 4500 m but showed an increasing trend with increasing elevation above 4500 m from the distributions of the frozen ground types shown in fig 4 4500 m was approximately the lower boundary between permafrost and the sfg therefore runoff generation may differ in different types of frozen ground which will be discussed in the next section 4 2 2 differences in water balance components between permafrost and seasonally frozen ground regions table 1 shows the long term average hydrological components in the sfg region and permafrost region the sfg region was derived from the distribution map in fig 4 a and the permafrost region was derived from that in fig 4 b the mean annual precipitation was similar in the two types of regions however the sfg region produced much less runoff than the permafrost region the ratios of annual potential evapotranspiration to precipitation aridity index in the sfg region and permafrost region were very close at 1 86 and 1 87 respectively since the aridity indices were nearly 2 the actual evapotranspiration in the two regions was controlled by available water although the aridity indices in the two regions were close the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation was remarkably larger in the sfg region one of the possible causes for this difference is that a larger proportion of precipitation transformed into liquid soil water in the sfg region which provided more available water for evapotranspiration and thus induced a larger evapotranspiration intensity more vegetation coverage higher lai in the sfg region may have also resulted in a larger proportion of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation as shown in fig s3 the changes in lai and temperature showed increasing trends with increasing elevation the influence of temperature has been considered in the calculation of potential evapotranspiration 4 3 inter annual changes in the frozen ground and hydrological components from 1981 to 2015 4 3 1 trend of frozen ground change the area of the permafrost region was 113 580 km2 during 1981 1990 while it declined to 108 940 km2 during 2001 2015 fig 4 the zones where permafrost was transformed into sfg accounted for 3 3 of the total area and were mainly distributed in elevation ranges between 4300 m and 4700 m which was also the junction between permafrost and sfg as shown in fig 7 the mean value of the alt was approximately 2 0 m and the mean value of mfdsfg was approximately 2 1 m fig 7 shows that the alt of the permafrost increased significantly at the 0 05 level at a rate of 4 2 cm 10 a and the mfdsfg had a significantly decreasing trend at a rate of 12 3 cm 10 a which showed a degradation trend of the frozen ground in the sryr as shown in fig 8 a the deepening rate of the alt decreased with elevation while the shallowing rate of the mfdsfg increased with elevation indicating that the transition zone of permafrost and sfg experienced more obvious degradation wang et al 2019 4 3 2 inter annual changes in water balance components fig 9 shows the inter annual variations in the hydrological components in the entire sryr from 1981 to 2015 the mean air temperature rose rapidly at a rate of 0 60 c 10 a and increased by 2 1 c in total during the study period an increasing rate of 25 5 mm 10 a was found for the annual precipitation the observed annual runoff also had an overall increasing trend at a rate of 5 7 mm 10 a although it had a decreasing trend from the 1980 s to the 1990 s the runoff coefficient decreased at a rate of 0 002 10 a the consistency between the blue dotted line and blue solid line in fig 9 b indicates that the simulated annual runoff had a similar increasing rate 6 2 mm 10 a with the observations and thus was reliable in terms of representing the changing trend of runoff in the study area the simulated annual et increased significantly at a rate of 16 6 mm 10 a which was likely a result of the increase in precipitation and the sharp increase in air temperature as shown in table 2 over the past 35 years the precipitation and evapotranspiration both significantly increased at a significance level of 0 1 in most elevation zones runoff in higher altitude regions 4400 m increased while that in lower elevations 4400 m decreased fig 8 b shows the regression coefficients α β γ between runoff and precipitation r p and between et and precipitation et p temperature et t which were estimated as r α p a et β p b and et γ t c the regression coefficients between et and p β and between et and t γ had the same pattern in terms of varying with elevation the regression coefficient between runoff and temperature was not significant this result suggested that runoff change was more sensitive to precipitation change in the higher altitude regions mainly covered by permafrost than in the lower altitude regions mainly covered by sfg in the transition zone of permafrost into sfg the regression coefficients of et t and et p reached their maximum values which implied that the evapotranspiration change in the transition zone was more sensitive to climate change in addition the results indicated that the precipitation increase had a greater influence on runoff than on evapotranspiration in most elevation zones with a larger regression coefficient of r p than et p regarding the different types of frozen ground regions the precipitation and evapotranspiration in the sfg region and permafrost region both showed increasing trends as shown in fig 10 a smaller rate of precipitation increase and a greater rate of evapotranspiration increase were found in the sfg region the runoff in the permafrost region increased while that in the sfg region decreased the difference in runoff changes between the two types of regions was generally consistent with that at different elevation ranges 4 4 frozen ground change impacts on regional runoff based on the numerical simulation results the runoff coefficient decreased in the lower altitude regions but increased in the higher altitude regions while the aridity index decreased in all elevation zones as shown in fig 8 c this result indicates that the runoff coefficient change in the higher elevation regions was more directly related to climate change while other factors influenced the change in the runoff coefficient in the lower elevation regions from eq 13 we can see that the runoff coefficient is influenced by both the aridity index e 0 p and parameter n a larger parameter n will contribute to the decrease in the runoff coefficient while a decrease in the aridity index will inhibit the decrease in the runoff coefficient in addition the glacier retreat may influence the runoff coefficient in the higher altitude regions by the stepwise regression method the linear regression equations between parameter n and the explanatory variables in the sfg region eq 17 permafrost region eq 18 and the sryr eq 19 are shown as follows 17 n 1 300 m f d s f g 4 469 18 n 1 102 a l t 0 929 19 n 1 518 a l t 1 710 the r2 values in the sfg region permafrost region and sryr were 0 60 0 48 and 0 65 respectively see fig s4 all three models were significant p value 0 05 although the results showed that only the alt and mfdsfg were significantly related to parameter n it is worth noting that the changes in the alt and mfdsfg also reflected the combined influences of climate and underlying conditions such as lai and snowfall regarding the annual runoff time series an abrupt change was detected in 1989 2004 and 2004 for the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively see fig 11 the statistical t values between the two subsamples before and after the possible change points were 3 0 3 0 and 2 7 in the three regions respectively all of which were larger than the critical value t 0 05 2 04 based on the change point in each region the study period was divided into two sub periods period 1 1981 to change point and period 2 change point 1 to 2015 table 3 shows the long term parameter n and precipitation potential evapotranspiration and parameter n elasticities of runoff in different regions the sfg had a larger parameter n and a smaller runoff coefficient than those of the permafrost region as precipitation elasticity presented an inverse relationship with the runoff coefficient chiew et al 2006 zheng et al 2009 the sfg had the greatest precipitation elasticity based on the elasticities in the entire sryr the runoff will increase by 1 32 when the precipitation increases by 1 the runoff changes from period 1 to period 2 were 25 7 mm 33 8 mm and 25 8 mm in the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively table 4 as shown in table 4 climate change changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration contributed 101 and 126 to the runoff increase in the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively of which the precipitation change contributed most of the increase parameter n contributed 90 of the runoff decrease in the sfg region combined with the mean alt and mfdsfg in the two periods the changes in parameter n caused by frozen ground degradation were 0 22 0 08 and 0 10 in the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively therefore frozen ground degradation contributed changes of 15 0 mm 8 8 mm and 11 6 mm to the annual runoff which accounted for 63 26 and 45 of the runoff change respectively 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of the frozen ground change with previous studies the simulated average alt in our study was 2 0 m which was similar to the value of 2 01 m reported by guo and wang 2013 the comparisons of frozen ground change in our study with the results of previous studies and observations of meteorological stations are shown in table 5 our study simulated a smaller change rate 0 04 m 10 a than the average value 0 15 m 10 a on the tp reported by guo and wang 2013 similarly oelke and zhang 2007 simulated an increasing trend of 0 14 m 10 a in the alt in the northern tp from 1980 to 2001 in addition to the different study periods and different forcing data using for the models the differences between the permafrost degradation rate in our study and those in the previous studies are related to the spatial heterogeneity of permafrost changes on the tp the degradation rate of the permafrost in the sryr was probably slower than the average value on the tp for the change rates of the mfdsfg our results were close to the observations at two meteorological stations zhiduo and qumalai table 5 compared with previous studies our study focused on the sryr with a higher resolution and study successfully distinguished the distribution of sfg and investigated its maximum frozen depth changes whereas previous studies mainly investigated the permafrost changes in this region guo and wang 2013 oelke and zhang 2007 several previous studies have investigated hydrological changes and found that precipitation was the dominant factor affecting runoff change in this region e g yao et al 2014 based on an empirical relationship liu et al 2019 based on the budyko framework and guo et al 2019 based on a grid based hydrological model in our study the gbehm which considers soil freezing and thawing processes was used to reproduce the hydrological processes and found that the influence of frozen ground degradation was an important factor in addition to the precipitation moreover this study illustrated the different hydrological responses to climate change in the sfg region and permafrost region which deepened our understanding of the hydrological processes in cold regions 5 2 runoff change in the sryr 5 2 1 impacts of frozen ground on runoff change the results showed that the sfg region had a larger ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation and a larger parameter n of the budyko curve than the permafrost region the evapotranspiration had a larger change with temperature and precipitation change in the transition zone therefore the degradation of permafrost to sfg might intensify evapotranspiration and reduce the available water resources in the sryr which should serve as a warning to other river source areas originating from the tp under climate change as shown in eqs 17 19 the positive negative relationship between the alt mfdsfg and parameter n quantitatively proved a negative effect of frozen ground degradation on runoff previous studies on the tp niu et al 2016 qiu and jane 2012 wang et al 2018a also found that frozen ground degradation might decrease runoff by enhancing infiltration and enlarging the water storage capacity which was supported by meng et al 2019 in which an increase in water storage from 2003 to 2014 was found based on grace satellite data in this area 5 2 2 impacts of other factors on runoff change as shown in fig 1 a the sryr was mainly covered by grassland and bare land the results in section 4 4 showed that the impact of the lai on runoff change was limited in the sryr probably because of the sparse vegetation in the sryr snowmelt and glacier melt were other factors that affected the runoff both glacier runoff and snowmelt runoff showed increasing trends from 1981 to 2015 fig s5 the impact of the amount of snowfall on runoff has been included in the amount of precipitation by the budyko framework additionally parameter n was not significantly related to the snowfall proportion from results in section 4 3 since glaciers covered only approximately 0 95 of the sryr guo et al 2019 glacial runoff and its impact on runoff change was relatively small the mean annual glacial runoff values during 1981 2004 and 2005 2015 were 5 9 mm and 6 3 mm respectively representing a difference of 0 4 mm although the glacier retreat contributed to the runoff increase in at higher altitudes the glacier area decrease induced by continuous retreat may lead to a decrease in glacial runoff in the future zhao et al 2019 5 3 uncertainty in the numerical simulation in this study the numerical simulations by the gbehm may have uncertainties including the meteorological data used as the model inputs which were interpolated spatially from a limited number of stations the parameters of the vegetation and the soil and the structure and physics of the eco hydrological model the meteorological stations available in the study area are located at elevations below 4700 m the interpolation of air temperature based on the elevation gradient obtained from the low elevation region may not be the same in the high elevation region satellite remote sensing can be useful in areas lacking ground observations especially on the tp zheng et al 2019 and this method will be used in future studies 6 conclusions this study used a process based distributed eco hydrological model to simulate the spatiotemporal variations in frozen ground and hydrological components based on the numerical simulations and the budyko framework we systematically evaluated the joint impacts of frozen ground degradation and climate change on runoff in the sryr based on the results the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 based on long term simulations from 1981 to 2015 the runoff slightly initially decreased and then increased with rising elevation the permafrost region with an elevation range of 4700 4800 m was the main source area of runoff in the sryr the runoff coefficient showed an increasing trend with increasing elevation above 4500 m which was approximately the lower boundary between the permafrost and sfg 2 from 1981 to 2015 the mfdsfg decreased at a rate of 12 3 cm 10 a while the alt of permafrost had an increasing rate of 4 2 cm 10 a the observed runoff showed an increasing trend of 5 7 mm 10 a however the runoff coefficient decreased by 0 002 10 a 3 the deepening rate of the alt decreased with elevation while the shallowing rate of the mfdsfg increased with elevation the annual runoff in the sfg region decreased while that in the permafrost region increased runoff change was more sensitive to precipitation change in the higher altitude regions that were mainly covered by permafrost than the lower altitude regions that were mainly covered by seasonally frozen ground while the evapotranspiration change in the transition zone was more sensitive to climate change 4 an abrupt change in the annual runoff time series was detected in 1989 2004 and 2004 in the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively and the annual runoff change from period 1 1981 to change point to period 2 change point 1 to 2015 were 25 7 mm 33 8 mm and 25 8 mm respectively frozen ground degradation contributed changes of 15 0 mm 8 8 mm and 11 6 mm to the annual runoff in the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively these findings highlight the different runoff changes and causes in the sfg region and permafrost region this study provides a better understanding of the hydrological processes in a warming climate in terms of permafrost degradation the results of this study may provide guidelines for decision makers to formulate sustainable strategies for water resource management under climate change in the qinghai tibet

5146,the source region of the yangtze river sryr located on the eastern tibetan plateau is an essential part of the asian water tower and plays an important role in the downstream water resources significant changes in frozen ground caused by increases in air temperature have been widely reported in the past several decades which has greatly affected regional runoff this study evaluated the spatiotemporal variations in frozen ground and hydrological components by utilizing a geomorphology based eco hydrological model gbehm and investigated the reasons for runoff changes based on the budyko framework the results showed that the area with an elevation range of 4700 4800 m located in the permafrost region was the main source area of runoff generation from 1981 to 2015 compared with the permafrost region the seasonally frozen ground sfg region had a larger ratio of annual evapotranspiration to annual precipitation although the aridity indices in the two regions were very similar from 1981 to 2015 the mean value of the maximum frozen depth of sfg mfdsfg decreased by 12 3 cm 10 a and the mean value of the active layer thickness alt of permafrost increased by 4 2 cm 10 a the annual runoff in the sfg region decreased while that in the permafrost region increased runoff change was more sensitive to precipitation change in the higher altitude regions that were mainly covered by permafrost than in the lower altitude regions that were mainly covered by the sfg while the evapotranspiration change in the transition zone was more sensitive to climate change an abrupt change in the annual runoff time series was detected in 1989 2004 and 2004 in the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively and the annual runoff change from period 1 1981 to change point to period 2 change point 1 to 2015 were 25 7 mm 33 8 mm and 25 8 mm respectively frozen ground degradation contributed changes of 15 0 mm 8 8 mm and 11 6 mm to the annual runoff in the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively this result implied that frozen ground degradation had a negative impact on regional runoff in the sryr these findings deepen our understanding of frozen ground and its hydrological changes and are helpful for water resource management in the sryr keywords the source region of the yangtze river climate change frozen ground

river the brahmaputra river and many other asian rivers which supply water for approximately 1 4 billion people immerzeel et al 2010 frozen ground and glaciers are widely distributed on the tp due to its low air temperature liu et al 2015 ye et al 2013 in the past several decades the air temperature on the tp has risen more significantly than the average value in the northern hemisphere duan and xiao 2015 zhong et al 2011 under climate warming the tp has experienced significant changes including the decrease in ice storage and degradation of frozen ground cheng and jin 2013 kang et al 2010 the cryospheric changes have remarkably affected the hydrological processes and downstream water supply liu et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 due to the loss of glacier area a decrease in future runoff is projected despite an increase in rainfall immerzeel et al 2010 frozen ground degradation enlarges the soil storage capacity cuo et al 2015 niu et al 2011 qiu and jane 2012 and may account for the runoff decrease qiu and jane 2012 frozen ground has two main categories permafrost and seasonally frozen ground permafrost refers to the sub surface material with a temperature of less than or equal to 0 c during at least two consecutive years gruber 2012 while seasonally frozen ground refers to ground that freezes and thaws during a single year wang et al 2019 the frozen ground on the tp has undergone evident degradation and the area of permafrost has declined from 1 50 106 km2 in the 1970 s to 1 05 106 km2 in 2012 cheng and jin 2013 frozen ground degradation including the thickening of the active layer thickness alt of permafrost the thinning of the maximum frozen depth of the seasonally frozen ground mfdsfg and the degradation of permafrost into the seasonally frozen ground has considerable influences on the hydrological processes by changing the soil surface albedo enhancing the infiltration and enlarging the soil storage capacity cuo et al 2015 wang et al 2018b to analyze the frozen ground changes and hydrological changes previous studies widely utilized distributed hydrological models that considered the freezing thawing processes of frozen ground such as the variable infiltration capacity vic model cuo et al 2015 community land model clm oleson et al 2010 mke she bosson et al 2012 and water and energy budget based distributed hydrological model web dhm wang et al 2010 however most of these models regard frozen ground as a static layer or characterize flow routing with linear schemes therefore these models can hardly consider the dynamics of frozen ground and the associated hydrological processes qin et al 2017 yang et al 2015a and gao et al 2016 proposed a geomorphology based eco hydrological model gbehm that describes the details of flow routing and fully couples cryospheric processes with hydrological processes and this model has been successfully applied in many regions such as the upper heihe river basin hrb gao et al 2016 gao et al 2018 wang et al 2018b and the source region of the yellow river basin qin et al 2017 to simulate historical and future processes the yangtze river is the longest river in china discharges as much as 960 billion m3 into the east china sea and provides water for approximately 0 4 billion people within the watershed yang et al 2015b as one of the major rivers originating from the tp the source region of the yangtze river sryr is also widely covered with frozen ground and most of which is permafrost zou et al 2017 however the sryr has experienced frozen ground degradation and glacier retreat in recent decades guo and wang 2013 yao et al 2012 yao et al 2014 the runoff in the sryr significantly decreased from the 1980s to the 1990s and increased from the 1990s to the 2000s guo et al 2019 several studies have attempted to understand the cryospheric and hydrological changes in the sryr some studies cuo et al 2015 han et al 2019 liu et al 2009a zhao et al 2019 have illustrated the cryospheric changes in the sryr such as changes in snow and glaciers however these studies have rarely considered the total runoff change in the entire sryr some studies have investigated the reasons for runoff changes based on conceptual models guo et al 2019 liu et al 2019 however these studies ignored the influence of frozen ground change on runoff change in addition the sryr spans a large elevation range and has great spatial variations in terms of precipitation and air temperature trends liu et al 2009b which may result in variations in runoff changes among different elevation zones additionally because the sryr contains both permafrost and seasonally frozen ground the hydrological processes and responses to climate change may vary in the two regions due to the differences in the seasonal permeability freezing thawing processes and exchange processes between groundwater and the subsurface carey and debeer 2008 evans and ge 2017 hayashi 2013 distinguishing the hydrological changes among different elevations and between two regions with different types of frozen ground can enhance our understanding of the runoff change and the role of frozen ground on runoff change this study aims to clarify the spatiotemporal variations in frozen ground and hydrological components and the influences of frozen ground degradation on runoff change in the sryr over the past 35 years based on a distributed model gbehm the objectives of this study are to i evaluate the spatial variability of the hydrological components in the sryr during 1981 2015 ii distinguish the different hydrological responses to climate change and frozen ground change in different regions from 1981 to 2015 and iii quantitatively analyze the reasons for runoff changes in the seasonally frozen ground sfg region permafrost region and entire sryr with considering the possible influences of frozen ground in the results section section 4 the model is first validated and based on the simulations the long term average values of the hydrological components among different elevation zones and in different types of frozen ground regions are provided furthermore we illustrated the inter annual changes in frozen ground and hydrological components in the sryr and assessed the different hydrological responses to climate change and frozen ground change in different elevation zones and the two types of frozen ground regions finally we quantitatively analyzed the reasons for runoff changes in the different types of regions with considering the influences of frozen ground change 2 study area and data 2 1 source region of the yangtze river the sryr of which the outlet is the zhimenda hydrological station fig 1 originates from the hinterland of the tp and covers an area of 137 704 km2 guo et al 2019 the sryr is located at elevations ranging from 3500 m to 6600 m with a mean value of 4760 m and it is low lying from the west to the east jarvis et al 2008 due to the high altitude and low air temperature the composition of the study area is 80 permafrost region and 20 sfg region zou et al 2017 and glaciers are widely distributed at elevations above 5500 m fig 1 from 1981 to 2015 the mean annual precipitation in the sryr was approximately 400 mm shen and xiong 2016 and the mean annual discharge at the zhimenda station was approximately 13 8 billion m3 most of the precipitation evaporated in the sryr of which the runoff coefficient i e the ratio of the mean annual runoff to the mean annual precipitation was only approximately 0 20 from 1986 to 2009 yao et al 2014 2 2 data the forcing data

humidity daily mean wind speed and daily sunshine duration from 16 meteorological stations within or around the study area were utilized in this study the gridded daily precipitation data were spatially interpolated from gauge observations using the climatology based optimal method provided by shen and xiong 2016 based on the angular distance weighting method which considers the change in temperature with elevation yang et al 2004 the observations of other climatic data were spatially interpolated to produce 2 5 km gridded datasets based on the daily climatic data hourly forcing data

radiation absorbed by vegetation fpar and the leaf area index lai were obtained from the lai3g and fpar3g datasets which were developed by zhu et al 2013 based on the 3rd generation of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi3g of the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms for the model calibration and validation the river discharge data collected at the zhimenda hydrological station during 1981 2015 were used the observations of frozen ground depth at two cma meteorological stations qumalai and zhiduo in the study area which were manually measured by a standard frozen soil apparatus buried in the meteorological field were available during 1982 2015 and 1981 2015 respectively the distribution map of permafrost on the tp produced by zou et al 2017 which was developed using the temperature at the top of the permafrost model based on in situ observations and modis lst was utilized for the validation of the permafrost distribution simulated by the model the global land evapotranspiration amsterdam model gleam a global dataset with a resolution of 0 25 was used to evaluate the rationality of the simulations this global evapotranspiration product first calculated the potential evapotranspiration based on the priestley taylor approach with the reanalysis data and satellite based data as input information and then multiplied the potential evapotranspiration by a stress factor s ranging between 0 and 1 to obtain the actual evapotranspiration martens et al 2017 3 methods 3 1 model description and evaluation this study employed the gbehm to simulate the eco hydrological changes in the sryr gao et al 2016 the gbehm uses a sub grid parameterization approach to describe the topography yang et al 2015a each grid is represented by a number of hillslope valley systems hillslope is the basic unit of the eco hydrological simulation which includes water and heat transfers in the vegetation canopy snow glacier and soil layers gao et al 2018 the water flow pathways on a hillslope include surface sub surface and groundwater yang et al 2015a in this study the catchment was discretized by a 2 5 km grid system and divided into 261 sub catchments soil freezing and thawing processes in the model are calculated based on the energy balance in the soil layer gao et al 2018 the energy balance equation is as follows 1 c s t t ρ i l f θ i t z λ s t z ρ l c l q l t z 0 where c s is the volumetric soil heat capacity j m 3 k 1 t is the temperature k of the soil layers t is the time s z is the vertical depth of the soil m ρ i is the density of ice kg m 3

kg 1 k 1 and q l is the water flux between different soil layers m s 1 which can be calculated using the 1 d vertical richards equation the soil column in the model is divided into 39 layers vertically gao et al 2018 fig s1 the soil from 1 to 3 m is finely subdivided because the values of the alt of permafrost and the mfdsfg are approximately in this scope based on observations and previous studies guo and wang 2013 the depth of 50 m is defined as the lower boundary of the heat flux the process of glacier melting is described by an energy balance equation gao et al 2018 2 q m s

2017 in the model snow cover is divided into multiple layers the number of snow layers and the thickness of each layer is a function of snow depth oleson et al 2010 snow processes are simulated using mass and energy balance methods of which the physical schemes are similar to those of the sntherm model jordan 1991 snowpack model bartelt and lehning 2002 and crocus model vionnet et al 2012 the solar radiation transfer in the snow layers and the snow albedo are simulated using the snow ice and aerosol radiation snicar model flanner et al 2007 more details can be found in gao et al 2018 and li et al 2019 the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation s t w is calculated based on the equations advised by sughya 1991 3 s t w 1 0 5 exp 2 2 1 1 t w 1 3 t w 1 1 c 0 5 exp 2 2 1 1 t w 1 3 t w 1 1 c the wet bulb temperature t w is calculated as follows 4 t w 0 584 t a 0 875 e 5 32 where t a is the mean air temperature and e is the water vapor pressure at the temperate of t w we used the observed runoff to calibrate the model the main parameters that needed to be manually calibrated included the slope of the river channel cross section and the saturated hydraulic conductivity at the surface and bottom after calibration we evaluated the performance in simulating river discharge frozen ground and evapotranspiration the simulated frozen ground depth was validated using the site observations and the simulated et was evaluated with the et from gleam we chose the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias as indicators of measuring the model performance in terms of simulating river discharge moriasi et al 2007 the r2 and root mean square error rmse were utilized to evaluate the model performance in terms of the frozen ground and evapotranspiration simulations these evaluation indicators are defined as follows 5 nse 1 t 1 t r t obs r t sim 2 t 1 t r t obs r obs 2 6 pbias t 1 t r t obs r t sim t 1 t r t obs 7 r 2 1 t 1 t r t sim r obs 2 t 1 t r t obs r obs 2 8 rmse t 1 t r t obs r t sim 2 t where r t obs and r t sim are the observed and simulated runoff values at time t respectively t is the length of the time series and r obs is the average value of the observed runoff during time period t 3 2 abrupt change detection this study used order cluster analysis to detect abrupt change in the annual runoff time series the order cluster analysis explores the possible change point by miming the sum of squares of deviations before and after a specific year liu et al 2019 v t the sum of squares of deviations divided by the year t is calculated as follows huang 1995 9 v t i 1 t r i r 1 i t 1 n r i r 2 where r i is the runoff in year i and r 1 and r 2 are the average values before and after year t respectively the year when the value of v t reaches the minimum is the possible change point to verify the possible change point the t test was utilized to test whether there was a significant difference in the mean values before and after the possible change point the formula for the t test is as follows zheng et al 2007 10 t x 1 x 2 i s 1 n 1 1 n 2 11 s n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 where x i s and n i are the mean standard variation and size of the two independent samples i 1 2 respectively the degree of freedom in the t test is n 1 n 2 2 if the calculated t value is larger than the critical value t α the point can be accepted as a change point at the significance level of α the degree of freedom is 33 and α is 0 05 in this study therefore the critical value is 2 04 3 3 runoff change analysis based on the budyko framework in addition to the numerical simulations we employed the budyko framework to quantify the regional runoff change caused by precipitation potential evapotranspiration and frozen ground degradation the budyko framework states that the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation can be written as a function of the aridity index the ratio of potential evapotranspiration to precipitation at the mean annual time scale budyko 1974 the expression of the budyko framework obtained empirically by choudhury 1999 and derived analytically by yang et al 2008 is as follows 12 e p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n where e is the mean annual actual evapotranspiration p is the mean annual precipitation e0 is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration and parameter n represents the catchment characteristics yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 which are also related to precipitation intensity and seasonality donohue et al 2012 milly 1994 combining eq 12 with the long term water balance equation the runoff can be written as follows 13 r p p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n o r r p 1 e 0 p n 1 1 n based on the concept of climate elasticity xu et al 2014 yang and yang 2011 zheng et al 2009 the precipitation elasticity of runoff is defined as ε p dr r dp p and the potential evapotranspiration elasticity of runoff ε e 0 and the catchment landscape characteristic elasticity of runoff ε n are defined as ε e 0 dr r d e 0 e 0 and ε n dr r dn n respectively therefore to understand the causes the runoff change can be written as follows 14 δ r ε p δ p p r ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 r ε n δ n n r the equations for calculating the elasticities of runoff can be found in xu et al 2014 the parameter n is estimated based on the mean annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff using eq 13 in this study e 0 was calculated with the penman monteith equation recommended by the fao allen et al 1998 frozen ground degradation may affect parameter n by changing the landscape conditions and influencing the hydraulic characteristics such as water storage niu et al 2016 wang et al 2018a and soil water content walvoord and kurylyk 2016 in addition parameter n may be influenced by vegetation coverage zhang et al 2016 rainfall intensity and snowfall proportion donohue et al 2012 milly 1994 zhang et al 2015 therefore parameter n can be estimated as follows 15 n a i v i b where n is the parameter of the budyko curve v i is the explanatory variable a i is the regression coefficient and b is the intercept we considered the lai snowfall proportion rainfall intensity and frozen ground depth alt in the permafrost region and the sryr and maximum frozen depth in the sfg region as possible explanatory factors and utilized the stepwise regression method to find variables with significant influences on parameter n by spss version 20 0 software the alt of the permafrost was used to indicate the frozen ground in the sryr because most of the basin was covered with permafrost the change in parameter n caused by the frozen ground change from period 1 to period 2 can be estimated as follows 16 δ n f f alt m f d s f g a 2 f alt m f d s f g a 1 when establishing the regression equations by spss forward selection and backward elimination were combined in the forward selection the variable with the smallest p value p 0 05 of f testing was first selected then the variable in the remaining candidate variables with the smallest p value p 0 05 of partial f testing taking into account variables already in the model was selected and this step was repeated until no p value of remaining candidate variables was smaller than 0 05 in backward elimination after adding one more variable the variable with a p value of f testing larger than 0 10 was removed from the regression equation 4 results 4 1 validation of the hydrological model fig 2 shows the comparison of the simulated monthly runoff and the observations at the zhimenda station from 1981 to 1990 calibration period and from 1991 to 2015 validation period the nse r2 and pbias values for the calibration period were 0 83 0 92 and 2 1 respectively and for the validation period were 0 86 0 94 and 4 3 which indicated good performance these results indicated that the simulated monthly river discharge generally reproduced the variations in the observations fig 3 shows the time series of the simulated and observed monthly frozen ground depths at two cma meteorological stations i e zhiduo and qumalai and the comparison of monthly evapotranspiration from gleam and gbehm at the basin scale during the period of 1981 2015 comparisons between the monthly et from gleam and gbhm at the grid scale are shown in fig s2 in the supplementary material the et from gbehm and gleam were consistent with the rmse value of 8 mm and r2 value of 0 95 at the basin scale and the means of the spatial distributions of r2 rmse and pbias values were 0 82 12 10 mm and 8 respectively there was good agreement between the simulated frozen ground depth and observations i e the r2 and rmse values were 0 96 and 22 mm at the zhiduo station and 0 91 and 37 mm at the qumalai station respectively this result meant that the simulations successfully captured the observed freezing and thawing processes of frozen ground fig 4 represents the distribution of permafrost and seasonally frozen ground in different periods and the area degraded from permafrost to seasonally frozen ground during the two periods the distribution map of the frozen ground types during 2001 2015 was generally consistent with the previous permafrost map of the tp zou et al 2017 the simulated permafrost area during 2001 2015 was 108 940 km2 which was very close to the value of 108 490 km2 calculated from zou s map therefore the performance of the distributed model gbehm in simulating the monthly river discharge monthly evapotranspiration and frozen ground depth was generally acceptable for the further analysis of hydrological process changes frozen ground changes and interaction between them in the study area 4 2 spatial variability of water balance components generally the mean annual precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and runoff coefficient during 1981 2015 decreased from southeast to northwest as shown in fig 5 annual precipitation ranged from 236 mm to 687 mm with a mean value of 414 mm and a standard deviation value of 82 mm while the annual actual evapotranspiration was between 11 mm and 481 mm with a mean value of 321 mm and a standard deviation value of 47 mm the range of annual runoff was 7 905 mm and the mean value and standard deviation value were 96 mm and 87 mm respectively the annual runoff coefficient the ratio of runoff to precipitation in one grid was between 0 02 and 2 20 and the mean value and standard deviation value were 0 21 and 0 16 respectively the runoff coefficient in some glacier regions was greater than 1 which was due to significant glacier retreat 4 2 1 changes in the water balance components with elevation the changes in the area runoff volume mean annual precipitation actual evapotranspiration runoff and runoff coefficient with elevation are shown in fig 6 as the elevation rose the precipitation in the study area initially increased and then decreased with a minimum value achieved at elevations of 4500 m 4600 m while the actual evapotranspiration always decreased the runoff slightly initially decreased and then increased with a minimum value achieved at elevations of 4400 4500 m combined with the area distribution the runoff volume was largest in the elevation range of 4700 4800 m which was mainly located in the permafrost region fig 6 shows that the runoff coefficient remained approximately stable below 4500 m but showed an increasing trend with increasing elevation above 4500 m from the distributions of the frozen ground types shown in fig 4 4500 m was approximately the lower boundary between permafrost and the sfg therefore runoff generation may differ in different types of frozen ground which will be discussed in the next section 4 2 2 differences in water balance components between permafrost and seasonally frozen ground regions table 1 shows the long term average hydrological components in the sfg region and permafrost region the sfg region was derived from the distribution map in fig 4 a and the permafrost region was derived from that in fig 4 b the mean annual precipitation was similar in the two types of regions however the sfg region produced much less runoff than the permafrost region the ratios of annual potential evapotranspiration to precipitation aridity index in the sfg region and permafrost region were very close at 1 86 and 1 87 respectively since the aridity indices were nearly 2 the actual evapotranspiration in the two regions was controlled by available water although the aridity indices in the two regions were close the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation was remarkably larger in the sfg region one of the possible causes for this difference is that a larger proportion of precipitation transformed into liquid soil water in the sfg region which provided more available water for evapotranspiration and thus induced a larger evapotranspiration intensity more vegetation coverage higher lai in the sfg region may have also resulted in a larger proportion of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation as shown in fig s3 the changes in lai and temperature showed increasing trends with increasing elevation the influence of temperature has been considered in the calculation of potential evapotranspiration 4 3 inter annual changes in the frozen ground and hydrological components from 1981 to 2015 4 3 1 trend of frozen ground change the area of the permafrost region was 113 580 km2 during 1981 1990 while it declined to 108 940 km2 during 2001 2015 fig 4 the zones where permafrost was transformed into sfg accounted for 3 3 of the total area and were mainly distributed in elevation ranges between 4300 m and 4700 m which was also the junction between permafrost and sfg as shown in fig 7 the mean value of the alt was approximately 2 0 m and the mean value of mfdsfg was approximately 2 1 m fig 7 shows that the alt of the permafrost increased significantly at the 0 05 level at a rate of 4 2 cm 10 a and the mfdsfg had a significantly decreasing trend at a rate of 12 3 cm 10 a which showed a degradation trend of the frozen ground in the sryr as shown in fig 8 a the deepening rate of the alt decreased with elevation while the shallowing rate of the mfdsfg increased with elevation indicating that the transition zone of permafrost and sfg experienced more obvious degradation wang et al 2019 4 3 2 inter annual changes in water balance components fig 9 shows the inter annual variations in the hydrological components in the entire sryr from 1981 to 2015 the mean air temperature rose rapidly at a rate of 0 60 c 10 a and increased by 2 1 c in total during the study period an increasing rate of 25 5 mm 10 a was found for the annual precipitation the observed annual runoff also had an overall increasing trend at a rate of 5 7 mm 10 a although it had a decreasing trend from the 1980 s to the 1990 s the runoff coefficient decreased at a rate of 0 002 10 a the consistency between the blue dotted line and blue solid line in fig 9 b indicates that the simulated annual runoff had a similar increasing rate 6 2 mm 10 a with the observations and thus was reliable in terms of representing the changing trend of runoff in the study area the simulated annual et increased significantly at a rate of 16 6 mm 10 a which was likely a result of the increase in precipitation and the sharp increase in air temperature as shown in table 2 over the past 35 years the precipitation and evapotranspiration both significantly increased at a significance level of 0 1 in most elevation zones runoff in higher altitude regions 4400 m increased while that in lower elevations 4400 m decreased fig 8 b shows the regression coefficients α β γ between runoff and precipitation r p and between et and precipitation et p temperature et t which were estimated as r α p a et β p b and et γ t c the regression coefficients between et and p β and between et and t γ had the same pattern in terms of varying with elevation the regression coefficient between runoff and temperature was not significant this result suggested that runoff change was more sensitive to precipitation change in the higher altitude regions mainly covered by permafrost than in the lower altitude regions mainly covered by sfg in the transition zone of permafrost into sfg the regression coefficients of et t and et p reached their maximum values which implied that the evapotranspiration change in the transition zone was more sensitive to climate change in addition the results indicated that the precipitation increase had a greater influence on runoff than on evapotranspiration in most elevation zones with a larger regression coefficient of r p than et p regarding the different types of frozen ground regions the precipitation and evapotranspiration in the sfg region and permafrost region both showed increasing trends as shown in fig 10 a smaller rate of precipitation increase and a greater rate of evapotranspiration increase were found in the sfg region the runoff in the permafrost region increased while that in the sfg region decreased the difference in runoff changes between the two types of regions was generally consistent with that at different elevation ranges 4 4 frozen ground change impacts on regional runoff based on the numerical simulation results the runoff coefficient decreased in the lower altitude regions but increased in the higher altitude regions while the aridity index decreased in all elevation zones as shown in fig 8 c this result indicates that the runoff coefficient change in the higher elevation regions was more directly related to climate change while other factors influenced the change in the runoff coefficient in the lower elevation regions from eq 13 we can see that the runoff coefficient is influenced by both the aridity index e 0 p and parameter n a larger parameter n will contribute to the decrease in the runoff coefficient while a decrease in the aridity index will inhibit the decrease in the runoff coefficient in addition the glacier retreat may influence the runoff coefficient in the higher altitude regions by the stepwise regression method the linear regression equations between parameter n and the explanatory variables in the sfg region eq 17 permafrost region eq 18 and the sryr eq 19 are shown as follows 17 n 1 300 m f d s f g 4 469 18 n 1 102 a l t 0 929 19 n 1 518 a l t 1 710 the r2 values in the sfg region permafrost region and sryr were 0 60 0 48 and 0 65 respectively see fig s4 all three models were significant p value 0 05 although the results showed that only the alt and mfdsfg were significantly related to parameter n it is worth noting that the changes in the alt and mfdsfg also reflected the combined influences of climate and underlying conditions such as lai and snowfall regarding the annual runoff time series an abrupt change was detected in 1989 2004 and 2004 for the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively see fig 11 the statistical t values between the two subsamples before and after the possible change points were 3 0 3 0 and 2 7 in the three regions respectively all of which were larger than the critical value t 0 05 2 04 based on the change point in each region the study period was divided into two sub periods period 1 1981 to change point and period 2 change point 1 to 2015 table 3 shows the long term parameter n and precipitation potential evapotranspiration and parameter n elasticities of runoff in different regions the sfg had a larger parameter n and a smaller runoff coefficient than those of the permafrost region as precipitation elasticity presented an inverse relationship with the runoff coefficient chiew et al 2006 zheng et al 2009 the sfg had the greatest precipitation elasticity based on the elasticities in the entire sryr the runoff will increase by 1 32 when the precipitation increases by 1 the runoff changes from period 1 to period 2 were 25 7 mm 33 8 mm and 25 8 mm in the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively table 4 as shown in table 4 climate change changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration contributed 101 and 126 to the runoff increase in the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively of which the precipitation change contributed most of the increase parameter n contributed 90 of the runoff decrease in the sfg region combined with the mean alt and mfdsfg in the two periods the changes in parameter n caused by frozen ground degradation were 0 22 0 08 and 0 10 in the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively therefore frozen ground degradation contributed changes of 15 0 mm 8 8 mm and 11 6 mm to the annual runoff which accounted for 63 26 and 45 of the runoff change respectively 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of the frozen ground change with previous studies the simulated average alt in our study was 2 0 m which was similar to the value of 2 01 m reported by guo and wang 2013 the comparisons of frozen ground change in our study with the results of previous studies and observations of meteorological stations are shown in table 5 our study simulated a smaller change rate 0 04 m 10 a than the average value 0 15 m 10 a on the tp reported by guo and wang 2013 similarly oelke and zhang 2007 simulated an increasing trend of 0 14 m 10 a in the alt in the northern tp from 1980 to 2001 in addition to the different study periods and different forcing data using for the models the differences between the permafrost degradation rate in our study and those in the previous studies are related to the spatial heterogeneity of permafrost changes on the tp the degradation rate of the permafrost in the sryr was probably slower than the average value on the tp for the change rates of the mfdsfg our results were close to the observations at two meteorological stations zhiduo and qumalai table 5 compared with previous studies our study focused on the sryr with a higher resolution and study successfully distinguished the distribution of sfg and investigated its maximum frozen depth changes whereas previous studies mainly investigated the permafrost changes in this region guo and wang 2013 oelke and zhang 2007 several previous studies have investigated hydrological changes and found that precipitation was the dominant factor affecting runoff change in this region e g yao et al 2014 based on an empirical relationship liu et al 2019 based on the budyko framework and guo et al 2019 based on a grid based hydrological model in our study the gbehm which considers soil freezing and thawing processes was used to reproduce the hydrological processes and found that the influence of frozen ground degradation was an important factor in addition to the precipitation moreover this study illustrated the different hydrological responses to climate change in the sfg region and permafrost region which deepened our understanding of the hydrological processes in cold regions 5 2 runoff change in the sryr 5 2 1 impacts of frozen ground on runoff change the results showed that the sfg region had a larger ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation and a larger parameter n of the budyko curve than the permafrost region the evapotranspiration had a larger change with temperature and precipitation change in the transition zone therefore the degradation of permafrost to sfg might intensify evapotranspiration and reduce the available water resources in the sryr which should serve as a warning to other river source areas originating from the tp under climate change as shown in eqs 17 19 the positive negative relationship between the alt mfdsfg and parameter n quantitatively proved a negative effect of frozen ground degradation on runoff previous studies on the tp niu et al 2016 qiu and jane 2012 wang et al 2018a also found that frozen ground degradation might decrease runoff by enhancing infiltration and enlarging the water storage capacity which was supported by meng et al 2019 in which an increase in water storage from 2003 to 2014 was found based on grace satellite data in this area 5 2 2 impacts of other factors on runoff change as shown in fig 1 a the sryr was mainly covered by grassland and bare land the results in section 4 4 showed that the impact of the lai on runoff change was limited in the sryr probably because of the sparse vegetation in the sryr snowmelt and glacier melt were other factors that affected the runoff both glacier runoff and snowmelt runoff showed increasing trends from 1981 to 2015 fig s5 the impact of the amount of snowfall on runoff has been included in the amount of precipitation by the budyko framework additionally parameter n was not significantly related to the snowfall proportion from results in section 4 3 since glaciers covered only approximately 0 95 of the sryr guo et al 2019 glacial runoff and its impact on runoff change was relatively small the mean annual glacial runoff values during 1981 2004 and 2005 2015 were 5 9 mm and 6 3 mm respectively representing a difference of 0 4 mm although the glacier retreat contributed to the runoff increase in at higher altitudes the glacier area decrease induced by continuous retreat may lead to a decrease in glacial runoff in the future zhao et al 2019 5 3 uncertainty in the numerical simulation in this study the numerical simulations by the gbehm may have uncertainties including the meteorological data used as the model inputs which were interpolated spatially from a limited number of stations the parameters of the vegetation and the soil and the structure and physics of the eco hydrological model the meteorological stations available in the study area are located at elevations below 4700 m the interpolation of air temperature based on the elevation gradient obtained from the low elevation region may not be the same in the high elevation region satellite remote sensing can be useful in areas lacking ground observations especially on the tp zheng et al 2019 and this method will be used in future studies 6 conclusions this study used a process based distributed eco hydrological model to simulate the spatiotemporal variations in frozen ground and hydrological components based on the numerical simulations and the budyko framework we systematically evaluated the joint impacts of frozen ground degradation and climate change on runoff in the sryr based on the results the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 based on long term simulations from 1981 to 2015 the runoff slightly initially decreased and then increased with rising elevation the permafrost region with an elevation range of 4700 4800 m was the main source area of runoff in the sryr the runoff coefficient showed an increasing trend with increasing elevation above 4500 m which was approximately the lower boundary between the permafrost and sfg 2 from 1981 to 2015 the mfdsfg decreased at a rate of 12 3 cm 10 a while the alt of permafrost had an increasing rate of 4 2 cm 10 a the observed runoff showed an increasing trend of 5 7 mm 10 a however the runoff coefficient decreased by 0 002 10 a 3 the deepening rate of the alt decreased with elevation while the shallowing rate of the mfdsfg increased with elevation the annual runoff in the sfg region decreased while that in the permafrost region increased runoff change was more sensitive to precipitation change in the higher altitude regions that were mainly covered by permafrost than the lower altitude regions that were mainly covered by seasonally frozen ground while the evapotranspiration change in the transition zone was more sensitive to climate change 4 an abrupt change in the annual runoff time series was detected in 1989 2004 and 2004 in the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively and the annual runoff change from period 1 1981 to change point to period 2 change point 1 to 2015 were 25 7 mm 33 8 mm and 25 8 mm respectively frozen ground degradation contributed changes of 15 0 mm 8 8 mm and 11 6 mm to the annual runoff in the sfg region the permafrost region and the entire sryr respectively these findings highlight the different runoff changes and causes in the sfg region and permafrost region this study provides a better understanding of the hydrological processes in a warming climate in terms of permafrost degradation the results of this study may provide guidelines for decision makers to formulate sustainable strategies for water resource management under climate change in the qinghai tibet

5147,concerns about total residual chlorine effects on the aquatic environment have led to a lowering of allowable effluent discharge concentrations many municipalities use monochloramine as a water disinfectant which makes its way into drainage systems through outdoor and industrial water uses and ultimately into surface waters monochloramine is known to dissipate with variable temporal and spatial decay coefficients however no existing stormwater models simulate these aspects thus this study describes a novel variable decay coefficient simulator vdcs that predicts levels of degradable pollutants in sewer systems the importance of spatially and temporally varying monochloramine decay coefficients on pollutant concentrations was assessed through three scenarios using 1 a constant decay coefficient 2 spatially varying decay coefficients per land use and 3 spatially and temporally varying decay coefficients at the system outfall the spatially and temporally varying decay coefficients generated 67 and 100 higher concentrations respectively than the constant decay coefficient these differences have important implications for the modeling of degradable pollutants in stormwater systems and for the application of environmental regulations keywords stormwater quality stormwater modeling monochloramine dissipation decay coefficient degradable pollutant total active chlorine 1 introduction chloramine was first used by a treatment plant in ottawa canada in 1916 to reduce drinking water treatment costs awwa 2006 during chloramination ammonia is added to convert the residual free chlorine to chloramines initially chlorine and chloramine were both used widely for disinfection purposes however after the u s public health service observed chlorine s rapid effect on several bacteria in 1943 chloramine use decreased significantly crittenden et al 2012 it was not until the discovery of chlorine disinfection by products dbp in the 1970 s that chloramine started to be used widely as a disinfectant connell 1996 because 1 although chloramines do form dbps they do so to a much smaller degree than chlorine zhang et al 2017 and 2 monochloramine nh2cl the most dominant chloramine species has a desirable longer lasting residual that prolongs its disinfection efficiency who 2004 by 2008 approximately 30 of u s water suppliers used chloramination for disinfection maestre et al 2016 and today it is widely used worldwide as a drinking water secondary disinfectant moradi et al 2017 wahman and speitel 2012 including by the city of edmonton coe in alberta canada given its long lasting residual the dbps and chloramines in treated drinking water may reach the aquatic environment through their introduction to stormwater drainage systems after outdoor or industrial tap water use zhang et al 2018c sourcesinclude distribution system leaks and breaks lawn and garden watering car and driveway washing pool emptying street cleaning firefighting construction activities industrial hydro testing and industrial or commercial wash down balling et al 2008 manning et al 1996 in edmonton stormwater eventually enters the north saskatchewan river or tributary creeks from over 200 storm sewer outfalls from which some of the stormwater system discharges flow directly without any treatment into receiving waters city of edmonton 2013 over the past several decades a shift has occurred toward the control of the water quality of discharges from urban areas to stream ecosystems goulden et al 2018 shrestha and he 2017 in the case of the chloramine discharges in stormwater effluents a number of studies have demonstrated harmful and potentially fatal influences of chlorine on fish habitat and possible changes in species composition grothe and eaton 1975 manning et al 1996 zillich 1972 zvinavashe et al 2008 the effects of exposure depend on the concentration duration fish species and other environmental factors field studies and biological surveys have found a total active chlorine tac concentration exceeding 0 02 mg l to harm aquatic life where tac represents the combination of chloramines and free chlorine species released from chloramines consequently the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme 2014 issued new canada wide guidelines for the protection of aquatic life that lowered the maximum tac concentration in surface waters to 0 02 mg l in edmonton recent monitoring of the tac concentrations at selected storm sewer outfalls showed tac concentrations up to 0 39 mg l which are substantially greater 1950 higher than the reported detrimental level city of edmonton 2013 combined together these factors establish requirements to understand and then control chloramine concentrations in stormwater systems comprehensive studies on chloramine dissipation in storm sewer networks are lacking in the literature zhang et al 2018c previous studies have addressed tac dissipation in water distribution networks for human health concerns ahn et al 2012 alexander and boccelli 2010 fisher et al 2016 shang et al 2008 however the reactivity between chloramines and a group of substances naturally found in storm sewer environments causes chloramine dissipation to differ significantly in stormwater zhang et al 2018a further the spatial and temporal variability within the stormwater system should be considered marsalek 1991 spatially with varying characteristics of stormwater effluents per land use type and human activity zhang et al 2018c distribution of the decay inducing parameters within the sewers potgieter et al 2018 such as biofilms further discussed below and changes in the properties of the sewer network itself savic et al 2009 which produces varying velocities and consequently travel times and temporally as a result of fluctuations in the pollutant mass fluxes over time clark 1998 changes in the levels of the decay affecting parameters such as temperature vanbriesen et al 2011 and the dynamic nature of pipe hydraulics westbrook and digiano 2009 and decay rates jonkergouw et al 2009 in partcular decay rates are known to decrease with time courtis et al 2009 because chloraminated flows traveling in a pipe react with chloramine consuming substances where present sathasivan et al 2008 both in bulk water and in biofilms at the pipe wall hallam et al 2002 these reactions slow over time as reactants are consumed kohpaei et al 2011 zhang et al 2018b the mathematical representation of these temporal and spatial changes employs varying decay coefficents to model chloramine decay in the stormwater system zhang et al 2018b therefore there is a real need for a stormwater model that can predict concentrations of pollutants with spatially and temporally variable decay coefficients in stormwater effluents however tools capable of simulating such pollutants are lacking available software tools such as swmm mouse and infoworks ws can simulate first order decay processes with a constant decay rate for an entire stormwater network over the simulated period of time butler and davies 2011 elliott and trowsdale 2007 rubinato et al 2013 these models contain sophisticated runoff and pipe flow routing modules and have been applied to study water quality in terms of the transport of suspended solids heavy metals phosphorus and cod bod in stormwater networks becouze lareure et al 2019 fraga et al 2016 lee et al 2010 may and sivakumar 2009 shon et al 2012 however they are unsuited to simulation of pollutants with variable decay coefficients this paper therefore presents a novel framework for simulation and prediction of chloramine concentrations in stormwater effluents throughout a drainage network including the important spatial and temporal variations in chloramine decay coefficients at different points in that network this framework includes field sampling laboratory experiments and a stormwater simulation model first a number of chemical physiochemical and biological properties of stormwater were investigated in terms of their effects on chloramine dissipation rates under dry and wet weather conditions zhang et al 2018c 2018a 2018b gaafar et al 2019 the temporal and spatial variability of chloramine decay rates was also determined through field samples and laboratory experiments zhang et al 2018c 2018b second a stormwater model was built calibrated and validated as described below to give satisfactory flow routing and water quality predictions third a new model called the variable decay coefficient simulator vdcs was developed to predict degradable pollutant concentrations in a drainage system using temporally and spatially variable decay coefficients finally the previously determined chloramine decay rates were applied to the vdcs model for a stormwater basin in order to predict chloramine concentrations throughout the stormwater system and particularly at the storm sewer outlet this model framework allows us to investigate the impact of variable rates of chloramine decay on stormwater model predictions specifically the more commonly used constant average decay value was compared against 1 spatially varying values per land use and 2 more comprehensive temporally and spatially varying decay rates it was hypothesized that higher spatial and temporal variability in observed decay rates would lead to more accurate model predictions as compared with measured concentrations in the system importantly the framework developed in this research is not limited to chloramine it can be applied to study the dissipation of other degradable pollutants in storm sewers such as nitrite and organic matter and to reduce the uncertainties that preclude accurate prediction of their concentrations in different pipe systems note that this more detailed representation of decay variability requires significantly more sampling and modeling effort than an approach that uses a single average decay coefficient for water quality simulations however it should improve the ability of decision makers to anticipate pollutant fluxes in the sewer system and maintain released concentrations below regulated values 2 literature review 2 1 parameters important for chloramine decay the dissipation of chlorine and or chloramine has been studied primarily in water distribution systems wds chloramine is known to dissipate in these systems through chemical reactivity bio degradation and auto decomposition crittenden et al 2012 zhang et al 2018a some parameters are known to have a greater effect on the dynamics of chloramine decay such as natural organic matter nom hrudey 2009 zhang et al 2018a temperature adhikari et al 2012 regan et al 2002 ph sarker and sathasivan 2012 nitrite moradi et al 2017 sathasivan et al 2009 and biofilm sathasivan et al 2009 2008 in addition to other reported parameters such as bromide vikesland et al 2001 microbiological growth herath et al 2015 sung et al 2005 cometabolism maestre et al 2016 alkalinity zhang et al 2017 corrosion clark et al 2006 flow velocity westbrook and digiano 2009 and pipe materials mutoti et al 2007 the large number of factors involved in chloramine dissipation creates challenges for the modeling of chloramine decay mutoti et al 2007 further unlike many stormwater pollutants generated from deposition on various urban surfaces and accumulated over antecedent dry periods between rainfalls wei et al 2019 chloramine does not exhibit build up and wash off characteristics to date a single study on chloramine dissipation in stormwater systems zhang et al 2018c has shown the nom concentration to be the dominant contributer for monochloramine dissipation in stormwater it also showed that ammonium can decrease decay rates through promoting the regeneration of nh2cl while reactions with nitrite organic components and biofilms accelerate the decay process 2 2 modeling tac decay in water networks the decay of both chlorine and chloramine disinfectant in water networks is generally modeled with first order kinetics ahn et al 2012 rossman et al 1994 savic et al 2009 as 1 dc dt k c where c is the concentration and k is the first order decay constant chloramine decay involves two distinct processes as it travels in pipes it reacts both with consuming substances in the bulk fluid and with the pipe s internal wall material and biofilms these two processes are known as the bulk decay kb and wall decay kw respectively rossman et al 1994 so that 2 k k b k w many attempts have been made to determine kb and kw and their associated processes using laboratory experiments or field measurements with regression analysis see for instance ahn et al 2012 al omari et al 2004 boccelli et al 2003 castro and neves 2003 clark et al 1995 fisher et al 2011 hallam et al 2002 powell et al 2000 and vasconcelos et al 1997 kb usually varies with temperature total organic carbon toc transport time and initial cl concentration and contaminant while kw is affected by pipe age diameter material roughness corrosion and biofilm in some models the decay coefficient k is simply calibrated to minimize the model error against field measurements ahn et al 2012 mostafa et al 2013 vanbriesen et al 2011 however equation 1 is not the only first order decay model available other versions of the first order decay model such as parallel and limited first order models have also been studied some of these models provide a better fit to available data sets although they are not significantly or consistently better in most cases see for instance ahn et al 2012 helbling and vanbriesen 2009 and vasconcelos et al 1997 other studies focus on second order decay kinetic models including those by clark 1998 fisher et al 2011 and islam et al 1997 the second order decay models used to study chlorine decay show neither considerable nor constant improvements compared to first order ones for instance boccelli et al 2003 found second order models generally equaled or bettered the performance of first order models while kim et al 2015 compared the performance of 9 different chlorine decay models for a pilot scale water network and found that the first order model outperformed other models under all studied conditions thus despite the complexity of its decay chemistry chloramine decay is better represented as a first order process than chlorine fisher et al 2009 it acts like free chlorine but with slower dissipation lee et al 2003 maier et al 2000 because temporal and spatial changes in chloramine decay rates do not lend themselves to a simple representation they can be better modeled in stormwater systems using variable decay coefficients kohpaei et al 2011 zhang et al 2018b based on field sampling results laboratory experiments zhang et al 2018c 2018a and model development in comsol zhang et al 2018b the temporal variation of chloramine decay rates has been described with the following relationship 3 k t i 1 α t β f i where kt i is the decay coefficient at time t for land use i f is a land use dependent coefficient described in zhang et al 2018b t is the discharge time in minutes α 1 73 and β 1 0 3 methods and material 3 1 location selection four study locations were selected to represent major land uses within two stormwater catchments kennedale in north edmonton and 30th avenue in south edmonton see fig 1 these locations included 1 a residential site as a reference for other land uses 2 a park site for higher application of irrigation and fertilizer compared to residential areas 3 a commercial site focusing on automobile dealerships and rental locations and 4 an industrial site focusing on pressure vessel fabricator locations general characteristics of the stormwater network played an important role in site selection such as the location of the neighborhood within the pipe system the presence of stormwater ponds upstream manhole accessibility for water sampling and existence of monitoring data for water quality and flow moreover long uninterrupted sections of pipe were preferred to permit attribution of changes in water quality to chemical and biological interactions taking place within the water mass and to provide sufficient time for such interactions to occur the sampling location within the network itself was also important since sampling close to the upstream end of the stormwater network would ensure that stormwater flows resulted from the catchment under consideration but could lead to limited flow volumes while sampling farther downstream would make the attribution of contamination to specific sources difficult finally potential neighborhoods with mixed land uses within or upstream of the neighborhood were avoided and some neighborhoods were excluded because of high traffic poor accessibility and sampling difficulty additional criteria were applied for specific land use types similarly to approaches applied by marsalek 1991 shrestha and he 2017 and zhang et al 2018b for the residential location low density neighborhoods with relatively higher property values were favored because of their larger lawn areas al kofahi et al 2012 and were identified from coe data and aerial photos as shown in fig 2 a then the coe property assessment values were categorized as shown in fig 2 b for the industrial location pressure vessel fabricators were selected because of their reliance on large volumes of chloramine containing potable water for testing vessel integrity last for the commercial site a cluster of commercial automobile services including car rental locations car washes and car dealerships was selected fig 3 and table 1 show the selected neighborhoods and their associated stormwater network properties 3 2 data collection the city of edmonton provided a number of data sets that were used first to establish study site selection criteria and then to select the sites themselves the data comprised 1 gis data including aerial images land use maps property assessment maps and digital elevation models dem 2 attributes and layouts of the stormwater network components from their drains database 3 mike urban sewer system models built to the trunk level which represents the main drainage features pipes with diameters greater than approximately 800 mm and 4 data about the city s parklands i e area irrigation status and type of watering source online sources including google maps and telephone listings were used to find locations of pressure vessel manufacturers and commercial car dealerships in the two basins for calibration and validation of the stormwater model the following data sets were collected for case study locations 1 flow metering records from temporary flow meters installed in the summer seasons of 2015 2016 and 2017 at three locations one for each of the commercial industrial and parks land uses 2 long term pipe flow records from other permanent metering stations and finally 3 long term rain gauge data for the two stormwater basins for further details on the data and their application to different modeling stages please refer to section c of the supplementary materials 3 3 stormwater modeling in many stormwater modeling tools drainage system simulations and computations are conducted in two distinct stages zoppou 1999 as shown in fig 4 the first stage is runoff computations which simulate the hydrologic surface processes and routing of surface flow in modeled catchment areas based on precipitation input and selected hydrologic model parameters and processes elliott and trowsdale 2007 the second stage is network computations which uses the computed runoff from the previous stage as a hydraulic load to the collection system thorndahl and schaarup jensen 2007 these steps are described in dhi 2014a the present study uses mike urban as the stormwater simulation tool mike urban can simulate distributed rainfall runoff and unsteady flow in pipe and channel networks contains one of the most comprehensive water quality modules borah et al 2009 carr et al 2010 haris et al 2016 and is used by the coe for decision support in terms of water quality it can simulate pollution transport dissipation and interaction between different water quality processes such as advection dispersion sediment transport and biological processes dhi 2014b however the water quality module can only simulate first order decay with a constant decay coefficient finally the selected routing techniques in mike urban included the kinematic wave method for surface flows and the dynamic wave method for pipe flow which together balance the need for accurate results with relatively shorter simulation times the city of edmonton provided a mike urban stormwater model for the 30th ave catchment built to the trunk level this level of detail allowed the simulation of urban floods but did not meet requirements for simulating water quality in sewers butler and davies 2011 hence the model was modified to include network components down to the smallest pipe section at the system s upstream ends at all study locations next to calibrate the model a sensitivity analysis was conducted for 34 parameters to identify critical model inputs parameter values were perturbed sequentially to examine the related variation in the fit between observations and model predictions using a procedure adapted from james 2005 and loucks and van beek 2017 these parameters included imperviousness catchment surface properties infiltration indices depression and initial losses and surface roughness for sample results see section a of the supplementary materials the sensitivity analysis results showed that model performance was very sensitive to surface roughness imperviousness and depression storage while changes in catchment length and infiltration parameters had relatively little effect therefore gis applications were used to improve estimates for some model parameters as described by liu et al 2010 aerial images and land use maps were used to adjust the imperviousness ratios of each catchment and digital elevation maps from the coe improved catchment slope calculations the following model efficiency assessment measures were used for model calibration br2 moriasi et al 2007 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 ritter and munoz carpena 2013 rmse legates and mccabe 1999 willmott 1981 and logarithmic nse which is a useful measure for low flow rate performance pushpalatha et al 2012 ye et al 1998 from the flow monitoring records of 2015 and 2016 rainfall events were identified to represent different storm durations patterns and magnitudes and their respective sewer flow hydrographs were measured at three different locations within the stormwater basin these events were then divided into two groups to be used in the calibration and validation processes a sample of twelve validation results is shown in section b of the supplementary materials which compares storm hydrographs from the uncalibrated and calibrated mike urban stormwater models against observed sewer flows values of the model efficiency measures used to assess the performance of the stormwater model pre and post calibration model and validation are shown in fig 5 where model accuracy was significantly improved in terms of model prediction errors as well as the correlation of both peak and low flows to observed stormwater discharges 3 4 python model vdcs available stormwater modeling software packages can only simulate the dissipation of degradable substances in water networks with constant decay coefficients therefore to define spatially and or temporally variable chemical decay coefficients it was necessary to develop a new simulation tool the resulting variable decay coefficients simulator vdcs a novel water quality model developed in python and the focus of this paper can simulate concentrations of a degradable chemical substance in any linear water system such as distribution and stormwater collection networks for ease of use vdcs was built to receive hydrodynamic simulation results from any existing stormwater modeling tool it applies the nth order decay model butler and davies 2011 to represent the degradation reactions of individual pollutants as 4 dc dt k c n where c is the substance concentration k is the decay constant and n is the order of the reaction with respect to that substance focusing on chloramine dissipation in this study the vdcs model applies a first order decay model following the recommendations and work of fisher et al 2009 lee et al 2003 and maier et al 2000 however vdcs can simulate lower or higher decay orders if required application of eq 3 generated the decay rates represented in fig 6 for the four different land uses in the current study where the decay rates start high at the beginning of release events and then decrease over time different water characteristics especially biofilm presence result in spatial variability in decay rates as well these differences among land uses were higher in absolute terms at the beginning of the event and then decreased toward the end of the simulations the water quality computation process in the vdcs is shown in fig 7 the first tier represents the required inputs to the vdcs in the form of spreadsheets either in csv or xls file formats inputs are categorized into three groups 1 sewer system attributes 2 hydrodynamic results from a stormsewer simulation and 3 pollutant introduction points and loads sewer system attribute data describe different system properties for sewer pipes manholes and outlets in terms of diameters lengths material and invert levels and manhole ids at both upstream and downstream ends of each pipe in the system the vdcs uses these data to reconstruct the physical layout and geometry of the water network from upstream branches diversion and collection nodes and through to the system outlet this reproduction of the network layout is required later to determine the paths of pollutants through the sewer system second hydrodynamic results from independent stormwater simulations are imported to provide time series of flow rates and velocities throughout the sewer system organization of the hydrodynamic results in spreadsheet form allows the vdcs to import them from any stormwater simulation model third pollutant introduction points such as fire hydrants and industrial releases are defined for specific locations in the drainage system along with variations of their loads over the simulation period finally the decay order is selected and the decay rate variation is set to one of three levels 1 constant average value 2 spatially varying per land use or 3 varying both spatially and temporally please refer to section d of the supplementary materials for further details on input file formats and organization employing the provided data sets the vdcs calculates concentrations of the degradable substance along its transit path through the sewer system to the system outlet the vdcs model computations start by identifying contamination paths which use the constructed network flow map to trace pollutants from previously defined introduction points from manhole to manhole to the system outlet the model then identifies common pollution paths stemming from pollutant introductions at different locations in the network and combines their loads in the subsequent water quality computations based on the concentration at introduction points and volumetric flow rates the pollutant load can be calculated and then tracked over the calculated contaminant path according to the selected decay order for chloramine dissipation with a first order decay model the vdcs calculates the concentration at the downstream node through 5 c ds c us e k t where cus and cds are the chloramine concentrations at upstream and downstream ends of the current sewer link respectively k is the first order decay coefficient and t is the travel time between the upstream and downstream nodes calculated from the pipe length and flow velocity depending on the selected decay coefficient behavior the vdcs sets the decay coefficient to a constant value or computes it at every timestep from eq 3 similarly beginning at the introduction points and then moving manhole to manhole to the system outlet the vdcs model applies eq 5 to calculate the concentration downstream based on a known upstream concentration at diversion or collection points downstream concentrations are calculated by converting all upstream concentrations to mass fluxes and then distributing the total mass to the downstream links according to their relative volumetric proportions assuming uniform and full mixing at all junctions the vdcs produces pollutographs for different system nodes such as manholes and outlets results can be exported to spreadsheets or plotted within the python environment as presented below in section 5 the vdcs results were verified against the mike urban stormwater model using the same inputs and chloramine loads 4 simulation scenarios a set of three simulation scenarios was designed to demonstrate the effects of spatial and temporal variation in decay coefficients on chloramine concentrations in a storm sewer system see table 2 these scenarios investigate the effects of 1 a constant decay rate which uses a fixed decay coefficient value throughout the sewer network over the simulation period 2 a spatially varying decay rate which specifies a fixed value for each land use type and 3 spatially and temporally varying decay rates that incorporate differences in land use types and times from initial pollutant releases the chloramine decay coefficient values for each scenario are shown in fig 8 and were determined from field sampling described by zhang et al 2018b for fixed decay coefficient values the performance of the vdcs model was tested under both wet and dry weather conditions as described in gaafar et al 2019 dry weather was defined as zero precipitation preceding and during the simulation period to achieve these conditions the stormwater model hydrological input was limited to point source discharges of chloraminated water without any additional hydrological input to represent rainfall or runoff wet and dry weather results consistently matched the chloramine concentrations generated by the mike urban water quality module r2 0 96 further lacking precipitation input to dilute chloramine pollutant loads and thus reduce its concentrations in the sewer network this scenario more clearly demonstrated chloramine decay behavior dry weather simulations are therefore the focus below because simulated chloramine concentrations were low throughout the sewer network during wet weather periods as found also in previous studies lee et al 2009 shrestha and he 2017 zhang et al 2018c gaafar et al 2019 4 1 scenario 1 validation of the variable decay coefficient simulator the first set of simulations assesses the performance of the vdcs against the mike urban model for the 30th ave catchment using a constant decay coefficient as in mike urban therefore in scenario 1a an arithmetically averaged decay coefficient value was applied as an input for both models as shown in fig 8 this scenario represents a practical case of a point source contaminant release from a single fire hydrant to demonstrate the chloramine dissipation process with network flow to the system outlet a similar approach could be taken to represent the effects of watermain breaks or prohibited industrial releases potentially important chloramine contamination sources with high flows over a relatively long period of time the simulated point source release from a hydrant next to manhole res1 fig 3 a in the residential neighborhood was simulated as a constant discharge of 150 l sec for two hours with an initial concentration of 2 0 mg l the regulated chloramine limit in drinking water next to validate vdcs performance under a different set of conditions scenario 1b was designed to represent nonpoint source chloramine releases from different land uses to replicate more general conditions where chloramine releases occur at the same time from a number of outdoor activities scenario 1b also applies a constant decay rate for both mike urban and the vdcs as shown in fig 8 in addition to model validation scenario 1b results are also compared with other scenario results to study the effects of decay coefficient variations on chloramine decay rates 4 2 scenario 2 effect of spatially variable decay coefficients the second set of scenarios investigated the effects of spatially variable decay coefficients with coefficient values dependent on the mix of land uses in each catchment temporal variations in decay rates were omitted such that each coefficient was constant over the simulation period as shown in fig 8 to provide a plausible lower bound estimate for the chloramine concentrations at the sewer outfall the highest plausible decay rate associated with a first flush event was used for scenario 2a scenario 2b was then used to assess a lower time averaged decay rate value for each land use type together this set of simulations illustrates the importance of selecting appropriate decay coefficient values for the different land use types for these scenarios although the land uses were limited to four main types residential commercial industrial and parks with the four individual decay rate values shown in fig 8 each catchment had unique chloramine load and decay coefficient values based on its drainage area and the proportional mix of the four land use types from the field sampling results to select appropriate time averaged decay coefficients for these simulations two decay rates were used as in scenario 1 the first flush decay rate and the average decay rate which were calculated as 6 k i i 1 n k n ε n where ki is the land use averaged decay coefficient of catchment i kn is the decay coefficient of land use n and εn is the percentage of land use n in catchment i as per the municipal land use maps 4 3 scenario 3 effect of spatially and temporally varying decay coefficients in the last scenario both spatial and temporal variabilities of the decay coefficients were simulated in the vdcs as shown in fig 8 this scenario was intended to represent a more realistic situation in which chloramine decay rates decreased with time with results applicable for water managers and decision makers for the regulation and treatment of degradable pollutants consequently scenario 3 represents a conservative case since the chloramine concentrations it simulates would be expected to be significantly higher throughout the sewer system and at the system outlet than in the other scenarios the average nonpoint chloramine load used in scenario 1b and 2 was applied to this scenario 5 results and discussion 5 1 vdcs model validation the first set of scenarios was intended to validate the vdcs against results from the mike urban water quality module scenario 1a simulates chloramine dissipation from a single potable water point source using the pipe flow hydrographs for hydrodynamic simulations from mike urban shown in fig 9 lag and attenuation effects are apparent in the flow hydrograph for discharge introduced at point h that traveled downstream through points j k and o see fig 1 a for the locations of these points fig 9 also shows that the corresponding chloramine concentrations decreased from the standard initial concentration of 2 0 mg l for tap water to reach 0 47 mg l at the system outfall point o a value that is still considerably higher than the allowable chloramine discharge concentration the chloramine concentrations peaks and patterns simulated by the vdcs closely matched those produced by the water quality module of mike urban as shown in the pollutographs of fig 9 b in terms of a statistical assessment of model performance the vdcs produced very high agreement at all points with mike urban results r2 0 98 rmse 0 02 mg l and nse 0 96 further the small discrepancies between the two results can be attributed to differences in the hydrodynamic input to the two water quality models mike urban used data directly generated from flow routing while the vdcs used flow parameters at set timestep intervals of 5 min an alternative view of scenario 1a focuses on longitudinal profiles of the chloramine concentration from the source at h to the system outfall at o a total length of about 5 0 km for specific initial release times as shown in fig 10 for example after 2 h t 2 0 the chloramine concentration was 2 0 mg l at point h km 0 0 dropped to 1 00 mg l after 2 0 km in the sewer line and reached 0 0 mg l after 3 0 km likewise after 8 0 h t 8 0 when the release event ended chloramine pollution no longer existed at the release point h while the maximum chloramine concentration along the release path was 0 53 mg l at km 1 75 longitudinal pollutant concentration profiles as presented in this work offer many clear advantages in understanding the transport of any contaminant in a stormwater system they simplify investigation of the propagation of the pollutant plume through the sewers identify the location and value of peak concentrations at different time intervals and mark time periods after which pollutant concentrations are below regulation limits throughout the water network in scenario 1b the vdcs was evaluated for nonpoint sources where chloramine effluents were defined as variable by land use the pipe flow hydrographs computed by mike urban at respective points a b c d j k and o on the main trunk see fig 1 a are shown in fig 11 a the passage of the stormwater wave through the drainage system is clearly visible beginning at point a and then increasing along the main trunk as the collected stormwater volume increased to reach its peak value at the system outfall point o because this scenario represented nonpoint contaminant sources the shapes of simulated hydrographs and their corresponding pollutographs were affected by many different characteristics of the sub catchments connected to the key manholes on the main trunk such as the drainage area geometry and land use types and their distributions within the various sub basins chloramine concentrations computed for point o with mike urban and the vdcs see fig 11 b using the decay rate value for scenario 1b from fig 8 were significantly higher than the allowable discharge concentration to surface waters over the entire simulation period comparison of the two sets of results also reveals high agreement of the vdcs to mike urban values as shown in fig 11 b the average values for the statistical measures were r2 0 97 rmse 0 026 mg l nrmse 7 74 and nse 0 94 note that the slightly higher differences in these measures resulted from the considerably higher flows encountered in scenario 1b 5 2 spatially variable decay coefficients scenarios 2a and 2b focused on model results for spatially variable but temporally constant decay coefficient values nonpoint source chloramine contaminants introduced to the stormwater model were set at the same level as scenario 1b as shown in fig 8 and pipe flow hydrographs computed by mike urban are shown in fig 12 a further pollutographs at the system outlet point o show chloramine concentrations at the system outlet above the allowable discharge concentration to surface waters as shown in fig 12 b the average concentrations in scenario 2b were consistently higher than those of scenario 2a which used the first flush decay coefficients because of the significant difference between the two decay coefficient values however the first flush values were used to generate a lower bound scenario for chloramine concentrations which is not intended to be realistic over the entire simulation period such high decay rates tend to last only briefly after chloramine introduction because of the reduction in chloramine dissipation by biofilm over time kohpaei et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 interestingly the differences between the scenario results were not constant throughout the simulation period for instance during the first quarter of the simulation period the difference between the computed concentrations in the two scenarios reached a maximum relative value of 38 for the chloramine levels of scenario 2a while the results of scenario 2b were 67 higher than scenario 2a by the end of the simulation period over the full simulation period the average difference in the two pollutographs was 43 a significant difference in chloramine concentrations in the sewer system this comparison illustrates the importance of selecting an appropriate coefficient value even where the temporal change in decay coefficients is ignored 5 3 impact of spatial and temporal variability of in the decay coefficient the scenarios of group 3 incorporated both temporal and spatial variations in the decay coefficient see fig 8 and applied the pipe flow hydrographs shown in fig 12 a results from the three varying levels of the decay rates constant spatially variable and temporally and spatially variable are shown in fig 13 the following analysis focuses on the stormwater outlet because of its proximity to the receiving waters overall the results of spatial disaggregation considered in scenario 2b showed very high agreement with scenario 1b because of the small differences in the decay coefficient values between the two scenarios interestingly despite the incorporation of different decay coefficients for specific land uses in scenario 2b the spatially averaged decay coefficient value was quite similar to the single decay coefficient used in scenario 1b see fig 13 however because this result may have stemmed from the combination of decay coefficient values for the included land use types it should not be taken as a general conclusion of the current work in contrast to the similarity between scenarios 1b and 2b incorporation of both spatial and temporal variations in the decay coefficients in scenario 3 produced a significantly different pollutograph shown in fig 13 the maximum simulated concentration in scenario 3 was 0 65 mg l which comes closest to 0 7 mg l the measured concentration at the system outlet of the 30th ave basin during field samples in summer 2015 zhang et al 2018c interestingly the rank of scenario 3 changed over time relative to the other scenarios from relatively low for the first quarter of the simulation period where it lay between the values for scenarios 2b and 2a to the highest value in the last three quarters further as the stormwater volumes collected from farther neighborhoods began to reach the system outlet by the second third of the simulation period the differences between the scenarios became more visible with higher chloramine concentrations in scenario 3 than in scenarios 1b and 2b this result can be attributed to higher decay rates for case 1b and 2b in this part of the simulation period finally in the last third of the simulation period the concentrations of scenario 3 were at a maximum of about 100 higher than those predicted in scenario 2a in absolute terms the highest predicted chloramine concentrations at the outlet point o were 0 54 0 32 0 55 and 0 65 mg l for scenarios 1b 2a 2b and 3 respectively due to the much lower chloramine decay rates in scenario 3 than in the other scenarios it is important to consider mass fluxes in addition to concentrations system operators and managers prioritize pollutant concentrations over mass fluxes both because concentrations can be measured more easily in the field and because guidelines like those of the ccme focus on maximum allowable concentrations however maximum mass fluxes may not occur concurrently with maximum concentrations for example in the first third of the simulation period the concentrations shown on the pollutograph were relatively high however the corresponding mass flux of 0 5 g s at t 1 hr was low because of a relatively low discharge at that time in the middle third which had the lowest concentrations at the outfall the maximum discharge occurred and a high mass flux of 5 7 g s at t 4 hr resulted finally by the end of the simulation period with the highest concentrations at the system outfall the corresponding discharge was relatively low and a similar mass flux of 5 1 g s at t 7 hr resulted the difference between mass fluxes and concentrations shows that care must be taken in the analysis and interpretation of model results and that a focus only on pollutant concentrations may omit potential environmental consequences of high mass low concentration releases of pollutants regulators and water managers should incorporate mass fluxes as parameters in guidelines and regulations 6 conclusions this study investigated the importance of spatial and temporal variability of monochloramine dissipation rates in stormwater networks the new variable decay coefficient simulator model vdcs was developed to simulate spatial and temporal variations in coefficient values and field measurements and results from dhi s mike urban simulations with constant coefficient values were used to validate model performance three scenarios were designed to compare the application of 1 constant decay coefficient values throughout the sewer network over the simulation period with 2 spatially varying decay rates per land use type and 3 spatially and temporally varying decay rates that incorporate changes in coefficient values with time from the initial pollutant releases comparison of the scenario results demonstrated the importance of including both temporal and spatial variations of decay coefficients when simulating degradable chemical pollutants in sewer systems the combination of spatial and temporal variability in chloramine decay rates affected the predicted chloramine concentrations significantly with implications for environmental regulations to accommodate variable decay rates for degradable chemicals the available water quality models require modification in their current state they omit important dynamics of pollutant concentrations in stormwater systems and may underpredict discharge concentrations with adverse consequences for the quality of receiving water bodies for future studies an extensive stormwater quality monitoring program is recommended to improve water quality simulations that involve degradable chemicals in stormwater networks although resource intensive and potentially costly such monitoring programs would improve the estimation of pollutant decay rates improve understanding of the role of different land uses and pollutant loads on pollutant concentrations and aid validation of stormwater quality simulations finally especially for dry weather conditions close attention should be paid to chloraminated effluents toward the middle and end of the discharge period rather than at the early stages of release events after a dry period which would allow biofilms to accumulate both chloramine mass fluxes and concentrations would initially be relatively low but they rise significantly as decay rates decrease and more distant sections of the drainage system contribute to produce higher flow rates results will differ by basin geometry the mixture of land uses and system attributes and water use and quality characteristics and so pollutants must be assessed for each stormwater basin individually 7 data availability the model generated by the study is available from the corresponding author on request credit authorship contribution statement

5147,concerns about total residual chlorine effects on the aquatic environment have led to a lowering of allowable effluent discharge concentrations many municipalities use monochloramine as a water disinfectant which makes its way into drainage systems through outdoor and industrial water uses and ultimately into surface waters monochloramine is known to dissipate with variable temporal and spatial decay coefficients however no existing stormwater models simulate these aspects thus this study describes a novel variable decay coefficient simulator vdcs that predicts levels of degradable pollutants in sewer systems the importance of spatially and temporally varying monochloramine decay coefficients on pollutant concentrations was assessed through three scenarios using 1 a constant decay coefficient 2 spatially varying decay coefficients per land use and 3 spatially and temporally varying decay coefficients at the system outfall the spatially and temporally varying decay coefficients generated 67 and 100 higher concentrations respectively than the constant decay coefficient these differences have important implications for the modeling of degradable pollutants in stormwater systems and for the application of environmental regulations keywords stormwater quality stormwater modeling monochloramine dissipation decay coefficient degradable pollutant total active chlorine 1 introduction chloramine was first used by a treatment plant in ottawa canada in 1916 to reduce drinking water treatment costs awwa 2006 during chloramination ammonia is added to convert the residual free chlorine to chloramines initially chlorine and chloramine were both used widely for disinfection purposes however after the u s public health service observed chlorine s rapid effect on several bacteria in 1943 chloramine use decreased significantly crittenden et al 2012 it was not until the discovery of chlorine disinfection by products dbp in the 1970 s that chloramine started to be used widely as a disinfectant connell 1996 because 1 although chloramines do form dbps they do so to a much smaller degree than chlorine zhang et al 2017 and 2 monochloramine nh2cl the most dominant chloramine species has a desirable longer lasting residual that prolongs its disinfection efficiency who 2004 by 2008 approximately 30 of u s water suppliers used chloramination for disinfection maestre et al 2016 and today it is widely used worldwide as a drinking water secondary disinfectant moradi et al 2017 wahman and speitel 2012 including by the city of edmonton coe in alberta canada given its long lasting residual the dbps and chloramines in treated drinking water may reach the aquatic environment through their introduction to stormwater drainage systems after outdoor or industrial tap water use zhang et al 2018c sourcesinclude distribution system leaks and breaks lawn and garden watering car and driveway washing pool emptying street cleaning firefighting construction activities industrial hydro testing and industrial or commercial wash down balling et al 2008 manning et al 1996 in edmonton stormwater eventually enters the north saskatchewan river or tributary creeks from over 200 storm sewer outfalls from which some of the stormwater system discharges flow directly without any treatment into receiving waters city of edmonton 2013 over the past several decades a shift has occurred toward the control of the water quality of discharges from urban areas to stream ecosystems goulden et al 2018 shrestha and he 2017 in the case of the chloramine discharges in stormwater effluents a number of studies have demonstrated harmful and potentially fatal influences of chlorine on fish habitat and possible changes in species composition grothe and eaton 1975 manning et al 1996 zillich 1972 zvinavashe et al 2008 the effects of exposure depend on the concentration duration fish species and other environmental factors field studies and biological surveys have found a total active chlorine tac concentration exceeding 0 02 mg l to harm aquatic life where tac represents the combination of chloramines and free chlorine species released from chloramines consequently the canadian council of ministers of the environment ccme 2014 issued new canada wide guidelines for the protection of aquatic life that lowered the maximum tac concentration in surface waters to 0 02 mg l in edmonton recent monitoring of the tac concentrations at selected storm sewer outfalls showed tac concentrations up to 0 39 mg l which are substantially greater 1950 higher than the reported detrimental level city of edmonton 2013 combined together these factors establish requirements to understand and then control chloramine concentrations in stormwater systems comprehensive studies on chloramine dissipation in storm sewer networks are lacking in the literature zhang et al 2018c previous studies have addressed tac dissipation in water distribution networks for human health concerns ahn et al 2012 alexander and boccelli 2010 fisher et al 2016 shang et al 2008 however the reactivity between chloramines and a group of substances naturally found in storm sewer environments causes chloramine dissipation to differ significantly in stormwater zhang et al 2018a further the spatial and temporal variability within the stormwater system should be considered marsalek 1991 spatially with varying characteristics of stormwater effluents per land use type and human activity zhang et al 2018c distribution of the decay inducing parameters within the sewers potgieter et al 2018 such as biofilms further discussed below and changes in the properties of the sewer network itself savic et al 2009 which produces varying velocities and consequently travel times and temporally as a result of fluctuations in the pollutant mass fluxes over time clark 1998 changes in the levels of the decay affecting parameters such as temperature vanbriesen et al 2011 and the dynamic nature of pipe hydraulics westbrook and digiano 2009 and decay rates jonkergouw et al 2009 in partcular decay rates are known to decrease with time courtis et al 2009 because chloraminated flows traveling in a pipe react with chloramine consuming substances where present sathasivan et al 2008 both in bulk water and in biofilms at the pipe wall hallam et al 2002 these reactions slow over time as reactants are consumed kohpaei et al 2011 zhang et al 2018b the mathematical representation of these temporal and spatial changes employs varying decay coefficents to model chloramine decay in the stormwater system zhang et al 2018b therefore there is a real need for a stormwater model that can predict concentrations of pollutants with spatially and temporally variable decay coefficients in stormwater effluents however tools capable of simulating such pollutants are lacking available software tools such as swmm mouse and infoworks ws can simulate first order decay processes with a constant decay rate for an entire stormwater network over the simulated period of time butler and davies 2011 elliott and trowsdale 2007 rubinato et al 2013 these models contain sophisticated runoff and pipe flow routing modules and have been applied to study water quality in terms of the transport of suspended solids heavy metals phosphorus and cod bod in stormwater networks becouze lareure et al 2019 fraga et al 2016 lee et al 2010 may and sivakumar 2009 shon et al 2012 however they are unsuited to simulation of pollutants with variable decay coefficients this paper therefore presents a novel framework for simulation and prediction of chloramine concentrations in stormwater effluents throughout a drainage network including the important spatial and temporal variations in chloramine decay coefficients at different points in that network this framework includes field sampling laboratory experiments and a stormwater simulation model first a number of chemical physiochemical and biological properties of stormwater were investigated in terms of their effects on chloramine dissipation rates under dry and wet weather conditions zhang et al 2018c 2018a 2018b gaafar et al 2019 the temporal and spatial variability of chloramine decay rates was also determined through field samples and laboratory experiments zhang et al 2018c 2018b second a stormwater model was built calibrated and validated as described below to give satisfactory flow routing and water quality predictions third a new model called the variable decay coefficient simulator vdcs was developed to predict degradable pollutant concentrations in a drainage system using temporally and spatially variable decay coefficients finally the previously determined chloramine decay rates were applied to the vdcs model for a stormwater basin in order to predict chloramine concentrations throughout the stormwater system and particularly at the storm sewer outlet this model framework allows us to investigate the impact of variable rates of chloramine decay on stormwater model predictions specifically the more commonly used constant average decay value was compared against 1 spatially varying values per land use and 2 more comprehensive temporally and spatially varying decay rates it was hypothesized that higher spatial and temporal variability in observed decay rates would lead to more accurate model predictions as compared with measured concentrations in the system importantly the framework developed in this research is not limited to chloramine it can be applied to study the dissipation of other degradable pollutants in storm sewers such as nitrite and organic matter and to reduce the uncertainties that preclude accurate prediction of their concentrations in different pipe systems note that this more detailed representation of decay variability requires significantly more sampling and modeling effort than an approach that uses a single average decay coefficient for water quality simulations however it should improve the ability of decision makers to anticipate pollutant fluxes in the sewer system and maintain released concentrations below regulated values 2 literature review 2 1 parameters important for chloramine decay the dissipation of chlorine and or chloramine has been studied primarily in water distribution systems wds chloramine is known to dissipate in these systems through chemical reactivity bio degradation and auto decomposition crittenden et al 2012 zhang et al 2018a some parameters are known to have a greater effect on the dynamics of chloramine decay such as natural organic matter nom hrudey 2009 zhang et al 2018a temperature adhikari et al 2012 regan et al 2002 ph sarker and sathasivan 2012 nitrite moradi et al 2017 sathasivan et al 2009 and biofilm sathasivan et al 2009 2008 in addition to other reported parameters such as bromide vikesland et al 2001 microbiological growth herath et al 2015 sung et al 2005 cometabolism maestre et al 2016 alkalinity zhang et al 2017 corrosion clark et al 2006 flow velocity westbrook and digiano 2009 and pipe materials mutoti et al 2007 the large number of factors involved in chloramine dissipation creates challenges for the modeling of chloramine decay mutoti et al 2007 further unlike many stormwater pollutants generated from deposition on various urban surfaces and accumulated over antecedent dry periods between rainfalls wei et al 2019 chloramine does not exhibit build up and wash off characteristics to date a single study on chloramine dissipation in stormwater systems zhang et al 2018c has shown the nom concentration to be the dominant contributer for monochloramine dissipation in stormwater it also showed that ammonium can decrease decay rates through promoting the regeneration of nh2cl while reactions with nitrite organic components and biofilms accelerate the decay process 2 2 modeling tac decay in water networks the decay of both chlorine and chloramine disinfectant in water networks is generally modeled with first order kinetics ahn et al 2012 rossman et al 1994 savic et al 2009 as 1 dc dt k c where c is the concentration and k is the first order decay constant chloramine decay involves two distinct processes as it travels in pipes it reacts both with consuming substances in the bulk fluid and with the pipe s internal wall material and biofilms these two processes are known as the bulk decay kb and wall decay kw respectively rossman et al 1994 so that 2 k k b k w many attempts have been made to determine kb and kw and their associated processes using laboratory experiments or field measurements with regression analysis see for instance ahn et al 2012 al omari et al 2004 boccelli et al 2003 castro and neves 2003 clark et al 1995 fisher et al 2011 hallam et al 2002 powell et al 2000 and vasconcelos et al 1997 kb usually varies with temperature total organic carbon toc transport time and initial cl concentration and contaminant while kw is affected by pipe age diameter material roughness corrosion and biofilm in some models the decay coefficient k is simply calibrated to minimize the model error against field measurements ahn et al 2012 mostafa et al 2013 vanbriesen et al 2011 however equation 1 is not the only first order decay model available other versions of the first order decay model such as parallel and limited first order models have also been studied some of these models provide a better fit to available data sets although they are not significantly or consistently better in most cases see for instance ahn et al 2012 helbling and vanbriesen 2009 and vasconcelos et al 1997 other studies focus on second order decay kinetic models including those by clark 1998 fisher et al 2011 and islam et al 1997 the second order decay models used to study chlorine decay show neither considerable nor constant improvements compared to first order ones for instance boccelli et al 2003 found second order models generally equaled or bettered the performance of first order models while kim et al 2015 compared the performance of 9 different chlorine decay models for a pilot scale water network and found that the first order model outperformed other models under all studied conditions thus despite the complexity of its decay chemistry chloramine decay is better represented as a first order process than chlorine fisher et al 2009 it acts like free chlorine but with slower dissipation lee et al 2003 maier et al 2000 because temporal and spatial changes in chloramine decay rates do not lend themselves to a simple representation they can be better modeled in stormwater systems using variable decay coefficients kohpaei et al 2011 zhang et al 2018b based on field sampling results laboratory experiments zhang et al 2018c 2018a and model development in comsol zhang et al 2018b the temporal variation of chloramine decay rates has been described with the following relationship 3 k t i 1 α t β f i where kt i is the decay coefficient at time t for land use i f is a land use dependent coefficient described in zhang et al 2018b t is the discharge time in minutes α 1 73 and β 1 0 3 methods and material 3 1 location selection four study locations were selected to represent major land uses within two stormwater catchments kennedale in north edmonton and 30th avenue in south edmonton see fig 1 these locations included 1 a residential site as a reference for other land uses 2 a park site for higher application of irrigation and fertilizer compared to residential areas 3 a commercial site focusing on automobile dealerships and rental locations and 4 an industrial site focusing on pressure vessel fabricator locations general characteristics of the stormwater network played an important role in site selection such as the location of the neighborhood within the pipe system the presence of stormwater ponds upstream manhole accessibility for water sampling and existence of monitoring data for water quality and flow moreover long uninterrupted sections of pipe were preferred to permit attribution of changes in water quality to chemical and biological interactions taking place within the water mass and to provide sufficient time for such interactions to occur the sampling location within the network itself was also important since sampling close to the upstream end of the stormwater network would ensure that stormwater flows resulted from the catchment under consideration but could lead to limited flow volumes while sampling farther downstream would make the attribution of contamination to specific sources difficult finally potential neighborhoods with mixed land uses within or upstream of the neighborhood were avoided and some neighborhoods were excluded because of high traffic poor accessibility and sampling difficulty additional criteria were applied for specific land use types similarly to approaches applied by marsalek 1991 shrestha and he 2017 and zhang et al 2018b for the residential location low density neighborhoods with relatively higher property values were favored because of their larger lawn areas al kofahi et al 2012 and were identified from coe data and aerial photos as shown in fig 2 a then the coe property assessment values were categorized as shown in fig 2 b for the industrial location pressure vessel fabricators were selected because of their reliance on large volumes of chloramine containing potable water for testing vessel integrity last for the commercial site a cluster of commercial automobile services including car rental locations car washes and car dealerships was selected fig 3 and table 1 show the selected neighborhoods and their associated stormwater network properties 3 2 data collection the city of edmonton provided a number of data sets that were used first to establish study site selection criteria and then to select the sites themselves the data comprised 1 gis data including aerial images land use maps property assessment maps and digital elevation models dem 2 attributes and layouts of the stormwater network components from their drains database 3 mike urban sewer system models built to the trunk level which represents the main drainage features pipes with diameters greater than approximately 800 mm and 4 data about the city s parklands i e area irrigation status and type of watering source online sources including google maps and telephone listings were used to find locations of pressure vessel manufacturers and commercial car dealerships in the two basins for calibration and validation of the stormwater model the following data sets were collected for case study locations 1 flow metering records from temporary flow meters installed in the summer seasons of 2015 2016 and 2017 at three locations one for each of the commercial industrial and parks land uses 2 long term pipe flow records from other permanent metering stations and finally 3 long term rain gauge data for the two stormwater basins for further details on the data and their application to different modeling stages please refer to section c of the supplementary materials 3 3 stormwater modeling in many stormwater modeling tools drainage system simulations and computations are conducted in two distinct stages zoppou 1999 as shown in fig 4 the first stage is runoff computations which simulate the hydrologic surface processes and routing of surface flow in modeled catchment areas based on precipitation input and selected hydrologic model parameters and processes elliott and trowsdale 2007 the second stage is network computations which uses the computed runoff from the previous stage as a hydraulic load to the collection system thorndahl and schaarup jensen 2007 these steps are described in dhi 2014a the present study uses mike urban as the stormwater simulation tool mike urban can simulate distributed rainfall runoff and unsteady flow in pipe and channel networks contains one of the most comprehensive water quality modules borah et al 2009 carr et al 2010 haris et al 2016 and is used by the coe for decision support in terms of water quality it can simulate pollution transport dissipation and interaction between different water quality processes such as advection dispersion sediment transport and biological processes dhi 2014b however the water quality module can only simulate first order decay with a constant decay coefficient finally the selected routing techniques in mike urban included the kinematic wave method for surface flows and the dynamic wave method for pipe flow which together balance the need for accurate results with relatively shorter simulation times the city of edmonton provided a mike urban stormwater model for the 30th ave catchment built to the trunk level this level of detail allowed the simulation of urban floods but did not meet requirements for simulating water quality in sewers butler and davies 2011 hence the model was modified to include network components down to the smallest pipe section at the system s upstream ends at all study locations next to calibrate the model a sensitivity analysis was conducted for 34 parameters to identify critical model inputs parameter values were perturbed sequentially to examine the related variation in the fit between observations and model predictions using a procedure adapted from james 2005 and loucks and van beek 2017 these parameters included imperviousness catchment surface properties infiltration indices depression and initial losses and surface roughness for sample results see section a of the supplementary materials the sensitivity analysis results showed that model performance was very sensitive to surface roughness imperviousness and depression storage while changes in catchment length and infiltration parameters had relatively little effect therefore gis applications were used to improve estimates for some model parameters as described by liu et al 2010 aerial images and land use maps were used to adjust the imperviousness ratios of each catchment and digital elevation maps from the coe improved catchment slope calculations the following model efficiency assessment measures were used for model calibration br2 moriasi et al 2007 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 ritter and munoz carpena 2013 rmse legates and mccabe 1999 willmott 1981 and logarithmic nse which is a useful measure for low flow rate performance pushpalatha et al 2012 ye et al 1998 from the flow monitoring records of 2015 and 2016 rainfall events were identified to represent different storm durations patterns and magnitudes and their respective sewer flow hydrographs were measured at three different locations within the stormwater basin these events were then divided into two groups to be used in the calibration and validation processes a sample of twelve validation results is shown in section b of the supplementary materials which compares storm hydrographs from the uncalibrated and calibrated mike urban stormwater models against observed sewer flows values of the model efficiency measures used to assess the performance of the stormwater model pre and post calibration model and validation are shown in fig 5 where model accuracy was significantly improved in terms of model prediction errors as well as the correlation of both peak and low flows to observed stormwater discharges 3 4 python model vdcs available stormwater modeling software packages can only simulate the dissipation of degradable substances in water networks with constant decay coefficients therefore to define spatially and or temporally variable chemical decay coefficients it was necessary to develop a new simulation tool the resulting variable decay coefficients simulator vdcs a novel water quality model developed in python and the focus of this paper can simulate concentrations of a degradable chemical substance in any linear water system such as distribution and stormwater collection networks for ease of use vdcs was built to receive hydrodynamic simulation results from any existing stormwater modeling tool it applies the nth order decay model butler and davies 2011 to represent the degradation reactions of individual pollutants as 4 dc dt k c n where c is the substance concentration k is the decay constant and n is the order of the reaction with respect to that substance focusing on chloramine dissipation in this study the vdcs model applies a first order decay model following the recommendations and work of fisher et al 2009 lee et al 2003 and maier et al 2000 however vdcs can simulate lower or higher decay orders if required application of eq 3 generated the decay rates represented in fig 6 for the four different land uses in the current study where the decay rates start high at the beginning of release events and then decrease over time different water characteristics especially biofilm presence result in spatial variability in decay rates as well these differences among land uses were higher in absolute terms at the beginning of the event and then decreased toward the end of the simulations the water quality computation process in the vdcs is shown in fig 7 the first tier represents the required inputs to the vdcs in the form of spreadsheets either in csv or xls file formats inputs are categorized into three groups 1 sewer system attributes 2 hydrodynamic results from a stormsewer simulation and 3 pollutant introduction points and loads sewer system attribute data describe different system properties for sewer pipes manholes and outlets in terms of diameters lengths material and invert levels and manhole ids at both upstream and downstream ends of each pipe in the system the vdcs uses these data to reconstruct the physical layout and geometry of the water network from upstream branches diversion and collection nodes and through to the system outlet this reproduction of the network layout is required later to determine the paths of pollutants through the sewer system second hydrodynamic results from independent stormwater simulations are imported to provide time series of flow rates and velocities throughout the sewer system organization of the hydrodynamic results in spreadsheet form allows the vdcs to import them from any stormwater simulation model third pollutant introduction points such as fire hydrants and industrial releases are defined for specific locations in the drainage system along with variations of their loads over the simulation period finally the decay order is selected and the decay rate variation is set to one of three levels 1 constant average value 2 spatially varying per land use or 3 varying both spatially and temporally please refer to section d of the supplementary materials for further details on input file formats and organization employing the provided data sets the vdcs calculates concentrations of the degradable substance along its transit path through the sewer system to the system outlet the vdcs model computations start by identifying contamination paths which use the constructed network flow map to trace pollutants from previously defined introduction points from manhole to manhole to the system outlet the model then identifies common pollution paths stemming from pollutant introductions at different locations in the network and combines their loads in the subsequent water quality computations based on the concentration at introduction points and volumetric flow rates the pollutant load can be calculated and then tracked over the calculated contaminant path according to the selected decay order for chloramine dissipation with a first order decay model the vdcs calculates the concentration at the downstream node through 5 c ds c us e k t where cus and cds are the chloramine concentrations at upstream and downstream ends of the current sewer link respectively k is the first order decay coefficient and t is the travel time between the upstream and downstream nodes calculated from the pipe length and flow velocity depending on the selected decay coefficient behavior the vdcs sets the decay coefficient to a constant value or computes it at every timestep from eq 3 similarly beginning at the introduction points and then moving manhole to manhole to the system outlet the vdcs model applies eq 5 to calculate the concentration downstream based on a known upstream concentration at diversion or collection points downstream concentrations are calculated by converting all upstream concentrations to mass fluxes and then distributing the total mass to the downstream links according to their relative volumetric proportions assuming uniform and full mixing at all junctions the vdcs produces pollutographs for different system nodes such as manholes and outlets results can be exported to spreadsheets or plotted within the python environment as presented below in section 5 the vdcs results were verified against the mike urban stormwater model using the same inputs and chloramine loads 4 simulation scenarios a set of three simulation scenarios was designed to demonstrate the effects of spatial and temporal variation in decay coefficients on chloramine concentrations in a storm sewer system see table 2 these scenarios investigate the effects of 1 a constant decay rate which uses a fixed decay coefficient value throughout the sewer network over the simulation period 2 a spatially varying decay rate which specifies a fixed value for each land use type and 3 spatially and temporally varying decay rates that incorporate differences in land use types and times from initial pollutant releases the chloramine decay coefficient values for each scenario are shown in fig 8 and were determined from field sampling described by zhang et al 2018b for fixed decay coefficient values the performance of the vdcs model was tested under both wet and dry weather conditions as described in gaafar et al 2019 dry weather was defined as zero precipitation preceding and during the simulation period to achieve these conditions the stormwater model hydrological input was limited to point source discharges of chloraminated water without any additional hydrological input to represent rainfall or runoff wet and dry weather results consistently matched the chloramine concentrations generated by the mike urban water quality module r2 0 96 further lacking precipitation input to dilute chloramine pollutant loads and thus reduce its concentrations in the sewer network this scenario more clearly demonstrated chloramine decay behavior dry weather simulations are therefore the focus below because simulated chloramine concentrations were low throughout the sewer network during wet weather periods as found also in previous studies lee et al 2009 shrestha and he 2017 zhang et al 2018c gaafar et al 2019 4 1 scenario 1 validation of the variable decay coefficient simulator the first set of simulations assesses the performance of the vdcs against the mike urban model for the 30th ave catchment using a constant decay coefficient as in mike urban therefore in scenario 1a an arithmetically averaged decay coefficient value was applied as an input for both models as shown in fig 8 this scenario represents a practical case of a point source contaminant release from a single fire hydrant to demonstrate the chloramine dissipation process with network flow to the system outlet a similar approach could be taken to represent the effects of watermain breaks or prohibited industrial releases potentially important chloramine contamination sources with high flows over a relatively long period of time the simulated point source release from a hydrant next to manhole res1 fig 3 a in the residential neighborhood was simulated as a constant discharge of 150 l sec for two hours with an initial concentration of 2 0 mg l the regulated chloramine limit in drinking water next to validate vdcs performance under a different set of conditions scenario 1b was designed to represent nonpoint source chloramine releases from different land uses to replicate more general conditions where chloramine releases occur at the same time from a number of outdoor activities scenario 1b also applies a constant decay rate for both mike urban and the vdcs as shown in fig 8 in addition to model validation scenario 1b results are also compared with other scenario results to study the effects of decay coefficient variations on chloramine decay rates 4 2 scenario 2 effect of spatially variable decay coefficients the second set of scenarios investigated the effects of spatially variable decay coefficients with coefficient values dependent on the mix of land uses in each catchment temporal variations in decay rates were omitted such that each coefficient was constant over the simulation period as shown in fig 8 to provide a plausible lower bound estimate for the chloramine concentrations at the sewer outfall the highest plausible decay rate associated with a first flush event was used for scenario 2a scenario 2b was then used to assess a lower time averaged decay rate value for each land use type together this set of simulations illustrates the importance of selecting appropriate decay coefficient values for the different land use types for these scenarios although the land uses were limited to four main types residential commercial industrial and parks with the four individual decay rate values shown in fig 8 each catchment had unique chloramine load and decay coefficient values based on its drainage area and the proportional mix of the four land use types from the field sampling results to select appropriate time averaged decay coefficients for these simulations two decay rates were used as in scenario 1 the first flush decay rate and the average decay rate which were calculated as 6 k i i 1 n k n ε n where ki is the land use averaged decay coefficient of catchment i kn is the decay coefficient of land use n and εn is the percentage of land use n in catchment i as per the municipal land use maps 4 3 scenario 3 effect of spatially and temporally varying decay coefficients in the last scenario both spatial and temporal variabilities of the decay coefficients were simulated in the vdcs as shown in fig 8 this scenario was intended to represent a more realistic situation in which chloramine decay rates decreased with time with results applicable for water managers and decision makers for the regulation and treatment of degradable pollutants consequently scenario 3 represents a conservative case since the chloramine concentrations it simulates would be expected to be significantly higher throughout the sewer system and at the system outlet than in the other scenarios the average nonpoint chloramine load used in scenario 1b and 2 was applied to this scenario 5 results and discussion 5 1 vdcs model validation the first set of scenarios was intended to validate the vdcs against results from the mike urban water quality module scenario 1a simulates chloramine dissipation from a single potable water point source using the pipe flow hydrographs for hydrodynamic simulations from mike urban shown in fig 9 lag and attenuation effects are apparent in the flow hydrograph for discharge introduced at point h that traveled downstream through points j k and o see fig 1 a for the locations of these points fig 9 also shows that the corresponding chloramine concentrations decreased from the standard initial concentration of 2 0 mg l for tap water to reach 0 47 mg l at the system outfall point o a value that is still considerably higher than the allowable chloramine discharge concentration the chloramine concentrations peaks and patterns simulated by the vdcs closely matched those produced by the water quality module of mike urban as shown in the pollutographs of fig 9 b in terms of a statistical assessment of model performance the vdcs produced very high agreement at all points with mike urban results r2 0 98 rmse 0 02 mg l and nse 0 96 further the small discrepancies between the two results can be attributed to differences in the hydrodynamic input to the two water quality models mike urban used data directly generated from flow routing while the vdcs used flow parameters at set timestep intervals of 5 min an alternative view of scenario 1a focuses on longitudinal profiles of the chloramine concentration from the source at h to the system outfall at o a total length of about 5 0 km for specific initial release times as shown in fig 10 for example after 2 h t 2 0 the chloramine concentration was 2 0 mg l at point h km 0 0 dropped to 1 00 mg l after 2 0 km in the sewer line and reached 0 0 mg l after 3 0 km likewise after 8 0 h t 8 0 when the release event ended chloramine pollution no longer existed at the release point h while the maximum chloramine concentration along the release path was 0 53 mg l at km 1 75 longitudinal pollutant concentration profiles as presented in this work offer many clear advantages in understanding the transport of any contaminant in a stormwater system they simplify investigation of the propagation of the pollutant plume through the sewers identify the location and value of peak concentrations at different time intervals and mark time periods after which pollutant concentrations are below regulation limits throughout the water network in scenario 1b the vdcs was evaluated for nonpoint sources where chloramine effluents were defined as variable by land use the pipe flow hydrographs computed by mike urban at respective points a b c d j k and o on the main trunk see fig 1 a are shown in fig 11 a the passage of the stormwater wave through the drainage system is clearly visible beginning at point a and then increasing along the main trunk as the collected stormwater volume increased to reach its peak value at the system outfall point o because this scenario represented nonpoint contaminant sources the shapes of simulated hydrographs and their corresponding pollutographs were affected by many different characteristics of the sub catchments connected to the key manholes on the main trunk such as the drainage area geometry and land use types and their distributions within the various sub basins chloramine concentrations computed for point o with mike urban and the vdcs see fig 11 b using the decay rate value for scenario 1b from fig 8 were significantly higher than the allowable discharge concentration to surface waters over the entire simulation period comparison of the two sets of results also reveals high agreement of the vdcs to mike urban values as shown in fig 11 b the average values for the statistical measures were r2 0 97 rmse 0 026 mg l nrmse 7 74 and nse 0 94 note that the slightly higher differences in these measures resulted from the considerably higher flows encountered in scenario 1b 5 2 spatially variable decay coefficients scenarios 2a and 2b focused on model results for spatially variable but temporally constant decay coefficient values nonpoint source chloramine contaminants introduced to the stormwater model were set at the same level as scenario 1b as shown in fig 8 and pipe flow hydrographs computed by mike urban are shown in fig 12 a further pollutographs at the system outlet point o show chloramine concentrations at the system outlet above the allowable discharge concentration to surface waters as shown in fig 12 b the average concentrations in scenario 2b were consistently higher than those of scenario 2a which used the first flush decay coefficients because of the significant difference between the two decay coefficient values however the first flush values were used to generate a lower bound scenario for chloramine concentrations which is not intended to be realistic over the entire simulation period such high decay rates tend to last only briefly after chloramine introduction because of the reduction in chloramine dissipation by biofilm over time kohpaei et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 interestingly the differences between the scenario results were not constant throughout the simulation period for instance during the first quarter of the simulation period the difference between the computed concentrations in the two scenarios reached a maximum relative value of 38 for the chloramine levels of scenario 2a while the results of scenario 2b were 67 higher than scenario 2a by the end of the simulation period over the full simulation period the average difference in the two pollutographs was 43 a significant difference in chloramine concentrations in the sewer system this comparison illustrates the importance of selecting an appropriate coefficient value even where the temporal change in decay coefficients is ignored 5 3 impact of spatial and temporal variability of in the decay coefficient the scenarios of group 3 incorporated both temporal and spatial variations in the decay coefficient see fig 8 and applied the pipe flow hydrographs shown in fig 12 a results from the three varying levels of the decay rates constant spatially variable and temporally and spatially variable are shown in fig 13 the following analysis focuses on the stormwater outlet because of its proximity to the receiving waters overall the results of spatial disaggregation considered in scenario 2b showed very high agreement with scenario 1b because of the small differences in the decay coefficient values between the two scenarios interestingly despite the incorporation of different decay coefficients for specific land uses in scenario 2b the spatially averaged decay coefficient value was quite similar to the single decay coefficient used in scenario 1b see fig 13 however because this result may have stemmed from the combination of decay coefficient values for the included land use types it should not be taken as a general conclusion of the current work in contrast to the similarity between scenarios 1b and 2b incorporation of both spatial and temporal variations in the decay coefficients in scenario 3 produced a significantly different pollutograph shown in fig 13 the maximum simulated concentration in scenario 3 was 0 65 mg l which comes closest to 0 7 mg l the measured concentration at the system outlet of the 30th ave basin during field samples in summer 2015 zhang et al 2018c interestingly the rank of scenario 3 changed over time relative to the other scenarios from relatively low for the first quarter of the simulation period where it lay between the values for scenarios 2b and 2a to the highest value in the last three quarters further as the stormwater volumes collected from farther neighborhoods began to reach the system outlet by the second third of the simulation period the differences between the scenarios became more visible with higher chloramine concentrations in scenario 3 than in scenarios 1b and 2b this result can be attributed to higher decay rates for case 1b and 2b in this part of the simulation period finally in the last third of the simulation period the concentrations of scenario 3 were at a maximum of about 100 higher than those predicted in scenario 2a in absolute terms the highest predicted chloramine concentrations at the outlet point o were 0 54 0 32 0 55 and 0 65 mg l for scenarios 1b 2a 2b and 3 respectively due to the much lower chloramine decay rates in scenario 3 than in the other scenarios it is important to consider mass fluxes in addition to concentrations system operators and managers prioritize pollutant concentrations over mass fluxes both because concentrations can be measured more easily in the field and because guidelines like those of the ccme focus on maximum allowable concentrations however maximum mass fluxes may not occur concurrently with maximum concentrations for example in the first third of the simulation period the concentrations shown on the pollutograph were relatively high however the corresponding mass flux of 0 5 g s at t 1 hr was low because of a relatively low discharge at that time in the middle third which had the lowest concentrations at the outfall the maximum discharge occurred and a high mass flux of 5 7 g s at t 4 hr resulted finally by the end of the simulation period with the highest concentrations at the system outfall the corresponding discharge was relatively low and a similar mass flux of 5 1 g s at t 7 hr resulted the difference between mass fluxes and concentrations shows that care must be taken in the analysis and interpretation of model results and that a focus only on pollutant concentrations may omit potential environmental consequences of high mass low concentration releases of pollutants regulators and water managers should incorporate mass fluxes as parameters in guidelines and regulations 6 conclusions this study investigated the importance of spatial and temporal variability of monochloramine dissipation rates in stormwater networks the new variable decay coefficient simulator model vdcs was developed to simulate spatial and temporal variations in coefficient values and field measurements and results from dhi s mike urban simulations with constant coefficient values were used to validate model performance three scenarios were designed to compare the application of 1 constant decay coefficient values throughout the sewer network over the simulation period with 2 spatially varying decay rates per land use type and 3 spatially and temporally varying decay rates that incorporate changes in coefficient values with time from the initial pollutant releases comparison of the scenario results demonstrated the importance of including both temporal and spatial variations of decay coefficients when simulating degradable chemical pollutants in sewer systems the combination of spatial and temporal variability in chloramine decay rates affected the predicted chloramine concentrations significantly with implications for environmental regulations to accommodate variable decay rates for degradable chemicals the available water quality models require modification in their current state they omit important dynamics of pollutant concentrations in stormwater systems and may underpredict discharge concentrations with adverse consequences for the quality of receiving water bodies for future studies an extensive stormwater quality monitoring program is recommended to improve water quality simulations that involve degradable chemicals in stormwater networks although resource intensive and potentially costly such monitoring programs would improve the estimation of pollutant decay rates improve understanding of the role of different land uses and pollutant loads on pollutant concentrations and aid validation of stormwater quality simulations finally especially for dry weather conditions close attention should be paid to chloraminated effluents toward the middle and end of the discharge period rather than at the early stages of release events after a dry period which would allow biofilms to accumulate both chloramine mass fluxes and concentrations would initially be relatively low but they rise significantly as decay rates decrease and more distant sections of the drainage system contribute to produce higher flow rates results will differ by basin geometry the mixture of land uses and system attributes and water use and quality characteristics and so pollutants must be assessed for each stormwater basin individually 7 data availability the model generated by the study is available from the corresponding author on request credit authorship contribution statement

5148,the changes of terrestrial water storage tws is critical for drought monitoring water and food security global water cycle and climate change studies currently the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellites are unique means of observing large scale water storage variations but the short time series 2002 present limits their applications in long term climatic and hydrologic studies although the tws can be calculated from global land surface models large uncertainties arise due to uncertainties of inputs and the limitations of the models this study developed a reconstruction model for grace tws anomalies twsa based on the global land data assimilation system gldas model outputs by using a random forest rf regression approach a spatially moving window smw structure was introduced when training the rf model to address the spatial variations of twsa and a linear regression approach lr was also used for comparison purpose long term twsa over china land area were generated based on the proposed approaches and results were validated through cross validation and comparisons with reference datasets as a result the rf based model outperforms the lr based model and the reconstructed twsa by using the two models both well reproduce grace dataset and outperform the twsa that are derived directly from gldas models moreover the twsa produced by using the presented models have good agreements with another global grace based reconstructed twsa dataset and in situ soil moisture measurements importance value for each variable in the rf model was quantified as well as the spatial coefficients for each variable in the lr model the importance values and regression coefficients present varying spatial patterns rather than modifying the land surface model structure and inputs this study provides alternative ways of improving the tws estimations of gldas and extending time range of grace datasets the experiments are expected to promote and enrich the methodologies and theories of combining physical and statistical models for optimal simulations in geoscientific research keywords terrestrial water storage anomalies grace land surface model random forest moving window 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws is the sum of soil water land surface water groundwater canopy water and snow water rodell and famiglietti 1999 rodell et al 2004 long term variation information of the tws is beneficial for drought assessment and prediction and has great significance to water resources management global water cycle and climate change studies seyoum and milewski 2017 yang et al 2017 satellite remote sensing has outperformed classical ground based monitoring approaches in large scale water resources research depending on its advantages in real time and widely ranging detection with low cost tucker 1980 gao 1996 for example global inland water and glacier snow can be mapped at high spatial resolutions 10 30 m by using optical remote sensing techniques immerzeel et al 2009 feng et al 2016 and global precipitation rates and land surface soil water content can be obtained from satellite based microwave sensors ulaby batlivala and dobson 1978 njoku et al 2002 zhan et al 2006 huffman et al 2007 however regional water storage balance is difficult to be estimated from those sensors because of the optical and microwave sensors inability to detect the water stored in root zone and underground the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace project is an observation mission on earth s gravity field that collaborated by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german aerospace center the grace twin satellites were launched in 2002 global water storage anomalies have been obtained by measuring the earth s gravity field changes landerer and swenson 2012 scanlon et al 2016 the water storage anomalies products are extremely beneficial to water balance research because they provide more direct estimation of the tws variation than global land surface models and hydrological models tang et al 2010 huang et al 2012 scanlon longuevergne and long 2012 dieng et al 2015 mo et al 2016 yao et al 2016 but their applications in hydrological process are still restricted by the short period forced by long term climate datasets precipitation and air temperature global land surface models and hydrological models are able to simulate historical hydrology and energy fluxes rodell et al 2004 estimation of long term tws is then possible based on the models simulations however uncertainties of current models combined with the quality of forcing data greatly reduce the ability of the models to simulate real conditions qian et al 2006 hence discrepancies between the tws changes born from the surface hydrological models and the tws anomalies twsa datasets provided by grace observations are expected as a matter of fact those discrepancies were revealed globally in number of basins yang et al 2013 scanlon et al 2018 combining grace observations with global land surface models outputs for improving the twsa estimation has been increasingly concerned in recent years long et al 2014 nie et al 2015 the grace observations provide more reliable estimation on the tws changes than global models and the simulations of historical hydrometeorological variables from the models are able to estimate extensive tws time series although uncertainties exist in the model born tws simulations their close relationships with grace results make it possible to develop reliable long term twsa datasets the tws changes estimated from water balance basis are approximately linearly related to grace twsa in some basins nile et al 2015 implemented a linear model to link global land data assimilation system gldas tws estimation to grace twsa and reconstructed twsa from 1948 to 2012 by using the linear model in the amazon basin nie et al 2015 based on the similar principle humphrey et al 2017 made it a step forward by developing a polynomial regression model between grace twsa and reanalysis climatic variables precipitation and temperature in the same basin humphrey gudmundsson and seneviratne 2017 the reconstruction of long term twsa also can rely on relationship between groundwater level or sea surface temperature and twsa for example becker et al 2011 reconstructed twsa of amazon basin from 1980 to 2008 based on the correlations between twsa and station based groundwater observations becker et al 2011 de linage et al 2014 examined a lagged correlation between tropical pacific and north atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies and predicted historical tws change using the relationship de linage famiglietti and randerson 2014 however these reconstructions are based on 1 d time series and are subject to in situ observations with high quality and the specific correlation it is difficult to apply such empirical approaches to other basins dominated by tropical climate and the largest rainforest in the world the amazon basin has plenty of rainfall all year around local correlations between terrestrial water balance and atmospheric or oceanic variables are possible to be simulated by using classical regression models however it is less easy to directly use such approaches in arid and sub arid basins which always have great spatially heterogeneous climate conditions and intense human activities yang et al 2018 rising of machine learning approaches has greatly improved our ability to simulate and predict the world successful stories in diverse geo scientific applications such as weather prediction land cover mapping and soil type mapping grimm et al 2008 rogan et al 2008 bauer thorpe and brunet 2015 have increasingly added new possibilities and better theories in earth system modelling integrating machine learning into the twsa reconstruction model is a beneficial alternative perspective where physical model is uncertain and traditional statistical approach is weak promotive attempt has been made in southwest china by long et al 2014 using grace data and artificial neural network ann model long et al 2014 they reconstructed grace twsa over the yun gui plateau back to 1980 s by training an ann model between grace data and other in situ and model data but the weak interpretability of ann algorithm reduces the benefits of integrating it into geo scientific modelling where interpretability is important the random forest algorithm rf a popular and efficient machine learning approach has increasingly been applied to geoscience and remote sensing problems and has obtained outstanding results at local and global scales grimm et al 2008 kühnlein et al 2014 hengl et al 2017 in addition tree based model structure of rf makes it possible to evaluate variables importance by quantifying their contributions to the trees nodes this provides a perspective for understanding the variables contributions to tws simulation in this study we attempt to link gldas model outputs to the grace twsa datasets by using the random forest regression algorithm for extending grace twsa time series a spatially moving window structure is used when training the random forest model to address spatial differences of the matching patterns between grace observation and gldas model outputs a case study was conducted on two different released grace solutions over china land area which covering landscapes and climate zones with great varieties the twsa over the study area were reconstructed back to 1948 by using the presented approaches the results were compared with gldas born twsa and another reconstructed grace based dataset as well as in situ soil moisture measurements the presented models are expected to add new perspective to hybrid model development of combining physical models and statistical approaches 2 study area and data resource 2 1 study area the study area is china land area excluding south china

the center for space research at university of texas austin csr and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl respectively the tws products are obtained by using the mass concentration blocks mascons techniques the mascons techniques make the implementation of geophysical constraints which are referred as mascons the latest jpl mascons jpl m solution watkins et al 2015 tellus 2018 used in this study is the rl06 at 1 2 0 5 degree resolution from https podaac jpl nasa gov grace the csr mascons csr m rl06 solution save bettadpur and tapley 2016 save 2019 is obtained from http www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html the csr m rl06 solution is provided at 1 4 0 25 degree grids and the dataset were re sampled to 0 5 spatial resolution by using arithmetic mean method to keep consistent with the jpl m solution the two solutions differ in terms of the employed processing algorithms and for more detailed information about the grace mission and the solutions processing algorithms the readers can refer to the related publications watkins et al 2015 save et al 2016 wiese landerer and watkins 2016 in this study the twsa reconstruction models are examined on the csr m and jpl m solutions respectively to investigate the differences all the data described are provided as anomalies relative to the january 2004 december 2009 time mean baseline therefore the tws datasets from grace are referred as terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa in this study 2 3 the gldas models forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from princeton university sheffield goteti and wood 2006 the global land data assimilation system gldas model provides optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 current gldas version 2 0 gldas 2 0 model simulations are initialized on simulation date january 1 1948 extending through 2014 daily products from gldas 2 0 catchment model at spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 were used in this study in the catchment model snow water storage snws canopy water storage cws soil moisture sms and groundwater storage gws are simulated and the sms includes surface smss profile smsp and root zone smsrz table 2 the tws simulation of the catchment model calculated by summing these components were used for comparison in this study moreover there is another gldas 2 0 model noah differing from catchment model the noah model does not contain simulation of groundwater storage therefore the noah model outputs was not used for training the model in this study but considering the tws from the noah model is also widely used for comparison with grace observations we also considered the tws data in the noah model for comparison with the reconstruction results in this study the catchment twsa and noah twsa were generated the same way as grace results subtracting arithmetic average tws from january 2004 to december 2009 from original tws series 2 4 auxiliary data used for comparison 2 4 1 the grace rec datasets another grace based twsa reconstruction dataset was used for comparison with the results in this study the grace rec dataset includes several sub datasets that were reconstructed based on different meteorological forcing datasets humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the grace rec constructs tws changes on a water balance basis and then calibrates them by using the grace observations the released grace rec products are deseasonalized twsa data after removing the seasonal cycle and the datasets are available on https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 7670849 in this study two monthly grace rec datasets based on the jpl m rl06 solution were used for comparison they are generated from two different meteorological forcing datasets respectively which are the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis era5 and the global soil wetness project phase 3 gswp3 thus the two grace rec datasets are referred as jpl m era and jpl m gswp in the following parts the jpl m era and jpl m gwsp are provided at the same spatial resolution 0 5 and different time spans the jpl m era covers 1979 2014 while the jpl m gswp are provided over the period of 1901 2014 2 4 2 soil moisture measurements china cropland soil moisture in situ dataset includes soil moisture measurements collected from 778 cropland sites at temporal resolution of 10 days from 1991 to 2003 the relative soil moisture at five difference depths 0 10 cm 0 20 cm 0 50 cm 0 70 cm and 0 100 cm the relative soil moisture is defined as the ratio in percentage of water in weight to the field capacity in weight of the measured soil layer the original dataset was obtained from the national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn data and it has been widely used for mapping agricultural droughts validating remotely sensed and reanalysis soil moisture products and improving land surface model s soil moisture simulation over china area liu and xie 2013 lai et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 there are absent records in the original dataset therefore it was preprocessed before being used the sites with observation extension less than three years 36 months were removed and because most of the records at soil depth of 0 70 cm and 0 100 cm is absent only the measurements at depth of 0 50 cm were used in this study the spatial distribution of the thirty qualified sites after being preprocessed are shown in fig 2 these sites are mainly in north china and most of them are located in the yellow river basin monthly soil moisture was calculated by averaging the 10 days time series 3 methods 3 1 combination of the random forest and a spatially moving window structure the basic concept of the rf based tws reconstruction model is to fit the matching patterns between the grace twsa and the anomalies of the catchment model simulations of tws components the model is given by an expression between dependent variables twsa and the corresponding independent variables listed in table 2 1 twsa i j f snwsa i j cwsa i j smsa s i j smsa p i j smsa rz i j gwsa i j where twsa i j represents the grace twsa at the grid of location i j the snwsa i j cwsa i j smsa s i j smsa p i j smsa rz i j and gwsa i j are the anomalies relative to the baseline of 2004 2009 of snws cws sms and gws from the catchment model at the grid of location i j the random forest rf regression algorithm which is an outstanding ensemble learning method that combines multiple estimators to obtain better predictions breiman 2001 is used to learn the f x i j the model is learned at a 0 5 0 5 grid scale and a spatially moving window smw structure is used to address the spatial variations of f x i j instead of simply including geolocations in the model the smw consists of the following major steps as well as illustrated in fig 3 1 a moving window of w w grids rolls through the twsa grids with size of i j rows columns at a step of s see step 0 in fig 3 for each window k all the grids w w within the window are input in a local rf model for training referred as rf k 2 the learning process of rf k follows the standard random forest regression algorithm breiman 2001 that can be briefly depicted as follows n tree a subsets are drawn randomly from the total training set in window k with replacement size of each subset is 2 3 of the total set in the window b for each subset in n tree a classification and regression tree cart model is generated the cart algorithm is a classical binary classification or regression tree algorithm proposed by breiman breiman et al 1984 a cart tree is built from a learning sample of size n the tree is a binary tree and is generated by splitting samples recursively into two children nodes t l and t r and the parent node of t l and t r is node t referred as n t meaning number of samples at node t the value to split the node t is s t s the s t is one of the independent variables and the s is the corresponding value the best variable s t and the corresponding best value s that used to split the node t are determined by searching the s t s that could maximize the decrease of impurity between t and its two children nodes the decrease of impurity is expressed as 2 δ i s t i t p l i t l p r i t r where s t and s are the best variables and best values to split the node t respectively and p l n t l n t and p r n t r n t n t l and n t r are number of samples in the two children node t l and t r the i t is the impurity measurement function that defines the variety of samples in a node t 3 i t 1 n t i 1 n t y i y where n t is number of samples in node t y i is the input instance value for a sample i in the node t and y is the mean value of y given by 1 n t i 1 n t y i thus samples in each terminal node have the optimized purity and the lowest variation the predicted output y for a new sample in that individual tree is the value of the node reached by the sample when it is splitted by those best s t s throughout the tree c predictions for new samples can be made by averaging the predictions from all the individual regression trees 4 f 1 n tree i 1 n tree f i x where n tree is the number of trees and f i x is the prediction from each individual regression tree in random forest algorithm over fitting can be controlled through the random sampling and averaging prediction process according to the developer of rf algorithm breiman 2001 larger n tree is recommended to produce higher predictive accuracy and less over fitting the n tree was set as 200 in this study 3 all the grids in the window k w w grids are given the fitted rf k model in step 2 the score of the model at window k is evaluated based on the coefficient of determination r2 in the next window k 1 the rf k 1 are fitted based on the same process in the former step the score of the model in the window k 1 is referred as r k 1 2 and for the overlapped grids between window k and k 1 see red grids in step 0 in fig 3 if the new model s score r k 1 2 is higher than that of the prior window s r k 2 the models of these overlapped grids are replaced with the new model of window k 1 step 2 in fig 3 as a result the rf models at grids in each window can be obtained by the recursively updating step 3 in fig 3 interpretation of machine learning model is significant for model application individual trees can be interpreted easily by simply plotting the tree structure however it is less easy to inspect hundreds of trees by simply plotting them variable importance ranking provides a tool to evaluate the importance of each variable to the rf model breiman 2001 the importance of variable x j is given as 5 v i x j 1 n tree m 1 n tree v s t x j p t δ i s t t where p t is the proportion n t n of samples reaching t and v s t is the variable used in split s t and m 1 2 3 n tree concept behind the variable importance evaluation approach is to add up the weighted impurity decreases p t δ i s t t for all nodes t where x j is used and variable importance of x j is obtained by averaging over all n tree trees in the forest by applying the spatially moving window structure when training the rf model the variable importance values can be calculated grid by grid this provides an insight into how the variable importance of the rf model vary spatially for estimating the tws changes over the study area 3 2 a linear regression model solution in addition to the rf based model a local linear regression model based on the same spatially moving window structure was also implemented to reconstruct the twsa for comparison in the linear regression solution a same spatially moving window is used but it is assumed that the grace twsa can be expressed as a local linear function with coefficients between the anomalies of snws cws sms and gws from the catchment model in window k the local linear function can be expressed as follow 6 twsa i j α 0 i j snwsa i j α 1 i j cwsa i j α 2 i j smsa s i j α 3 i j smsa p i j α 4 i j smsa rz i j α 5 i j gwsa i j β i j where twsa i j represents the grace twsa at the grid of location i j the snwsa i j cwsa i j smsa s i j smsa p i j smsa rz i j and gwsa i j are the anomalies relative to the baseline of 2004 2009 of snws cws sms and gws from the catchment model at the grid of location i j and α 0 i j α 1 i j α 5 i j are the corresponding coefficients β i j is the constant value of the location i j to obtain estimated coefficients and constant at each grid the ordinary least squares regression method is used to fit the coefficients and constant of the function in the window k 7 twsa k α 0 k snwsa k α 1 k cwsa k α 2 k smsa s k α 3 k smsa p k α 4 k smsa rz k α 5 k gwsa k β k where k represents the window average value α 0 k α 1 k α 5 k and β k are the coefficients and constant all the grids in the window k w w grids are given the fitted coefficients and constant of eq 7 the score of the model at window k is evaluated based on the coefficient of determination r2 in the next window k 1 the coefficients α 0 k 1 α 1 k 1 α 5 k 1 and constant β k 1 are fitted by using the same process in the former step the score of the model in the window k 1 is referred as r k 1 2 and for the overlapped grids between window k and k 1 if the new model s score r k 1 2 is higher than that of the prior window s r k 2 the coefficients of these overlapped grids are replaced with the new coefficients of the model of window k 1 the regression coefficients at grids in each window can be obtained by the recursively updating the past grace consistent twsa is then can be simulated by using the regression coefficients based on eq 6 3 3 time series decomposition the twsa series need to be deseasonalized to estimate the trends of total water storage changes the seasonal trend decomposition using local regression loess stl proposed by cleveland et al cleveland et al 1990 was used in this study to decompose twsa monthly time series the stl was reported to be a versatile and robust method for decomposing time series lu 2003 key to the stl approach is loess local regression smoothing the loess fits a smoothed series g j from an input time series x j x tj where tj is a sequence of discrete sampling times the smoothed value at each point j is given by the value at time tj of a polynomial fitted to the sampled values of x over a window j q j q with decreasing weight assigned to points in this window as their distance from point j increases the stl consists of outer and inner loops with a sequence of smoothing operator loess and generates three components from a time series cleveland and cleveland 1990 9 s total s long t r e n d s seasonal s residual in the outer loop the weights are assigned to each data point in the inner loop the trend and seasonal components are iteratively updated a the current estimate of the trend initialize trend as 0 is subtracted from the raw series b the detrended time series is then partition into cycle subseries in this study the series is monthly then there are 12 cycle subseries all januarys will be one cycle subseries all february a second etc c the cycle subseries are loess smoothed and then passed through a moving average low pass filter of length 12 monthly series the seasonal components are the loess smoothed cycle subseries minus the result from the low pass filter d the seasonal components are subtracted from the raw data to generate deseasonalized series the deseasonalized series after removing seasonal cycles are smoothed by loess which becomes the trend what is left is the residuals the twsa trends are the linear trends estimated from the long trend components and the deseasonalized twsa are the desesonalized series after removing seasonal cycles for more details of the stl decomposition approach we refer the reader to the related publications of cleveland et al 1990 lu 2003 4 results and analysis 4 1 reconstruction of twsa and cross validation the random forest rf and linear regression lr reconstruction model based on the spatially moving window framework were run through two grace twsa solutions csr m and jpl m separately in this study the window size of 6 6 grids approximating 3 3 caps of the mascons solution and the step size of 2 grids 1 were used for january to december all the data of the specific month from 2003 to 2014 were input for fitting the rf and lr models of that month except for the validation period of 2007 2009 therefore there are twelve groups of models e g one group for all januarys another group for all februarys etc all the land grids within the extent of 73 135 e and 17 56 n were used as samples to train the models to keep the integrity of the training and mapping ranges and the following analysis was based on the mask of china main land area fig 4 shows the spatial patterns of the reconstructed twsa of january and july in 2008 as well as the twsa from grace solutions and the land surface models great discrepancies can be interpreted between twsa of catchment noah model and those of grace solutions according to fig 4 g h o p for example relative to the grace solutions the catchment model fail to capture notable negative twsa in the southwest and the noah model overestimates the twsa negatives in the southwest and northeast in january 2008 the rf based twsa perfectly capture the spatial pattern of grace twsa the lr based twsa match with the grace observations better than the catchment and noah twsa but not as well as those from rf models scatter plots between grace twsa reconstructed twsa and catchment noah twsa of the validation period 2007 2009 further illustrate their differences fig 5 the reconstructed twsa and catchment noah twsa were aggregated to a unified spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 to generate the scatter plots the catchment and noah twsa according to fig 5 e h are obviously inferior to the rf and lr twsa in comparison with the grace results with lower r2 and higher rmse the rf model outperforms the lr model with higher r2 0 65 for jpl m and 0 80 for csr m and lower rmse 3 37 cm for jpl m and 2 15 cm for csr m besides the presented reconstruction models perform better on the grace csr m than the jpl m solution this is probably partly subject to the more smoothed grids of the csr m solution compared with the jpl m according to fig 4 signals in the csr m solution have more gradual change when comparing with the sharp step change in the jpl m solution and less spatially heterogeneous surface is more likely to be accurately predicted garrigues et al 2006 garrigues allard and baret 2008 zhu et al 2010 temporal performance of the deseasonalized twsa is then examined from basin averaged twsa time series in the nine major basins of china fig 6 fig 7 presents the correlation maps between the deseasonalized twsa from grace solutions and the reconstructed twsa based on the validation period of 2007 2009 the catchment noah twsa and two grace rec twsa jpl m era and jpl m gswp are also presented in fig 6 and fig 7 on the basin scale the rf and lr model well reproduce the grace twsa time series during both entire 2003 2014 period and the validation period of 2007 2009 the rf based twsa have better correlations with the grace solutions than the twsa from other models and resources the lr based results have comparable performance with the grace rec datasets except for the continental basin yellow river basin and haihe river basin in these basins the jpl m era twsa time series have better correlations with the grace solutions than the lr results the catchment and noah model overestimate the twsa in the continental basin yellow river basin haihe river basin and songhua and liaohe river basin according to fig 6 this is consistent with previous findings scanlon et al 2018 the presented models as well as the jpl m era dataset can calibrate these overestimations according to fig 6 the jpl m gswp dataset performs worse than the jpl m era and it has much negative biased twsa estimations in continental basin southwest basin and yangtze river basin these biased estimations are probably related to the initial value of the grace rec method in the grace rec model the reconstruction of tws anomalies is based on the initial value at the very beginning of the time series the first year the beginning of the jpl gswp time series is 1901 uncertainties and missing records in the historical meteorological dataset may produce twsa estimation bias 4 2 extended grace twsa and trends to obtain the past changes of tws throughout the study area the dataset covering 2003 2014 were input to the rf and lr models and the trained models were used to reconstruct the past grace consistent twsa data shown in fig 8 are the basin averaged rf and lr based twsa and grace rec twsa time series from 1948 to 2014 in the nine basins and the csr m and jpl m twsa from 2003 to 2014 are also displayed the 2003 2014 period is marked with red background in the panels the whole period is divided into six sub periods 1948 1960 p1 1961 1970 p2 1971 1980 p3 1981 1990 p4 1991 2000 p5 2001 2014 p6 and the correlation maps between the twsas during each period in each basin are displayed in fig 9 the twsa produced by the rf and lr models are consistent with the grace twsa according to fig 8 before 2003 the rf and lr twsa have consistent temporal variations with the jpl m era time series covering 1979 2014 compared with the jpl m gswp the jpl m era is more consistent with the grace observations due to negative bias of jpl m gswp relative to the grace observations in some basins the correlations between jpl m gswp and the twsa from the presented reconstruction models vary in different basins extreme inconsistent correlations between the jpl gswp and the rf and lr twsa can be detected in the continental and southwest basin during p1 and p2 fig 9 but their temporal variations become more consistent after 1970 s fig 10 displays the twsa trends in each basin during six sub periods the trends derived from the csr m and jpl m solution are generally consistent but differences can be detected between the twsa trends from the rf model and the twsa trends from the lr model in the yellow river basin huaihe river basin and southeast river basin specifically the trends estimated from the lr based twsa are more negative than those from the rf based twsa in these three basins especially in p2 for example the trends of the lr based twsa in the yellow river basin and huaihe river basin in p2 are around 0 4 cm yr and 2 8 cm yr respectively fig 10 b h much negative than the trends of the rf based twsa 0 2 cm yr for the yellow river basin and 1 cm yr for the huaihe river basin the trends from the rf based twsa and the jpl m gswp are consistent in those two basins yellow river basin huaihe river basin as well as the songhua and liaohe river basin during the entire period in general the evolutions of the twsa trends through the entire period have good agreement in most basins except for continental basin and southeast basin 4 3 comparison with in situ soil moisture measurements fig 11 shows the comparisons between the rf twsa and monthly soil moisture of profile 0 50 cm obtained from china agricultural soil moisture dataset and their correlation coefficients are shown in fig 12 since there are several missing values in the in situ soil moisture the number of available records at each site is also shown for reference although there are a number of missing records it can be inferred from the time series that the reconstructed twsa are generally consistent with the in situ soil moisture variations and capture the peak and valley of soil moisture time series according to fig 11 the variation of the reconstructed twsa has good agreement with in situ soil moisture at most examined sites and their overall change trends are consistent the correlation coefficient r at each site ranges between 0 2 0 8 and at most sites the r values are around 0 5 the r is low at sites with inadequate records such as no 51238 and no 51358 but at some sites with more than 80 records the r value is also lower than 0 4 such as no 53915 and no 53926 the correlations between tws variations and subsurface water content are mainly involved with root zone soil moisture and groundwater level rodell et al 2009 tian et al 2019 because groundwater accounts for majority of tws although profile soil moisture variations can partly indicate regional water storage changes because soil water content contributes to groundwater recharge rushton and ward 1979 zhang et al 1999 their connection is weaker than that between groundwater and tws changes the reconstructed twsa by using the presented models generally have good agreement with in situ soil moisture at most sites examined in this study suggesting good performance of the presented models in estimating past twsa in the study area however since the comparison was conducted based on soil moisture measurements at 0 50 cm which only indicates water content variations in the shallow soil layer interpretation of the results should be regarded as indirect evaluation instead of validated accuracy 4 4 model interpretation variable importance vi values provide possibilities of evaluating significance of each independent variable to the rf model given the huge spatial variations in tws changes throughout the study area significance spatial differences of the variable importance in the rf model are not unexpected by combining the rf and the moving window approach variable importance can be provided on a grid cell level thus the spatial patterns of variable importance can be mapped fig 13 presents the spatial patterns of the average variable importance for the rf model and the monthly variable importance maps for some selected months e g february april june august october and december are displayed in fig s1 and fig s2 fig 14 summarizes the violin plots for the gridded average variable importance for the csr m solution in each basin and the summary for the jpl m solution is presented in fig s3 in general the variables importance values have spatially and temporally varying patterns for example the snwsa has extremely low importance values close to 0 throughout the most parts of the study area except for tibetan plateau and high latitude areas in june and august fig s1 and fig s2 which are summer months of northern hemisphere the importance value of gwsa is remarkably high in north china plain and northeast china plain fig 13 f l which are under heavy irrigation and have been hot spots of groundwater declining regions in asia kendy et al 2004 shi et al 2011 feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 min shen and pei 2015 chen et al 2018 this can also be implied from the violin plots of feature importance in the yellow river basin haihe river basin and huaihe river basin fig 14 b c h anomalies in profile and root zone soil moisture and groundwater storage have notable significance to the rf models this is rational because they are major components of the terrestrial water storage and are closely correlated with the changes of tws hirschi seneviratne and schär 2006 rodell et al 2009 pokhrel et al 2013 soni and syed 2015 the variable importance is beneficial to explain the relative significance of the variables in the rf based model however it is impossible to address how exactly they contributes to the model because the variable importance values are measured by calculating their contributions to the tree nodes therefore the variable importance is a relative indicator rather than a real contribution measurement of independent variables to the target hence variable importance should be interpreted with additional cautions the lr based model gives the regression coefficients in each grid fig s4 and fig s5 the spatial patterns of the snws anomalies snwsa in winter months are significantly different from those in other months from december to april the coefficients of snwsa are in large range over northeast and northwest areas where are usually deep snow regions during winter months dahe shiyin and peiji 2006 wang and he 2013 the anomalies of profile soil moisture smsap and groundwater storage gwsa have larger coefficients than other variables this is consistent with the patterns of variable importance of the rf models it should be noted that the variables are anomalies therefore the positive negative regression coefficients of the variables do not indicate exactly their positive negative contributions to the twsa the constant values account for the parts that cannot be well estimated by the independent variables in january and december remarkable negative constants can be detected in the himalayas and its surrounding areas suggesting that the catchment model overestimates twsa in these areas relative to grace observations in winter months in addition such negative constant also can be found in north china plain the regression coefficients in the lr models and the variable importance in the rf models show general consistent patterns but differences are detected on the canopy water storage anomalies cwsa variable according to fig s4 and fig s5 the coefficients of the cwsa are in narrow ranges because the cws accounts for only a fraction of the tws however the cwsa has significant variable importance in the rf models except for some agricultural regions e g north china plain and northeast china plain where groundwater storage is declining because of intense human withdrawals one possible explanation is that the variable importance calculated in the rf model is a relative indicator differing from linear regression coefficients more important the capacity of canopy water storage is a key factor in controlling the rainfall interception and regional hydrological process wang et al 2012 the respond of cwsa to precipitation is instant and significant correlations can be detected between them zhang et al 2019 since precipitation is the most important factor that drives hydrological process and water balance the significant importance values of cwsa in the rf model are not unexpected 5 discussion 5 1 what causes the differences in twsa between grace and gldas models the discrepancies in twsa from gldas and grace products were acknowledged and discussed from different perspectives in previous researches major reasons leading to such inconsistencies can be attributed to model structure and inputs model structure the twsa derived from the gldas models are not strictly equal to the grace observations the storages of surface water and groundwater are not included in all the gldas models except for catchment model the contribution of sws and gws variations to the tws changes could not be neglected especially in arid and semiarid regions because in the arid region variations in surface water and groundwater are more intense than in the humid areas with abundant rainfall and low evapotranspiration hence we can see more obvious differences in twsa between gldas and grace results in arid and semiarid basins than the humid basins in this study however inclusion of gws in catchment model doesn t produce better agreement between gldas born twsa and grace results a possible explanation is that the model may lack sufficient capacities to give highly reliable groundwater simulations another constrains comes from the gldas models inability to simulate human interventions the north china plain including huaihe river basin haihe river basin and lower yellow river basin is a well known hot spot region of groundwater loss that is attributed to irrigation feng et al 2013 in regions where human induced water use is the main driver of tws changes we would expect twsa from gldas models to be more positive or less negative than that of grace observation it is true in this study that gldas born twsa are more positive than the grace results in these basins which are more vulnerable to human interventions model inputs input datasets of the gldas include climatic forcing data and land surface state data the climatic forcing data include downward short and longwave radiation specific humidity surface air pressure and wind speed and land surface state data are elevation land cover and soils datasets the forcing data are from global meteorological forcing dataset from princeton university which is constructed by combining a suite of global observation based products e g cru climate variables gpcp precipitation trmm precipitation and nasa langley monthly surface radiation budget with ncep ncar reanalysis qian et al 2006 sheffield et al 2006 although some known biases in those observation based datasets have been corrected and improved uncertainties in regions with complex and elevated topography still remain due to lack of observations sheffield et al 2006 land cover and soil texture data are from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis land cover product and hybrid statsgo fao datasets respectively accuracies of these products vary from region to region and type to type wu et al 2008 friedl et al 2010 this may also be one of the main sources leading to uncertainties in the gldas results 5 2 reliability of the presented models and the future study the rf model nicely reproduces spatial pattern and time series of grace twsa and outperforms another global grace based reconstruction dataset the lr model has lower accuracy than the rf model but can well capture the temporal variations of the grace twsa both the presented models explicitly improve the twsa estimations of the examined gldas models in this study and extend the grace twsa time series however uncertainties and limitations still remain the rf and lr models produced the twsa that match grace observations much better than the gldas born results this indicates that biases in gldas born twsa have been filled by the presented models but it is obvious that human interventions are still not considered in the reconstruction models possible solutions may rely on the integration of global hydrology models ghms outputs of human water use and irrigation future work is expected on the comparison of modelling twsa with and without human interventions for evaluating the impacts from human activity additionally those combined uncertainties from multiple sources could not be decomposed and quantified in the reconstruction models this is especially true for the rf based model the importance of each variable for predicting twsa can be calculated based on their contributions to the rf model node splits this undoubtedly provides a meaningful way to look into the variables significance to the model however the importance value cannot be interpreted as the variables exact contributions to the tws estimations since it is just a statistical relative ranking as a powerful ensemble learning algorithm the rf has been one of the most popular machine learning approaches to meet challenges in various geoscientific computing and earth system modelling applications catani et al 2013 o gorman and dwyer 2018 keller and evans 2019 strong outperformance of the rf algorithm against support vector machine svm k nearest neighbors knn decision trees dt artificial neural network ann has been reported in multiple applications such as precipitation and soil moisture mapping and downscaling jing et al 2016 liu et al 2018 land cover mapping cracknell and reading 2014 surface temperature rescaling hutengs and vohland 2016 and geological mapping cracknell and reading 2014 however the tree based structure would limit a model s prediction within the range of training data because all the prediction using the target scale covariates that values outside the range of the training covariates are predicted up to the range of training scale sinha et al 2019 therefore the extended grace twsa data is just a possible scenario based on the patterns learned by the models and they may miss prediction of some extremes when backtracking the past states as a matter of fact differences between the twsa time series from 2003 and those historically reconstructed twsa time series can be found in some individual basins see fig 8 a e further experiments are expected to investigate the performance of other machine learning solutions by using the svm and ann models the spatially moving window extends the concept of moving window regression from 1 d to 2 d and is combined with the random forest algorithm and linear regression in this study the lr model produces twsa estimations with lower accuracy than those from the rf model but it estimates comparable twsa time series with the rf model and the jpl m era dataset in addition it gives the spatial patterns of the regression coefficient for each variable as well as the regression constant value which would provide an alternative perspective to interpret the twsa estimation model and those contributions from each components and their spatial differences the moving window structure involves two important parameters which are window size and moving step the window size controls the spatial scale of each basic unit of the regression model and the moving step determines the overlapped grids between adjacent windows in this study we presented the moving window with window size of 6 6 and step size of 2 2 future studies are expected to take experiments on the scale effects of changing window and step sizes upon the model performance over other locations and different climatic and ecosystems in addition other regression models e g svm ann extreme gradient boosting xgboost and bayesian regression which would have potential to advance the models estimations will be further tested to optimize the model in the near future 6 conclusion long term products of tws changes are key resources for global water cycle and climate change studies in this study we presented a spatially moving window framework and compared two long term twsa generating approaches based on grace data and gldas outputs and a case study was conducted in china land area the twsa generated by using the presented rf model and lr model have much better agreement with grace twsa than those of pure gldas born results the rf model outperforms another reconstructed twsa dataset the grace rec while the lr model produces comparable twsa time series with the grace rec both the rf and lr model perform better on the grace csr m solution than the jpl m solution discrepancies between gldas born twsa and grace results are much more notable in north china than south china area this is reasonable because water storage in arid or semiarid regions is more vulnerable to groundwater change and human interventions those differences are well rectified by the presented models variable importance ranking given by the rf model presents remarkable spatial differences the lr model gives the spatial patterns of the regression coefficients and constant values the profile soil moisture and groundwater obtain larger and spatially varying coefficients such hot spot regions can be detected over southwest china and north china plain as well as the himalayas and its surrounding areas the constant values reveal the spatial differences between twsa from grace and gldas this study provides alternative perspectives of integrating grace and gldas model to produce optimal prediction of long term changes in tws machine learning approaches have provided exciting new opportunities and are increasingly adopted for strengthening earth system modelling but most of the machine learning algorithms are claimed for lack of validated interpretability this is still blocking in depth combination of machine learning and challenging issues of earth system science beyond the applications in this study we could expect methodologies of combining physical model and machine learning as well as geographical information science to be explored in depth to obtain optimal prediction while maintaining interpretability credit authorship contribution statement wenlong jing conceptualization

5148,the changes of terrestrial water storage tws is critical for drought monitoring water and food security global water cycle and climate change studies currently the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellites are unique means of observing large scale water storage variations but the short time series 2002 present limits their applications in long term climatic and hydrologic studies although the tws can be calculated from global land surface models large uncertainties arise due to uncertainties of inputs and the limitations of the models this study developed a reconstruction model for grace tws anomalies twsa based on the global land data assimilation system gldas model outputs by using a random forest rf regression approach a spatially moving window smw structure was introduced when training the rf model to address the spatial variations of twsa and a linear regression approach lr was also used for comparison purpose long term twsa over china land area were generated based on the proposed approaches and results were validated through cross validation and comparisons with reference datasets as a result the rf based model outperforms the lr based model and the reconstructed twsa by using the two models both well reproduce grace dataset and outperform the twsa that are derived directly from gldas models moreover the twsa produced by using the presented models have good agreements with another global grace based reconstructed twsa dataset and in situ soil moisture measurements importance value for each variable in the rf model was quantified as well as the spatial coefficients for each variable in the lr model the importance values and regression coefficients present varying spatial patterns rather than modifying the land surface model structure and inputs this study provides alternative ways of improving the tws estimations of gldas and extending time range of grace datasets the experiments are expected to promote and enrich the methodologies and theories of combining physical and statistical models for optimal simulations in geoscientific research keywords terrestrial water storage anomalies grace land surface model random forest moving window 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws is the sum of soil water land surface water groundwater canopy water and snow water rodell and famiglietti 1999 rodell et al 2004 long term variation information of the tws is beneficial for drought assessment and prediction and has great significance to water resources management global water cycle and climate change studies seyoum and milewski 2017 yang et al 2017 satellite remote sensing has outperformed classical ground based monitoring approaches in large scale water resources research depending on its advantages in real time and widely ranging detection with low cost tucker 1980 gao 1996 for example global inland water and glacier snow can be mapped at high spatial resolutions 10 30 m by using optical remote sensing techniques immerzeel et al 2009 feng et al 2016 and global precipitation rates and land surface soil water content can be obtained from satellite based microwave sensors ulaby batlivala and dobson 1978 njoku et al 2002 zhan et al 2006 huffman et al 2007 however regional water storage balance is difficult to be estimated from those sensors because of the optical and microwave sensors inability to detect the water stored in root zone and underground the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace project is an observation mission on earth s gravity field that collaborated by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german aerospace center the grace twin satellites were launched in 2002 global water storage anomalies have been obtained by measuring the earth s gravity field changes landerer and swenson 2012 scanlon et al 2016 the water storage anomalies products are extremely beneficial to water balance research because they provide more direct estimation of the tws variation than global land surface models and hydrological models tang et al 2010 huang et al 2012 scanlon longuevergne and long 2012 dieng et al 2015 mo et al 2016 yao et al 2016 but their applications in hydrological process are still restricted by the short period forced by long term climate datasets precipitation and air temperature global land surface models and hydrological models are able to simulate historical hydrology and energy fluxes rodell et al 2004 estimation of long term tws is then possible based on the models simulations however uncertainties of current models combined with the quality of forcing data greatly reduce the ability of the models to simulate real conditions qian et al 2006 hence discrepancies between the tws changes born from the surface hydrological models and the tws anomalies twsa datasets provided by grace observations are expected as a matter of fact those discrepancies were revealed globally in number of basins yang et al 2013 scanlon et al 2018 combining grace observations with global land surface models outputs for improving the twsa estimation has been increasingly concerned in recent years long et al 2014 nie et al 2015 the grace observations provide more reliable estimation on the tws changes than global models and the simulations of historical hydrometeorological variables from the models are able to estimate extensive tws time series although uncertainties exist in the model born tws simulations their close relationships with grace results make it possible to develop reliable long term twsa datasets the tws changes estimated from water balance basis are approximately linearly related to grace twsa in some basins nile et al 2015 implemented a linear model to link global land data assimilation system gldas tws estimation to grace twsa and reconstructed twsa from 1948 to 2012 by using the linear model in the amazon basin nie et al 2015 based on the similar principle humphrey et al 2017 made it a step forward by developing a polynomial regression model between grace twsa and reanalysis climatic variables precipitation and temperature in the same basin humphrey gudmundsson and seneviratne 2017 the reconstruction of long term twsa also can rely on relationship between groundwater level or sea surface temperature and twsa for example becker et al 2011 reconstructed twsa of amazon basin from 1980 to 2008 based on the correlations between twsa and station based groundwater observations becker et al 2011 de linage et al 2014 examined a lagged correlation between tropical pacific and north atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies and predicted historical tws change using the relationship de linage famiglietti and randerson 2014 however these reconstructions are based on 1 d time series and are subject to in situ observations with high quality and the specific correlation it is difficult to apply such empirical approaches to other basins dominated by tropical climate and the largest rainforest in the world the amazon basin has plenty of rainfall all year around local correlations between terrestrial water balance and atmospheric or oceanic variables are possible to be simulated by using classical regression models however it is less easy to directly use such approaches in arid and sub arid basins which always have great spatially heterogeneous climate conditions and intense human activities yang et al 2018 rising of machine learning approaches has greatly improved our ability to simulate and predict the world successful stories in diverse geo scientific applications such as weather prediction land cover mapping and soil type mapping grimm et al 2008 rogan et al 2008 bauer thorpe and brunet 2015 have increasingly added new possibilities and better theories in earth system modelling integrating machine learning into the twsa reconstruction model is a beneficial alternative perspective where physical model is uncertain and traditional statistical approach is weak promotive attempt has been made in southwest china by long et al 2014 using grace data and artificial neural network ann model long et al 2014 they reconstructed grace twsa over the yun gui plateau back to 1980 s by training an ann model between grace data and other in situ and model data but the weak interpretability of ann algorithm reduces the benefits of integrating it into geo scientific modelling where interpretability is important the random forest algorithm rf a popular and efficient machine learning approach has increasingly been applied to geoscience and remote sensing problems and has obtained outstanding results at local and global scales grimm et al 2008 kühnlein et al 2014 hengl et al 2017 in addition tree based model structure of rf makes it possible to evaluate variables importance by quantifying their contributions to the trees nodes this provides a perspective for understanding the variables contributions to tws simulation in this study we attempt to link gldas model outputs to the grace twsa datasets by using the random forest regression algorithm for extending grace twsa time series a spatially moving window structure is used when training the random forest model to address spatial differences of the matching patterns between grace observation and gldas model outputs a case study was conducted on two different released grace solutions over china land area which covering landscapes and climate zones with great varieties the twsa over the study area were reconstructed back to 1948 by using the presented approaches the results were compared with gldas born twsa and another reconstructed grace based dataset as well as in situ soil moisture measurements the presented models are expected to add new perspective to hybrid model development of combining physical models and statistical approaches 2 study area and data resource 2 1 study area the study area is china land area excluding south china sea china land area lies between 17 n 56 n and 73 e 135 e and the land area is about 9600 000 km2 china has complex terrain and varied landscapes and climates there are nine major river basins over china land area fig 1 and their areas and the major rivers are summarized in table 1 the majority of the yangtze river pearl river southeast and southwest basins are subtropical monsoon climate regions southern part of the pearl river basin is tropical monsoon climate region these regions have dense river network and are abundant of water resources the yellow river haihe river huaihe river and songhua and liaohe river basin are temperate monsoon climate regions characterized by hot and rainy summers cold and dry winters dominated by flat plains these basins are main grain cultivating areas of china the continental basin is inland river basin the southern part of the basin is in the tibetan plateau and northern part is temperate continental climate region most part of the continental basin is arid region with scarce rainfall and is deficient of water resources 2 2 the grace dataset two grace terrestrial water storage tws solutions are used in this study they are from the center for space research at university of texas austin csr and the jet propulsion laboratory jpl respectively the tws products are obtained by using the mass concentration blocks mascons techniques the mascons techniques make the implementation of geophysical constraints which are referred as mascons the latest jpl mascons jpl m solution watkins et al 2015 tellus 2018 used in this study is the rl06 at 1 2 0 5 degree resolution from https podaac jpl nasa gov grace the csr mascons csr m rl06 solution save bettadpur and tapley 2016 save 2019 is obtained from http www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html the csr m rl06 solution is provided at 1 4 0 25 degree grids and the dataset were re sampled to 0 5 spatial resolution by using arithmetic mean method to keep consistent with the jpl m solution the two solutions differ in terms of the employed processing algorithms and for more detailed information about the grace mission and the solutions processing algorithms the readers can refer to the related publications watkins et al 2015 save et al 2016 wiese landerer and watkins 2016 in this study the twsa reconstruction models are examined on the csr m and jpl m solutions respectively to investigate the differences all the data described are provided as anomalies relative to the january 2004 december 2009 time mean baseline therefore the tws datasets from grace are referred as terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa in this study 2 3 the gldas models forced by the global meteorological forcing data set from princeton university sheffield goteti and wood 2006 the global land data assimilation system gldas model provides optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes rodell et al 2004 current gldas version 2 0 gldas 2 0 model simulations are initialized on simulation date january 1 1948 extending through 2014 daily products from gldas 2 0 catchment model at spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 were used in this study in the catchment model snow water storage snws canopy water storage cws soil moisture sms and groundwater storage gws are simulated and the sms includes surface smss profile smsp and root zone smsrz table 2 the tws simulation of the catchment model calculated by summing these components were used for comparison in this study moreover there is another gldas 2 0 model noah differing from catchment model the noah model does not contain simulation of groundwater storage therefore the noah model outputs was not used for training the model in this study but considering the tws from the noah model is also widely used for comparison with grace observations we also considered the tws data in the noah model for comparison with the reconstruction results in this study the catchment twsa and noah twsa were generated the same way as grace results subtracting arithmetic average tws from january 2004 to december 2009 from original tws series 2 4 auxiliary data used for comparison 2 4 1 the grace rec datasets another grace based twsa reconstruction dataset was used for comparison with the results in this study the grace rec dataset includes several sub datasets that were reconstructed based on different meteorological forcing datasets humphrey and gudmundsson 2019 the grace rec constructs tws changes on a water balance basis and then calibrates them by using the grace observations the released grace rec products are deseasonalized twsa data after removing the seasonal cycle and the datasets are available on https doi org 10 6084 m9 figshare 7670849 in this study two monthly grace rec datasets based on the jpl m rl06 solution were used for comparison they are generated from two different meteorological forcing datasets respectively which are the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis era5 and the global soil wetness project phase 3 gswp3 thus the two grace rec datasets are referred as jpl m era and jpl m gswp in the following parts the jpl m era and jpl m gwsp are provided at the same spatial resolution 0 5 and different time spans the jpl m era covers 1979 2014 while the jpl m gswp are provided over the period of 1901 2014 2 4 2 soil moisture measurements china cropland soil moisture in situ dataset includes soil moisture measurements collected from 778 cropland sites at temporal resolution of 10 days from 1991 to 2003 the relative soil moisture at five difference depths 0 10 cm 0 20 cm 0 50 cm 0 70 cm and 0 100 cm the relative soil moisture is defined as the ratio in percentage of water in weight to the field capacity in weight of the measured soil layer the original dataset was obtained from the national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn data and it has been widely used for mapping agricultural droughts validating remotely sensed and reanalysis soil moisture products and improving land surface model s soil moisture simulation over china area liu and xie 2013 lai et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 there are absent records in the original dataset therefore it was preprocessed before being used the sites with observation extension less than three years 36 months were removed and because most of the records at soil depth of 0 70 cm and 0 100 cm is absent only the measurements at depth of 0 50 cm were used in this study the spatial distribution of the thirty qualified sites after being preprocessed are shown in fig 2 these sites are mainly in north china and most of them are located in the yellow river basin monthly soil moisture was calculated by averaging the 10 days time series 3 methods 3 1 combination of the random forest and a spatially moving window structure the basic concept of the rf based tws reconstruction model is to fit the matching patterns between the grace twsa and the anomalies of the catchment model simulations of tws components the model is given by an expression between dependent variables twsa and the corresponding independent variables listed in table 2 1 twsa i j f snwsa i j cwsa i j smsa s i j smsa p i j smsa rz i j gwsa i j where twsa i j represents the grace twsa at the grid of location i j the snwsa i j cwsa i j smsa s i j smsa p i j smsa rz i j and gwsa i j are the anomalies relative to the baseline of 2004 2009 of snws cws sms and gws from the catchment model at the grid of location i j the random forest rf regression algorithm which is an outstanding ensemble learning method that combines multiple estimators to obtain better predictions breiman 2001 is used to learn the f x i j the model is learned at a 0 5 0 5 grid scale and a spatially moving window smw structure is used to address the spatial variations of f x i j instead of simply including geolocations in the model the smw consists of the following major steps as well as illustrated in fig 3 1 a moving window of w w grids rolls through the twsa grids with size of i j rows columns at a step of s see step 0 in fig 3 for each window k all the grids w w within the window are input in a local rf model for training referred as rf k 2 the learning process of rf k follows the standard random forest regression algorithm breiman 2001 that can be briefly depicted as follows n tree a subsets are drawn randomly from the total training set in window k with replacement size of each subset is 2 3 of the total set in the window b for each subset in n tree a classification and regression tree cart model is generated the cart algorithm is a classical binary classification or regression tree algorithm proposed by breiman breiman et al 1984 a cart tree is built from a learning sample of size n the tree is a binary tree and is generated by splitting samples recursively into two children nodes t l and t r and the parent node of t l and t r is node t referred as n t meaning number of samples at node t the value to split the node t is s t s the s t is one of the independent variables and the s is the corresponding value the best variable s t and the corresponding best value s that used to split the node t are determined by searching the s t s that could maximize the decrease of impurity between t and its two children nodes the decrease of impurity is expressed as 2 δ i s t i t p l i t l p r i t r where s t and s are the best variables and best values to split the node t respectively and p l n t l n t and p r n t r n t n t l and n t r are number of samples in the two children node t l and t r the i t is the impurity measurement function that defines the variety of samples in a node t 3 i t 1 n t i 1 n t y i y where n t is number of samples in node t y i is the input instance value for a sample i in the node t and y is the mean value of y given by 1 n t i 1 n t y i thus samples in each terminal node have the optimized purity and the lowest variation the predicted output y for a new sample in that individual tree is the value of the node reached by the sample when it is splitted by those best s t s throughout the tree c predictions for new samples can be made by averaging the predictions from all the individual regression trees 4 f 1 n tree i 1 n tree f i x where n tree is the number of trees and f i x is the prediction from each individual regression tree in random forest algorithm over fitting can be controlled through the random sampling and averaging prediction process according to the developer of rf algorithm breiman 2001 larger n tree is recommended to produce higher predictive accuracy and less over fitting the n tree was set as 200 in this study 3 all the grids in the window k w w grids are given the fitted rf k model in step 2 the score of the model at window k is evaluated based on the coefficient of determination r2 in the next window k 1 the rf k 1 are fitted based on the same process in the former step the score of the model in the window k 1 is referred as r k 1 2 and for the overlapped grids between window k and k 1 see red grids in step 0 in fig 3 if the new model s score r k 1 2 is higher than that of the prior window s r k 2 the models of these overlapped grids are replaced with the new model of window k 1 step 2 in fig 3 as a result the rf models at grids in each window can be obtained by the recursively updating step 3 in fig 3 interpretation of machine learning model is significant for model application individual trees can be interpreted easily by simply plotting the tree structure however it is less easy to inspect hundreds of trees by simply plotting them variable importance ranking provides a tool to evaluate the importance of each variable to the rf model breiman 2001 the importance of variable x j is given as 5 v i x j 1 n tree m 1 n tree v s t x j p t δ i s t t where p t is the proportion n t n of samples reaching t and v s t is the variable used in split s t and m 1 2 3 n tree concept behind the variable importance evaluation approach is to add up the weighted impurity decreases p t δ i s t t for all nodes t where x j is used and variable importance of x j is obtained by averaging over all n tree trees in the forest by applying the spatially moving window structure when training the rf model the variable importance values can be calculated grid by grid this provides an insight into how the variable importance of the rf model vary spatially for estimating the tws changes over the study area 3 2 a linear regression model solution in addition to the rf based model a local linear regression model based on the same spatially moving window structure was also implemented to reconstruct the twsa for comparison in the linear regression solution a same spatially moving window is used but it is assumed that the grace twsa can be expressed as a local linear function with coefficients between the anomalies of snws cws sms and gws from the catchment model in window k the local linear function can be expressed as follow 6 twsa i j α 0 i j snwsa i j α 1 i j cwsa i j α 2 i j smsa s i j α 3 i j smsa p i j α 4 i j smsa rz i j α 5 i j gwsa i j β i j where twsa i j represents the grace twsa at the grid of location i j the snwsa i j cwsa i j smsa s i j smsa p i j smsa rz i j and gwsa i j are the anomalies relative to the baseline of 2004 2009 of snws cws sms and gws from the catchment model at the grid of location i j and α 0 i j α 1 i j α 5 i j are the corresponding coefficients β i j is the constant value of the location i j to obtain estimated coefficients and constant at each grid the ordinary least squares regression method is used to fit the coefficients and constant of the function in the window k 7 twsa k α 0 k snwsa k α 1 k cwsa k α 2 k smsa s k α 3 k smsa p k α 4 k smsa rz k α 5 k gwsa k β k where k represents the window average value α 0 k α 1 k α 5 k and β k are the coefficients and constant all the grids in the window k w w grids are given the fitted coefficients and constant of eq 7 the score of the model at window k is evaluated based on the coefficient of determination r2 in the next window k 1 the coefficients α 0 k 1 α 1 k 1 α 5 k 1 and constant β k 1 are fitted by using the same process in the former step the score of the model in the window k 1 is referred as r k 1 2 and for the overlapped grids between window k and k 1 if the new model s score r k 1 2 is higher than that of the prior window s r k 2 the coefficients of these overlapped grids are replaced with the new coefficients of the model of window k 1 the regression coefficients at grids in each window can be obtained by the recursively updating the past grace consistent twsa is then can be simulated by using the regression coefficients based on eq 6 3 3 time series decomposition the twsa series need to be deseasonalized to estimate the trends of total water storage changes the seasonal trend decomposition using local regression loess stl proposed by cleveland et al cleveland et al 1990 was used in this study to decompose twsa monthly time series the stl was reported to be a versatile and robust method for decomposing time series lu 2003 key to the stl approach is loess local regression smoothing the loess fits a smoothed series g j from an input time series x j x tj where tj is a sequence of discrete sampling times the smoothed value at each point j is given by the value at time tj of a polynomial fitted to the sampled values of x over a window j q j q with decreasing weight assigned to points in this window as their distance from point j increases the stl consists of outer and inner loops with a sequence of smoothing operator loess and generates three components from a time series cleveland and cleveland 1990 9 s total s long t r e n d s seasonal s residual in the outer loop the weights are assigned to each data point in the inner loop the trend and seasonal components are iteratively updated a the current estimate of the trend initialize trend as 0 is subtracted from the raw series b the detrended time series is then partition into cycle subseries in this study the series is monthly then there are 12 cycle subseries all januarys will be one cycle subseries all february a second etc c the cycle subseries are loess smoothed and then passed through a moving average low pass filter of length 12 monthly series the seasonal components are the loess smoothed cycle subseries minus the result from the low pass filter d the seasonal components are subtracted from the raw data to generate deseasonalized series the deseasonalized series after removing seasonal cycles are smoothed by loess which becomes the trend what is left is the residuals the twsa trends are the linear trends estimated from the long trend components and the deseasonalized twsa are the desesonalized series after removing seasonal cycles for more details of the stl decomposition approach we refer the reader to the related publications of cleveland et al 1990 lu 2003 4 results and analysis 4 1 reconstruction of twsa and cross validation the random forest rf and linear regression lr reconstruction model based on the spatially moving window framework were run through two grace twsa solutions csr m and jpl m separately in this study the window size of 6 6 grids approximating 3 3 caps of the mascons solution and the step size of 2 grids 1 were used for january to december all the data of the specific month from 2003 to 2014 were input for fitting the rf and lr models of that month except for the validation period of 2007 2009 therefore there are twelve groups of models e g one group for all januarys another group for all februarys etc all the land grids within the extent of 73 135 e and 17 56 n were used as samples to train the models to keep the integrity of the training and mapping ranges and the following analysis was based on the mask of china main land area fig 4 shows the spatial patterns of the reconstructed twsa of january and july in 2008 as well as the twsa from grace solutions and the land surface models great discrepancies can be interpreted between twsa of catchment noah model and those of grace solutions according to fig 4 g h o p for example relative to the grace solutions the catchment model fail to capture notable negative twsa in the southwest and the noah model overestimates the twsa negatives in the southwest and northeast in january 2008 the rf based twsa perfectly capture the spatial pattern of grace twsa the lr based twsa match with the grace observations better than the catchment and noah twsa but not as well as those from rf models scatter plots between grace twsa reconstructed twsa and catchment noah twsa of the validation period 2007 2009 further illustrate their differences fig 5 the reconstructed twsa and catchment noah twsa were aggregated to a unified spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 to generate the scatter plots the catchment and noah twsa according to fig 5 e h are obviously inferior to the rf and lr twsa in comparison with the grace results with lower r2 and higher rmse the rf model outperforms the lr model with higher r2 0 65 for jpl m and 0 80 for csr m and lower rmse 3 37 cm for jpl m and 2 15 cm for csr m besides the presented reconstruction models perform better on the grace csr m than the jpl m solution this is probably partly subject to the more smoothed grids of the csr m solution compared with the jpl m according to fig 4 signals in the csr m solution have more gradual change when comparing with the sharp step change in the jpl m solution and less spatially heterogeneous surface is more likely to be accurately predicted garrigues et al 2006 garrigues allard and baret 2008 zhu et al 2010 temporal performance of the deseasonalized twsa is then examined from basin averaged twsa time series in the nine major basins of china fig 6 fig 7 presents the correlation maps between the deseasonalized twsa from grace solutions and the reconstructed twsa based on the validation period of 2007 2009 the catchment noah twsa and two grace rec twsa jpl m era and jpl m gswp are also presented in fig 6 and fig 7 on the basin scale the rf and lr model well reproduce the grace twsa time series during both entire 2003 2014 period and the validation period of 2007 2009 the rf based twsa have better correlations with the grace solutions than the twsa from other models and resources the lr based results have comparable performance with the grace rec datasets except for the continental basin yellow river basin and haihe river basin in these basins the jpl m era twsa time series have better correlations with the grace solutions than the lr results the catchment and noah model overestimate the twsa in the continental basin yellow river basin haihe river basin and songhua and liaohe river basin according to fig 6 this is consistent with previous findings scanlon et al 2018 the presented models as well as the jpl m era dataset can calibrate these overestimations according to fig 6 the jpl m gswp dataset performs worse than the jpl m era and it has much negative biased twsa estimations in continental basin southwest basin and yangtze river basin these biased estimations are probably related to the initial value of the grace rec method in the grace rec model the reconstruction of tws anomalies is based on the initial value at the very beginning of the time series the first year the beginning of the jpl gswp time series is 1901 uncertainties and missing records in the historical meteorological dataset may produce twsa estimation bias 4 2 extended grace twsa and trends to obtain the past changes of tws throughout the study area the dataset covering 2003 2014 were input to the rf and lr models and the trained models were used to reconstruct the past grace consistent twsa data shown in fig 8 are the basin averaged rf and lr based twsa and grace rec twsa time series from 1948 to 2014 in the nine basins and the csr m and jpl m twsa from 2003 to 2014 are also displayed the 2003 2014 period is marked with red background in the panels the whole period is divided into six sub periods 1948 1960 p1 1961 1970 p2 1971 1980 p3 1981 1990 p4 1991 2000 p5 2001 2014 p6 and the correlation maps between the twsas during each period in each basin are displayed in fig 9 the twsa produced by the rf and lr models are consistent with the grace twsa according to fig 8 before 2003 the rf and lr twsa have consistent temporal variations with the jpl m era time series covering 1979 2014 compared with the jpl m gswp the jpl m era is more consistent with the grace observations due to negative bias of jpl m gswp relative to the grace observations in some basins the correlations between jpl m gswp and the twsa from the presented reconstruction models vary in different basins extreme inconsistent correlations between the jpl gswp and the rf and lr twsa can be detected in the continental and southwest basin during p1 and p2 fig 9 but their temporal variations become more consistent after 1970 s fig 10 displays the twsa trends in each basin during six sub periods the trends derived from the csr m and jpl m solution are generally consistent but differences can be detected between the twsa trends from the rf model and the twsa trends from the lr model in the yellow river basin huaihe river basin and southeast river basin specifically the trends estimated from the lr based twsa are more negative than those from the rf based twsa in these three basins especially in p2 for example the trends of the lr based twsa in the yellow river basin and huaihe river basin in p2 are around 0 4 cm yr and 2 8 cm yr respectively fig 10 b h much negative than the trends of the rf based twsa 0 2 cm yr for the yellow river basin and 1 cm yr for the huaihe river basin the trends from the rf based twsa and the jpl m gswp are consistent in those two basins yellow river basin huaihe river basin as well as the songhua and liaohe river basin during the entire period in general the evolutions of the twsa trends through the entire period have good agreement in most basins except for continental basin and southeast basin 4 3 comparison with in situ soil moisture measurements fig 11 shows the comparisons between the rf twsa and monthly soil moisture of profile 0 50 cm obtained from china agricultural soil moisture dataset and their correlation coefficients are shown in fig 12 since there are several missing values in the in situ soil moisture the number of available records at each site is also shown for reference although there are a number of missing records it can be inferred from the time series that the reconstructed twsa are generally consistent with the in situ soil moisture variations and capture the peak and valley of soil moisture time series according to fig 11 the variation of the reconstructed twsa has good agreement with in situ soil moisture at most examined sites and their overall change trends are consistent the correlation coefficient r at each site ranges between 0 2 0 8 and at most sites the r values are around 0 5 the r is low at sites with inadequate records such as no 51238 and no 51358 but at some sites with more than 80 records the r value is also lower than 0 4 such as no 53915 and no 53926 the correlations between tws variations and subsurface water content are mainly involved with root zone soil moisture and groundwater level rodell et al 2009 tian et al 2019 because groundwater accounts for majority of tws although profile soil moisture variations can partly indicate regional water storage changes because soil water content contributes to groundwater recharge rushton and ward 1979 zhang et al 1999 their connection is weaker than that between groundwater and tws changes the reconstructed twsa by using the presented models generally have good agreement with in situ soil moisture at most sites examined in this study suggesting good performance of the presented models in estimating past twsa in the study area however since the comparison was conducted based on soil moisture measurements at 0 50 cm which only indicates water content variations in the shallow soil layer interpretation of the results should be regarded as indirect evaluation instead of validated accuracy 4 4 model interpretation variable importance vi values provide possibilities of evaluating significance of each independent variable to the rf model given the huge spatial variations in tws changes throughout the study area significance spatial differences of the variable importance in the rf model are not unexpected by combining the rf and the moving window approach variable importance can be provided on a grid cell level thus the spatial patterns of variable importance can be mapped fig 13 presents the spatial patterns of the average variable importance for the rf model and the monthly variable importance maps for some selected months e g february april june august october and december are displayed in fig s1 and fig s2 fig 14 summarizes the violin plots for the gridded average variable importance for the csr m solution in each basin and the summary for the jpl m solution is presented in fig s3 in general the variables importance values have spatially and temporally varying patterns for example the snwsa has extremely low importance values close to 0 throughout the most parts of the study area except for tibetan plateau and high latitude areas in june and august fig s1 and fig s2 which are summer months of northern hemisphere the importance value of gwsa is remarkably high in north china plain and northeast china plain fig 13 f l which are under heavy irrigation and have been hot spots of groundwater declining regions in asia kendy et al 2004 shi et al 2011 feng et al 2013 huang et al 2015 min shen and pei 2015 chen et al 2018 this can also be implied from the violin plots of feature importance in the yellow river basin haihe river basin and huaihe river basin fig 14 b c h anomalies in profile and root zone soil moisture and groundwater storage have notable significance to the rf models this is rational because they are major components of the terrestrial water storage and are closely correlated with the changes of tws hirschi seneviratne and schär 2006 rodell et al 2009 pokhrel et al 2013 soni and syed 2015 the variable importance is beneficial to explain the relative significance of the variables in the rf based model however it is impossible to address how exactly they contributes to the model because the variable importance values are measured by calculating their contributions to the tree nodes therefore the variable importance is a relative indicator rather than a real contribution measurement of independent variables to the target hence variable importance should be interpreted with additional cautions the lr based model gives the regression coefficients in each grid fig s4 and fig s5 the spatial patterns of the snws anomalies snwsa in winter months are significantly different from those in other months from december to april the coefficients of snwsa are in large range over northeast and northwest areas where are usually deep snow regions during winter months dahe shiyin and peiji 2006 wang and he 2013 the anomalies of profile soil moisture smsap and groundwater storage gwsa have larger coefficients than other variables this is consistent with the patterns of variable importance of the rf models it should be noted that the variables are anomalies therefore the positive negative regression coefficients of the variables do not indicate exactly their positive negative contributions to the twsa the constant values account for the parts that cannot be well estimated by the independent variables in january and december remarkable negative constants can be detected in the himalayas and its surrounding areas suggesting that the catchment model overestimates twsa in these areas relative to grace observations in winter months in addition such negative constant also can be found in north china plain the regression coefficients in the lr models and the variable importance in the rf models show general consistent patterns but differences are detected on the canopy water storage anomalies cwsa variable according to fig s4 and fig s5 the coefficients of the cwsa are in narrow ranges because the cws accounts for only a fraction of the tws however the cwsa has significant variable importance in the rf models except for some agricultural regions e g north china plain and northeast china plain where groundwater storage is declining because of intense human withdrawals one possible explanation is that the variable importance calculated in the rf model is a relative indicator differing from linear regression coefficients more important the capacity of canopy water storage is a key factor in controlling the rainfall interception and regional hydrological process wang et al 2012 the respond of cwsa to precipitation is instant and significant correlations can be detected between them zhang et al 2019 since precipitation is the most important factor that drives hydrological process and water balance the significant importance values of cwsa in the rf model are not unexpected 5 discussion 5 1 what causes the differences in twsa between grace and gldas models the discrepancies in twsa from gldas and grace products were acknowledged and discussed from different perspectives in previous researches major reasons leading to such inconsistencies can be attributed to model structure and inputs model structure the twsa derived from the gldas models are not strictly equal to the grace observations the storages of surface water and groundwater are not included in all the gldas models except for catchment model the contribution of sws and gws variations to the tws changes could not be neglected especially in arid and semiarid regions because in the arid region variations in surface water and groundwater are more intense than in the humid areas with abundant rainfall and low evapotranspiration hence we can see more obvious differences in twsa between gldas and grace results in arid and semiarid basins than the humid basins in this study however inclusion of gws in catchment model doesn t produce better agreement between gldas born twsa and grace results a possible explanation is that the model may lack sufficient capacities to give highly reliable groundwater simulations another constrains comes from the gldas models inability to simulate human interventions the north china plain including huaihe river basin haihe river basin and lower yellow river basin is a well known hot spot region of groundwater loss that is attributed to irrigation feng et al 2013 in regions where human induced water use is the main driver of tws changes we would expect twsa from gldas models to be more positive or less negative than that of grace observation it is true in this study that gldas born twsa are more positive than the grace results in these basins which are more vulnerable to human interventions model inputs input datasets of the gldas include climatic forcing data and land surface state data the climatic forcing data include downward short and longwave radiation specific humidity surface air pressure and wind speed and land surface state data are elevation land cover and soils datasets the forcing data are from global meteorological forcing dataset from princeton university which is constructed by combining a suite of global observation based products e g cru climate variables gpcp precipitation trmm precipitation and nasa langley monthly surface radiation budget with ncep ncar reanalysis qian et al 2006 sheffield et al 2006 although some known biases in those observation based datasets have been corrected and improved uncertainties in regions with complex and elevated topography still remain due to lack of observations sheffield et al 2006 land cover and soil texture data are from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer modis land cover product and hybrid statsgo fao datasets respectively accuracies of these products vary from region to region and type to type wu et al 2008 friedl et al 2010 this may also be one of the main sources leading to uncertainties in the gldas results 5 2 reliability of the presented models and the future study the rf model nicely reproduces spatial pattern and time series of grace twsa and outperforms another global grace based reconstruction dataset the lr model has lower accuracy than the rf model but can well capture the temporal variations of the grace twsa both the presented models explicitly improve the twsa estimations of the examined gldas models in this study and extend the grace twsa time series however uncertainties and limitations still remain the rf and lr models produced the twsa that match grace observations much better than the gldas born results this indicates that biases in gldas born twsa have been filled by the presented models but it is obvious that human interventions are still not considered in the reconstruction models possible solutions may rely on the integration of global hydrology models ghms outputs of human water use and irrigation future work is expected on the comparison of modelling twsa with and without human interventions for evaluating the impacts from human activity additionally those combined uncertainties from multiple sources could not be decomposed and quantified in the reconstruction models this is especially true for the rf based model the importance of each variable for predicting twsa can be calculated based on their contributions to the rf model node splits this undoubtedly provides a meaningful way to look into the variables significance to the model however the importance value cannot be interpreted as the variables exact contributions to the tws estimations since it is just a statistical relative ranking as a powerful ensemble learning algorithm the rf has been one of the most popular machine learning approaches to meet challenges in various geoscientific computing and earth system modelling applications catani et al 2013 o gorman and dwyer 2018 keller and evans 2019 strong outperformance of the rf algorithm against support vector machine svm k nearest neighbors knn decision trees dt artificial neural network ann has been reported in multiple applications such as precipitation and soil moisture mapping and downscaling jing et al 2016 liu et al 2018 land cover mapping cracknell and reading 2014 surface temperature rescaling hutengs and vohland 2016 and geological mapping cracknell and reading 2014 however the tree based structure would limit a model s prediction within the range of training data because all the prediction using the target scale covariates that values outside the range of the training covariates are predicted up to the range of training scale sinha et al 2019 therefore the extended grace twsa data is just a possible scenario based on the patterns learned by the models and they may miss prediction of some extremes when backtracking the past states as a matter of fact differences between the twsa time series from 2003 and those historically reconstructed twsa time series can be found in some individual basins see fig 8 a e further experiments are expected to investigate the performance of other machine learning solutions by using the svm and ann models the spatially moving window extends the concept of moving window regression from 1 d to 2 d and is combined with the random forest algorithm and linear regression in this study the lr model produces twsa estimations with lower accuracy than those from the rf model but it estimates comparable twsa time series with the rf model and the jpl m era dataset in addition it gives the spatial patterns of the regression coefficient for each variable as well as the regression constant value which would provide an alternative perspective to interpret the twsa estimation model and those contributions from each components and their spatial differences the moving window structure involves two important parameters which are window size and moving step the window size controls the spatial scale of each basic unit of the regression model and the moving step determines the overlapped grids between adjacent windows in this study we presented the moving window with window size of 6 6 and step size of 2 2 future studies are expected to take experiments on the scale effects of changing window and step sizes upon the model performance over other locations and different climatic and ecosystems in addition other regression models e g svm ann extreme gradient boosting xgboost and bayesian regression which would have potential to advance the models estimations will be further tested to optimize the model in the near future 6 conclusion long term products of tws changes are key resources for global water cycle and climate change studies in this study we presented a spatially moving window framework and compared two long term twsa generating approaches based on grace data and gldas outputs and a case study was conducted in china land area the twsa generated by using the presented rf model and lr model have much better agreement with grace twsa than those of pure gldas born results the rf model outperforms another reconstructed twsa dataset the grace rec while the lr model produces comparable twsa time series with the grace rec both the rf and lr model perform better on the grace csr m solution than the jpl m solution discrepancies between gldas born twsa and grace results are much more notable in north china than south china area this is reasonable because water storage in arid or semiarid regions is more vulnerable to groundwater change and human interventions those differences are well rectified by the presented models variable importance ranking given by the rf model presents remarkable spatial differences the lr model gives the spatial patterns of the regression coefficients and constant values the profile soil moisture and groundwater obtain larger and spatially varying coefficients such hot spot regions can be detected over southwest china and north china plain as well as the himalayas and its surrounding areas the constant values reveal the spatial differences between twsa from grace and gldas this study provides alternative perspectives of integrating grace and gldas model to produce optimal prediction of long term changes in tws machine learning approaches have provided exciting new opportunities and are increasingly adopted for strengthening earth system modelling but most of the machine learning algorithms are claimed for lack of validated interpretability this is still blocking in depth combination of machine learning and challenging issues of earth system science beyond the applications in this study we could expect methodologies of combining physical model and machine learning as well as geographical information science to be explored in depth to obtain optimal prediction while maintaining interpretability credit authorship contribution statement wenlong jing conceptualization

5149,we conducted lab scale experiments to investigate the mechanism of dual peaked breakthrough curves btcs in karst tracer tests three groups of dual conduit structures were constructed by varying 1 the length ratio between the two conduits for a fixed length of the shorter conduit 2 the total length of the conduits for a fixed length ratio 3 the connection angle between the conduits the btcs generated by the tracing experiments were fitted by a dual region advection dispersion drad model to derive effective transport parameters our results confirm that the dual conduit structure triggers the double peaked btcs increasing the conduit length for a fixed length ratio or increasing the length ratio increases peak separation the connection angles between the two conduits θ 1 and θ 2 also influence the btcs increasing θ 1 and decreasing θ 2 causes the first peak to get smaller and the second peak to get larger the drad model can reproduce the dual peaked btcs while its application to the case of single peaked btcs may be problematic due to strong interaction between model parameters a method is proposed for estimating underground karstic conduit lengths from experimental dual peaked btcs keywords karst conduit tracer test laboratory experiment breakthrough curve mcmc 1 introduction the methodology of tracer test initially developed for the investigation of karst aquifers is still widely used in karst hydrogeology tracer tests can provide information about groundwater trajectories and yield breakthrough curves btcs that can be used to estimate transport model parameters goldscheider and drew 2007 due to the strong heterogeneity of karst aquifers the btcs may exhibit asymmetry with long tails or multiple peaks moreno and tsang 1991 hauns et al 2001 massei et al 2006 perrin and luetscher goldscheider et al 2008 the advection dispersion equation ade performs poorly in characterizing these btcs to better reproduce tailing effects some researchers considered including further processes in the transport model morales et al 2010 the mobile immobile model mim developed by van genuchten and wierenga 1976 partitions the aquifer into mobile and immobile regions skopp et al 1981 proposed a dual permeability model also referred to as the multiple region advection dispersion mrad by majdalani et al 2018 with two mobile regions using the ade model berkowitz et al 2006 proposed the continuous time random walk ctrw theory by conceptualizing solute transport as a series of particle jumps or transitions with spatially changing velocities recently ctrw was also applied to karst aquifers goeppert et al 2020 dual peaked btcs were successfully modeled by the application of the dual advection dispersion equation dade and the weighted sum advection dispersion equation wsade model field and leij 2012 dual peaked btcs in karst tracer tests may be caused by the presence of pools or underground lakes along main conduits field and leij 2012 dewaide et al 2018 or multiple flow paths maloszewski et al 1992 goldscheider et al 2008 perrin and luetscher 2008 this hypothesis has been investigated using laboratory scale experiments in the past moreno and tsang 1991 field and leij 2012 among the different experiments used for a better understanding of karst aquifer solute transport some scale models account for both the conduit and the matrix florea and wicks 2001 li et al 2008 mohammadi et al 2019 while others focus on transport in conduits only zhao et al 2019 2017 field and leij 2012 field and leij 2012 noted that the presence of pools or auxiliary conduits causes dual peaked btcs mohammadi et al 2019 studied how the hydraulic head gradient influences btcs by a bench scale karst model zhao et al 2017 2019 found that the existence of pools on the conduit would increase the tailing of btcs however these studies did not show whether karst conduit properties can be inferred from btc shapes to better assess the relationship between conduit structure and btcs we studied how the dual conduit geometry influences the btcs shape by laboratory tracer experiments three groups of solute transport experiments were carried out the obtained btcs were fitted using a one dimensional transport model to achieve a quantitative comparison 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a series of lab scale idealized dual conduit structure models were built using silicone pipes with an internal diameter of 0 4 cm the dual conduit structure consists of three parts the inlet dual conduit and outlet at the inlet and outlet parts the flow is restricted in the single conduit at the dual conduit part the flow is divided into two conduits of different lengths fig 1 the shorter and the longer conduit lengths are denoted as l 1 and l 2 respectively the deviation angles between the shorter and longer conduits at both the inlet and outlet connecting part are denoted respectively as θ 1 and θ 2 during the experiments the dual conduit structure is placed on a horizontal platform to eliminate gravity effects the inflowing flow is supplied using a peristaltic pump lead fluid brand at a constant rate the discharge q is set at 0 6846 cm3 s and hence the calculated velocity through the outlet conduit is 5 4480 cm s the inlet is connected in parallel to a pure water supply and a salty water supply a three way adapter is used to switch between the salty water and pure water the salty water deionized water nacl at c 0 0 06 mol l is used as the tracer a pulse tracer release is realized by switching the adaptor to the salty water supply for 5 s 3 42 ml the physical models were fully sealed and the recovery rate was 100 for all of the experiments we use a scale mettler toledo to estimate the discharge a conductimeter wtw tetracon 325 accuracy is 1 10 6 mol l is used to measure the outlet tracer concentration the scale and conductimeter are connected to a data logger campbell cr1000 for automatic data recording at a time step of 1 s in order to obtain more accurate peak time the btcs have been interpolated by 0 05 s in each experiment the tracer injection is initiated after the flow within the system is stabilized each experiment is repeated three times a mean btc is derived from the replicates to reduce the measurement error three groups of experiments are performed table 1 the notation for the experiment name takes the format of l 1 l 2 θ 1 θ 2 fig 1 experiment group 1 is designed to study the effect of length ratio of the two conduits on the transport process l 1 is set at 10 cm while l 2 is set to 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 120 cm respectively the angles θ 1 and θ 2 are both fixed at 30 degrees experiment group 2 is designed to study the effect of total conduit length variation on the transport process keeping the length ratio of two conduits as 1 6 l 1 is set to be 10 cm 20 cm and 60 cm and l 2 is set to be 60 cm 120 cm and 360 cm respectively the angles θ 1 and θ 2 of the connectors are also fixed at 30 degrees experiment group 3 is designed to study the effect of the conduit connection angle on the transport process l 1 is set at 10 cm and l 2 is 60 cm and three different connection types are made by arranging the θ 1 and θ 2 combinations in total eight tracer tests are presented the 10 60 30 30 experiment is used in all of the three groups as a reference case 2 2 one dimensional modeling 2 2 1 dual region advection dispersion drad model to quantitatively investigate the dual peaked btcs obtained in section 2 1 we apply a dual region advection dispersion drad model this model has been called two region mrad model by majdalani et al 2018 and dade model by field and leij 2012 drad model assumes two regions flowing in parallel and exchanging mass due to concentration difference in both regions the ade model is assumed valid fig 2 we do not consider solute degradation or adsorption desorption in our model the drad model is chosen because it is the possible simplest model to reproduce the dual peaked btcs the governing equations are given as follows 1 c i t u i c i x d i 2 c i x 2 k ij w i c j c i i 1 2 j 2 1 2 k 12 k 21 3 w 1 w 2 1 the total concentration at the outlet is computed as 4 c x t w 1 c 1 x t w 2 c 2 x t where t is time t x is distance l ci is the concentration ml 3 of region i ui di and wi are respectively the flow velocity lt 1 dispersion coefficient l2t 1 and volumetric fraction in region i kij is the coefficient for solute exchange between regions i and j t 1 since we consider only two region systems k 12 k 21 and w 1 w 2 1 as a result six independent parameters are involved in the calibration w 1 k 12 u 1 u 2 d 1 and d 2 in our discussions the fast and slow regions are denoted by region 1 and region 2 respectively i e u 1 u 2 2 2 2 drad model parameter estimation the six independent drad model parameters were estimated using the mcmc method haario et al 2006 the mcmc method is a bayesian approach that evaluates the posterior distributions of parameters for an assumed error structure vrugt et al 2006 using the bayes rule the probability density function of the model parameter set θ w 1 k 12 u 1 u 2 d 1 d 2 is given as 5 p θ y l θ y p θ where p θ and p θ y are the prior and posterior parameter distribution respectively y y t 1 y t n is the observations l θ y is the likelihood function the prior distribution p θ is assumed to follow a uniform distribution the model residual for outlet concentrations are assumed to be independent and follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a constant variance σ 2 thus the posterior distribution is given by 6 p θ y σ 2 1 2 π σ 2 n 2 e x p i n c i y i 2 2 σ 2 where n is the number of observations ci and y i are the simulated and observed concentrations time i the convergence performance of mcmc chains is evaluated with a root mean square error rmse objective function which is defined as 7 rmse i 1 n c i y i 2 n we used the metropolis hastings mh algorithm to successively draw samples from the posterior distribution by forming a markov chain of model parameter set θ the mh algorithm constructs a markov chain in four main steps 1 choose an initial parameter set θ 0 and a proposal density distribution q θ k θ k 1 2 at each iteration k 1 generate a new sample θ from q θ θ k and calculate the probability of acceptance π min p θ l θ y q θ k θ p θ k l θ k y q θ θ k 1 draw a random number u from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 3 if π u set θ k 1 θ otherwise θ k 1 θ k 4 repeat steps 2 and 3 until a given maximum number of iteration is reached to achieve a fast convergence of the chain we first perform a manual fitting of the drad response to the experimental btcs to find the initial parameter set in this work we assume the posterior distribution is gaussian for each chain 16 000 iterations are executed and the last 1000 sampled parameter sets that allow the model to adequately fit the observed data were chosen to evaluate the posterior parameter distribution and the pairwise parameter correlations except for 10 20 30 30 all of the fitted parameters are set to be the mean value of these 1000 sets for 10 20 30 30 the fitted parameters are chosen with the criterion w 1 0 5 the parameter correlations are characterized by scatterplots of parameter pairs and the correlation coefficient r which is a statistical measure of the linear relationship between two variables given paired data x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n r is defined as 8 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where n is the sample size x and y are the mean value for and y respectively the parameter variability or uncertainty is represented by the parameter histogram and relative standard deviation rsd value rsd is calculated by 9 rsd i 1 n x i x 2 n 1 x 3 results 3 1 length ratio study experiment group 1 the btcs from experiment group 1 fig 3 trigger the following observations when the length ratio is small e g 2 the btc only exhibits a single peak for length ratio of 4 6 and 12 the btcs exhibit two peaks as the length ratio increases the first peak arrives slightly earlier while the arrival of the second peak is delayed the value of the first peak c peak1 decreases first from the 10 20 30 30 to the 10 40 30 30 case and then increases as the length ratio is further increased the concentration value of the second peak c peak2 decreases as the length ratio increases using the drad model and the mcmc calibration algorithm we try to correctly fit the experimental btcs visually the simulated btcs can capture the main shape of the experimental btcs the overall fitting performance is quite good for the 10 40 30 30 system with a maximum error value of 0 0233 table 2 however the recession limb of the second peak of some experimental btcs fig 3b c exhibits a slight skewness which the drad model is unable to capture exactly fig 3b d for the first experiment fig 3a the drad model allows a good fit for the btc curve for the dual peaked btcs fig 3b c the fit of the second peak is not as good as the fit of the first peak but the overall btc behavior is correctly reproduced by the drad model the parameters of the fitting result for group 1 are listed in table 2 and plotted in fig 4 we do not plot the variation of the exchange rate k 12 because of the very small values that indicate a negligible exchange rate and therefore a negligible effect on the btc from fig 4a we find that as the length ratio increases from 2 to 12 the velocity of region 1 u 1 increases from 4 46 10 2 to 5 09 10 2 1 1 14 the major increase in u 1 value occurs when transiting between 10 and 20 30 30 and 10 40 30 30 cases while the u 1 is only slightly increased from 10 to 40 30 30 to 10 120 30 30 cases the velocity of region 2 u 2 shows a significant decreasing trend decreases from 1 89 10 2 to 1 46 10 3 12 9 1 from 10 to 20 30 30 to 10 120 30 30 and u 2 decreases from 9 40 10 3 to 1 46 10 3 6 45 1 from 10 to 40 30 30 to 10 120 30 30 this is consistent with the fact that from 10 to 40 30 30 to 10 120 30 30 the second peak gets increasingly delayed fig 3 as we can see from fig 4b the d 1 value does not show any continuous increasing trend as the ratio increases from 2 to 12 d 1 increases from 5 71 10 4 to 1 05 10 3 1 1 84 and as the ratio increases from 4 to 12 d 1 increases from 3 99 10 4 to 1 05 10 3 1 2 63 such behavior of d 1 variation may be caused by the strong correlation between some parameters for the case of 10 20 30 30 see parameter identifiability results in section 3 4 and discussion in section 4 3 as the ratio increases from 2 to 12 d 2 decreases from 3 86 10 4 to 1 47 10 5 2 73 1 as the ratio increases from 2 to 12 w 1 increases from 0 526 to 0 653 1 1 24 w 2 decreases from 0 474 to 0 347 1 36 1 this is in agreement with the trend observed from fig 3 except for the experiment 10 20 30 30 which only has one peak as the length ratio increases the area below the second peak a 2 and thus the mass transported through the longer conduit decreases 3 2 total length study experiment group 2 in this series of experiments the length ratio is fixed to 6 0 and the total length l 1 l 2 varies the experimental btcs and the numerical fitting of group 2 are shown in fig 5 for group 2 all of the tested dual conduit structures exhibit double peaked btcs as the length increases the two peaks become increasingly separated as the length increases both c peak1 and c peak2 show a decreasing trend with c peak2 decreasing faster than c peak1 for the experiment 60 360 30 30 the longer conduit has a strong flow resistance thus the amount of tracer that enters this conduit is much less as a result the second peak has a very low concentration value 0 0148 and is hardly visible on the plot a visual inspection indicates that the drad does not equally capture the two peaks of the experimental btcs similar to the analysis of group 1 results the skewness of the second peak in the btcs is not perfectly reproduced by the drad model the parameters of the fitting result are listed in table 3 the fitted parameters for group 2 except the exchange rate k 12 that remains negligible are plotted in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 as the length increases from 10 cm to 60 cm to 60 cm 360 cm 1 6 the velocity u 1 increases from 5 13 10 2 to 5 25 10 2 1 1 02 and u 2 decreases from 5 27 10 3 to 2 03 10 3 2 60 1 fig 6a the dispersion coefficient of both regions increases d 1 increases from 7 42 10 4 to 1 63 10 3 1 2 19 d 2 increases from 1 82 10 5 to

has an important influence on the flow and transport process as the θ 1 θ 2 value increases the two peaks become closer to each other c peak1 decreases c peak2 increases same with previous groups the fit is better for the first peak of the experiment btcs than for the second peak with a maximum error value to be 0 0168 table 4 the fitted parameters for group 3 are plotted in fig 8 fig 8a shows that as θ 1 θ 2 increases from 90 to 90 u 1 decreases from 5 39 10 2 m s to 2 99 10 2 m s i e by 1 8 times and u 2 increases from 3 31 10 3 m s to 8 56 10 3 m s 2 6 times this conforms to the fact that as θ 1 θ 2 increases the first peak is delayed and the second peak appears sooner fig 7 the d 1 decreases from 7 81 10 4 m2 s to 3 55 10 5 m2 s 2 2 times fig 8b the d 2 increases from 2 22 10 5

smaller first peak and a larger second peak fig 7 3 4 parameter identifiability as presented in section 3 1 the variation of the estimated parameter set for the 10 20 30 30 experiment does not show a trend consistent with that of other experiments we thus perform a study to check the identifiability of model parameters for various group 1 experiments based on the statistics extracted from respective mcmc chains the priori distribution of drad parameters used in the mcmc calibration of the two experiments is shown in table 5 figs 9 and 10 present the mcmc statistics for the 10 20 30 30 and 10 60 30 30 experiments respectively the on diagonal plots of these figures are the estimated posterior parameter distributions for each parameter while the off diagonal plots correspond to scatterplots between parameter pairs a widespread point cloud on the scatterplots indicates that the parameters are independent a narrow stripe on the scatterplots means a strong correlation between two parameters the correlation intensity is quantified by the correlation coefficient r as defined by eq 8 which is indicated in the scatterplots the 95 percentiles of the breakthrough curves are shown in the inset above the diagonal it can be seen that except for k 12 all other parameters are appropriately identified as their posterior distribution is gaussian fig 9 in a simple sensitivity test we observe that varying k 12 within a wide range between 10 90 and 10 8 and fixing all other parameters there is no change in the outlet breakthrough curve changes in breakthrough curves only occur when k 12 takes a large value which is on the magnitude of 10 3 this means that the model is insensitive to k 12 as long as its value is small for the other parameters the 10 20 30 30 experiment exhibited a strong interaction between parameters fig 9 according to the parameter correlation plots we find some parameter pairs for example u 2 d 2 u 2 w 1 and d 2 w 1 even exhibited a linear trend on the cross plot the strong correlations are also shown by the high values of correlation coefficients r nearly equal to 1 fig 9 the other parameter pairs like u 2 d 1 d 1 d 2 and d 1 w 1 exhibited a slightly lower correlation strength with r values of 0 748 0 712 and 0 772 in contrast the 10 60 30 30 experiment exhibited stronger parameter identifiability and much weaker parameter interaction fig 10 no obvious correlation between the parameters was found the maximum r value of 0 611 was found for the parameter pair d 1 w 1 the variation range of posterior distributions of the parameters was also smaller the dispersion coefficients d 1 and d 2 have the largest rsd values of 0 051 and 0 052 respectively the rsd values of other parameters such as u 1 u 2 w 1 are quite small i e 0 006 0 006 0 007 respectively these observations indicate the drad model parameters were properly identified for the 10 60 30 30 experiment similar behavior has also been found for other experiments not shown here with larger conduit length ratios 4 discussion 4 1 representativeness of the experiments for karst tracer tests we examine to which degree our experiments are representative of natural karst systems and the possibility to extrapolate our laboratory finding to the characterization of karst aquifers based on field tracer tests we calculate three dimensionless quantities i e the conduit length to diameter ratio péclet number and reynolds number to evaluate the geometric kinematic and dynamic similarities between our experiments and previous field studies table 6 see also appendix a for a summary of parameter values reported in the literature the péclet number pé is a measure of the relative importance of advection versus diffusion it is defined as 10 pã lu d where l is the characteristic length l u is the local flow velocity lt 1 d is the diffusion coefficient l2t 1 the reynolds number re is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid 11 re ρ u d μ where ρ is the density of the fluid ml 3 u is the local flow velocity lt 1 d is the diameter of the tube l μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid ml 1t 1 the range of values of the geometric and kinematic similarity criteria i e the conduit length diameter ratio and péclet number of our experiments fall within the range of values obtained under field conditions regarding the dynamic similarity criterion the reynolds number of our experiments is quite small compared to that obtained from field tracer tests in our experiments the fluid flow in conduits is laminar i e re 2000 while it is well known that the turbulent flow often occurs in natural karst aquifers although the difference in flow regime may induce a discrepancy in pressure or flow rate in the conduits the general trend that the flow rate is positively correlated to the hydraulic head gradient is still respected thus the observed effect of conduit geometry on transport responses may still provide important insights for the interpretation of field tracer tests in natural karst systems our experimental work confirms that the dual conduit structure generally results in dual peaked btcs as shown in previous studies smart 1988 perrin and luetscher 2008 field and leij 2012 we further found that the number of peaks in the btcs is not necessarily the same as the number of conduits when the length of the two conduits is similar for example the btc of experiment 10 20 30 30 showed only one peak the single peak is composed of two overlapping concentration fronts whose arrival times to the outlet are similar 4 2 inferring conduit lengths from dual peaked btcs we propose to use tracer btcs to infer the length of conduits that form a looped network as shown in fig 1 and fig b1 for dual peaked btcs we denote the areas below the first and second peaks by a 1 and a 2 respectively for cases where the two peaks are fully separated a 1 a 2 may be used to approximate the ratio of the tracer amount of the two conduits when the péclet number is sufficiently high as in our experiments pé ranges from 7 77 to 21 27 advection dominates the flow process the flow rate ratio between the conduits may thus be approximated with the ratio of tracer amount passing through the two conduits i e q 1 q 2 a 1 a 2 see appendix b for details the mean travel times of the two packs of tracer at the outlet may be estimated by the concentration peak times t peak1 and t peak2 if all conduits are assumed to have a constant diameter that may be estimated by field investigations by applying mass conservation at the diverging and converging points of the dual conduit network the length of the shorter and longer conduits can be estimated by 12 l 1 e q 1 q 1 q 2 t peak 1 l s f π r 2 q 2 π r 2 13 l 2 e q 2 t peak 2 q 1 t peak 1 l s f π r 2 π r 2 where l 1e and l 2e are respectively the estimated lengths of the shorter and longer conduits l is the total length of the dual conduit structure i e the distance from the injection point to the sampling point via the shorter conduit s f is the sinuosity factor r is the conduit radius q 1 and q 2 are respectively the flow rates of shorter and longer conduits we validate the proposed method for estimating lengths of subsurface conduits by applying it to our experimental data of groups 1 and 2 the ratios between the estimated length and the actual length for the two conduits l 1e l 1 and l 2e l 2 are shown in fig 11 it can be seen that the length ratios for various experiments scatter around 1 0 which indicates an effective estimation the average value of this ratio is 1 058 the estimated values tend to be slightly larger than the true value the shorter conduit length seems better identified than that of the longer conduit this may be caused by the stronger skewness of the second peak i e stronger dispersion in the longer conduit the most biased case is the 10 60 30 120 experiment where the ratio for the shorter conduit l 1e l 1 1 20 however the ratio is still very close to 1 0 this indicates that the proposed method is valid at least for the tested conduit network configurations and flow conditions it is stressed that the method is based on the assumption the conduit diameter is constant for the entire system and is known the geometrical complexity of natural karst system may invalidate the assumption and imply considering an equivalent conduit diameter obviously the method should be checked for the more general cases of variable conduit diameter when experimental data for such experiments become available the method is applicable when btcs show fully separated dual peaks its usage may be hindered if the two peaks overlap each other for instance in the interpretation of the btcs of the 10 40 30 30 and 10 60 120 30 experiments we used the local minimum concentration point between the two peaks to approximately separate them and assess the areas under the two peaks the results of estimated conduit lengths appear reasonably good on the other hand the method is expected to be inaccurate when the two peaks are further separated for example in experiment 60 360 30 30 the small value of the second peak makes it difficult to evaluate a 2 because the concentration value is of the same order of magnitude as the background noise signal for real karst tracer tests the low concentration signal is very possible to be hidden behind the background noise signals this suggests us not to ignore the low concentration signals when performing tracer tests in real karst aquifers because this low concentration peak may indicate the existence of very long secondary conduits through which a few quantities of tracer is transported 4 3 parameter identifiability of drad model the distributions for the sets of parameters of 10 20 30 30 exhibited a strong interaction u 2 d 1 d 1 d 2 d 1 w 1 in the 10 20 30 30 experiment the concentration fronts from the two flowing regions do not separate i e the concentration is similar at a certain time on the other hand solute migration in the two regions of drad is modeled using two similar transport equations since the two transport equations have to handle similar concentration it is likely that the contribution of the two transport equations to the model responses is indistinguishable however it should be noted that the issue of difficult to separate model parameters observed in our study is different from the equifinality issue as discussed in younes et al 2016 younes et al 2016 used a similar dual flowing continuum model to examine transport problems in porous media that includes biofilm phases the equifinality of their model due to the non separated concentration fronts in model responses results essentially from a high exchange rate between the dual flowing phases in contrast in our experiments there is almost no mass exchange between the two regions the non separation of concentration peaks results from the similar arrival times of two packs of solute travel through the two conduits according to the rsd and r values the fitting mcmc chain of 10 60 30 30 showed weaker interaction the drad showed different parameter identifiability for 10 20 30 30 and 10 60 30 30 data one model may perform good parameter identifiability when characterizing a given btc and exhibits weak identifiability for another one this has been noted by previous studies wagner and harvey 1997 kelleher et al 2013 rana et al 2019 it seems necessary to study the model parameter identifiability with more cases for the single peaked btc the drad model may reproduce the curve sufficiently well but some of the estimated parameters show strong correlations this indicates that the drad is not optimally parsimonious for single peaked btc for the dual peaked btcs drad can adequately characterize the dual peaked btcs on the whole with good parameter identifiability but does not characterize the skewness of the btc peaks satisfactorily finding an optimal model for all situations is beyond the scope of the present study and is left for future research model fitting yields a negligible exchange rate k 12 this is attributed to the difference between the conceptual structure of the drad model and the physics of the transport process in the experiment in the drad model mass exchange is assumed to take place along the entire model length while in the experimental setup mass exchange only occurs at the divergence and convergence between the two conduits 5 conclusion in this paper we studied the solute transport process in dual conduit structures by lab scale experiments the main contributions of this study are summarized as follows first we studied how the dual conduit structure may influence the btcs shape specifically 1 as the length ratio increases on the c pv plot the two peaks get more separated the concentration value of the first peak c peak1 increases and the second peak c peak2 decreases 2 as the total length increases the two peaks become increasingly separated and the concentration value of both peaks decreases while c peak2 decreases much more than c peak1 3 as the θ 1 θ 2 value of the dual conduit connection increases the size of the first peak a 1 and thus the mass transported through the shorter conduit gets smaller and the size of the second peak a 2 and thus the mass transported through the longer conduit gets bigger second we proposed a method to estimate underground conduit length from recorded dual peaked btcs assuming a known average conduit diameter the method exhibits good performance when applied to the experimental btcs whether the method applies to the interpretation of real karst tracer tests needs to be further confirmed by fully controlled field experiments third we studied the ability of the drad model to reproduce btcs with a single peak and double peaks for the single peaked btcs the experimental data are well reproduced but the low parameter identifiability indicates that the drad model is non optimally parsimonious for dual peaked btcs the drad model achieves a good fitting with stronger parameter identifiability although the exchange coefficient is consistently negligible for some experiments the model fails to reproduce the skewness of some parts of the slower peaks while it may be considered useful for predictive purposes for a given site on which it has been properly calibrated the analysis of the fitting results shows that its parameters do not necessarily bear a physical meaning a path for research thus focuses on the development of models the parameters of which would reflect the geometric and hydraulic reality of the experiments the following limitations are acknowledged for the present study i the flow regime in the experiments is laminar while it can be turbulent in field tracer tests ii structures with variable conduit diameter were not studied iii neither the influence of varying flow velocities studying the influence of such factors is the

below the second peak from eqs b 2 and b 3 we have b4 m 1 m 2 a 1 a 2 assuming that advection dominates the transport process the tracer mass that enters the two conduits can also be approximated at

5149,we conducted lab scale experiments to investigate the mechanism of dual peaked breakthrough curves btcs in karst tracer tests three groups of dual conduit structures were constructed by varying 1 the length ratio between the two conduits for a fixed length of the shorter conduit 2 the total length of the conduits for a fixed length ratio 3 the connection angle between the conduits the btcs generated by the tracing experiments were fitted by a dual region advection dispersion drad model to derive effective transport parameters our results confirm that the dual conduit structure triggers the double peaked btcs increasing the conduit length for a fixed length ratio or increasing the length ratio increases peak separation the connection angles between the two conduits θ 1 and θ 2 also influence the btcs increasing θ 1 and decreasing θ 2 causes the first peak to get smaller and the second peak to get larger the drad model can reproduce the dual peaked btcs while its application to the case of single peaked btcs may be problematic due to strong interaction between model parameters a method is proposed for estimating underground karstic conduit lengths from experimental dual peaked btcs keywords karst conduit tracer test laboratory experiment breakthrough curve mcmc 1 introduction the methodology of tracer test initially developed for the investigation of karst aquifers is still widely used in karst hydrogeology tracer tests can provide information about groundwater trajectories and yield breakthrough curves btcs that can be used to estimate transport model parameters goldscheider and drew 2007 due to the strong heterogeneity of karst aquifers the btcs may exhibit asymmetry with long tails or multiple peaks moreno and tsang 1991 hauns et al 2001 massei et al 2006 perrin and luetscher goldscheider et al 2008 the advection dispersion equation ade performs poorly in characterizing these btcs to better reproduce tailing effects some researchers considered including further processes in the transport model morales et al 2010 the mobile immobile model mim developed by van genuchten and wierenga 1976 partitions the aquifer into mobile and immobile regions skopp et al 1981 proposed a dual permeability model also referred to as the multiple region advection dispersion mrad by majdalani et al 2018 with two mobile regions using the ade model berkowitz et al 2006 proposed the continuous time random walk ctrw theory by conceptualizing solute transport as a series of particle jumps or transitions with spatially changing velocities recently ctrw was also applied to karst aquifers goeppert et al 2020 dual peaked btcs were successfully modeled by the application of the dual advection dispersion equation dade and the weighted sum advection dispersion equation wsade model field and leij 2012 dual peaked btcs in karst tracer tests may be caused by the presence of pools or underground lakes along main conduits field and leij 2012 dewaide et al 2018 or multiple flow paths maloszewski et al 1992 goldscheider et al 2008 perrin and luetscher 2008 this hypothesis has been investigated using laboratory scale experiments in the past moreno and tsang 1991 field and leij 2012 among the different experiments used for a better understanding of karst aquifer solute transport some scale models account for both the conduit and the matrix florea and wicks 2001 li et al 2008 mohammadi et al 2019 while others focus on transport in conduits only zhao et al 2019 2017 field and leij 2012 field and leij 2012 noted that the presence of pools or auxiliary conduits causes dual peaked btcs mohammadi et al 2019 studied how the hydraulic head gradient influences btcs by a bench scale karst model zhao et al 2017 2019 found that the existence of pools on the conduit would increase the tailing of btcs however these studies did not show whether karst conduit properties can be inferred from btc shapes to better assess the relationship between conduit structure and btcs we studied how the dual conduit geometry influences the btcs shape by laboratory tracer experiments three groups of solute transport experiments were carried out the obtained btcs were fitted using a one dimensional transport model to achieve a quantitative comparison 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a series of lab scale idealized dual conduit structure models were built using silicone pipes with an internal diameter of 0 4 cm the dual conduit structure consists of three parts the inlet dual conduit and outlet at the inlet and outlet parts the flow is restricted in the single conduit at the dual conduit part the flow is divided into two conduits of different lengths fig 1 the shorter and the longer conduit lengths are denoted as l 1 and l 2 respectively the deviation angles between the shorter and longer conduits at both the inlet and outlet connecting part are denoted respectively as θ 1 and θ 2 during the experiments the dual conduit structure is placed on a horizontal platform to eliminate gravity effects the inflowing flow is supplied using a peristaltic pump lead fluid brand at a constant rate the discharge q is set at 0 6846 cm3 s and hence the calculated velocity through the outlet conduit is 5 4480 cm s the inlet is connected in parallel to a pure water supply and a salty water supply a three way adapter is used to switch between the salty water and pure water the salty water deionized water nacl at c 0 0 06 mol l is used as the tracer a pulse tracer release is realized by switching the adaptor to the salty water supply for 5 s 3 42 ml the physical models were fully sealed and the recovery rate was 100 for all of the experiments we use a scale mettler toledo to estimate the discharge a conductimeter wtw tetracon 325 accuracy is 1 10 6 mol l is used to measure the outlet tracer concentration the scale and conductimeter are connected to a data logger campbell cr1000 for automatic data recording at a time step of 1 s in order to obtain more accurate peak time the btcs have been interpolated by 0 05 s in each experiment the tracer injection is initiated after the flow within the system is stabilized each experiment is repeated three times a mean btc is derived from the replicates to reduce the measurement error three groups of experiments are performed table 1 the notation for the experiment name takes the format of l 1 l 2 θ 1 θ 2 fig 1 experiment group 1 is designed to study the effect of length ratio of the two conduits on the transport process l 1 is set at 10 cm while l 2 is set to 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 120 cm respectively the angles θ 1 and θ 2 are both fixed at 30 degrees experiment group 2 is designed to study the effect of total conduit length variation on the transport process keeping the length ratio of two conduits as 1 6 l 1 is set to be 10 cm 20 cm and 60 cm and l 2 is set to be 60 cm 120 cm and 360 cm respectively the angles θ 1 and θ 2 of the connectors are also fixed at 30 degrees experiment group 3 is designed to study the effect of the conduit connection angle on the transport process l 1 is set at 10 cm and l 2 is 60 cm and three different connection types are made by arranging the θ 1 and θ 2 combinations in total eight tracer tests are presented the 10 60 30 30 experiment is used in all of the three groups as a reference case 2 2 one dimensional modeling 2 2 1 dual region advection dispersion drad model to quantitatively investigate the dual peaked btcs obtained in section 2 1 we apply a dual region advection dispersion drad model this model has been called two region mrad model by majdalani et al 2018 and dade model by field and leij 2012 drad model assumes two regions flowing in parallel and exchanging mass due to concentration difference in both regions the ade model is assumed valid fig 2 we do not consider solute degradation or adsorption desorption in our model the drad model is chosen because it is the possible simplest model to reproduce the dual peaked btcs the governing equations are given as follows 1 c i t u i c i x d i 2 c i x 2 k ij w i c j c i i 1 2 j 2 1 2 k 12 k 21

respectively the flow velocity lt 1 dispersion coefficient l2t 1 and volumetric fraction in region i kij is the coefficient for solute exchange between regions i and j t 1 since we consider only two region systems k 12 k 21 and w 1 w 2 1 as a result six independent parameters are involved in the calibration w 1 k 12 u 1 u 2 d 1 and d 2 in our discussions the fast and slow regions are denoted by region 1 and region 2 respectively i e u 1 u 2 2 2 2 drad model parameter estimation the six independent drad model parameters were estimated using the mcmc method haario et al 2006 the mcmc method is a bayesian approach that evaluates the posterior distributions of parameters for an assumed error structure vrugt et al 2006 using the bayes rule the probability density function of the model parameter set θ w 1 k 12 u 1 u 2 d 1 d 2 is given as 5 p θ y l θ y p θ where p θ and p θ y are the prior and posterior parameter distribution respectively y y t 1 y t n is the observations l θ y is the likelihood function the prior distribution p θ is assumed to follow a uniform distribution the model residual for outlet concentrations are assumed to be independent and follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a constant variance σ 2 thus the posterior distribution is given by 6 p θ y σ 2 1 2 π σ 2 n 2 e x p i n c i y i 2 2 σ 2 where n is the number of observations ci and y i are the simulated and observed concentrations time i the convergence performance of mcmc chains is evaluated with a root mean square error rmse objective function which is defined as 7 rmse i 1 n c i y i 2 n we used the metropolis hastings mh algorithm to successively draw samples from the posterior distribution by forming a markov chain of model parameter set θ the mh algorithm constructs a markov chain in four main steps 1 choose an initial parameter set θ 0 and a proposal density distribution q θ k θ k 1 2 at each iteration k 1 generate a new sample θ from q θ θ k and calculate the

and 3 until a given maximum number of iteration is reached to achieve a fast convergence of the chain we first perform a manual fitting of the drad response to the experimental btcs to find the initial parameter set in this work we assume the posterior distribution is gaussian for each chain 16 000 iterations are executed and the last 1000 sampled parameter sets that allow the model to adequately fit the observed data were chosen to evaluate the posterior parameter distribution and the pairwise parameter correlations except for 10 20 30 30 all of the fitted parameters are set to be the mean value of these 1000 sets for 10 20 30 30 the fitted parameters are chosen with the criterion w 1 0 5 the parameter correlations are characterized by scatterplots of parameter pairs and the correlation coefficient r which is a statistical measure of the linear relationship between two variables given paired data x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n r is defined as 8 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2

the length ratio is small e g 2 the btc only exhibits a single peak for length ratio of 4 6 and 12 the btcs exhibit two peaks as the length ratio increases the first peak arrives slightly earlier while the arrival of the second peak is delayed the value of the first peak c peak1 decreases first from the 10 20 30 30 to the 10 40 30 30 case and then increases as the length ratio is further increased the concentration value of the second peak c peak2 decreases as the length ratio increases using the drad model and the mcmc calibration algorithm we try to correctly fit the experimental btcs visually the simulated btcs can capture the main shape of the experimental btcs the overall fitting performance is quite good for the 10 40 30 30 system with a maximum error value of 0 0233 table 2 however the recession limb of the second peak of some experimental btcs fig 3b c exhibits a slight skewness which the drad model is unable to capture exactly fig 3b d for the first experiment fig 3a the drad model allows a good fit for the btc curve for the dual peaked btcs fig 3b c the fit of the second peak is not as good as the fit of the first peak but the overall btc behavior is correctly reproduced by the drad model the parameters of the fitting result for group 1 are listed in table 2 and plotted in fig 4 we do not plot the variation of the exchange rate k 12 because of the very small values that indicate a negligible exchange rate and therefore a negligible effect on the btc from fig 4a we find that as the length ratio increases from 2 to 12 the velocity of region 1 u 1 increases from 4 46 10 2 to 5 09 10 2 1 1 14 the major increase in u 1 value occurs when transiting between 10 and 20 30 30 and 10 40 30 30 cases while the u 1 is only slightly increased from 10 to 40 30 30 to 10 120 30 30 cases the velocity of region 2 u 2 shows a significant decreasing trend decreases from 1 89 10 2 to 1 46 10 3 12 9 1 from 10 to 20 30 30 to 10 120 30 30 and u 2 decreases from 9 40 10 3 to 1 46 10 3 6 45 1 from 10 to 40 30 30 to 10 120 30 30 this is consistent with the fact that from 10 to 40 30 30 to 10 120 30 30 the second peak gets increasingly delayed fig 3 as we can see from fig 4b the d 1 value does not show any continuous increasing trend as the ratio increases from 2 to 12 d 1 increases from 5 71 10 4 to 1 05 10 3 1 1 84 and as the ratio increases from 4 to 12 d 1 increases from 3 99 10 4 to 1 05 10 3 1 2 63 such behavior of d 1 variation may be caused by the strong correlation between some parameters for the case of 10 20 30 30 see parameter identifiability results in section 3 4 and discussion in section 4 3 as the ratio increases from 2 to 12 d 2 decreases from 3 86 10 4 to 1 47 10 5 2 73 1 as the ratio increases from 2 to 12 w 1 increases from 0 526 to 0 653 1 1 24 w 2 decreases from 0 474 to 0 347 1 36 1 this is in agreement with the trend observed from fig 3 except for the experiment 10 20 30 30 which only has one peak as the length ratio increases the area below the second peak a 2 and thus the mass transported through the longer conduit decreases 3 2 total length study experiment group 2 in this series of experiments the length ratio is fixed to 6 0 and the total length l 1 l 2 varies the experimental btcs and the numerical fitting of group 2 are shown in fig 5 for group 2 all of the tested dual conduit structures exhibit double peaked btcs as the length increases the two peaks become increasingly separated as the length increases both c peak1 and c peak2 show a decreasing trend with c peak2 decreasing faster than c peak1 for the experiment 60 360 30 30 the longer conduit has a strong flow resistance thus the amount of tracer that enters this conduit is much less as a result the second peak has a very low concentration value 0 0148 and is hardly visible on the plot a visual inspection indicates that the drad does not equally capture the two peaks of the experimental btcs similar to the analysis of group 1 results the skewness of the second peak in the btcs is not perfectly reproduced by the drad model the parameters of the fitting result are listed in table 3 the fitted parameters for group 2 except the exchange rate k 12 that remains negligible are plotted in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 as the length increases from 10 cm to 60 cm to 60 cm 360 cm 1 6 the velocity u 1 increases from 5 13 10 2 to 5 25 10 2 1 1 02 and u 2 decreases from 5 27 10 3 to 2 03 10 3 2 60 1 fig 6a the dispersion coefficient of both regions increases d 1 increases from 7 42 10 4 to 1 63 10 3 1 2 19 d 2 increases from 1 82 10 5 to 4 77 10 5 1 2 62 fig 6b c w 1 remains almost the same from 0 633 to 0 721 1 1 14 fig 6d 3 3 connection angle experiment group 3 for group 3 experiments fig 7 the connector angle between two conduits has an important influence on the flow and transport process as the θ 1 θ 2 value increases the two peaks become closer to each other c peak1 decreases c peak2 increases same with previous groups the fit is better for the first peak of the experiment btcs than for the second peak with a maximum error value to be 0 0168 table 4 the fitted parameters for group 3 are plotted in fig 8 fig 8a shows that as θ 1 θ 2 increases from 90 to 90 u 1 decreases from 5 39 10 2 m s to 2 99 10 2 m s i e by 1 8 times and u 2 increases from 3 31 10 3 m s to 8 56 10 3 m s 2 6 times this conforms to the fact that as θ 1 θ 2 increases the first peak is delayed and the second peak appears sooner fig 7 the d 1 decreases from 7 81 10 4 m2 s to 3 55 10 5 m2 s 2 2 times fig 8b the d 2 increases from 2 22 10 5 m2 s to 3 17 10 5 m2 s 1 4 times fig 8c w 1 decreases from 0 732 to 0 451 1 6 times while w 2 increases from 0 268 to 0 549 2 times fig 8d the changes in w 1 and w 2 values are consistent with a smaller first peak and a larger second peak fig 7 3 4 parameter identifiability as presented in section 3 1 the variation of the estimated parameter set for the 10 20 30 30 experiment does not show a trend consistent with that of other experiments we thus perform a study to check the identifiability of model parameters for various group 1 experiments based on the statistics extracted from respective mcmc chains the priori distribution of drad parameters used in the mcmc calibration of the two experiments is shown in table 5 figs 9 and 10 present the mcmc statistics for the 10 20 30 30 and 10 60 30 30 experiments respectively the on diagonal plots of these figures are the estimated posterior parameter distributions for each parameter while the off diagonal plots correspond to scatterplots between parameter pairs a widespread point cloud on the scatterplots indicates that the parameters are independent a narrow stripe on the scatterplots means a strong correlation between two parameters the correlation intensity is quantified by the correlation coefficient r as defined by eq 8 which is indicated in the scatterplots the 95 percentiles of the breakthrough curves are shown in the inset above the diagonal it can be seen that except for k 12 all other parameters are appropriately identified as their posterior distribution is gaussian fig 9 in a simple sensitivity test we observe that varying k 12 within a wide range between 10 90 and 10 8 and fixing all other parameters there is no change in the outlet breakthrough curve changes in breakthrough curves only occur when k 12 takes a large value which is on the magnitude of 10 3 this means that the model is insensitive to k 12 as long as its value is small for the other parameters the 10 20 30 30 experiment exhibited a strong interaction between parameters fig 9 according to the parameter correlation plots we find some parameter pairs for example u 2 d 2 u 2 w 1 and d 2 w 1 even exhibited a linear trend on the cross plot the strong correlations are also shown by the high values of correlation coefficients r nearly equal to 1 fig 9 the other parameter pairs like u 2 d 1 d 1 d 2 and d 1 w 1 exhibited a slightly lower correlation strength with r values of 0 748 0 712 and 0 772 in contrast the 10 60 30 30 experiment exhibited stronger parameter identifiability and much weaker parameter interaction fig 10 no obvious correlation between the parameters was found the maximum r value of 0 611 was found for the parameter pair d 1 w 1 the variation range of posterior distributions of the parameters was also smaller the dispersion coefficients d 1 and d 2 have the largest rsd values of 0 051 and 0 052 respectively the rsd values of other parameters such as u 1 u 2 w 1 are quite small i e 0 006 0 006 0 007 respectively these observations indicate the drad model parameters were properly identified for the 10 60 30 30 experiment similar behavior has also been found for other experiments not shown here with larger conduit length ratios 4 discussion 4 1 representativeness of the experiments for karst tracer tests we examine to which degree our experiments are representative of natural karst systems and the possibility to extrapolate our laboratory finding to the characterization of karst aquifers based on field tracer tests we calculate three dimensionless quantities i e the conduit length to diameter ratio péclet number and reynolds number to evaluate the geometric kinematic and dynamic similarities between our experiments and previous field studies table 6 see also appendix a for a summary of parameter values reported in the literature the péclet number pé is a measure of the relative importance of advection versus diffusion it is defined as 10 pã lu d where l is the characteristic length l u is the local flow velocity lt 1 d is the diffusion coefficient l2t 1 the reynolds number re is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid 11 re ρ u d μ where ρ is the density of the fluid ml 3 u is the local flow velocity lt 1 d is the diameter of the tube l μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid ml 1t 1 the range of values of the geometric and kinematic similarity criteria i e the conduit length diameter ratio and péclet number of our experiments fall within the range of values obtained under field conditions regarding the dynamic similarity criterion the reynolds number of our experiments is quite small compared to that obtained from field tracer tests in our experiments the fluid flow in conduits is laminar i e re 2000 while it is well known that the turbulent flow often occurs in natural karst aquifers although the difference in flow regime may induce a discrepancy in pressure or flow rate in the conduits the general trend that the flow rate is positively correlated to the hydraulic head gradient is still respected thus the observed effect of conduit geometry on transport responses may still provide important insights for the interpretation of field tracer tests in natural karst systems our experimental work confirms that the dual conduit structure generally results in dual peaked btcs as shown in previous studies smart 1988 perrin and luetscher 2008 field and leij 2012 we further found that the number of peaks in the btcs is not necessarily the same as the number of conduits when the length of the two conduits is similar for example the btc of experiment 10 20 30 30 showed only one peak the single peak is composed of two overlapping concentration fronts whose arrival times to the outlet are similar 4 2 inferring conduit lengths from dual peaked btcs we propose to use tracer btcs to infer the length of conduits that form a looped network as shown in fig 1 and fig b1 for dual peaked btcs we denote the areas below the first and second peaks by a 1 and a 2 respectively for cases where the two peaks are fully separated a 1 a 2 may be used to approximate the ratio of the tracer amount of the two conduits when the péclet number is sufficiently high as in our experiments pé ranges from 7 77 to 21 27 advection dominates the flow process the flow rate ratio between the conduits may thus be approximated with the ratio of tracer amount passing through the two conduits i e q 1 q 2 a 1 a 2 see appendix b for details the mean travel times of the two packs of tracer at the outlet may be estimated by the concentration peak times t peak1 and t peak2 if all conduits are assumed to have a constant diameter that may be estimated by field investigations by applying mass conservation at the diverging and converging points of the dual conduit network the length of the shorter and longer conduits can be estimated by 12 l 1 e q 1 q 1 q 2 t peak 1 l s f π r 2 q 2 π r 2 13 l 2 e q 2 t peak 2 q 1 t peak 1 l s f π r 2 π r 2 where l 1e and l 2e are respectively the estimated lengths of the shorter and longer conduits l is the total length of the dual conduit structure i e the distance from the injection point to the sampling point via the shorter conduit s f is the sinuosity factor r is the conduit radius q 1 and q 2 are respectively the flow rates of shorter and longer conduits we validate the proposed method for estimating lengths of subsurface conduits by applying it to our experimental data of groups 1 and 2 the ratios between the estimated length and the actual length for the two conduits l 1e l 1 and l 2e l 2 are shown in fig 11 it can be seen that the length ratios for various experiments scatter around 1 0 which indicates an effective estimation the average value of this ratio is 1 058 the estimated values tend to be slightly larger than the true value the shorter conduit length seems better identified than that of the longer conduit this may be caused by the stronger skewness of the second peak i e stronger dispersion in the longer conduit the most biased case is the 10 60 30 120 experiment where the ratio for the shorter conduit l 1e l 1 1 20 however the ratio is still very close to 1 0 this indicates that the proposed method is valid at least for the tested conduit network configurations and flow conditions it is stressed that the method is based on the assumption the conduit diameter is constant for the entire system and is known the geometrical complexity of natural karst system may invalidate the assumption and imply considering an equivalent conduit diameter obviously the method should be checked for the more general cases of variable conduit diameter when experimental data for such experiments become available the method is applicable when btcs show fully separated dual peaks its usage may be hindered if the two peaks overlap each other for instance in the interpretation of the btcs of the 10 40 30 30 and 10 60 120 30 experiments we used the local minimum concentration point between the two peaks to approximately separate them and assess the areas under the two peaks the results of estimated conduit lengths appear reasonably good on the other hand the method is expected to be inaccurate when the two peaks are further separated for example in experiment 60 360 30 30 the small value of the second peak makes it difficult to evaluate a 2 because the concentration value is of the same order of magnitude as the background noise signal for real karst tracer tests the low concentration signal is very possible to be hidden behind the background noise signals this suggests us not to ignore the low concentration signals when performing tracer tests in real karst aquifers because this low concentration peak may indicate the existence of very long secondary conduits through which a few quantities of tracer is transported 4 3 parameter identifiability of drad model the distributions for the sets of parameters of 10 20 30 30 exhibited a strong interaction u 2 d 1 d 1 d 2 d 1 w 1 in the 10 20 30 30 experiment the concentration fronts from the two flowing regions do not separate i e the concentration is similar at a certain time on the other hand solute migration in the two regions of drad is modeled using two similar transport equations since the two transport equations have to handle similar concentration it is likely that the contribution of the two transport equations to the model responses is indistinguishable however it should be noted that the issue of difficult to separate model parameters observed in our study is different from the equifinality issue as discussed in younes et al 2016 younes et al 2016 used a similar dual flowing continuum model to examine transport problems in porous media that includes biofilm phases the equifinality of their model due to the non separated concentration fronts in model responses results essentially from a high exchange rate between the dual flowing phases in contrast in our experiments there is almost no mass exchange between the two regions the non separation of concentration peaks results from the similar arrival times of two packs of solute travel through the two conduits according to the rsd and r values the fitting mcmc chain of 10 60 30 30 showed weaker interaction the drad showed different parameter identifiability for 10 20 30 30 and 10 60 30 30 data one model may perform good parameter identifiability when characterizing a given btc and exhibits weak identifiability for another one this has been noted by previous studies wagner and harvey 1997 kelleher et al 2013 rana et al 2019 it seems necessary to study the model parameter identifiability with more cases for the single peaked btc the drad model may reproduce the curve sufficiently well but some of the estimated parameters show strong correlations this indicates that the drad is not optimally parsimonious for single peaked btc for the dual peaked btcs drad can adequately characterize the dual peaked btcs on the whole with good parameter identifiability but does not characterize the skewness of the btc peaks satisfactorily finding an optimal model for all situations is beyond the scope of the present study and is left for future research model fitting yields a negligible exchange rate k 12 this is attributed to the difference between the conceptual structure of the drad model and the physics of the transport process in the experiment in the drad model mass exchange is assumed to take place along the entire model length while in the experimental setup mass exchange only occurs at the divergence and convergence between the two conduits 5 conclusion in this paper we studied the solute transport process in dual conduit structures by lab scale experiments the main contributions of this study are summarized as follows first we studied how the dual conduit structure may influence the btcs shape specifically 1 as the length ratio increases on the c pv plot the two peaks get more separated the concentration value of the first peak c peak1 increases and the second peak c peak2 decreases 2 as the total length increases the two peaks become increasingly separated and the concentration value of both peaks decreases while c peak2 decreases much more than c peak1 3 as the θ 1 θ 2 value of the dual conduit connection increases the size of the first peak a 1 and thus the mass transported through the shorter conduit gets smaller and the size of the second peak a 2 and thus the mass transported through the longer conduit gets bigger second we proposed a method to estimate underground conduit length from recorded dual peaked btcs assuming a known average conduit diameter the method exhibits good performance when applied to the experimental btcs whether the method applies to the interpretation of real karst tracer tests needs to be further confirmed by fully controlled field experiments third we studied the ability of the drad model to reproduce btcs with a single peak and double peaks for the single peaked btcs the experimental data are well reproduced but the low parameter identifiability indicates that the drad model is non optimally parsimonious for dual peaked btcs the drad model achieves a good fitting with stronger parameter identifiability although the exchange coefficient is consistently negligible for some experiments the model fails to reproduce the skewness of some parts of the slower peaks while it may be considered useful for predictive purposes for a given site on which it has been properly calibrated the analysis of the fitting results shows that its parameters do not necessarily bear a physical meaning a path for research thus focuses on the development of models the parameters of which would reflect the geometric and hydraulic reality of the experiments the following limitations are acknowledged for the present study i the flow regime in the experiments is laminar while it can be turbulent in field tracer tests ii structures with variable conduit diameter were not studied iii neither the influence of varying flow velocities studying the influence of such factors is the

diameter of karst conduit ranges from a few centimeters to several meters upchurch et al 2018 the karst aquifer length is between 0 5 km and 10 km morales et al 2010 göppert and goldscheider 2008

below the second peak from eqs b 2 and b 3 we have b4 m 1 m 2 a 1 a 2 assuming that advection dominates the transport process the tracer mass that enters the two conduits can also be approximated at
