9050,as a vital cotton producing region the arid and semi arid region of northwest china has faced increasing scarcity of water resources and the associated decline in irrigation capacity has necessitated the adoption of more efficient irrigation methods in this region a two year field experiment was carried out in northern xinjiang of china in 2020 and 2021 to explore the effects of various soil water potential swp thresholds 10 20 30 and 40 kpa for drip irrigation on soil salinity soil temperature cotton growth seed cotton yield harvest index and water productivity the results showed that with the decrease of swp threshold soil moisture in the 0 20 cm soil layer decreased gradually while soil salinity decreased first and then increased soil salt content was lowest under 20 kpa and soil salinity was controlled below the root zone swp thresholds of 10 and 20 kpa could well control soil temperature during the whole growing season of cotton to reduce heat stress higher smp was beneficial to plant height leaf area and stem diameter but it did not significantly improve seed cotton yield the effects of soil moisture heat and salt on growth indexes and seed cotton yield were quantitatively evaluated based on the path analysis the number of cotton boll was the most influential growth variable on seed cotton yield and soil salt content had the most significant influence on boll number high frequency irrigation 10 kpa was not conducive to reducing soil salinity increasing boll number and increasing seed cotton yield drip irrigation with swp threshold of 20 kpa was recommended for drip irrigated cotton under film mulch in northern xinjiang this study can provide scientific basis for irrigation management of cotton in saline alkali regions keywords water productivity seed cotton yield path analysis cotton soil temperature soil salinity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil salinization and water shortage are two major factors restricting the agricultural productivity in arid and semi arid areas yan et al 2021 more than 412 million hectares of farmland worldwide are reported to be affected by soil salinization accounting for about 20 of available cropland but it is estimated that this figure can increase by 50 in 2050 montanarella et al 2015 nachshon 2018 wang et al 2020a with the rapid population growth limited fresh water supply and inadequate irrigation the agricultural sustainability in semi arid regions is facing increasing global challenges li et al 2021 therefore it is of great importance to improve the efficiency of irrigation water balance soil salinity and put forward a scientific and effective irrigation management system while ensuring sufficient crop yields cotton is the world s most important fiber crop and oil crop providing about 35 of the global fiber source abdelraheem et al 2019 as china is the world s largest raw cotton producer xinjiang has been the maximal high quality cotton production base in china since 2000 with an output of 4 51 106 t in 2014 accounting for 73 of the national total output li et al 2020c tian et al 2017a light and heat resources are very important for cotton and as a medium salt tolerant crop cotton is sensitive to soil water and salt status abdelraheem et al 2019 liu et al 2012b in order to ensure high cotton production local farmers often use extensive irrigation and fertilization management due to the excessive application of water and chemical fertilizers soil structure is destroyed greenhouse gas emissions increase significantly and soil secondary salinization is very prominent bai et al 2021 kuang et al 2018 what s more this unreasonable field production method damages cotton fiber quality without increasing seed cotton yield which further reduces its economic benefit ballester et al 2021 tian et al 2017a the primary purpose of irrigation is to provide cotton with the water they need for normal physiological activities zhang et al 2022 however exceeding plant requirements or soil water holding capacity may reduce its water productivity resulting in unnecessary resources waste jabeen et al 2022 matteau et al 2022 as water stress worsens this extensive use of agricultural water needs to be reconsidered irrigation is an essential factor in guaranteeing crop production in arid and semi arid regions appropriate irrigation can not only increase seed cotton yield strengthen cotton carbon assimilation but also avoid excessive energy consumption of cotton leaf and branch growth redundancy thereby promoting the increase of population yield effectively avoiding the machine harvest leaves greedy and reducing the amount of defoliant and fiber damage tian et al 2018 2017b in arid areas insufficient irrigation will also reduce cotton productivity cause soil salt accumulation lead to the synergistic effect of drought and heat and make cotton more likely to be affected by drought edde 2022 sconiers and eubanks 2017 himanshu et al 2021 showed that water productivity seed cotton yield and net income can be maximized by optimizing irrigation schedule for water stress at different growth stages ale et al 2020 showed that farmers can adjust the irrigation time and the amount of water per irrigation event and higher cotton seed yield can be achieved without reducing irrigation water use efficiency plant transpiration or soil moisture can be referred for setting cotton irrigation strategies hou et al 2022 ma et al 2022 although it is widely used to determine irrigation based on reference crop evaporation and crop coefficient this method is mainly based on crop variety growth period and climate change liu et al 2021 there are still many problems with this method which is difficult to respond to different soil textures li et al 2021 in recent years soil moisture state such as soil water potential or soil water content has been widely used in irrigation scheduling which can well determine the irrigation time and irrigation amount li et al 2020a 2022b ning et al 2021 set three irrigation intervals of 5 7 and 10 days and six irrigation amounts based on crop evapotranspiration to optimize irrigation for cotton liu et al 2022 improved irrigation scheduling of saline alkali cotton field by plant water deficit index meng et al 2023 optimized irrigation schemes based on root distribution these results indicated that optimal irrigation scheduling is an effective and economical method for salt stressed plots but these methods were not necessarily universally applicable or easy to use currently studies on soil water potential swp thresholds for irrigation in different crops such as tomato potato and wheat have been studied in response to root zone swp li et al 2022a matteau et al 2022 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 appropriate swp thresholds for different crops are also proposed saidi et al 2010 found the wheat seedlings had the largest root surface area between 40 and 60 kpa while with the reduction of swp below 60 kpa the root length of wheat seedlings descended significantly a study in the north china plain showed that swp of 25 kpa significantly increased crop evapotranspiration and was the most powerful setting for potato production while swp below 45 kpa led to a sharp decrease in tuber swelling rate wang et al 2007 zheng et al 2013 showed that tomato yield could be higher at 30 to 40 kpa when swp was lower than 40 kpa the yield decreased significantly but the fruit quality was better the path analysis can explain and quantify the direct and indirect effects on a fundamental variable resulting in more reliable and reasonable results li et al 2020b used path analysis to quantitatively describe the influence of different factors on irrigation water demand and proposed to use planting structure to reduce irrigation water consumption gong et al 2020b used path analysis to analyze the influencing factors of different irrigation treatments on plant transpiration tao et al 2021 found that evapotranspiration was a key component in determining yield with the highest direct coefficient and contribution rate based on path analysis and irrigation and appropriate nitrogen application should be carried out in the critical growth period however the effects of various soil water potential thresholds for drip irrigation on soil salinity seed cotton yield and water productivity of cotton has been poorly understood more importantly soil water potential in saline alkali lands is affected by soil solute which increases the uncertainty of irrigation strategy it is necessary to further explore the quantitative influence of soil water potential thresholds on soil moisture heat and salt changes and seed cotton yield to find out the most critical factors and the most limiting factors for cotton production therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to study effects of various swp thresholds on root zone soil moisture heat and salt distributions 2 to explore the influence of various swp thresholds on cotton growth seed cotton yield harvest index and water productivity 3 to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of soil hydrothermal and salt conditions on growth parameters and the final contribution to production quantitatively 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field

potentials were controlled by a tensiometer buried at a depth of 20 cm according to the recommendation of ballester et al 2021 irrigation was performed when the soil water potential was close to 10

suggested by liu et al 2012a irrigation was stopped at 95 of field capacity and the timing and amounts of drip irrigation applied each time for cotton in 2020 and 2021 are shown in fig 2 each

each treatment each plot area was 90 m2 7 5 m 12 m 2 3 measurement methods 2 3 1 soil sampling and soil physical parameters soil samples were collected with a soil auger at the 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm with spaces of 0 0 22 0 37 and 0 8 m to the mulch center at each growth stage in 2020 and 2021 the soil temperature was measured with a thermometer and the soil was then divided into two parts one part was put into an aluminum box and the soil moisture content was gauged with the drying method zou et al 2020 the other part was air dried milled and sieved with a screen of 2 mm in diameter then 5 g of soil was weighed and mixed with water at a ratio of 1 5 after full soaking shaking and filtration and total dissolved solids tds was finally measured xiao et al 2021 curved pipe geotherm meter was used in the 5 25 cm soil layer at 5 cm intervals at 08 00 14 00 and 20 00 on each measurement day the average daily soil temperature was averaged at three time points 2 3 2 cotton growth yield harvest index and water productivity four cotton plants were randomly selected at seedling budding flowering and boll opening stages to measure plant height stem diameter and leaf area

the path analysis was performed by the stepwise method tan et al 2021 graphics were drawn using origin 9 0 and surfer 9 0 3 results 3 1 soil moisture distribution under mulched drip irrigation fig 3 showed that different soil water potential thresholds significantly affected the two dimensional distributions of swc at different growth stages seedling budding flowering and boll opening stages in 2020 and 2021 in the horizontal direction the swc in the film mulched zones wide row drip tape and narrow row was higher than that in the non mulched zones and the swc in the whole soil layer decreased with the decrease of water potential threshold and the decrease in the film mulched zones was greater swc decreased with the increase of soil depth at budding flowering and boll opening stages in the vertical direction swc was higher at the 0 20 cm depth and was lower below 20 cm layer in 2020 and 2021 the surface swc was lower and the deep swc was higher which may be caused by the shallower root of cotton at the seedling stage which could hardly absorb the water in the deep soil for each growing season swc was highest at budding stage and lowest at boll opening stage generally swc in t1 and t2 treatments remained at a high level throughout the growing season which could ensure the normal growth of cotton 3 2 soil salinity distribution fig 4 showed the two dimensional distributions of soil salt content ssc in different soil water potential treatments in the horizontal direction ssc of each treatment under drip tape and in narrow row was lower than that in the non mulched zones significantly with the decreasing soil water potential ssc in narrow row decreased first and then increased and the minimum soil salinity in narrow row was obtained in the t2 treatment in the vertical direction due to continuous drip irrigation in the film mulched zones the surface soil salt was leached into deeper soil depths at budding and flowering stages t1 could control ssc below 20 30 cm soil layer and t2 could control ssc below 30 40 cm soil layer however the desalination area was only formed on the surface of t3 and t4 treatments in terms of growth stages the ssc of the whole soil profile began to decrease at the seeding stage reached the lowest at the flowering stage and the ssc increased slightly at the boll opening stage 3 3 soil temperature distribution fig 5 showed the changes of soil temperature at 5 25 cm depths in different soil water potential irrigation treatments in 2020 and 2021 table 2 showed the statistical parameters of soil temperature in 2020 and 2021 it was found that the irrigation amount decreased with the decrease of soil water potential resulting in an increase in soil temperature t1 t2 t3 t4 with increases by 2 8 7 06 and 2 69 8 74 compared with that in the t1 treatment in 2020 and 2021 respectively this difference was more significant in the surface soil 5 cm and 10 cm and the difference in soil temperature among treatments below 15 cm depth decreased the variation trend of soil temperature at different depths of each treatment was basically the same over time which was higher at the early growth stage and gradually decreased the difference of soil temperature among different treatments was mainly reflected at the late growth stage 90 days after sowing but not at the early growth stage the mean soil temperature of t1 t2 and t3 decreased slightly by 1 54 1 64 and 1 23 in 2021 compared with that in 2020 respectively while that of t4 remained unchanged during the two years 3 4 cotton growth fig 6 showed the plant height stem diameter lai boll number and aboveground biomass accumulation in 2020 and 2021 different soil water potential thresholds had significant effects on the growth parameters of cotton and the plant height decreased with the decrease of soil water potential compared with low water potential treatment t4 t1 t2 and t3 increased plant height by 47 02 33 99 and 12 61 in 2020 and 40 77 33 85 and 16 92 in 2021 respectively there were significant differences in stem diameter among different treatments t1 had the highest stem diameter which increased by 17 24 51 56 and 14 59 36 76 compared with that in the other treatments in 2020 and 2021 respectively stem diameter of t2 was slightly lower than that of t1 and no significant difference was found between t3 and t4 p 0 05 t1 had the maximum lai and only t2 and t4 showed significant differences among t2 t3 and t4 no significant difference was found in boll number among t1 t2 and t3 in 2020 and t1 and t2 produced significantly higher boll number than t4 while boll number of t2 was significantly higher than that of t3 and t4 in 2021 in 2020 the dry matter accumulation of cotton decreased with the decrease of soil water potential compared with low soil water potential t4 the dry matter accumulation of cotton in t1 t2 and t3 treatments increased by 51 73 39 89 and 19 78 in 2020 respectively while no significant difference was present between t1 and t2 in 2021 which were significantly higher than t3 and t4 in general plant height stem diameter and lai of t1 were greatest while the number of buds and dry matter accumulation of t1 and t2 were optimal 3 5 cotton yield harvest index and water productivity table 3 showed the effects of different soil water potential treatments on seed cotton yield harvest index and wp the seed cotton yield of t1 and t2 was significantly higher compared with that of t3 and t4 and the seed cotton yield of t2 was highest which increased 13 19 50 42 and 12 50 50 61 in 2020 and 2021 compared with that of t3 and t4 respectively the harvest index increased at first but then decreased with the decrease of soil water potential and t3 had the highest value with an increase of 3 18 13 05 and 11 89 19 59 compared with that of other treatments in 2020 and 2021 respectively with the decrease of soil water potential irrigation amount decreased and wp increased first and then decreased in the two years wp of t2 was highest in 2020 but wp was highest in t3 in 2021 however there was no significant difference in wp among t2 t3 and t4 between the two years while wp of t1 was lower than that of other treatments significantly compared with others they decreased by 16 26 22 03 and 14 84 18 56 respectively 3 6 direct correlation coefficients between cotton yield and growth parameters and soil moisture salt and temperature the path analysis results of yield and growth parameters in different treatments were shown in table 4 due to the direct and indirect effects the correlation coefficient on yield ranked dma bn ph sd lai lai and bn had the largest direct path coefficient on yield followed by dma and ph lai was smallest and the direct path coefficient on yield was negative however the indirect coefficient was largest in lai and the smallest in bn the determination coefficient showed that bn dma and ph were the three main limiting factors on yield therefore table 5 analyzed the influence of soil hydrothermal salt on these three factors the correlation coefficients between swc and these three parameters were positive while ssc and st were negative in addition swc had the highest total indirect path coefficient and the lowest path diameter coefficient for dma ph and bn swc had the highest determination coefficient of ph and dma indicating that soil moisture was the most important determinant of plant height and dry matter growth bn had the highest determination coefficients ssc and swc was slightly lower than ssc the results indicated that soil salt was the key determinant limiting bn therefore salts regulated by irrigation played a decisive role in cotton growth in arid areas 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of soil water potential on soil water salinity distribution in this study it was found that soil water potential played a decisive role in swc due to the difference of irrigation amount swc gradually decreased with the decrease of soil water potential fig 3 while ssc gradually increased the ssc in the 0 40 cm soil layer was higher indicating that swp had little influence on ssc below 40 cm and could only control it in the 0 40 cm soil layer which was similar to the results of liu et al 2011 and li et al 2018 soil salt accumulation in 0 30 cm soil layer increased first and then decreased with the increase of swp in t2 treatment salt control effect in soil layer below 30 cm was better which was slightly different from the results of wang et al 2012 this can be due to the difference of single irrigation amount irrigation frequency and total irrigation amount resulting from different swp controls the lower the swp was the lower the total irrigation amount was with the decreasing irrigation amount the leaching efficiency coefficient decreased linearly while the soil salt storage index increased linearly mao et al 2022 meanwhile different single irrigation quota had different effects on salt leaching and salt concentration was inversely proportional to single irrigation amount zhang et al 2017 proper irrigation amount can leach excess soil salinity increase swc effectively alleviate soil salinization and alkalization and accomplish soil water and salt balance du et al 2019 however the single irrigation amount of t1 was lower than 20 mm and the leaching effect of ssc was not as good as that of t2 this can be also due to the excessive irrigation of t1 which improved swc increased the root distribution in the wetting zone and formed a shallow root system this also reinforced the absorption capacity of cotton plants to soil water and further reduced the effect of salt leaching by irrigation wang et al 2021 4 2 the influence of soil water potential on soil temperature soil temperature is an important factor in the physical chemical and biological properties of soils and thus affects cotton growth in different ways our study found that the swp threshold determined the soil temperature on the one hand the lower swp resulted in the drier soil and lower heat capacity of dry soil which resulted in a rapid increase in soil temperature during the day hunt et al 2010 on the other hand lower swc was less conducive to cotton leaves growth resulting in lower lai and poorer shading area making it easier for sunlight to reach the soil surface li et al 2017 in addition compared with other growth stages the difference between the maximum and minimum soil temperature at the the early stage was greater which was caused by short plants and less leaves this was consistent with the results of karandish and shahnazari 2016 however many studies have shown that increasing average temperature at the beginning and the final growth stages promoted biomass accumulation pettigrew 2008 which also explained the general increase in yield and dry matter mass in 2021 compared to that in 2020 average soil temperature increased by 1 from 130 to 141 d after sowing in 2021 within 80 120 d after sowing soil temperature difference was largest among different treatments which was also the key stage of cotton boll growth due to the high heat sensitivity of enzyme reaction high temperature stress affected the overall enzyme activity of root system and limited cotton flowering and lint production li et al 2020d considering the increasing temperatures was common in cotton producing areas and the ability to use irrigation for soil thermal regulation was critical to cotton growth and yield singh et al 2007 in addition some studies have shown that the increase of soil temperature accelerated the decomposition of soil organic carbon and soil greenhouse gas emissions which had a negative impact on agricultural sustainability li et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 4 3 effects of soil water potential on cotton growth and seed cotton yield water directly affected the growth of cotton since cotton was the offspring of perennial plants and had the property of infinite growth wei et al 2022 therefore increasing irrigation amount significantly improved plant height stem diameter and lai of cotton which was matching with previous studies witt et al 2020 however this often came at the expense of reproductive growth in 2021 the boll number in t1 was slightly lower than that in t2 while the yield and dry matter accumulation were not significantly different from those in t2 this was similar to the meta analysis of cheng et al 2021 who found that cotton yield did not increase linearly with increasing irrigation amount and higher cotton yield can be obtained only when the deficit was around 6 8 soil salt was also an important limiting factor for cotton growth in severely salinized areas including osmotic stress ion toxicity and nutrient deficiency caused by salt wang et al 2018 traditional leaching was not suitable for water shortage areas so it was more important to use drip irrigation to alleviate salt stress in growth period in this study with the decrease of irrigation amount salt stress in t4 became more serious and cotton growth parameters and dry matter accumulation were lowest which was similar to the conclusion of kang et al 2010 it may be that the severe salt stress inhibited photosynthesis and reduced carbon assimilation of cotton li et al 2020d ming et al 2021 however only boll number reached the maximum in t2 with the lowest salinity while lai plant height and stem diameter reached the maximum in t1 we speculated that the influence of boll number may be more sensitive to the influence of salinity because excessive soil salinity resulted in delayed flowering increased boll detachment and decreased boll weight which ultimately led to reduced yield ju et al 2021 in addition drought stress was often accompanied by heat stress previous studies have shown that the synergistic effect of drought stress and high temperature stress worsened membrane stability aggravated oxidative stress reduced total soluble protein and ultimately destroyed cotton reproductive tissue saleem et al 2018 the increase in soil heat capacity due to irrigation resulted in faster cooling and warming of dry soil so that the highest soil temperature of the noon tended to be greater than the average daily soil temperature yin et al 2020 the increase in soil temperature was likely to exacerbate water stress during propagation by increasing crop transpiration thereby further reducing yield he et al 2017 4 4 effects of soil water potential on cotton water productivity and harvest index improving the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer and saving water resources through irrigation strategy are the constant pursuit of modern agriculture hou et al 2021a previous studies believed that wp was inversely proportional to irrigation amount and wp was usually higher in deficient irrigation while wp gradually decreased in over irrigation fan et al 2018 wang et al 2020b we found wp was lowest under high irrigation but it did not increase all the time as the irrigation amount gradually decreased and then gradually decreased with the maximum between t2 and t3 it may be that in harsh semi arid climate frequent irrigation of t1 increased irrigation water for cotton resulting in reduced water productivity çetin and kara 2019 paul et al 2016 in addition higher irrigation frequency and lower single irrigation amount may lead to more localized root growth limiting cotton plant s absorption of deep water and reducing wp el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 a number of studies have shown that suitable irrigation patterns namely mild water deficit can save significant amounts of irrigation water with minimal impact on crop yields by limiting soil drainage deeba et al 2012 rao et al 2016 shareef et al 2018 we found wp did not continue to increase under the minimum irrigation amount which may be because the low soil moisture and high salt stress severely restricted the development of cotton bolls and the low yield resulted in a slight decrease in water productivity as a vital index to appraise or assess seed cotton yield and cultivation effect hi reflects the proportion of upper biomass occupied by seed cotton many studies found that negative effect in hi was observed although irrigation amount increased hou et al 2021b luo et al 2018 similar to previous studies we found that water stress shortened the cotton seed yield and total biomass while it increased hi which indicated that the proportion of photosynthate transfer to reproductive organs percentage increased when soil water stress degree kept increasing however the higher irrigation amount resulted in the stronger vegetative growth and the later ripening of cotton it was less conducive to seed cotton yield and hi increase chen et al 2022 in addition the highest hi was obtained in t3 during 2020 2021 with hi reaching 0 37 and 0 4 respectively the hi of t4 decreased to 0 34 and 0 36 indicating that the lower swp threshold was also not conducive to improving hi 4 5 effects of different growth parameters and soil conditions on cotton productivity the path coefficient analysis divided the correlation coefficients into components of direct and indirect effects which allowed us to get a comprehensive picture of the contributions of various features toebe and cargnelutti filho 2013 table 4 showed that boll number dry matter accumulation and plant height had a high active impact on seed cotton yield while lai had a low negative impact on yield and stem diameter had a small positive impact on yield which was similar to previous studies karademir et al 2009 the reason may be that the number of bolls directly determined the total weight of cotton seed per plant while more dry matter weight and plant height guaranteed better reproductive growth of cotton plants however more lai meant more vegetative growth of photosynthetic products of cotton which was not conducive to the formation of yield composition rasheed et al 2009 singh and narkhede 2010 irrigation has an effect on soil moisture soil salt and soil heat which varies greatly according to irrigation frequency single irrigation amount and total irrigation amount lin et al 2021 ortiz and jin 2021 wang et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 we found that soil moisture and soil temperature were the most influential factors for plant height because suitable soil temperature and water conditions were conducive to early emergence of cotton braunack et al 2015 however the synergistic effect of higher soil temperature and lower soil moisture at budding and flowering stage may reduce the carbon assimilation of cotton zong et al 2021 in addition higher soil temperature will affect soil biological activity and decrease soil microbial diversity blaise et al 2021 soil moisture and soil salt were the most influential factors for dry matter accumulation liang and shi 2021 lin et al 2021 wang et al 2022 the reason was possibly that appropriate soil moisture and soil salt status improved crop canopy structure which was the basis for increased dry matter accumulation fan et al 2019 the most influential factors for boll number were soil salinity and soil moisture this was similar to the finding of ju et al 2021 who found that the salt stress led to the delayed of cotton flowering increased boll shedding and lower boll weight and ultimately led to a decline in seed cotton yield another reason may be that the higher content of na ions in soil restricted the absorption of soil nutrients especially k ions and further caused the ion balance in cotton cells leading to high osmotic stress and cytotoxicity sharif et al 2019 which meant that in semi arid areas under saline alkali stress the change of soil salinity caused by irrigation may be a key factor of cotton yield which required not only the amount of irrigation but also the frequency of irrigation and the amount of single irrigation t1 10 kpa had high water potential threshold due to the frequent irrigation and the small single irrigation amount was not conducive to soil salt leaching therefore we recommend the soil water potential threshold of 20 kpa its yield and water saving benefits and ecological benefits were best in areas affected by salinity the regulation of irrigation farmland to affect soil environment should be given priority 5 conclusions different soil water potential thresholds for drip irrigation had great effects on cotton growth and development yield components and soil water heat and salt status when drip irrigation was carried out in saline and alkaline farmlands the soil surface layer was too wet which was beneficial to the growth of cotton stems and leaves but was not conducive to soil salt removal and the development of cotton bolls and the final yield formation and ultimately reduced the water productivity and harvest index path analysis showed that soil salt content played a decisive role in boll formation which was the most important component of cotton yield when planting cotton in soil affected by salt the salt regulation of irrigation should be considered emphatically a soil water

9050,as a vital cotton producing region the arid and semi arid region of northwest china has faced increasing scarcity of water resources and the associated decline in irrigation capacity has necessitated the adoption of more efficient irrigation methods in this region a two year field experiment was carried out in northern xinjiang of china in 2020 and 2021 to explore the effects of various soil water potential swp thresholds 10 20 30 and 40 kpa for drip irrigation on soil salinity soil temperature cotton growth seed cotton yield harvest index and water productivity the results showed that with the decrease of swp threshold soil moisture in the 0 20 cm soil layer decreased gradually while soil salinity decreased first and then increased soil salt content was lowest under 20 kpa and soil salinity was controlled below the root zone swp thresholds of 10 and 20 kpa could well control soil temperature during the whole growing season of cotton to reduce heat stress higher smp was beneficial to plant height leaf area and stem diameter but it did not significantly improve seed cotton yield the effects of soil moisture heat and salt on growth indexes and seed cotton yield were quantitatively evaluated based on the path analysis the number of cotton boll was the most influential growth variable on seed cotton yield and soil salt content had the most significant influence on boll number high frequency irrigation 10 kpa was not conducive to reducing soil salinity increasing boll number and increasing seed cotton yield drip irrigation with swp threshold of 20 kpa was recommended for drip irrigated cotton under film mulch in northern xinjiang this study can provide scientific basis for irrigation management of cotton in saline alkali regions keywords water productivity seed cotton yield path analysis cotton soil temperature soil salinity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil salinization and water shortage are two major factors restricting the agricultural productivity in arid and semi arid areas yan et al 2021 more than 412 million hectares of farmland worldwide are reported to be affected by soil salinization accounting for about 20 of available cropland but it is estimated that this figure can increase by 50 in 2050 montanarella et al 2015 nachshon 2018 wang et al 2020a with the rapid population growth limited fresh water supply and inadequate irrigation the agricultural sustainability in semi arid regions is facing increasing global challenges li et al 2021 therefore it is of great importance to improve the efficiency of irrigation water balance soil salinity and put forward a scientific and effective irrigation management system while ensuring sufficient crop yields cotton is the world s most important fiber crop and oil crop providing about 35 of the global fiber source abdelraheem et al 2019 as china is the world s largest raw cotton producer xinjiang has been the maximal high quality cotton production base in china since 2000 with an output of 4 51 106 t in 2014 accounting for 73 of the national total output li et al 2020c tian et al 2017a light and heat resources are very important for cotton and as a medium salt tolerant crop cotton is sensitive to soil water and salt status abdelraheem et al 2019 liu et al 2012b in order to ensure high cotton production local farmers often use extensive irrigation and fertilization management due to the excessive application of water and chemical fertilizers soil structure is destroyed greenhouse gas emissions increase significantly and soil secondary salinization is very prominent bai et al 2021 kuang et al 2018 what s more this unreasonable field production method damages cotton fiber quality without increasing seed cotton yield which further reduces its economic benefit ballester et al 2021 tian et al 2017a the primary purpose of irrigation is to provide cotton with the water they need for normal physiological activities zhang et al 2022 however exceeding plant requirements or soil water holding capacity may reduce its water productivity resulting in unnecessary resources waste jabeen et al 2022 matteau et al 2022 as water stress worsens this extensive use of agricultural water needs to be reconsidered irrigation is an essential factor in guaranteeing crop production in arid and semi arid regions appropriate irrigation can not only increase seed cotton yield strengthen cotton carbon assimilation but also avoid excessive energy consumption of cotton leaf and branch growth redundancy thereby promoting the increase of population yield effectively avoiding the machine harvest leaves greedy and reducing the amount of defoliant and fiber damage tian et al 2018 2017b in arid areas insufficient irrigation will also reduce cotton productivity cause soil salt accumulation lead to the synergistic effect of drought and heat and make cotton more likely to be affected by drought edde 2022 sconiers and eubanks 2017 himanshu et al 2021 showed that water productivity seed cotton yield and net income can be maximized by optimizing irrigation schedule for water stress at different growth stages ale et al 2020 showed that farmers can adjust the irrigation time and the amount of water per irrigation event and higher cotton seed yield can be achieved without reducing irrigation water use efficiency plant transpiration or soil moisture can be referred for setting cotton irrigation strategies hou et al 2022 ma et al 2022 although it is widely used to determine irrigation based on reference crop evaporation and crop coefficient this method is mainly based on crop variety growth period and climate change liu et al 2021 there are still many problems with this method which is difficult to respond to different soil textures li et al 2021 in recent years soil moisture state such as soil water potential or soil water content has been widely used in irrigation scheduling which can well determine the irrigation time and irrigation amount li et al 2020a 2022b ning et al 2021 set three irrigation intervals of 5 7 and 10 days and six irrigation amounts based on crop evapotranspiration to optimize irrigation for cotton liu et al 2022 improved irrigation scheduling of saline alkali cotton field by plant water deficit index meng et al 2023 optimized irrigation schemes based on root distribution these results indicated that optimal irrigation scheduling is an effective and economical method for salt stressed plots but these methods were not necessarily universally applicable or easy to use currently studies on soil water potential swp thresholds for irrigation in different crops such as tomato potato and wheat have been studied in response to root zone swp li et al 2022a matteau et al 2022 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2021 appropriate swp thresholds for different crops are also proposed saidi et al 2010 found the wheat seedlings had the largest root surface area between 40 and 60 kpa while with the reduction of swp below 60 kpa the root length of wheat seedlings descended significantly a study in the north china plain showed that swp of 25 kpa significantly increased crop evapotranspiration and was the most powerful setting for potato production while swp below 45 kpa led to a sharp decrease in tuber swelling rate wang et al 2007 zheng et al 2013 showed that tomato yield could be higher at 30 to 40 kpa when swp was lower than 40 kpa the yield decreased significantly but the fruit quality was better the path analysis can explain and quantify the direct and indirect effects on a fundamental variable resulting in more reliable and reasonable results li et al 2020b used path analysis to quantitatively describe the influence of different factors on irrigation water demand and proposed to use planting structure to reduce irrigation water consumption gong et al 2020b used path analysis to analyze the influencing factors of different irrigation treatments on plant transpiration tao et al 2021 found that evapotranspiration was a key component in determining yield with the highest direct coefficient and contribution rate based on path analysis and irrigation and appropriate nitrogen application should be carried out in the critical growth period however the effects of various soil water potential thresholds for drip irrigation on soil salinity seed cotton yield and water productivity of cotton has been poorly understood more importantly soil water potential in saline alkali lands is affected by soil solute which increases the uncertainty of irrigation strategy it is necessary to further explore the quantitative influence of soil water potential thresholds on soil moisture heat and salt changes and seed cotton yield to find out the most critical factors and the most limiting factors for cotton production therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to study effects of various swp thresholds on root zone soil moisture heat and salt distributions 2 to explore the influence of various swp thresholds on cotton growth seed cotton yield harvest index and water productivity 3 to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of soil hydrothermal and salt conditions on growth parameters and the final contribution to production quantitatively 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field

each treatment each plot area was 90 m2 7 5 m 12 m 2 3 measurement methods 2 3 1 soil sampling and soil physical parameters soil samples were collected with a soil auger at the 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm with spaces of 0 0 22 0 37 and 0 8 m to the mulch center at each growth stage in 2020 and 2021 the soil temperature was measured with a thermometer and the soil was then divided into two parts one part was put into an aluminum box and the soil moisture content was gauged with the drying method zou et al 2020 the other part was air dried milled and sieved with a screen of 2 mm in diameter then 5 g of soil was weighed and mixed with water at a ratio of 1 5 after full soaking shaking and filtration and total dissolved solids tds was finally measured xiao et al 2021 curved pipe geotherm meter was used in the 5 25 cm soil layer at 5 cm intervals at 08 00 14 00 and 20 00 on each measurement day the average daily soil temperature was averaged at three time points 2 3 2 cotton growth yield harvest index and water productivity four cotton plants were randomly selected at seedling budding flowering and boll opening stages to measure plant height stem diameter and leaf area

the path analysis was performed by the stepwise method tan et al 2021 graphics were drawn using origin 9 0 and surfer 9 0 3 results 3 1 soil moisture distribution under mulched drip irrigation fig 3 showed that different soil water potential thresholds significantly affected the two dimensional distributions of swc at different growth stages seedling budding flowering and boll opening stages in 2020 and 2021 in the horizontal direction the swc in the film mulched zones wide row drip tape and narrow row was higher than that in the non mulched zones and the swc in the whole soil layer decreased with the decrease of water potential threshold and the decrease in the film mulched zones was greater swc decreased with the increase of soil depth at budding flowering and boll opening stages in the vertical direction swc was higher at the 0 20 cm depth and was lower below 20 cm layer in 2020 and 2021 the surface swc was lower and the deep swc was higher which may be caused by the shallower root of cotton at the seedling stage which could hardly absorb the water in the deep soil for each growing season swc was highest at budding stage and lowest at boll opening stage generally swc in t1 and t2 treatments remained at a high level throughout the growing season which could ensure the normal growth of cotton 3 2 soil salinity distribution fig 4 showed the two dimensional distributions of soil salt content ssc in different soil water potential treatments in the horizontal direction ssc of each treatment under drip tape and in narrow row was lower than that in the non mulched zones significantly with the decreasing soil water potential ssc in narrow row decreased first and then increased and the minimum soil salinity in narrow row was obtained in the t2 treatment in the vertical direction due to continuous drip irrigation in the film mulched zones the surface soil salt was leached into deeper soil depths at budding and flowering stages t1 could control ssc below 20 30 cm soil layer and t2 could control ssc below 30 40 cm soil layer however the desalination area was only formed on the surface of t3 and t4 treatments in terms of growth stages the ssc of the whole soil profile began to decrease at the seeding stage reached the lowest at the flowering stage and the ssc increased slightly at the boll opening stage 3 3 soil temperature distribution fig 5 showed the changes of soil temperature at 5 25 cm depths in different soil water potential irrigation treatments in 2020 and 2021 table 2 showed the statistical parameters of soil temperature in 2020 and 2021 it was found that the irrigation amount decreased with the decrease of soil water potential resulting in an increase in soil temperature t1 t2 t3 t4 with increases by 2 8 7 06 and 2 69 8 74 compared with that in the t1 treatment in 2020 and 2021 respectively this difference was more significant in the surface soil 5 cm and 10 cm and the difference in soil temperature among treatments below 15 cm depth decreased the variation trend of soil temperature at different depths of each treatment was basically the same over time which was higher at the early growth stage and gradually decreased the difference of soil temperature among different treatments was mainly reflected at the late growth stage 90 days after sowing but not at the early growth stage the mean soil temperature of t1 t2 and t3 decreased slightly by 1 54 1 64 and 1 23 in 2021 compared with that in 2020 respectively while that of t4 remained unchanged during the two years 3 4 cotton growth fig 6 showed the plant height stem diameter lai boll number and aboveground biomass accumulation in 2020 and 2021 different soil water potential thresholds had significant effects on the growth parameters of cotton and the plant height decreased with the decrease of soil water potential compared with low water potential treatment t4 t1 t2 and t3 increased plant height by 47 02 33 99 and 12 61 in 2020 and 40 77 33 85 and 16 92 in 2021 respectively there were significant differences in stem diameter among different treatments t1 had the highest stem diameter which increased by 17 24 51 56 and 14 59 36 76 compared with that in the other treatments in 2020 and 2021 respectively stem diameter of t2 was slightly lower than that of t1 and no significant difference was found between t3 and t4 p 0 05 t1 had the maximum lai and only t2 and t4 showed significant differences among t2 t3 and t4 no significant difference was found in boll number among t1 t2 and t3 in 2020 and t1 and t2 produced significantly higher boll number than t4 while boll number of t2 was significantly higher than that of t3 and t4 in 2021 in 2020 the dry matter accumulation of cotton decreased with the decrease of soil water potential compared with low soil water potential t4 the dry matter accumulation of cotton in t1 t2 and t3 treatments increased by 51 73 39 89 and 19 78 in 2020 respectively while no significant difference was present between t1 and t2 in 2021 which were significantly higher than t3 and t4 in general plant height stem diameter and lai of t1 were greatest while the number of buds and dry matter accumulation of t1 and t2 were optimal 3 5 cotton yield harvest index and water productivity table 3 showed the effects of different soil water potential treatments on seed cotton yield harvest index and wp the seed cotton yield of t1 and t2 was significantly higher compared with that of t3 and t4 and the seed cotton yield of t2 was highest which increased 13 19 50 42 and 12 50 50 61 in 2020 and 2021 compared with that of t3 and t4 respectively the harvest index increased at first but then decreased with the decrease of soil water potential and t3 had the highest value with an increase of 3 18 13 05 and 11 89 19 59 compared with that of other treatments in 2020 and 2021 respectively with the decrease of soil water potential irrigation amount decreased and wp increased first and then decreased in the two years wp of t2 was highest in 2020 but wp was highest in t3 in 2021 however there was no significant difference in wp among t2 t3 and t4 between the two years while wp of t1 was lower than that of other treatments significantly compared with others they decreased by 16 26 22 03 and 14 84 18 56 respectively 3 6 direct correlation coefficients between cotton yield and growth parameters and soil moisture salt and temperature the path analysis results of yield and growth parameters in different treatments were shown in table 4 due to the direct and indirect effects the correlation coefficient on yield ranked dma bn ph sd lai lai and bn had the largest direct path coefficient on yield followed by dma and ph lai was smallest and the direct path coefficient on yield was negative however the indirect coefficient was largest in lai and the smallest in bn the determination coefficient showed that bn dma and ph were the three main limiting factors on yield therefore table 5 analyzed the influence of soil hydrothermal salt on these three factors the correlation coefficients between swc and these three parameters were positive while ssc and st were negative in addition swc had the highest total indirect path coefficient and the lowest path diameter coefficient for dma ph and bn swc had the highest determination coefficient of ph and dma indicating that soil moisture was the most important determinant of plant height and dry matter growth bn had the highest determination coefficients ssc and swc was slightly lower than ssc the results indicated that soil salt was the key determinant limiting bn therefore salts regulated by irrigation played a decisive role in cotton growth in arid areas 4 discussion 4 1 the influence of soil water potential on soil water salinity distribution in this study it was found that soil water potential played a decisive role in swc due to the difference of irrigation amount swc gradually decreased with the decrease of soil water potential fig 3 while ssc gradually increased the ssc in the 0 40 cm soil layer was higher indicating that swp had little influence on ssc below 40 cm and could only control it in the 0 40 cm soil layer which was similar to the results of liu et al 2011 and li et al 2018 soil salt accumulation in 0 30 cm soil layer increased first and then decreased with the increase of swp in t2 treatment salt control effect in soil layer below 30 cm was better which was slightly different from the results of wang et al 2012 this can be due to the difference of single irrigation amount irrigation frequency and total irrigation amount resulting from different swp controls the lower the swp was the lower the total irrigation amount was with the decreasing irrigation amount the leaching efficiency coefficient decreased linearly while the soil salt storage index increased linearly mao et al 2022 meanwhile different single irrigation quota had different effects on salt leaching and salt concentration was inversely proportional to single irrigation amount zhang et al 2017 proper irrigation amount can leach excess soil salinity increase swc effectively alleviate soil salinization and alkalization and accomplish soil water and salt balance du et al 2019 however the single irrigation amount of t1 was lower than 20 mm and the leaching effect of ssc was not as good as that of t2 this can be also due to the excessive irrigation of t1 which improved swc increased the root distribution in the wetting zone and formed a shallow root system this also reinforced the absorption capacity of cotton plants to soil water and further reduced the effect of salt leaching by irrigation wang et al 2021 4 2 the influence of soil water potential on soil temperature soil temperature is an important factor in the physical chemical and biological properties of soils and thus affects cotton growth in different ways our study found that the swp threshold determined the soil temperature on the one hand the lower swp resulted in the drier soil and lower heat capacity of dry soil which resulted in a rapid increase in soil temperature during the day hunt et al 2010 on the other hand lower swc was less conducive to cotton leaves growth resulting in lower lai and poorer shading area making it easier for sunlight to reach the soil surface li et al 2017 in addition compared with other growth stages the difference between the maximum and minimum soil temperature at the the early stage was greater which was caused by short plants and less leaves this was consistent with the results of karandish and shahnazari 2016 however many studies have shown that increasing average temperature at the beginning and the final growth stages promoted biomass accumulation pettigrew 2008 which also explained the general increase in yield and dry matter mass in 2021 compared to that in 2020 average soil temperature increased by 1 from 130 to 141 d after sowing in 2021 within 80 120 d after sowing soil temperature difference was largest among different treatments which was also the key stage of cotton boll growth due to the high heat sensitivity of enzyme reaction high temperature stress affected the overall enzyme activity of root system and limited cotton flowering and lint production li et al 2020d considering the increasing temperatures was common in cotton producing areas and the ability to use irrigation for soil thermal regulation was critical to cotton growth and yield singh et al 2007 in addition some studies have shown that the increase of soil temperature accelerated the decomposition of soil organic carbon and soil greenhouse gas emissions which had a negative impact on agricultural sustainability li et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 4 3 effects of soil water potential on cotton growth and seed cotton yield water directly affected the growth of cotton since cotton was the offspring of perennial plants and had the property of infinite growth wei et al 2022 therefore increasing irrigation amount significantly improved plant height stem diameter and lai of cotton which was matching with previous studies witt et al 2020 however this often came at the expense of reproductive growth in 2021 the boll number in t1 was slightly lower than that in t2 while the yield and dry matter accumulation were not significantly different from those in t2 this was similar to the meta analysis of cheng et al 2021 who found that cotton yield did not increase linearly with increasing irrigation amount and higher cotton yield can be obtained only when the deficit was around 6 8 soil salt was also an important limiting factor for cotton growth in severely salinized areas including osmotic stress ion toxicity and nutrient deficiency caused by salt wang et al 2018 traditional leaching was not suitable for water shortage areas so it was more important to use drip irrigation to alleviate salt stress in growth period in this study with the decrease of irrigation amount salt stress in t4 became more serious and cotton growth parameters and dry matter accumulation were lowest which was similar to the conclusion of kang et al 2010 it may be that the severe salt stress inhibited photosynthesis and reduced carbon assimilation of cotton li et al 2020d ming et al 2021 however only boll number reached the maximum in t2 with the lowest salinity while lai plant height and stem diameter reached the maximum in t1 we speculated that the influence of boll number may be more sensitive to the influence of salinity because excessive soil salinity resulted in delayed flowering increased boll detachment and decreased boll weight which ultimately led to reduced yield ju et al 2021 in addition drought stress was often accompanied by heat stress previous studies have shown that the synergistic effect of drought stress and high temperature stress worsened membrane stability aggravated oxidative stress reduced total soluble protein and ultimately destroyed cotton reproductive tissue saleem et al 2018 the increase in soil heat capacity due to irrigation resulted in faster cooling and warming of dry soil so that the highest soil temperature of the noon tended to be greater than the average daily soil temperature yin et al 2020 the increase in soil temperature was likely to exacerbate water stress during propagation by increasing crop transpiration thereby further reducing yield he et al 2017 4 4 effects of soil water potential on cotton water productivity and harvest index improving the utilization efficiency of water and fertilizer and saving water resources through irrigation strategy are the constant pursuit of modern agriculture hou et al 2021a previous studies believed that wp was inversely proportional to irrigation amount and wp was usually higher in deficient irrigation while wp gradually decreased in over irrigation fan et al 2018 wang et al 2020b we found wp was lowest under high irrigation but it did not increase all the time as the irrigation amount gradually decreased and then gradually decreased with the maximum between t2 and t3 it may be that in harsh semi arid climate frequent irrigation of t1 increased irrigation water for cotton resulting in reduced water productivity çetin and kara 2019 paul et al 2016 in addition higher irrigation frequency and lower single irrigation amount may lead to more localized root growth limiting cotton plant s absorption of deep water and reducing wp el hendawy and schmidhalter 2010 a number of studies have shown that suitable irrigation patterns namely mild water deficit can save significant amounts of irrigation water with minimal impact on crop yields by limiting soil drainage deeba et al 2012 rao et al 2016 shareef et al 2018 we found wp did not continue to increase under the minimum irrigation amount which may be because the low soil moisture and high salt stress severely restricted the development of cotton bolls and the low yield resulted in a slight decrease in water productivity as a vital index to appraise or assess seed cotton yield and cultivation effect hi reflects the proportion of upper biomass occupied by seed cotton many studies found that negative effect in hi was observed although irrigation amount increased hou et al 2021b luo et al 2018 similar to previous studies we found that water stress shortened the cotton seed yield and total biomass while it increased hi which indicated that the proportion of photosynthate transfer to reproductive organs percentage increased when soil water stress degree kept increasing however the higher irrigation amount resulted in the stronger vegetative growth and the later ripening of cotton it was less conducive to seed cotton yield and hi increase chen et al 2022 in addition the highest hi was obtained in t3 during 2020 2021 with hi reaching 0 37 and 0 4 respectively the hi of t4 decreased to 0 34 and 0 36 indicating that the lower swp threshold was also not conducive to improving hi 4 5 effects of different growth parameters and soil conditions on cotton productivity the path coefficient analysis divided the correlation coefficients into components of direct and indirect effects which allowed us to get a comprehensive picture of the contributions of various features toebe and cargnelutti filho 2013 table 4 showed that boll number dry matter accumulation and plant height had a high active impact on seed cotton yield while lai had a low negative impact on yield and stem diameter had a small positive impact on yield which was similar to previous studies karademir et al 2009 the reason may be that the number of bolls directly determined the total weight of cotton seed per plant while more dry matter weight and plant height guaranteed better reproductive growth of cotton plants however more lai meant more vegetative growth of photosynthetic products of cotton which was not conducive to the formation of yield composition rasheed et al 2009 singh and narkhede 2010 irrigation has an effect on soil moisture soil salt and soil heat which varies greatly according to irrigation frequency single irrigation amount and total irrigation amount lin et al 2021 ortiz and jin 2021 wang et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 we found that soil moisture and soil temperature were the most influential factors for plant height because suitable soil temperature and water conditions were conducive to early emergence of cotton braunack et al 2015 however the synergistic effect of higher soil temperature and lower soil moisture at budding and flowering stage may reduce the carbon assimilation of cotton zong et al 2021 in addition higher soil temperature will affect soil biological activity and decrease soil microbial diversity blaise et al 2021 soil moisture and soil salt were the most influential factors for dry matter accumulation liang and shi 2021 lin et al 2021 wang et al 2022 the reason was possibly that appropriate soil moisture and soil salt status improved crop canopy structure which was the basis for increased dry matter accumulation fan et al 2019 the most influential factors for boll number were soil salinity and soil moisture this was similar to the finding of ju et al 2021 who found that the salt stress led to the delayed of cotton flowering increased boll shedding and lower boll weight and ultimately led to a decline in seed cotton yield another reason may be that the higher content of na ions in soil restricted the absorption of soil nutrients especially k ions and further caused the ion balance in cotton cells leading to high osmotic stress and cytotoxicity sharif et al 2019 which meant that in semi arid areas under saline alkali stress the change of soil salinity caused by irrigation may be a key factor of cotton yield which required not only the amount of irrigation but also the frequency of irrigation and the amount of single irrigation t1 10 kpa had high water potential threshold due to the frequent irrigation and the small single irrigation amount was not conducive to soil salt leaching therefore we recommend the soil water potential threshold of 20 kpa its yield and water saving benefits and ecological benefits were best in areas affected by salinity the regulation of irrigation farmland to affect soil environment should be given priority 5 conclusions different soil water potential thresholds for drip irrigation had great effects on cotton growth and development yield components and soil water heat and salt status when drip irrigation was carried out in saline and alkaline farmlands the soil surface layer was too wet which was beneficial to the growth of cotton stems and leaves but was not conducive to soil salt removal and the development of cotton bolls and the final yield formation and ultimately reduced the water productivity and harvest index path analysis showed that soil salt content played a decisive role in boll formation which was the most important component of cotton yield when planting cotton in soil affected by salt the salt regulation of irrigation should be considered emphatically a soil water potential threshold of 20 kpa was recommended which can better adapt to cotton water demand and improve cotton yield and water productivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9051,vineyards from hilly areas of the mediterranean region are mostly grown in shallow soils that present low soil water holding capacity these vineyards are prone to water stress conditions which if well managed can raise the grape quality potential this study aimed to investigate the water stress development in an aglianico vineyard grown along a 90 m slope the two year 2011 2012 trial was conducted in two soils having different hydraulic properties the up slope with lower soil water holding capacity than the down slope site the results showed that grapevines were more stressed in the up slope soil than in the down slope soil as reflected by the higher crop water stress index lower leaf water potential and leaf gas exchanges values consequently the yield was significantly lower by 40 in the up slope which was determined by the lower weight and volume of berries the smaller berries improved must quality parameters of total soluble solids total polyphenols total anthocyanins and color intensity within a range of 4 25 higher in the up slope compared to the down slope site moreover the pre veraison stress experienced in 2012 reduced yield by 30 and depressed berry weight and volume compared to 2011 the post veraison stress induced the improvement of must quality mainly in the up slope 2011 interestingly there was no significant difference in the ph and titratable acidity between both sites which indicates the ability of up slope vines to make up for more stressful conditions and thus their resilient behavior to maintain their high quality wine this study highlights that vineyards in hilly areas may benefit from a differentiated management between different viticulture zones to bring up their high quality wine keywords vitis vinifera l pre veraison post veraison gas exchanges pca must composition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction grapevine vitis vinifera l subsp vinifera is a woody perennial crop that has been cultivated for more than 8000 years in the mediterranean region and still nowadays constitutes one of the main elements of its agricultural sector novara et al 2021 the planning and management of grapevine towards high quality wines are typically carried out using viticultural zoning procedures carey 2001 gladstones and smart 1997 vaudour 2003 these are an extension at a finer scale of the standard concept of terroir bonfante and brillante 2022 defined as a spatial and temporal entity with homogeneous or outstanding grape and or wine soil landscape and climate characteristics within a territory marked by socio cultural technical choices vaudour 2003 within each of these viticulture zones it is expected that the specific pedoclimate and specific management affects grapevine physiology creating in turn unique wines in each territory van leeuwen et al 2004 garcía navarro et al 2022 the environment of the mediterranean region that fosters potential high quality wine and grape production has been related to vineyards in hilly areas and rainfed farmed hofmann et al 2014 prosdocimi et al 2016 grapevine in this region is well adapted to marginal areas with sloping shallow well drained and poor fertile soils and thus with a higher risk to develop water deficit lazcano et al 2020 consequently grapevines are suited to the lack of water and recurrent drought and thus it plays a role in the adaptation to climate change by agriculture santillán et al 2020 previous research have strengthened the hypothesis that the physical soil properties and geomorphological features affect the final yield and grape quality characteristics even more than the soil chemical properties poni et al 2018 there is a consensus that steep sloped coarse textured and stony soils confer the best wine quality due to their lower soil water holding capacity which increases the grapevine water deficit poni et al 2018 water deficit conditions generated in these soils would boost earlier shoot growth slackening smaller berry size high grape sugar and anthocyanin concentrations thus rising grape quality potential bonfante et al 2017 brillante et al 2017 lazcano et al 2020 van leeuwen et al 2004 the impact of water stress on vine growth and yield fulfillment has been demonstrated as highly dependent on the intensity of the stress the phenological stages and greatly variable within short distances in the same field especially in vineyards grown in sloped soils bonfante et al 2017 brillante et al 2017 wenter et al 2018 basile et a 2020 this temporal and local soil variability has significant consequences not only in the physiological processes such as photosynthesis and stomatal conductance but also on the synthesis of grape compositional factors such as sugar acids anthocyanins and tannins and must composition pereyra et al 2022 pre and post veraison stages in grapevines are the most sensitive phenological phases to the effects of water deficit on yield and grape quality however results are not consistent among studies especially for post veraison stress poni et al 2018 the stress effects in these two phases are interrelated because deficit in pre veraison could cause a greater post veraison water deficit due to their cumulative effect van leeuwen et al 2004 casassa et al 2015 the same magnitude of water deficit has been reported to affect canopy growth yield and grape quality more when occurring in pre than post veraison girona et al 2009 palai et al 2021 wenter et al 2018 this is mainly related to the increased berry sensitivity to the soil water deficit and therefore to the vine water stress before veraison because the xylem is the main source of water for the berry instead of the phloem which becomes the unique berry stem hydraulic connection after veraison munitz et al 2017 in addition pre veraison water stress can restrain cell division and thus the total cell numbers which irreversibly decreases berry growth while late water stress can only produce a reversible negative effect on cell size girona et al 2009 ojeda at al 2002 wenter et al 2018 palai et al 2021 berry size diminution increases the skin to pulp weight ratio which results in higher concentrations of phenolic and anthocyanins compounds in the berry skin and lower concentration of total soluble solids ojeda et al 2002 the aroma composition of berries is also affected in relation to the phenological stage as glycosilated vocs were enhanced when water deficit occurred in pre veraison while no effect was detected for post veraison stress palai et al 2022 the greater variability reported in the literature about the effects of post veraison stress on the grapevine and wine performance can be attributed to the different intensity of the applied stress and the sensitivity of the cultivar in this way girona et al 2009 observed an improvement in the grape quality of cv tempranillo only when post veraison water deficit at midday did not decrease below 1 12 mpa leaf water potential threshold similar results were reported in the same cultivar by intrigliolo et al 2012 who informed that an excessive water deficit in post veraison reduced leaf photosynthesis and thus impaired sugar accumulation in another research conducted in potted shiraz vines in south of france ollé et al 2011 found that post veraison stress caused a decrease in berry weight whilst no effects were found in pre veraison stress as it was in the full irrigated vines more recently geng et al 2022 in cabernet sauvignon grown in semi arid area of china showed improved grape quality when water stress was mild from fruit setting to veraison or mild severe during post veraison consequently comparing studies and drawing general conclusions about grapevine adaptation to water stress remains difficult to establish even though vineyards in the mediterranean region are characteristic of hilly areas most of the conducted research dealing with water deficit reported the outcomes of experiments conducted in flat vineyards bota et al 2016 intrigliolo et al 2012 edwards and clingeleffer 2013 or compared the performance of vineyards grown in two separate sloped and flat fields zsófi et al 2009 in a mediterranean hilly viticultural area in a two year experiment the influence of different soil hydrological characteristics along a slope with the same textural class but different hydraulic properties on the vineyard performance was highlighted by our research group bonfante et al 2015 2017 moreover through a modeling approach we confirmed that rather than the slope gradient the different soil hydrological properties between up and down sloped soils were the main factors in driving the soil water potential and the vine water stress basile et al 2020 in the same experimental vineyard we continued the previous research conducted by basile et al 2020 as there is an evident gap in knowledge on the performances of rainfed vineyards grown in sloped soils indeed the data on the grape yield and must quality responses to different water stress conditions in vines grown at short distances along a slope are scarce therefore the main aim of this paper was to study the differences associated with the development of water stress conditions between rainfed vines grown in two different soils along a slope in terms of physiological responses grape yield and must quality moreover the paper studied the effects that pre and post veraison stress could have on the above parameters of the two sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 study

while in 2012 the biggest spell of rainfall was 60 mm during mid july basile et al 2020 the experiment was performed during 2011 and 2012 in a rainfed vitis vinifera l cv aglianico vineyard that was 10 years old grafted on v berlandieri planch x v rupestris scheele 1103 p and trained with a spurred cordon the rows were oriented nw se 320 and the vines were spaced 2 m between rows and 1 m along the rows i e 5000 plants per hectare the monitored vines were located along a slope length 90 m inclination β 10 in two different soils of the vineyard named the up slope and the down slope sites these two experimental plots were chosen after identifying them in two functional homogeneous soils by bonfante et al 2015 thus the two soils are classified according to the iuss working group wrb 2014 as calcisol clayic aric in the up slope site and cambisol clayic aric colluvic in the down slope site the two soils despite their same textural class clay loam show different soil hydrological

than the up slope soil 80 mm of awc bonfante et al 2015 2017 basile et al 2020 parameters of soil hydraulic properties along the profile of the two soils are reported in basile et al 2020 2 2 field

potential and leaf gas exchanges at the flowering stage fig 2a d of both years the vines did not experience any stress in either site in terms of both indicators potential cwsi and ψl as both soils had an optimum water content availability because of the rainfalls in winter as reported by bonfante et al 2015 and in may fig 1 during the pre veraison of 2011 the cwsi was less than 10 in both sites fig 2a while the ψl in the up slope began to be significantly lower than the down slope site at doy 188 fig 2c the cwsi and the ψl are crucial indicators for vine water status fuentes et al 2012 mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 according to the water stress thresholds based on leaf water potential van leeuwen et al 2009 the up slope vines depicted weak water stress ψl between 0 9 and 1 1 mpa while the down slope ones did not show any stress ψl 0 9 mpa in 2012 the cwsi at the pre veraison was much higher than the one in 2011 reaching 56 in the up slope fig 2b with the corresponding ψl equal to 1 35 mpa which matches with moderate to severe stress ψl between 1 3 and 1 4 mpa in pre veraison fig 2d in the same way in the down slope site the cwsi achieved values of 27 and the ψl was equal to 1 17 mpa depicting weak to moderate stress van leeuwen et al 2009 during post veraison in the up slope the maximum cwsi of 61 and the lowest ψl of 1 67 mpa occurred in 2011 fig 2a c indicating higher stress conditions than 2012 however the up slope vines reached levels of severe water stress ψl 1 4 mpa in the post veraison stage in both years fig 2c d in the same stage the down slope site achieved on average the maximum values of 32 cwsi and around 1 40 mpa ψl in both years which agreed with moderate severe water stress levels the ψl values registered along the season in both years fall within the common ranges for ψl in pre veraison of 0 8 mpa till achieving 1 7 mpa in post veraison stage in vineyards cultivated in semi arid environments as reported by other authors e g schultz 2003 centeno et al 2010 although cwsi and ψl are independent indicators they followed the same dynamics along the experimental seasons and across treatments in addition both were able to discriminate different timing of stress occurrence and its intensity between the up and down slope sites a positive correlation between cwsi and stem water potential with the slope position in the steep slope vineyards of chianti terroir tuscany italy has been reported also by puig sirera et al 2021 it is well known that field grown grapevines when submitted to long term water deficit show a strong reduction of stomatal conductance and co2 assimilation escalona et al 2000 in our experiment stomatal conductance gs and leaf co2 assimilation rate a resembled the general dynamics of ψl of the two slope positions in both experimental years fig 3a d fig 2c d hence both parameters were significantly lower in the up than in the down slope vines after the flowering stage doy 157 and 151 in 2011 and 2012 respectively and both decreased along the season with progressive drought quite low values of gs 0 038 mol m 2 s 1 and a 3 2 mol m 2 s 1 were registered in the up slope at the end of the pre veraison 2012 doy 202 a rainfall event during veraison doy 215 allowed a significant recovery followed by a strong decrease to the lowest values of gs and a at grape maturity gs 0 018 mol m 2 s 1 a 2 2 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 3b d the stress during pre veraison could have impaired both the rate and the extent of recovery after the rainy event flexas et al 2009 lovisolo et al 2010 and thus exacerbated the subsequent decrease in the gas exchanges of the up slope vines these gs data indicate severe vine water stress conditions in the up slope vines at both pre and post veraison as they are lower than the threshold 0 05 mol m 2 s 1 for severe water stress according to cifre et al 2005 in addition gs and a in the up slope vines were also low at grape maturity in 2011 gs 0 042 mol m 2 s 1 a 5 74 μmol m 2 s 1 indicating that severe water stress conditions also occurred in post veraison of 2011 during this stage we observed the maximum difference in intrinsic wue iwue a gs between up and down slope vines mainly due to the strong gs reduction in the up slope fig 3e conversely in 2012 differences in iwue between the two sites were less marked during most of the sea son fig 3f the decrease of both stomatal conductance and photosynthesis and the increase of iwue in grapevines with increased conditions of water deficit has been largely reported in many studies e g bota et al 2016 brillante et al 2016 palai et al 2021 poni et al 2009 the leaf gas exchange values of the down slope vines followed the same pattern as the ones in the up slope vines although achieving moderate water stress levels in both experimental years cifre et al 2005 the higher stress conditions in the up slope vines than in the down slope are due to the lower soil water retention capacity encountered in the up slope soil as demonstrated in previous works in the same experimental sites basile et al 2020 bonfante et al 2015 2017 similarly zsófi et al 2009 found significant differences in soil water availability between flat and steep slope vineyards which were reflected in lower pre dawn leaf water potentials gs and a values in the steep ones in addition the severe water stress experienced in the upper soil vines which caused a lower leaf co2 assimilation rate was at the same time reflected in reduced vegetative growth in fact along the season lai in up slope averaged 1 18 m2m 2 0 21 in 2011 12 lower than down slope while in 2012 lai averaged 1 36 m2m 2 0 17 22 lower than down slope vines data not shown the psii quantum yield ϕpsii was assessed through modulated fluorescence and resembled the a rates fig 3g h the up slope ϕpsii decreased to a minimum of 0 07 r u near grape maturity doy 252 of 2011 while in the same period the down slope vines showed double values fig 3g rainfalls occurring near veraison in 2012 also induced a recovery of ϕpsii in both slope positions likewise a and gs the down slope vines reached a maximum ϕpsii 0 2 r u at doy 215 fig 3h which is comparable with values measured during the flowering stage in 2011 fig 3g when no water stress was detected fig 2c such a recovery of ϕpsii in 2012 was followed by a gradual decrease with the lowest 0 09 r u value reached by the up slope vines in the late season such value was about half of the one measured in the down slope doy 271 fig 3h ju et al 2018 also reported a decrease in ϕpsii which can induce photoinhibition due to a light excess under water stress conditions maroco et al 2002 reported for tempranillo cv during mid summer a quantum yield of psii about 0 4 in the control and 0 3 in the stressed vines at midday because of earlier stomatal closure in the latter vines therefore both gas exchanges and fluorescence data confirmed the intense stress conditions encountered in the up slope vines the close link between impaired gas exchanges namely photosynthesis caused by decreased soil water availability and grape yield reduction is well established in the literature medrano et al 2003 3 2 yield and its components grapevine yields were significantly influenced by the slope position s p 0 001 and year y p 0 01 table 1 as expected the less water stressed down slope vine yielded significantly better 40 than the up slope vine in addition the yield of 2011 was significantly higher by 30 than the one of 2012 consequently s and y also significantly affected the related yield parameters of berry weight and volume both parameters mimicked the yield results and were higher in the down slope and 2011 thereby the differences in yield across treatments and years were mainly determined by the berry weight and volume the yield was also significantly affected by the slope year s y interaction specifically the down slope vines in 2011 showed the highest yield while the up slope vines in 2012 had the lowest grape yield 43 these results on yield differences between the up and down slope vines could be explained by the different hydraulic properties and specifically by the lower water retention of the soil horizons of the upper site basile et al 2020 bonfante et al 2017 the up slope soil hydrological properties led to a lower soil water content and also lower soil matric potential that imposed more intense stress in those grapevines moreover the significant rainfall event at the beginning of veraison 2012 probably avoided more intense stress in post veraison on the other hand the down slope vines in 2011 were able to produce the highest yield when there was no stress in pre veraison and moderate post veraison stress the pre veraison stress that took place in 2012 was the main driver of yield reduction in both sites the results on the influence that pre veraison stress has on yield and berry growth parameters agree with previous data reported in the literature for example casassa et al 2015 found a significant reduction of berry weight that turned into limited yields in cabernet sauvignon grapes subjected to pre veraison stress while post veraison stress caused no yield reduction in comparison to full irrigated grapes wenter et al 2018 on an experiment in hilly viticulture reported significantly lower yield in rainfed vines subjected to severe stress in pre veraison compared to those with full or deficit irrigation similarly palai et al 2021 reported the lowest value of yield fresh and dry berry weight for vines subjected to pre veraison stress in addition intrigliolo et al 2016 found that severe post veraison stress in rainfed cabernet sauvignon vines decreased berry weight and yield by 30 when compared to irrigated vines at 50 of etc these results are in line with our yield results of 2011 whose differences were driven by severe post veraison stress in up slope vines intermediate yields were generated in the up slope vines in 2011 and the down slope vines in 2012 table 1 both of them were significantly lower than the down slope 2011 but not significantly different from the up slope 2012 in this way these yield differences were significant in the down slope vines between the two years while no significance was found between the up slope vines in particular the up slope yield of 2011 was not significantly higher than the up slope yield of 2012 even with different severity and timing of stress furthermore the yield results of 2012 resulted in a non significant 12 difference between the two sites this small yield difference arose even if the up slope site encountered moderate to severe levels of pre veraison stress and the down slope site weak to moderate levels at the same time both sites experienced severe post veraison water stress levels in 2012 these results could be explained by the improved efficiency of water management by the upper grapevines for production purposes the grapevines from the up slope under more stressed conditions could have developed internal adaptation mechanisms that enabled them to maintain a steady production indeed pagay et al 2022 observed in an australian mediterranean type climate area that rain fed cabernet sauvignon showed better resilience to drought when grown in shallow soils as compared to vines in deep soils due to drought adaptation mechanisms induced by the cyclical droughts over many years 3 3 berry composition a great significant effect p 0 0001 of slope position s was detected for total soluble solids total polyphenols total anthocyanins and color intensity of berries table 1 specifically the up slope vines were 4 21 21 and 25 higher than the down slope vines respectively for each of the above parameters several studies reported that must quality improves significantly with mild to moderate water stress castellarin et al 2007 munitz et al 2017 ojeda et al 2002 however to our knowledge there are not many studies that investigate the ranges of berry quality parameters between two different slope positions regarding the vine water stress development in the same experimental site bonfante et al 2017 found significant correlations between the cwsi and tannins total anthocyanins color intensity and sugar content in both sites moreover there was also a significant influence p 0 001 of the s in the relative composition of phenolic compounds grapes from the up slope position were 10 higher in tannins and 8 3 lower in the tannins anthocyanin s ratio these results are important for the aglianico cultivar as an excess of tannins and tannins anthocyanins ratio could give astringents and tawny wines muccillo et al 2014 picariello et al 2020 the s x y interaction was statistically significant for total polyphenols and tannins in 2011 both parameters were statistically higher in the up than in the down slope site while even if these must parameters showed no significant difference in 2012 there was a clear trend indicating better quality in the up than in the down slope the effect of the s on the phenolic compounds anthocyanins and tannins of the up slope berries could be related to an excessive exposure to light irradiation of the berries in this way specific key enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase chalcone synthase and stilbene synthase of flavonoid pathway would be more activated ferrer et al 2008 moreover the slight shift towards higher production of anthocyanins with respect to tannins could be due to more specific activation of genes involved in this specific branch of pathway for aglianico grapes although grapes from the up slope position were in higher water stress conditions with respect to the down slope position differences in titratable acidity and ph between the two sites were almost negligible table 1 this result is important considering future drier climate as the upper vines seem to be able to maintain an acidic equilibrium similar to the one of the down slope vines which were under less water stress conditions regarding the year factor table 1 the main effect was detected for tss and titratable acidity probably due to the higher temperature and eto of 2012 than in 2011 fig 1 specifically the titratable acidity was 7 4 higher in 2011 compared to 2012 while the tss were 2 3 lower in 2011 than in 2012 similar findings were reported in previous studies mira de orduña 2010 wenter et al 2018 that reported significantly higher tss and lower titratable acidity in vineyards during the experimental year with the highest eto temperatures and limited soil water availability despite the limitation of the only two year dataset our results show that up slope grapes could produce red wines with high levels of total phenolic compounds and tannins good visual and gustatory scores and thus with greater commercial value fanzone et al 2012 3 4 correlation matrix and principal components analysis the pearson correlation matrix fig 4 allows the analysis of the relationships among the investigated variables the yield variation was more positively correlated with berry weight and volume gs pre and post and a pre whereas it was moderately positively correlated with ψ1 pre and post smwp pre and post and low positively correlated with titratable acidity and a post on the other hand the grape yield was highly negatively correlated with quality parameters such as tss ph total anthocyanins total polyphenols and total tannins whereas it was moderately negatively correlated with iwue post and cwsi pre and post and low negatively correlated with iwue pre total anthocyanins total polyphenols total tannins and tss quality parameters were more strongly correlated with water stress indicators cwsi ψ1 and smwp in post veraison as compared to pre veraison indicating that water deficiency in post veraison ameliorated the must quality fig 4 our results indicate that yield is strongly related to the photosynthetic rate a in the pre veraison stage because carbohydrate assimilation takes place for cell proliferation and expansion in this stage chaves et al 2010 whereas the plant water status and soil matric potential in both pre and post veraison stages strongly influence yield van leeuwen et al 2009 these outcomes have been reported in previous works but with some differences in the relationship between these variables and the final yield girona et al 2009 intrigliolo et al 2016 this fact may be due to the diverse variety sensitivity and or to the application of different levels of stress vaz et al 2016 to obtain a comprehensive overview of the soil and vine physiological parameters physical and quality grape characteristics and yield in response to slope position s and years y the whole data set including the climatic parameters from may to early october of the two years was subjected to principal component analysis pca for this trial the first two principal components pcs were associated with eigenvalues 1 and explained 86 3 of the cumulative variance pc1 accounted for 68 5 and pc2 for 17 8 table 2 fig 5 shows the pca results for the first two components pc1 and pc2 in the first pc the highly positively and significantly weighted variables were berry volume gs post a pre berry weight smwp pre ψ1 pre yield gs pre a post ϕpsii pre smwp post titratable acidity ψ1 post while the moderately weighted were ϕpsii post and the climatic parameters solar radiation rain and tavg in the pc1 total anthocyanins tss ph total tannins total polyphenols potential cwsi pre were instead highly negatively weighted and eto only lowly moreover in the second pc the potential cwsi post was positively and strongly weighted table 2 in contrast with what was expected a positive weak correlation between titratable acidity and the average temperature was shown in the pca fig 5 however previous studies showed that the relationship between temperature and acidic profile of grapes is cultivar dependent for instance in shiraz cv in contrasts with cabernet franc cv a lack of plasticity of ph with regards to temperature was observed sadras et al 2013 this result is of great interest for aglianico grape especially considering the dramatic effect that climate change can have on the base parameters of grapes and the fundamental role of low ph and high titratable acidity for gustative equilibrium and microbial and pigment stability of aglianico wine forino et al 2020 data could be instead considered consistent with previous studies on aglianico grapes where shoot trimming that usually determines an increase of bunch temperature was applied but no significant effect on ph and titratable acidity of berry juice was observed caccavello et al 2019 it is also possible that the lack of a great effect could be due to the higher content of exchangeable potassium in the down slope site compared to the upper site marcuzzo et al 2021 further and more specific experiments to study the separate effects of light and temperature the potassium soil content and the k accumulation capacity could help to better understand the behavior of this grape cultivar regarding these environmental factors the pc1 and pc2 score plot fig 5 discriminated the variables that more influenced each slope x year treatment s x y the positive side of pc1 in the lower right quadrant included most of the observations of the down slope site of 2011 this site was characterized by high relative values of soil and vine water potential thus good water status which was associated to the highest yield table 1 the lowest yield was recorded in the up slope 2012 treatment table 1 which observations fall within the left lower quadrant characterized by the highest cwsi pre and eto moreover as the highest relative values of both smwp pre and ψ1 pre were observed for the opposite quadrant right upper it means that the lowest values of these water status parameters i e stressful conditions occurred in up slope 2012 therefore we can infer that water stress in pre veraison caused the lowest yield observed in the up slope 2012 the observations from the upper and lower left quadrant characterized the up slope 2011 and 2012 respectively both sites were identified by lower yield and high quality parameters total anthocyanins total polyphenols tss and total tannins mainly for the up slope 2011 and ph for the up slope 2012 interestingly the cwsi in post veraison was clustered within the up slope 2011 and tightly correlated with polyphenols tss and tannins figs 4 and 5 thus a certain level of post veraison stress improved these quality parameters intrigliolo et al 2016 conversely the cwsi in pre veraison which was clustered in the up slope 2012 had no such effect on most quality parameters unfortunately the down slope 2012 observations are somewhat in the middle and less tightly clustered than the other groups when the observations are close to the center some information is carried on other principal components which means that the data set does not provide any relevant information regarding the down slope 2012 group 4 conclusions the results achieved in this study reinforce the importance that grapevines grown in hilly soils with varying soil hydrological properties experience different water stress development more specifically compared to down slope site vine water stress was more intense in the up slope site that had lower soil water retention capacity worse vine responses in terms of both ecophysiology and yield but better must quality the pre veraison water stress rather than post veraison stress prevailed the reduction of yield and its related parameters the must quality parameters such as total soluble solids total polyphenols total anthocyanins and color intensity of berries performed better in the up slope vines than in the down slope this effect can be attributed to water stress during post veraison consequently two different kinds of aglianico wines could be produced in the two sites high quality wine from the up slope grapes and lower commercial quality wine from the down slope grapes in addition grapevines in the upper site with more stressful conditions were able to maintain similar ranges of must acidity parameters to the ones in the down site this fact is important for growers as the aglianico cultivar can keep its high wine quality due to its resilient behaviour considering a changing climate with more frequent drought events this study highlights the importance of identifying viticultural zones with different soil physical properties vine eco physiological yield and quality grape characteristics in this way the growers could perform specific management for each zone and produce the best wine

9051,vineyards from hilly areas of the mediterranean region are mostly grown in shallow soils that present low soil water holding capacity these vineyards are prone to water stress conditions which if well managed can raise the grape quality potential this study aimed to investigate the water stress development in an aglianico vineyard grown along a 90 m slope the two year 2011 2012 trial was conducted in two soils having different hydraulic properties the up slope with lower soil water holding capacity than the down slope site the results showed that grapevines were more stressed in the up slope soil than in the down slope soil as reflected by the higher crop water stress index lower leaf water potential and leaf gas exchanges values consequently the yield was significantly lower by 40 in the up slope which was determined by the lower weight and volume of berries the smaller berries improved must quality parameters of total soluble solids total polyphenols total anthocyanins and color intensity within a range of 4 25 higher in the up slope compared to the down slope site moreover the pre veraison stress experienced in 2012 reduced yield by 30 and depressed berry weight and volume compared to 2011 the post veraison stress induced the improvement of must quality mainly in the up slope 2011 interestingly there was no significant difference in the ph and titratable acidity between both sites which indicates the ability of up slope vines to make up for more stressful conditions and thus their resilient behavior to maintain their high quality wine this study highlights that vineyards in hilly areas may benefit from a differentiated management between different viticulture zones to bring up their high quality wine keywords vitis vinifera l pre veraison post veraison gas exchanges pca must composition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction grapevine vitis vinifera l subsp vinifera is a woody perennial crop that has been cultivated for more than 8000 years in the mediterranean region and still nowadays constitutes one of the main elements of its agricultural sector novara et al 2021 the planning and management of grapevine towards high quality wines are typically carried out using viticultural zoning procedures carey 2001 gladstones and smart 1997 vaudour 2003 these are an extension at a finer scale of the standard concept of terroir bonfante and brillante 2022 defined as a spatial and temporal entity with homogeneous or outstanding grape and or wine soil landscape and climate characteristics within a territory marked by socio cultural technical choices vaudour 2003 within each of these viticulture zones it is expected that the specific pedoclimate and specific management affects grapevine physiology creating in turn unique wines in each territory van leeuwen et al 2004 garcía navarro et al 2022 the environment of the mediterranean region that fosters potential high quality wine and grape production has been related to vineyards in hilly areas and rainfed farmed hofmann et al 2014 prosdocimi et al 2016 grapevine in this region is well adapted to marginal areas with sloping shallow well drained and poor fertile soils and thus with a higher risk to develop water deficit lazcano et al 2020 consequently grapevines are suited to the lack of water and recurrent drought and thus it plays a role in the adaptation to climate change by agriculture santillán et al 2020 previous research have strengthened the hypothesis that the physical soil properties and geomorphological features affect the final yield and grape quality characteristics even more than the soil chemical properties poni et al 2018 there is a consensus that steep sloped coarse textured and stony soils confer the best wine quality due to their lower soil water holding capacity which increases the grapevine water deficit poni et al 2018 water deficit conditions generated in these soils would boost earlier shoot growth slackening smaller berry size high grape sugar and anthocyanin concentrations thus rising grape quality potential bonfante et al 2017 brillante et al 2017 lazcano et al 2020 van leeuwen et al 2004 the impact of water stress on vine growth and yield fulfillment has been demonstrated as highly dependent on the intensity of the stress the phenological stages and greatly variable within short distances in the same field especially in vineyards grown in sloped soils bonfante et al 2017 brillante et al 2017 wenter et al 2018 basile et a 2020 this temporal and local soil variability has significant consequences not only in the physiological processes such as photosynthesis and stomatal conductance but also on the synthesis of grape compositional factors such as sugar acids anthocyanins and tannins and must composition pereyra et al 2022 pre and post veraison stages in grapevines are the most sensitive phenological phases to the effects of water deficit on yield and grape quality however results are not consistent among studies especially for post veraison stress poni et al 2018 the stress effects in these two phases are interrelated because deficit in pre veraison could cause a greater post veraison water deficit due to their cumulative effect van leeuwen et al 2004 casassa et al 2015 the same magnitude of water deficit has been reported to affect canopy growth yield and grape quality more when occurring in pre than post veraison girona et al 2009 palai et al 2021 wenter et al 2018 this is mainly related to the increased berry sensitivity to the soil water deficit and therefore to the vine water stress before veraison because the xylem is the main source of water for the berry instead of the phloem which becomes the unique berry stem hydraulic connection after veraison munitz et al 2017 in addition pre veraison water stress can restrain cell division and thus the total cell numbers which irreversibly decreases berry growth while late water stress can only produce a reversible negative effect on cell size girona et al 2009 ojeda at al 2002 wenter et al 2018 palai et al 2021 berry size diminution increases the skin to pulp weight ratio which results in higher concentrations of phenolic and anthocyanins compounds in the berry skin and lower concentration of total soluble solids ojeda et al 2002 the aroma composition of berries is also affected in relation to the phenological stage as glycosilated vocs were enhanced when water deficit occurred in pre veraison while no effect was detected for post veraison stress palai et al 2022 the greater variability reported in the literature about the effects of post veraison stress on the grapevine and wine performance can be attributed to the different intensity of the applied stress and the sensitivity of the cultivar in this way girona et al 2009 observed an improvement in the grape quality of cv tempranillo only when post veraison water deficit at midday did not decrease below 1 12 mpa leaf water potential threshold similar results were reported in the same cultivar by intrigliolo et al 2012 who informed that an excessive water deficit in post veraison reduced leaf photosynthesis and thus impaired sugar accumulation in another research conducted in potted shiraz vines in south of france ollé et al 2011 found that post veraison stress caused a decrease in berry weight whilst no effects were found in pre veraison stress as it was in the full irrigated vines more recently geng et al 2022 in cabernet sauvignon grown in semi arid area of china showed improved grape quality when water stress was mild from fruit setting to veraison or mild severe during post veraison consequently comparing studies and drawing general conclusions about grapevine adaptation to water stress remains difficult to establish even though vineyards in the mediterranean region are characteristic of hilly areas most of the conducted research dealing with water deficit reported the outcomes of experiments conducted in flat vineyards bota et al 2016 intrigliolo et al 2012 edwards and clingeleffer 2013 or compared the performance of vineyards grown in two separate sloped and flat fields zsófi et al 2009 in a mediterranean hilly viticultural area in a two year experiment the influence of different soil hydrological characteristics along a slope with the same textural class but different hydraulic properties on the vineyard performance was highlighted by our research group bonfante et al 2015 2017 moreover through a modeling approach we confirmed that rather than the slope gradient the different soil hydrological properties between up and down sloped soils were the main factors in driving the soil water potential and the vine water stress basile et al 2020 in the same experimental vineyard we continued the previous research conducted by basile et al 2020 as there is an evident gap in knowledge on the performances of rainfed vineyards grown in sloped soils indeed the data on the grape yield and must quality responses to different water stress conditions in vines grown at short distances along a slope are scarce therefore the main aim of this paper was to study the differences associated with the development of water stress conditions between rainfed vines grown in two different soils along a slope in terms of physiological responses grape yield and must quality moreover the paper studied the effects that pre and post veraison stress could have on the above parameters of the two sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the two year research 2011 and 2012 was carried out at quintodecimo farm which produces high quality wine and is located in a hilly environment of southern italy mirabella eclano av campania

the same as in 2012 553 mm quite lower than the ten year average of 802 mm year 1 recorded from 2003 to 2013 in 2011 three spells of rainfall occurred in mid september and mid november of about 30 mm while in 2012 the biggest spell of rainfall was 60 mm during mid july basile et al 2020 the experiment was performed during 2011 and 2012 in a rainfed vitis vinifera l cv aglianico vineyard that was 10 years old grafted on v berlandieri planch x v rupestris scheele 1103 p and trained with a spurred cordon the rows were oriented nw se 320 and the vines were spaced 2 m between rows and 1 m along the rows i e 5000 plants per hectare the monitored vines were located along a slope length 90 m inclination β 10 in two different soils of the vineyard named the up slope and the down slope sites these two experimental plots were chosen after identifying them in two functional homogeneous soils by bonfante et al 2015 thus the two soils are classified according to the iuss working group wrb 2014 as calcisol clayic aric in the up slope site and cambisol clayic aric colluvic in the down slope site the two soils despite their same textural class clay loam show different soil hydrological behavior due to the different water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves of their soil horizons the down slope soil had 20 more water storage capacity i e 145 mm of available water content awc than the up slope soil 80 mm of awc bonfante et al 2015 2017 basile et al 2020 parameters of soil hydraulic properties along the profile of the two soils are reported in basile et al 2020 2 2 field and laboratory measurements 2 2 1 soil matric potential the average soil matric potential in the rooting zone of the up slope and down slope sites was estimated based on the results of the calibrated and validated hydrus 2d 3d model as detailed in basile et al 2020 2 2 2 plant water status leaf water potential ψl mpa was measured during the season using a scholander type pressure bomb saps ii 3115

entire experimental plot and at harvest 2nd october in both years total yield weight and volume of 100 berries were determined on 12 of these selected plants from the 15 vines left of each experimental site a sample of 200 berries was used to determine berry total soluble solids tss concentration ph titratable acidity total anthocyanins total polyphenols and total tannins of berries during the ripening period from berry color change to harvest the polyphenol extraction from grapes was done as follows the extraction of berry components was carried out in duplicate while simulating the maceration process necessary to produce red wines mattivi et al 2002 vacca et al 2009 briefly berries 200 g were cut in two with a razor blade and seeds and skins were carefully removed from each berry half the pulp on the inner face of the berry skin was removed using an end flattened spatula trying to preserve the integrity of berry skin skins and seeds were immediately immersed in a 200 ml solution consisting of ethanol water 12 88 v v 100 mg l of so2 5 g l tartaric acid and a ph value adjusted to 3 2 with naoh and extracted for five days at 30 c the extracts were shaken by hand once a

japan uv spectrophotometer 2 3 statistical analysis each dependent variable was preliminarily evaluated for normal distribution according to shapiro wilk s test if the normality assumption was violated we transformed data into box cox transformation combined analyses were run over 2011 and 2012 after verifying the homogeneity of error variances using bartlett s chi square test gomez and gomez 1984 the missmda package josse and husson 2016 in r studio software r core team 2013 was used to pair an unbalanced dataset due to an unequal number of observations of the dependent variables two way non parametric analysis by applying scheirer ray hare test was carried out to evaluate the effect of the different treatments i e slope position and year and their interactions on yield and

potential and leaf gas exchanges at the flowering stage fig 2a d of both years the vines did not experience any stress in either site in terms of both indicators potential cwsi and ψl as both soils had an optimum water content availability because of the rainfalls in winter as reported by bonfante et al 2015 and in may fig 1 during the pre veraison of 2011 the cwsi was less than 10 in both sites fig 2a while the ψl in the up slope began to be significantly lower than the down slope site at doy 188 fig 2c the cwsi and the ψl are crucial indicators for vine water status fuentes et al 2012 mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 according to the water stress thresholds based on leaf water potential van leeuwen et al 2009 the up slope vines depicted weak water stress ψl between 0 9 and 1 1 mpa while the down slope ones did not show any stress ψl 0 9 mpa in 2012 the cwsi at the pre veraison was much higher than the one in 2011 reaching 56 in the up slope fig 2b with the corresponding ψl equal to 1 35 mpa which matches with moderate to severe stress ψl between 1 3 and 1 4 mpa in pre veraison fig 2d in the same way in the down slope site the cwsi achieved values of 27 and the ψl was equal to 1 17 mpa depicting weak to moderate stress van leeuwen et al 2009 during post veraison in the up slope the maximum cwsi of 61 and the lowest ψl of 1 67 mpa occurred in 2011 fig 2a c indicating higher stress conditions than 2012 however the up slope vines reached levels of severe water stress ψl 1 4 mpa in the post veraison stage in both years fig 2c d in the same stage the down slope site achieved on average the maximum values of 32 cwsi and around 1 40 mpa ψl in both years which agreed with moderate severe water stress levels the ψl values registered along the season in both years fall within the common ranges for ψl in pre veraison of 0 8 mpa till achieving 1 7 mpa in post veraison stage in vineyards cultivated in semi arid environments as reported by other authors e g schultz 2003 centeno et al 2010 although cwsi and ψl are independent indicators they followed the same dynamics along the experimental seasons and across treatments in addition both were able to discriminate different timing of stress occurrence and its intensity between the up and down slope sites a positive correlation between cwsi and stem water potential with the slope position in the steep slope vineyards of chianti terroir tuscany italy has been reported also by puig sirera et al 2021 it is well known that field grown grapevines when submitted to long term water deficit show a strong reduction of stomatal conductance and co2 assimilation escalona et al 2000 in our experiment stomatal conductance gs and leaf co2 assimilation rate a resembled the general dynamics of ψl of the two slope positions in both experimental years fig 3a d fig 2c d hence both parameters were significantly lower in the up than in the down slope vines after the flowering stage doy 157 and 151 in 2011 and 2012 respectively and both decreased along the season with progressive drought quite low values of gs 0 038 mol m 2 s 1 and a 3 2 mol m 2 s 1 were registered in the up slope at the end of the pre veraison 2012 doy 202 a rainfall event during veraison doy 215 allowed a significant recovery followed by a strong decrease to the lowest values of gs and a at grape maturity gs 0 018 mol m 2 s 1 a 2 2 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 3b d the stress during pre veraison could have impaired both the rate and the extent of recovery after the rainy event flexas et al 2009 lovisolo et al 2010 and thus exacerbated the subsequent decrease in the gas exchanges of the up slope vines these gs data indicate severe vine water stress conditions in the up slope vines at both pre and post veraison as they are lower than the threshold 0 05 mol m 2 s 1 for severe water stress according to cifre et al 2005 in addition gs and a in the up slope vines were also low at grape maturity in 2011 gs 0 042 mol m 2 s 1 a 5 74 μmol m 2 s 1 indicating that severe water stress conditions also occurred in post veraison of 2011 during this stage we observed the maximum difference in intrinsic wue iwue a gs between up and down slope vines mainly due to the strong gs reduction in the up slope fig 3e conversely in 2012 differences in iwue between the two sites were less marked during most of the sea son fig 3f the decrease of both stomatal conductance and photosynthesis and the increase of iwue in grapevines with increased conditions of water deficit has been largely reported in many studies e g bota et al 2016 brillante et al 2016 palai et al 2021 poni et al 2009 the leaf gas exchange values of the down slope vines followed the same pattern as the ones in the up slope vines although achieving moderate water stress levels in both experimental years cifre et al 2005 the higher stress conditions in the up slope vines than in the down slope are due to the lower soil water retention capacity encountered in the up slope soil as demonstrated in previous works in the same experimental sites basile et al 2020 bonfante et al 2015 2017 similarly zsófi et al 2009 found significant differences in soil water availability between flat and steep slope vineyards which were reflected in lower pre dawn leaf water potentials gs and a values in the steep ones in addition the severe water stress experienced in the upper soil vines which caused a lower leaf co2 assimilation rate was at the same time reflected in reduced vegetative growth in fact along the season lai in up slope averaged 1 18 m2m 2 0 21 in 2011 12 lower than down slope while in 2012 lai averaged 1 36 m2m 2 0 17 22 lower than down slope vines data not shown the psii quantum yield ϕpsii was assessed through modulated fluorescence and resembled the a rates fig 3g h the up slope ϕpsii decreased to a minimum of 0 07 r u near grape maturity doy 252 of 2011 while in the same period the down slope vines showed double values fig 3g rainfalls occurring near veraison in 2012 also induced a recovery of ϕpsii in both slope positions likewise a and gs the down slope vines reached a maximum ϕpsii 0 2 r u at doy 215 fig 3h which is comparable with values measured during the flowering stage in 2011 fig 3g when no water stress was detected fig 2c such a recovery of ϕpsii in 2012 was followed by a gradual decrease with the lowest 0 09 r u value reached by the up slope vines in the late season such value was about half of the one measured in the down slope doy 271 fig 3h ju et al 2018 also reported a decrease in ϕpsii which can induce photoinhibition due to a light excess under water stress conditions maroco et al 2002 reported for tempranillo cv during mid summer a quantum yield of psii about 0 4 in the control and 0 3 in the stressed vines at midday because of earlier stomatal closure in the latter vines therefore both gas exchanges and fluorescence data confirmed the intense stress conditions encountered in the up slope vines the close link between impaired gas exchanges namely photosynthesis caused by decreased soil water availability and grape yield reduction is well established in the literature medrano et al 2003 3 2 yield and its components grapevine yields were significantly influenced by the slope position s p 0 001 and year y p 0 01 table 1 as expected the less water stressed down slope vine yielded significantly better 40 than the up slope vine in addition the yield of 2011 was significantly higher by 30 than the one of 2012 consequently s and y also significantly affected the related yield parameters of berry weight and volume both parameters mimicked the yield results and were higher in the down slope and 2011 thereby the differences in yield across treatments and years were mainly determined by the berry weight and volume the yield was also significantly affected by the slope year s y interaction specifically the down slope vines in 2011 showed the highest yield while the up slope vines in 2012 had the lowest grape yield 43 these results on yield differences between the up and down slope vines could be explained by the different hydraulic properties and specifically by the lower water retention of the soil horizons of the upper site basile et al 2020 bonfante et al 2017 the up slope soil hydrological properties led to a lower soil water content and also lower soil matric potential that imposed more intense stress in those grapevines moreover the significant rainfall event at the beginning of veraison 2012 probably avoided more intense stress in post veraison on the other hand the down slope vines in 2011 were able to produce the highest yield when there was no stress in pre veraison and moderate post veraison stress the pre veraison stress that took place in 2012 was the main driver of yield reduction in both sites the results on the influence that pre veraison stress has on yield and berry growth parameters agree with previous data reported in the literature for example casassa et al 2015 found a significant reduction of berry weight that turned into limited yields in cabernet sauvignon grapes subjected to pre veraison stress while post veraison stress caused no yield reduction in comparison to full irrigated grapes wenter et al 2018 on an experiment in hilly viticulture reported significantly lower yield in rainfed vines subjected to severe stress in pre veraison compared to those with full or deficit irrigation similarly palai et al 2021 reported the lowest value of yield fresh and dry berry weight for vines subjected to pre veraison stress in addition intrigliolo et al 2016 found that severe post veraison stress in rainfed cabernet sauvignon vines decreased berry weight and yield by 30 when compared to irrigated vines at 50 of etc these results are in line with our yield results of 2011 whose differences were driven by severe post veraison stress in up slope vines intermediate yields were generated in the up slope vines in 2011 and the down slope vines in 2012 table 1 both of them were significantly lower than the down slope 2011 but not significantly different from the up slope 2012 in this way these yield differences were significant in the down slope vines between the two years while no significance was found between the up slope vines in particular the up slope yield of 2011 was not significantly higher than the up slope yield of 2012 even with different severity and timing of stress furthermore the yield results of 2012 resulted in a non significant 12 difference between the two sites this small yield difference arose even if the up slope site encountered moderate to severe levels of pre veraison stress and the down slope site weak to moderate levels at the same time both sites experienced severe post veraison water stress levels in 2012 these results could be explained by the improved efficiency of water management by the upper grapevines for production purposes the grapevines from the up slope under more stressed conditions could have developed internal adaptation mechanisms that enabled them to maintain a steady production indeed pagay et al 2022 observed in an australian mediterranean type climate area that rain fed cabernet sauvignon showed better resilience to drought when grown in shallow soils as compared to vines in deep soils due to drought adaptation mechanisms induced by the cyclical droughts over many years 3 3 berry composition a great significant effect p 0 0001 of slope position s was detected for total soluble solids total polyphenols total anthocyanins and color intensity of berries table 1 specifically the up slope vines were 4 21 21 and 25 higher than the down slope vines respectively for each of the above parameters several studies reported that must quality improves significantly with mild to moderate water stress castellarin et al 2007 munitz et al 2017 ojeda et al 2002 however to our knowledge there are not many studies that investigate the ranges of berry quality parameters between two different slope positions regarding the vine water stress development in the same experimental site bonfante et al 2017 found significant correlations between the cwsi and tannins total anthocyanins color intensity and sugar content in both sites moreover there was also a significant influence p 0 001 of the s in the relative composition of phenolic compounds grapes from the up slope position were 10 higher in tannins and 8 3 lower in the tannins anthocyanin s ratio these results are important for the aglianico cultivar as an excess of tannins and tannins anthocyanins ratio could give astringents and tawny wines muccillo et al 2014 picariello et al 2020 the s x y interaction was statistically significant for total polyphenols and tannins in 2011 both parameters were statistically higher in the up than in the down slope site while even if these must parameters showed no significant difference in 2012 there was a clear trend indicating better quality in the up than in the down slope the effect of the s on the phenolic compounds anthocyanins and tannins of the up slope berries could be related to an excessive exposure to light irradiation of the berries in this way specific key enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase chalcone synthase and stilbene synthase of flavonoid pathway would be more activated ferrer et al 2008 moreover the slight shift towards higher production of anthocyanins with respect to tannins could be due to more specific activation of genes involved in this specific branch of pathway for aglianico grapes although grapes from the up slope position were in higher water stress conditions with respect to the down slope position differences in titratable acidity and ph between the two sites were almost negligible table 1 this result is important considering future drier climate as the upper vines seem to be able to maintain an acidic equilibrium similar to the one of the down slope vines which were under less water stress conditions regarding the year factor table 1 the main effect was detected for tss and titratable acidity probably due to the higher temperature and eto of 2012 than in 2011 fig 1 specifically the titratable acidity was 7 4 higher in 2011 compared to 2012 while the tss were 2 3 lower in 2011 than in 2012 similar findings were reported in previous studies mira de orduña 2010 wenter et al 2018 that reported significantly higher tss and lower titratable acidity in vineyards during the experimental year with the highest eto temperatures and limited soil water availability despite the limitation of the only two year dataset our results show that up slope grapes could produce red wines with high levels of total phenolic compounds and tannins good visual and gustatory scores and thus with greater commercial value fanzone et al 2012 3 4 correlation matrix and principal components analysis the pearson correlation matrix fig 4 allows the analysis of the relationships among the investigated variables the yield variation was more positively correlated with berry weight and volume gs pre and post and a pre whereas it was moderately positively correlated with ψ1 pre and post smwp pre and post and low positively correlated with titratable acidity and a post on the other hand the grape yield was highly negatively correlated with quality parameters such as tss ph total anthocyanins total polyphenols and total tannins whereas it was moderately negatively correlated with iwue post and cwsi pre and post and low negatively correlated with iwue pre total anthocyanins total polyphenols total tannins and tss quality parameters were more strongly correlated with water stress indicators cwsi ψ1 and smwp in post veraison as compared to pre veraison indicating that water deficiency in post veraison ameliorated the must quality fig 4 our results indicate that yield is strongly related to the photosynthetic rate a in the pre veraison stage because carbohydrate assimilation takes place for cell proliferation and expansion in this stage chaves et al 2010 whereas the plant water status and soil matric potential in both pre and post veraison stages strongly influence yield van leeuwen et al 2009 these outcomes have been reported in previous works but with some differences in the relationship between these variables and the final yield girona et al 2009 intrigliolo et al 2016 this fact may be due to the diverse variety sensitivity and or to the application of different levels of stress vaz et al 2016 to obtain a comprehensive overview of the soil and vine physiological parameters physical and quality grape characteristics and yield in response to slope position s and years y the whole data set including the climatic parameters from may to early october of the two years was subjected to principal component analysis pca for this trial the first two principal components pcs were associated with eigenvalues 1 and explained 86 3 of the cumulative variance pc1 accounted for 68 5 and pc2 for 17 8 table 2 fig 5 shows the pca results for the first two components pc1 and pc2 in the first pc the highly positively and significantly weighted variables were berry volume gs post a pre berry weight smwp pre ψ1 pre yield gs pre a post ϕpsii pre smwp post titratable acidity ψ1 post while the moderately weighted were ϕpsii post and the climatic parameters solar radiation rain and tavg in the pc1 total anthocyanins tss ph total tannins total polyphenols potential cwsi pre were instead highly negatively weighted and eto only lowly moreover in the second pc the potential cwsi post was positively and strongly weighted table 2 in contrast with what was expected a positive weak correlation between titratable acidity and the average temperature was shown in the pca fig 5 however previous studies showed that the relationship between temperature and acidic profile of grapes is cultivar dependent for instance in shiraz cv in contrasts with cabernet franc cv a lack of plasticity of ph with regards to temperature was observed sadras et al 2013 this result is of great interest for aglianico grape especially considering the dramatic effect that climate change can have on the base parameters of grapes and the fundamental role of low ph and high titratable acidity for gustative equilibrium and microbial and pigment stability of aglianico wine forino et al 2020 data could be instead considered consistent with previous studies on aglianico grapes where shoot trimming that usually determines an increase of bunch temperature was applied but no significant effect on ph and titratable acidity of berry juice was observed caccavello et al 2019 it is also possible that the lack of a great effect could be due to the higher content of exchangeable potassium in the down slope site compared to the upper site marcuzzo et al 2021 further and more specific experiments to study the separate effects of light and temperature the potassium soil content and the k accumulation capacity could help to better understand the behavior of this grape cultivar regarding these environmental factors the pc1 and pc2 score plot fig 5 discriminated the variables that more influenced each slope x year treatment s x y the positive side of pc1 in the lower right quadrant included most of the observations of the down slope site of 2011 this site was characterized by high relative values of soil and vine water potential thus good water status which was associated to the highest yield table 1 the lowest yield was recorded in the up slope 2012 treatment table 1 which observations fall within the left lower quadrant characterized by the highest cwsi pre and eto moreover as the highest relative values of both smwp pre and ψ1 pre were observed for the opposite quadrant right upper it means that the lowest values of these water status parameters i e stressful conditions occurred in up slope 2012 therefore we can infer that water stress in pre veraison caused the lowest yield observed in the up slope 2012 the observations from the upper and lower left quadrant characterized the up slope 2011 and 2012 respectively both sites were identified by lower yield and high quality parameters total anthocyanins total polyphenols tss and total tannins mainly for the up slope 2011 and ph for the up slope 2012 interestingly the cwsi in post veraison was clustered within the up slope 2011 and tightly correlated with polyphenols tss and tannins figs 4 and 5 thus a certain level of post veraison stress improved these quality parameters intrigliolo et al 2016 conversely the cwsi in pre veraison which was clustered in the up slope 2012 had no such effect on most quality parameters unfortunately the down slope 2012 observations are somewhat in the middle and less tightly clustered than the other groups when the observations are close to the center some information is carried on other principal components which means that the data set does not provide any relevant information regarding the down slope 2012 group 4 conclusions the results achieved in this study reinforce the importance that grapevines grown in hilly soils with varying soil hydrological properties experience different water stress development more specifically compared to down slope site vine water stress was more intense in the up slope site that had lower soil water retention capacity worse vine responses in terms of both ecophysiology and yield but better must quality the pre veraison water stress rather than post veraison stress prevailed the reduction of yield and its related parameters the must quality parameters such as total soluble solids total polyphenols total anthocyanins and color intensity of berries performed better in the up slope vines than in the down slope this effect can be attributed to water stress during post veraison consequently two different kinds of aglianico wines could be produced in the two sites high quality wine from the up slope grapes and lower commercial quality wine from the down slope grapes in addition grapevines in the upper site with more stressful conditions were able to maintain similar ranges of must acidity parameters to the ones in the down site this fact is important for growers as the aglianico cultivar can keep its high wine quality due to its resilient behaviour considering a changing climate with more frequent drought events this study highlights the importance of identifying viticultural zones with different soil physical properties vine eco physiological yield and quality grape characteristics in this way the growers could perform specific management for each zone and produce the best wine

9052,irrigation at jointing increases spike numbers at wheat harvest but the mechanisms underlying increased tiller spike formation rate sr during wheat production caused by irrigation have remained unclear we therefore designed the supplemental irrigation si treatments at jointing in which si was received sij or did not receive nsi by wheat and analyzed the morphological differentiation of young ears and physiological responses of young ears and stems to si results shown that sij relative to nsi mainly improved the sr of the first primary tiller t1 and second primary tiller t2 which significantly increased the grain yield the tillers sr positively correlated to the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in young ears but negatively correlated to that in stems sij significantly increased the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in young ears and reduced that in stems in both the main stem ms and tillers compared with ms the young ear differentiation of t1 and t2 tillers that can form spikes was always behind by 0 2 developmental periods between jointing and flowering although sij decelerated the young ears differentiation of the ms and the t1 tiller the increased sugar content in young ears causing a significant increase in grain numbers moreover sij positively regulated the young ear differentiation of t2 tiller with more sucrose contained in young ears and less in stems to narrow gaps in young ear differentiation between t2 tiller and ms some t1 and t2 as well as other high position tillers composed invalid tillers where young ears mostly ceased differentiating at the stages of glume primordium present to carpel primordium present and contained significantly less sugar than effective tillers significant morphological differences in young ears and nutritional physiological differences in tillers led to high position tillers that were difficult to convert into effective tillers even under favorable conditions by sij overall tillers can be converted into effective spikes by increasing sugar metabolism in young ears via sij when the discrepancy in young ear differentiation does not exceed two developmental stages compared to ms keywords wheat ear differentiation spike formation rate sugar metabolism effective and invalid tiller irrigation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the spike formation rate sr indicates the ability of winter wheat triticum aestivum l tillers to develop spikes productive tillers naruoka et al 2011 however numerous tillers produced by wheat are associated with mortality and this negatively correlates with grain yield moral and moral 1995 sharma 1995 only spikes of the main stem and the first and second primary tillers of wheat remain until maturity thorne and wood 1988 li et al 2019 which composed the spike numbers per unit area is a crucial component of wheat yield miller et al 1991 therefore understanding how factors affect spike formation during critical period of wheat growth would help to increase wheat yield generally the order of spike formation is associated with the time of tiller initiation where more than 87 of spikes originate from wintering tillers tilley et al 2019b the tillers that are initiated early have more leaf area than those initiated later tilley et al 2019a this advantage produces more photoassimilate that improve the growth and development of tillers and young ear differentiation therefore previous studies on wheat spike formation focused on the occurrence of tillers sparkes et al 2006 dreccer et al 2013 however wheat spike formation means that young ears can fully differentiate and develop and young ears can pull out the stem sheath and then complete flowering pollinating and forming the final yield ariel et al 2013 this process occurs after the jointing stage involving the differentiation of young ears lauer and simmons 1988 hu et al 2017 elongation of stem tilley et al 2019b laude et al 1967 abbate et al 1997 gonzález et al 2003 and mortality of tillers moral and moral 1995 sharma 1995 which is often ignored due to its complexity when studying the mechanisms of spike formation although studies have reported that the moderate irrigation at jointing optimizes the growth environment of wheat and increases the number of spikes by reducing nutritional competition among tillers kaya altop et al 2019 mitchell et al 2013 shang et al 2020 the mechanism s through supplemental irrigation si at jointing promotes spike formation in tillers is vague simultaneously tillers at different positions have different sensitivities to soil moisture at jointing sarath et al 2014 whether irrigation at jointing improves spike numbers at harvest by increasing the spike formation of low and high position tillers or both classified according to cai et al 2014 remains unclear yet actually the young ears of main stem develop spikelet and florets at jointing whereas during this period the young ears of tillers are at one or more developmental stages behind that of main stem lauer and simmons 1988 the huge gap between tillers and main stems during young ear differentiation results in weak nutritional competitiveness of high position tillers and limited spike formation hu et al 2017 furthermore the stem is a major temporary storage site of carbohydrates in wheat crops and assimilates are directly transferred from the stem into growing ears instead of into other organs borrell et al 1989 assessing whether young ears have sufficient competitiveness from competition with developing non spike organs to provide sufficient sugar and nitrogen nutrients for spikelet and floret development is important for judging the ability of tillers to form spikes carolina et al 2019 demotes mainard et al 1999 therefore it is necessary to explore the regulation of si at jointing on modifying the distribution of assimilates in growing wheat stems and ears and promoting the further development of young ears the findings are extremely important for understanding how spikes are formed soluble sugar is the main storage and structural substances in plants which is important indicators for studying the ear differentiation xue et al 2008 sucrose is the main product of photosynthesis and the main transport substance in plants which can decompose to hexose for the developmental of ears fruits roots etc ruan 2014 moreover nitrogen which can be transported between effective and ineffective tillers is also important for synthesizing enzymes to participate in spike formation ramadan et al 2018 sugar and nitrogen are the basic nutrients of crop growth and development and their distribution in organs is regulated by supplemental irrigation during wheat growth ramadan et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 this will further affect the morphogenesis of ear and stem and then regulate the process of spike formation zheng et al 2013 therefore we examined the morphological differentiation of young ear and the physiological conditions of young ears and stems to identify the underlying mechanisms for tiller conversion into spikes between jointing to flowering as well as how si at jointing affects ear differentiation productive tiller formation and grain yield our results provide a theoretical basis for supplemental irrigation at jointing to increase spike numbers and grain yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this two year field study proceeded in daolang town shandong province china 36 12 n 116 54 e during the 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 winter wheat growth seasons at the experimental site the soil is classified as loam and the major crop before this study is maize zea mays l during the maize growth season irrigation and fertilizer were managed

2130 5 c in 2017 2018 and 2221 5 c in 2018 2019 respectively the total precipitation during 2017 2018 wheat growth season was 220 2 mm where 4 0 27 6 67 4 and 121 2 mm from sowing to wintering wintering to jointing jointing to flowering and flowering to maturity respectively in turn the total precipitation during 2018 2019 was 111 6 mm and 28 8 2 8 44 0 and 45 2 mm from sowing to wintering wintering to jointing jointing to flowering and flowering to maturity respectively 2 2 experimental design shannong 23 sn23 is a widely planted commercial winter wheat cultivar in the north china plain which is a large spike cultivar with low tillers irrigation treatments were designed at jointing in which si was received sij or did not receive nsi by wheat using the zadoks scale zadoks et al 1974 to determine the jointing stage z31 and irrigation is carried out at five days after jointing at this time the young ear differentiates into the pharmacophore formation stage w5 5 according to waddington et al 1983 which is sensitive to irrigation and fertilizer zhang et al 2021 in this experiment the water management at sowing wintering and flowering was consistent in all si treatments except for the treatment period the si amount was determined according to the si method of wang et al 2018 the gravimetric soil water content gswc g g 1 and the relative soil water content rswc g g 1 were measured by using the oven drying method klute 1986 at sowing wintering jointing flowering and maturity where the soil samples were collected at 20 cm intervals using a soil corer from 200 cm soil depth then soil samples were put into the aluminum boxes weighed for fresh weight fw and dried in an oven at 105 c for 72 h for dry weight dw gswc0 20 and rswc0 20 referred as the gswc and rswc in the 0 20 cm soil layers respectively which were calculated by the formulas 1 g s w c 0 20 f w 0 20 d w 0 20 d w 0 20 2 r s w c 0 20 g s w c 0 20 f c 0 20 the si at sowing was implemented only when the rswc0 20 0 70 g g 1 on the day of sowing and si amount was calculated by the formula 3 s i 1000 0 2 γ 0 20 f c 0 20 g s w c 0 20 where the fc0 20 cm3 cm 3 and γ0 20 g cm 3 were the field capacity and soil bulk density in this experiment respectively the soil layer in 0 20 cm was wetting to 100 field capacity the si at wintering was implemented only when the rswc0 20 0 60 g g 1 at the initial of wintering and si amount was calculated by formula 3 the si at jointing was implemented at five days after the jointing stage under the sij treatment and si amount was calculated by formula 3 the nsi treatment was no water implemented at jointing the si at flowering was implemented only when the rswc0 20 0 50 g g 1 at the flowering complete stage and si amount was calculated by formula 3 the experimental design used a randomized block design with three replications with an area of 15 m2 10 m length and 1 5 m width for each plot the crops were uniformly sprayed with water in each plot using micro sprinkling hoses that is special for wheat wang et al 2013 the amount of si was measured using water meters installed on the hoses between plots a width of 1 0 m used for buffer zone the details of si amount and irrigation event date of wheat at different growth periods see table 3 supplementary figure 1 shows the soil water status after si at jointing which is measured at three day after si pure nitrogen fertilizer 240 kg ha 1 was applied during the growth season as 135 kg at sowing and 105 kg was top dressed at jointing pure nitrogen base fertilizer applied before sowing contained 15 nitrogen as 15 p2o5 and k2o and the soil was top dressed at jointing with urea containing 46 n wheat was sown on 13 october 2017 and 8 october 2018 and harvested on 8 june 2018 and 12 june 2019 respectively wheat planting density was 300 plants per square meter with 0 25 m row spacing the weed and pesticides management in all treatments were unified 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 wheat young ear differentiation and spike formation rate sr the earliest tillers were marked upon emergence and every five days thereafter until the numbers reached a maximum according to the klepper et al 1982 naming system the main stem is represented as ms and primary tillers growing from the true leaf axilla of the ms are represented as tillers t1 t2 t3 t4 and so on t10 and t20 tillers that grew from the axils of the prophyllae of t1 and t2 respectively were considered secondary tillers secondary tillers also included t11 tillers that grew from the axil of the first leaf of t1 and others tagged wheat samples were selected and separated after joining according to the tiller position and measured the development of young ears from the ms and tillers were assessed in 15 wheat plants with similar growth status which was examined by a stereoscopic microscope after joining with a interval in five days photoed the first floret in the middle spikelet of young ears and recorded the differentiation stages according to waddington s scale supplementary table 1 where the development stage of the first floret is taken as the young ears differentiation stages at the same sampling time of the effective tillers the young ears differentiation of invalid tiller is observed and shown in picture the invalid tiller is that more than 50 of the apical leaves tuned yellow and selected without tiller order moreover tiller numbers in one square meter was investigated and tiller numbers per hectare was calculated during wheat different growth periods then the tagged mature plants per square meter were collected in each experimental plot and separated according to tiller position the effective tiller number was determined and the sr was calculated the sr of tillers was the ratio of tillers in a specific position at maturity per unit area to the maximum number of tillers in the same position during the entire growth season 2 3 2 sugar and nitrogen contents wheat samples n 30 randomly collected from each plot were separated into different tillers according to their position between jointing and flowering during the 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 wheat growth seasons soluble sugar sucrose and nitrogen contents were evaluated in stems and young ears from individual shoot samples the soluble sugar and sucrose contents were determined using anthrone colorimetry winter and huber 2000 plant tissues 0 10 0 15 g were boiled in deionized water 7 ml for 20 min in 10 ml centrifuge tubes then centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min after cooling the supernatants were decanted into 50 ml volumetric flasks these steps were repeated twice and the supernatants were pooled then pooled supernatants 100 μl were boiled with anthrone reagent 3 ml for 10 min and the soluble sugar content was measured using a tu 1901 dual wavelength spectrophotometer persee instruments beijing china at a wavelength of 620 nm pooled supernatants 20 μl mixed with 100 μl of koh 30 were heated for 10 min in a boiling water bath cooled and then mixed with anthracenone 3 ml sucrose content was the assessed as absorbance at 480 nm the nitrogen content was analyzed using the micro kjeldahl method with 0 10 0 15 g of wheat tissues 2 3 3 senescence characteristics wheat samples n 10 were collected and separated according to the marked tiller positions in each plot at 5 10 15 and 20 d after jointing during 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 superoxide dismutase sod activity and malondialdehyde mda concentrations in mixed leaf samples 0 5 g from specific tiller positions were assessed as described by wu et al 2020 2 3 4 grain yield and components grain yields kg ha 1 of mature plants were sampled from 1 5 m2 1 m length and 1 5 m width of each plot thereafter 1000 wheat grains from each plot sample were weighed 1000 grain weight the number of grains produced per spike was determined in 50 wheat ears 2 4 statistical analysis data related to grain yield and sr are shown as averages and were analyzed using spss 22 ibm corp armonk ny usa the correlation analysis between the sr and the soluble sugar sucrose and nitrogen contents in stems and young ears was also analyzed using spss 22 significant differences among treatments were determined using the least significant difference lsd method probability was taken at p 0 05 the contents of soluble sugar sucrose and nitrogen as well as senescence characteristics were plotted using origin 2018 software origin lab corporation northampton ma usa the scale bar and codes of picture in young ear differentiation were modified by adobe photoshop 2022 3 results 3 1 increasing spike numbers per unit area contributed to higher grain yield the results of the two year field study showed that sij positively affected grain yield spikes and grain numbers and negatively affected grain weight table 4 compared with nsi sij significantly increased the grain yield spike numbers and numbers of grains per spike by 18 41 40 90 11 67 35 04 and 2 93 19 89 respectively only the 1000 grain weight decreased by 2 62 12 13 grain yield increase by sij was mainly due to a significant increase in spike numbers followed by an increase in grain number per spike although the 1000 grain weight was negatively related to grain yield the increased numbers of grains per unit area could compensate for yield losses the grain yield increased from 7291 54 to 9362 16 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 together with a significant increase in spike numbers compared with that in 2017 2018 therefore the number of spikes per unit area remained the most important factor affecting yield potential 3 2 supplemental irrigation at joining promoted more low position tillers to become effective spikes spikes at harvest contained 100 of ms 26 65 91 99 of t1 and 9 84 37 92 of t2 some t1 and t2 as well as other tillers at high positions composed invalid tillers table 5 compared with nsi sij did not affect the sr of the ms but greatly increased the sr in t1 and t2 by 10 28 32 40 and 3 90 9 84 respectively table 5 these findings confirmed that optimizing soil moisture at jointing improves spike formation of low position tillers rather than converting more high position tillers to productive tillers spike formation in tillers was affected by the process of young ear differentiation which differed according to tiller position and was regulated by sij at 5 days after jointing daj the young ears of ms t1 and t2 differentiated into w5 5 w5 and w4 5 respectively fig 2a1 3 at 10 daj the young ears of the ms t1 and t2 under the nsi differentiated to w7 w7 and w6 respectively which was faster than that under the sij where the young ears of the ms t1 and t2 differentiated to w6 5 w5 5 and w5 respectively fig 2b1 3 and c1 3 even during 15 20 daj the young ears of the ms and t1 under the nsi differentiated faster than those under the sij for example the young ears of the ms and t1 were differentiated to w8 5 and w8 5 under the nsi at 15 daj or w9 5 and w9 under the nsi at 20 daj whereas the young ears of ms and t1 were differentiated to w8 and w7 5 under the sij at 15 daj or w8 5 and w8 under sij at 20 daj therefore sij significantly delayed the young ear differentiation process of ms and t1 fig 2d1 and 2 e1 and 2 f1 and 2 g1 and 2 in contrast at 15 20 daj the young ears of tiller t2 stopped differentiating at w7 5 under nsi fig 2d3 and f3 but differentiated from w7 to w8 under sij fig 2e3 and g3 apparently sij significantly accelerated the development of the young ears of t2 tillers the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in young ears of tillers rapidly increased from jointing to flowering and gradually reached the levels in main stems particularly in t2 tillers however the sugar metabolism intensity increased in spikes at the cost of reducing that in the stems for example the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in young ears at 5 daj and the sucrose content in young ears at 10 daj were significantly reduced with increasing tiller positions fig 3a1 and b1 and 2 however the soluble sugar and sucrose contents did not significantly differ among young ears of the ms t1 and t2 at 20 daj fig 3a3 b3 in contrast the soluble sugar content did not significantly differ in stems of ms t1 and t2 between 5 and 10 daj fig 3a1 and 2 b1 and 2 however the soluble sugar content at 20 daj was significantly reduced as tiller positions increased fig 3a3 the sucrose content were significantly lower in tiller stems than in ms from 5 to 20 daj fig 3b1 3 sij significantly reduced the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in stems but significantly increased those in young ears resulting in a higher ratio of soluble sugar and sucrose contents in ears to that in stems fig 4a1 3 and b1 3 after irrigation the amplitude of the sucrose content increased in t2 ears and that of the soluble sugar content decreased in stems compared with that in ms and t1 fig 4b1 3 nitrogen content in both stems and ears increased with increasing tiller position fig 3c1 3 sij significantly improved the nitrogen content in stems and ears between jointing and flowering fig 4c1 3 the results of correlation analysis showed that the sr was positively related to the soluble sugar sucrose and nitrogen contents in young ears negatively related to the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in stems and not related to the nitrogen content in stems table 6 these results further confirmed that increasing the sugar and nitrogen contents in young ears particularly the sugar metabolism intensity in the ears facilitated the conversion of more low position tillers into effective spikes 3 3 high position tillers did not convert into effective spikes even after si optimized soil water status high position tillers were the main extinct tillers between jointing and flowering the young ears mostly differentiated into w3 w4 5 when tiller mortality became evident fig 5 the young ears of invalid tillers differentiated more slowly 1 0 2 5 1 75 3 75 2 5 5 0 and 3 0 5 5 at 5 10 15 and 20 daj respectively than those of low position tillers the differences in the young ear differentiation processes between the low and high position tillers gradually became more obvious between jointing and flowering compared with nsi sij significantly improved the nitrogen content and sod activities of the invalid tillers decreased the mda content and reduced the soluble sugar content resulting in delayed tiller mortality during jointing to flowering figs 6 and 7 table 7 however sij did not promote the differentiation of young ears in invalid tillers fig 5 moreover the sugar and nitrogen contents were significantly lower in the invalid than in the effective tillers and gradually decreased between jointing and flowering fig 7 therefore high position tillers were not converted into productive spikes and directly contributed to grain yield even when soil moisture conditions were optimized by si 4 discussion 4 1 sij improves spike formation of low position tillers to increase grain yield wheat spikes which changes will significantly adjust the grain numbers and grain weight is one index that most easily influenced by abiotic stress fischer and edmeades 2010 alvarez prado et al 2017 although the spike numbers has little potential to increase wheat yield under super high yield conditions it is necessary to ensure sufficient spikes to achieve high yield gravois and mcnew 1993 ferrante et al 2017 two evidences prove in this experiment that ensuring sufficient spike numbers guaranteed the higher level of grain yield firstly grain yield changed from 7291 54 2017 2018 to 9362 16 kg ha 1 2018 2019 which mainly because the spike number in the second year is significantly greater than that in the first year table 4 although the grain number per spike and 1000 grain weight increased sharply in 2017 2018 it could not make up for the grain yield loss due to significant decrease in spike number reasons for spike number varied between two years mainly attributed to the gracimetric soil water content in the 0 200 cm soil layer before sowing the amount of irrigation at sowing and the amount of precipitation from sowing to wintering in 2017 2018 were lower than those in 2018 2019 tables 2 and 3 fig 1 which did not favor the occurrence of tillers and significantly decreased the number of tillers at wintering where the tiller number at wintering accounted for more than 87 of wheat spikes at harvest tilley et al 2019b however to maintain the spike formation of tillers during wintering and increase spike formation of spring tillers the si at jointing was an important agronomic measure gautam et al 2014 as expected sij increased grain yield from 7312 66 to 9341 04 kg ha 1 accompanied by increase in numbers of spikes from 11 67 to 35 04 table 4 further analysis found that the ms and t1 and t2 tillers comprised spikes at harvest table 5 sij mostly increased the sr of low position tillers with that of t1 increasing by 10 28 32 40 and t2 increasing by 3 92 9 84 table 5 high position tillers even when delayed mortality under the irrigation conditions table 7 did not convert into effective spikes or directly contribute to yield formation these results confirmed that optimizing soil water status at jointing improves spike formation in low position tillers to increase grain yield rather than conversion to more high position productive tillers 4 2 conversion of tillers into effective spikes by increasing sugar metabolism of young ears via sij whether the tiller can form the spikes great morphological and nutritional physiological differences between the ms and tillers need to be considered zhong et al 2008 the first tillers initiated at a low position will always have an advantage over high position tillers in terms of acquiring more photoassimilate that improve the growth and development of young ears tilley et al 2019a young ears of the ms develop spikelet and florets at the jointing stage whereas young ears of tillers are 0 5 1 5 developmental stages behind those of the ms mosaad et al 2010 lin et al 2020 hui and yuan 2012 the present study also found that the differentiation of t1 and t2 young ears was always behind by 0 1 and 0 5 2 developmental periods respectively compared with the ms between jointing and flowering fig 2 this could explain the decrease in sr as the tiller order increased we also found that the soluble sugar and sucrose contents were significantly lower in the young ears of tillers than in the ms at the early jointing stage but these gradually became equal to the ms between jointing and flowering especially in t2 fig 3 these results indicated that improving the sugar metabolism of young ears ensured that they differentiated and matched those of the ms which facilitated spike formation compared with effective tillers the reasons for invalid tillers not becoming spikes were as follows young ears ceased to differentiate at the developmental stages of w3 w4 5 fig 5 and the sugar and nitrogen contents in invalid tillers were relatively lower and continued to decrease between jointing and flowering figs 4 and 7 significant morphological differences in young ears and nutritional physiological differences in tillers led to difficulties with converting invalid tillers into effective tillers other studies have also found that irrigation at jointing significantly improves spike numbers zhao et al 2020a 2020b but less is understood about how irrigation affects spike formation the present findings showed that sij significantly increased the soluble sugar content sucrose content and nitrogen content in young ears of the ms and tillers where those indexes were positively correlated with tiller sr tables 5 and 6 in addition sij significantly reduced the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in stems which was negatively correlated with tiller sr and significantly increased the nitrogen content in stems which was not correlated with tiller sr these results suggested that responses of sugar metabolism to sij is greater than nitrogen metabolism during the spike formation process however the increased sugar content might play different roles in the differentiation of young ears because of the different sensitivities of tillers to sij the results showed that sij significantly delayed young ear differentiation of the ms and t1 at 5 20 daj fig 2a1 and 2 g1 and 2 these results were consistent with those of another study ji et al 2010 but inconsistent with findings that terminal water stress at jointing results in delays of 0 0 5 developmental stages in young ears of tillers compared with that of the ms lin et al 2020 oosterhuis and cartwright 1982 however the prolonged young ear differentiation accompanied by the increased sugar content in the ms and t1 increased floret fertility zhang et al 2021 resulting in a significant increase in the numbers of grains table 4 in contrast we also found that sij initially inhibited then promoted the differentiation of t2 young ears fig 2a3 g3 sij positively regulate the young ear differentiation of t2 tiller with more sucrose contained in young ears and less in stems to narrow gaps in young ear differentiation between t2 tiller and ms led to the formation of effective spikes fig 4a3 and b3 although sij significantly improved sod activity decreased the mda content of invalid tillers fig 6 and delayed tiller mortality between jointing and flowering table 7 it did not affect the differentiation of young ears of invalid tillers or narrow the difference in sugar and nitrogen accumulation between effective and invalid tillers figs 3 and 5 tables 4 and 5 overall if the discrepancy in young ear differentiation between tillers and the ms does not exceed two developmental stages then spike conversion can be achieved by increasing sugar metabolism in young ears via sij 4 3 sugar content in young ears was improved by sij as sugar content decreased in stems conversion of tillers to effective spikes relies on nutrient accumulation between the re greening and jointing stages for the differentiation and development of young ears langer and hanif 1973 guo et al 2009 the increased spike numbers at maturity are associated with improved carbon metabolism by tillers along with dry matter accumulation xu and zhou 2004 liu et al 2013 however the results of previous studies ignore the complexity of the various spike formation processes between jointing to flowering tilley et al 2019b laude et al 1967 abbate et al 1997 gonzález et al 2003 in reality the nutritional competition between stems and spikes obviously exists craufurd and cartwright 1989 this experiment also showed that the increased soluble sugar content and sucrose content in young ears of tillers was at the expense of decreasing soluble sugar content in stems fig 3a1 3 and b1 3 the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in young ears of tillers increased gradually from to 5 20 daj and the contents did not differ between tillers and the ms at the terminal jointing stage fig 3a1 3 and b1 3 in contrast the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in stems did not differ between tillers and ms at the time of early jointing but differences gradually appeared and increased over time compared with t1 young ears of t2 tillers had a significantly larger decrease in the soluble sugar and sucrose contents at the start of jointing a significantly decreased soluble sugar content in stems at flowering and a significantly higher sugar accumulation rate between jointing and flowering fig 3a2 3 and b2 3 these results suggested that tillers that can form spikes reduce the intensity of sugar metabolism in stems transport more sugar to young ears and promote their differentiation to catch up with the ms and meet the standard of spike formation moreover the reduction of assimilates in tillers with rising orders requires the transport of more stored materials from stems to ears which further reduces the sugar content in stems fig 3a3 and b3 this is attributed to the fact that stems are major temporary storage sites for carbohydrates in wheat crops and assimilates are transferred directly from the stem into the growing ears instead of into other organs borrell et al 1989 here sij significantly increased the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in young ears of both ms and tillers and reduced those in stems fig 4a1 3 and b1 3 compared to ms and t1 t2 tillers were more sensitive to sij and its ears contained more sucrose and stems contained less soluble sugar these led to positive regulation of t2 young ear differentiation thus reducing stem growth rates and increasing the sugar partition to spikes facilitate the further differentiation of ears and florets demotes mainard et al 1999 to improve spike numbers as well as grain yield 5 conclusions our results showed that sij mainly increased the spike formation rate sr of the first primary tiller t1 and second primary tiller t2 instead of converting more high position tillers into effective tillers reasons for low position tillers converting into spikes are the young ear differentiation of t1 and t2 tillers that can form spikes was only delayed by up to two development periods relative to the ms and the amounts of soluble sugar and sucrose in young ears paralleled those in the ms over time during jointing to flowering although sij decelerated the young ears differentiation of the ms and the t1 tiller the increased sugar content in young ears causing a significant increase in grain numbers moreover sij positively regulate the young ear differentiation of t2 tiller with more sucrose contained in young ears and less in stems to narrow gaps in young ear differentiation between t2 tiller and ms led to the formation of effective spikes reasons for high position tillers can not form spikes are the young ears mostly ceased differentiation at the stages of glume primordium present to carpel primordium present and the sugar content was significantly lower than that of low position tillers significant morphological differences in young ears and nutritional physiological differences in tillers led to high position tillers that were difficult to convert into effective tillers even under favorable conditions by sij overall tillers can be converted into effective spikes by increasing sugar metabolism

9052,irrigation at jointing increases spike numbers at wheat harvest but the mechanisms underlying increased tiller spike formation rate sr during wheat production caused by irrigation have remained unclear we therefore designed the supplemental irrigation si treatments at jointing in which si was received sij or did not receive nsi by wheat and analyzed the morphological differentiation of young ears and physiological responses of young ears and stems to si results shown that sij relative to nsi mainly improved the sr of the first primary tiller t1 and second primary tiller t2 which significantly increased the grain yield the tillers sr positively correlated to the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in young ears but negatively correlated to that in stems sij significantly increased the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in young ears and reduced that in stems in both the main stem ms and tillers compared with ms the young ear differentiation of t1 and t2 tillers that can form spikes was always behind by 0 2 developmental periods between jointing and flowering although sij decelerated the young ears differentiation of the ms and the t1 tiller the increased sugar content in young ears causing a significant increase in grain numbers moreover sij positively regulated the young ear differentiation of t2 tiller with more sucrose contained in young ears and less in stems to narrow gaps in young ear differentiation between t2 tiller and ms some t1 and t2 as well as other high position tillers composed invalid tillers where young ears mostly ceased differentiating at the stages of glume primordium present to carpel primordium present and contained significantly less sugar than effective tillers significant morphological differences in young ears and nutritional physiological differences in tillers led to high position tillers that were difficult to convert into effective tillers even under favorable conditions by sij overall tillers can be converted into effective spikes by increasing sugar metabolism in young ears via sij when the discrepancy in young ear differentiation does not exceed two developmental stages compared to ms keywords wheat ear differentiation spike formation rate sugar metabolism effective and invalid tiller irrigation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the spike formation rate sr indicates the ability of winter wheat triticum aestivum l tillers to develop spikes productive tillers naruoka et al 2011 however numerous tillers produced by wheat are associated with mortality and this negatively correlates with grain yield moral and moral 1995 sharma 1995 only spikes of the main stem and the first and second primary tillers of wheat remain until maturity thorne and wood 1988 li et al 2019 which composed the spike numbers per unit area is a crucial component of wheat yield miller et al 1991 therefore understanding how factors affect spike formation during critical period of wheat growth would help to increase wheat yield generally the order of spike formation is associated with the time of tiller initiation where more than 87 of spikes originate from wintering tillers tilley et al 2019b the tillers that are initiated early have more leaf area than those initiated later tilley et al 2019a this advantage produces more photoassimilate that improve the growth and development of tillers and young ear differentiation therefore previous studies on wheat spike formation focused on the occurrence of tillers sparkes et al 2006 dreccer et al 2013 however wheat spike formation means that young ears can fully differentiate and develop and young ears can pull out the stem sheath and then complete flowering pollinating and forming the final yield ariel et al 2013 this process occurs after the jointing stage involving the differentiation of young ears lauer and simmons 1988 hu et al 2017 elongation of stem tilley et al 2019b laude et al 1967 abbate et al 1997 gonzález et al 2003 and mortality of tillers moral and moral 1995 sharma 1995 which is often ignored due to its complexity when studying the mechanisms of spike formation although studies have reported that the moderate irrigation at jointing optimizes the growth environment of wheat and increases the number of spikes by reducing nutritional competition among tillers kaya altop et al 2019 mitchell et al 2013 shang et al 2020 the mechanism s through supplemental irrigation si at jointing promotes spike formation in tillers is vague simultaneously tillers at different positions have different sensitivities to soil moisture at jointing sarath et al 2014 whether irrigation at jointing improves spike numbers at harvest by increasing the spike formation of low and high position tillers or both classified according to cai et al 2014 remains unclear yet actually the young ears of main stem develop spikelet and florets at jointing whereas during this period the young ears of tillers are at one or more developmental stages behind that of main stem lauer and simmons 1988 the huge gap between tillers and main stems during young ear differentiation results in weak nutritional competitiveness of high position tillers and limited spike formation hu et al 2017 furthermore the stem is a major temporary storage site of carbohydrates in wheat crops and assimilates are directly transferred from the stem into growing ears instead of into other organs borrell et al 1989 assessing whether young ears have sufficient competitiveness from competition with developing non spike organs to provide sufficient sugar and nitrogen nutrients for spikelet and floret development is important for judging the ability of tillers to form spikes carolina et al 2019 demotes mainard et al 1999 therefore it is necessary to explore the regulation of si at jointing on modifying the distribution of assimilates in growing wheat stems and ears and promoting the further development of young ears the findings are extremely important for understanding how spikes are formed soluble sugar is the main storage and structural substances in plants which is important indicators for studying the ear differentiation xue et al 2008 sucrose is the main product of photosynthesis and the main transport substance in plants which can decompose to hexose for the developmental of ears fruits roots etc ruan 2014 moreover nitrogen which can be transported between effective and ineffective tillers is also important for synthesizing enzymes to participate in spike formation ramadan et al 2018 sugar and nitrogen are the basic nutrients of crop growth and development and their distribution in organs is regulated by supplemental irrigation during wheat growth ramadan et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 this will further affect the morphogenesis of ear and stem and then regulate the process of spike formation zheng et al 2013 therefore we examined the morphological differentiation of young ear and the physiological conditions of young ears and stems to identify the underlying mechanisms for tiller conversion into spikes between jointing to flowering as well as how si at jointing affects ear differentiation productive tiller formation and grain yield our results provide a theoretical basis for supplemental irrigation at jointing to increase spike numbers and grain yield 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this two year field study proceeded in daolang town shandong province china 36 12 n 116 54 e during the 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 winter wheat

wintering to jointing jointing to flowering and flowering to maturity respectively 2 2 experimental design shannong 23 sn23 is a widely planted commercial winter wheat cultivar in the north china plain which is a large spike cultivar with low tillers irrigation treatments were designed at jointing in which si was received sij or did not receive nsi by wheat using the zadoks scale zadoks et al 1974 to determine the jointing stage z31 and irrigation is carried out at five days after jointing at this time the young ear differentiates into the pharmacophore formation stage w5 5 according to waddington et al 1983 which is sensitive to irrigation and fertilizer zhang et al 2021 in this experiment the water management at sowing wintering and flowering was consistent in all si treatments except for the treatment period the si amount was determined according to the si method of wang et al 2018 the gravimetric soil water content gswc g g 1 and the relative soil water content rswc g g 1 were measured by using the oven drying method klute 1986 at sowing wintering jointing flowering and maturity where the soil samples were collected at 20 cm intervals using a soil corer from 200 cm soil depth then soil samples were put into the aluminum boxes weighed for fresh weight fw and dried in an oven at 105 c for 72 h for dry weight dw gswc0 20 and rswc0 20 referred as the gswc and rswc

of wintering and si amount was calculated by formula 3 the si at jointing was implemented at five days after the jointing stage under the sij treatment and si amount was calculated by formula 3 the nsi treatment was no water implemented at jointing the si at flowering was implemented only when the rswc0 20 0 50 g g 1 at the flowering complete stage and si amount was calculated by formula 3 the experimental design used a randomized block design with three replications with an area of 15 m2 10 m length and 1 5 m width for each plot the crops were uniformly sprayed with water in each plot using micro sprinkling hoses that is special for wheat wang et al 2013 the amount of si was measured using water meters installed on the hoses between plots a width of 1 0 m used for buffer zone the details of si amount and irrigation event date of wheat at different growth periods see table 3 supplementary figure 1 shows the soil water status after si at jointing which is measured at three day after si pure nitrogen fertilizer 240 kg ha 1 was applied during the growth season as 135 kg at sowing and 105 kg was top dressed at jointing pure nitrogen base fertilizer applied before sowing contained 15 nitrogen as 15 p2o5 and k2o and the soil was top dressed at jointing with urea containing 46 n wheat was sown on 13 october 2017 and 8 october 2018 and harvested on 8 june 2018 and 12 june 2019 respectively wheat planting density was 300 plants per square meter with 0 25 m row spacing the weed and pesticides management in all treatments were unified 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 wheat young ear differentiation and spike formation rate sr the earliest tillers were marked upon emergence and every five days thereafter until the numbers reached a maximum according to the klepper et al 1982 naming system the main stem is represented as ms and primary tillers growing from the true leaf axilla of the ms are represented as tillers t1 t2 t3 t4 and so on t10 and t20 tillers that grew from the axils of the prophyllae of t1 and t2 respectively were considered secondary tillers secondary tillers also included t11 tillers that grew from the axil of the first leaf of t1 and others tagged wheat samples were selected and separated after joining according to the tiller position and measured the development of young ears from the ms and tillers were assessed in 15 wheat plants with similar growth status which was examined by a stereoscopic microscope after joining with a interval in five days photoed the first floret in the middle spikelet of young ears and recorded the differentiation stages according to waddington s scale supplementary table 1 where the development stage of the first floret is taken as the young ears differentiation stages at the same sampling time of the effective tillers the young ears differentiation of invalid tiller is observed and shown in picture the invalid tiller is that more than 50 of the apical leaves tuned yellow and selected without tiller order moreover tiller numbers in one square meter was investigated and tiller numbers per hectare was calculated during wheat different growth periods then the tagged mature plants per square meter were collected in each experimental plot and separated according to tiller position the effective tiller number was determined and the sr was calculated the sr of tillers was the ratio of tillers in a specific position at maturity per unit area to the maximum number of tillers in the same position during the entire growth season 2 3 2 sugar and nitrogen contents wheat samples n 30 randomly collected from each plot were separated into different tillers according to their position between jointing and flowering during the 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 wheat growth seasons soluble sugar sucrose and nitrogen contents were evaluated in stems and young ears from individual shoot samples the soluble sugar and sucrose contents were determined using anthrone colorimetry winter and huber 2000 plant tissues 0 10 0 15 g were boiled in deionized water 7 ml for 20 min in 10 ml centrifuge tubes then centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min after cooling the supernatants were decanted into 50 ml volumetric flasks these steps were repeated twice and the supernatants were pooled then pooled supernatants 100 μl were boiled with anthrone reagent 3 ml for 10 min and the soluble sugar content was measured using a tu 1901 dual wavelength spectrophotometer persee instruments beijing china at a wavelength of 620 nm pooled supernatants 20 μl mixed with 100 μl of koh 30 were heated for 10 min in a boiling water bath cooled and then mixed with anthracenone 3 ml sucrose content was the assessed as absorbance at 480 nm the nitrogen content was analyzed using the micro kjeldahl method with 0 10 0 15 g of wheat tissues 2 3 3 senescence characteristics wheat samples n 10 were collected and separated according to the marked tiller positions in each plot at 5 10 15 and 20 d after jointing during 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 superoxide dismutase sod activity and malondialdehyde mda concentrations in mixed leaf samples 0 5 g from specific tiller positions were assessed as described by wu et al 2020 2 3 4 grain yield and components grain yields kg ha 1 of mature plants were sampled from 1 5 m2 1 m length and 1 5 m width of each plot thereafter 1000 wheat grains from each plot sample were weighed 1000 grain weight the number of grains produced per spike was determined in 50 wheat ears 2 4 statistical analysis data related to grain yield and sr are shown as averages and were analyzed using spss 22 ibm corp armonk ny usa the correlation analysis between the sr and the soluble sugar sucrose and nitrogen contents in stems and young ears was also analyzed using spss 22 significant differences among treatments were determined using the least significant difference lsd method probability was taken at p 0 05 the contents of soluble sugar sucrose and nitrogen as well as senescence characteristics were plotted using origin 2018 software origin lab corporation northampton ma usa the scale bar and codes of picture in young ear differentiation were modified by adobe photoshop 2022 3 results 3 1 increasing spike numbers per unit area contributed to higher grain yield the results of the two year field study showed that sij positively affected grain yield spikes and grain numbers and negatively affected grain weight table 4 compared with nsi sij significantly increased the grain yield spike numbers and numbers of grains per spike by 18 41 40 90 11 67 35 04 and 2 93 19 89 respectively only the 1000 grain weight decreased by 2 62 12 13 grain yield increase by sij was mainly due to a significant increase in spike numbers followed by an increase in grain number per spike although the 1000 grain weight was negatively related to grain yield the increased numbers of grains per unit area could compensate for yield losses the grain yield increased from 7291 54 to 9362 16 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 together with a significant increase in spike numbers compared with that in 2017 2018 therefore the number of spikes per unit area remained the most important factor affecting yield potential 3 2 supplemental irrigation at joining promoted more low position tillers to become effective spikes spikes at harvest contained 100 of ms 26 65 91 99 of t1 and 9 84 37 92 of t2 some t1 and t2 as well as other tillers at high positions composed invalid tillers table 5 compared with nsi sij did not affect the sr of the ms but greatly increased the sr in t1 and t2 by 10 28 32 40 and 3 90 9 84 respectively table 5 these findings confirmed that optimizing soil moisture at jointing improves spike formation of low position tillers rather than converting more high position tillers to productive tillers spike formation in tillers was affected by the process of young ear differentiation which differed according to tiller position and was regulated by sij at 5 days after jointing daj the young ears of ms t1 and t2 differentiated into w5 5 w5 and w4 5 respectively fig 2a1 3 at 10 daj the young ears of the ms t1 and t2 under the nsi differentiated to w7 w7 and w6 respectively which was faster than that under the sij where the young ears of the ms t1 and t2 differentiated to w6 5 w5 5 and w5 respectively fig 2b1 3 and c1 3 even during 15 20 daj the young ears of the ms and t1 under the nsi differentiated faster than those under the sij for example the young ears of the ms and t1 were differentiated to w8 5 and w8 5 under the nsi at 15 daj or w9 5 and w9 under the nsi at 20 daj whereas the young ears of ms and t1 were differentiated to w8 and w7 5 under the sij at 15 daj or w8 5 and w8 under sij at 20 daj therefore sij significantly delayed the young ear differentiation process of ms and t1 fig 2d1 and 2 e1 and 2 f1 and 2 g1 and 2 in contrast at 15 20 daj the young ears of tiller t2 stopped differentiating at w7 5 under nsi fig 2d3 and f3 but differentiated from w7 to w8 under sij fig 2e3 and g3 apparently sij significantly accelerated the development of the young ears of t2 tillers the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in young ears of tillers rapidly increased from jointing to flowering and gradually reached the levels in main stems particularly in t2 tillers however the sugar metabolism intensity increased in spikes at the cost of reducing that in the stems for example the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in young ears at 5 daj and the sucrose content in young ears at 10 daj were significantly reduced with increasing tiller positions fig 3a1 and b1 and 2 however the soluble sugar and sucrose contents did not significantly differ among young ears of the ms t1 and t2 at 20 daj fig 3a3 b3 in contrast the soluble sugar content did not significantly differ in stems of ms t1 and t2 between 5 and 10 daj fig 3a1 and 2 b1 and 2 however the soluble sugar content at 20 daj was significantly reduced as tiller positions increased fig 3a3 the sucrose content were significantly lower in tiller stems than in ms from 5 to 20 daj fig 3b1 3 sij significantly reduced the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in stems but significantly increased those in young ears resulting in a higher ratio of soluble sugar and sucrose contents in ears to that in stems fig 4a1 3 and b1 3 after irrigation the amplitude of the sucrose content increased in t2 ears and that of the soluble sugar content decreased in stems compared with that in ms and t1 fig 4b1 3 nitrogen content in both stems and ears increased with increasing tiller position fig 3c1 3 sij significantly improved the nitrogen content in stems and ears between jointing and flowering fig 4c1 3 the results of correlation analysis showed that the sr was positively related to the soluble sugar sucrose and nitrogen contents in young ears negatively related to the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in stems and not related to the nitrogen content in stems table 6 these results further confirmed that increasing the sugar and nitrogen contents in young ears particularly the sugar metabolism intensity in the ears facilitated the conversion of more low position tillers into effective spikes 3 3 high position tillers did not convert into effective spikes even after si optimized soil water status high position tillers were the main extinct tillers between jointing and flowering the young ears mostly differentiated into w3 w4 5 when tiller mortality became evident fig 5 the young ears of invalid tillers differentiated more slowly 1 0 2 5 1 75 3 75 2 5 5 0 and 3 0 5 5 at 5 10 15 and 20 daj respectively than those of low position tillers the differences in the young ear differentiation processes between the low and high position tillers gradually became more obvious between jointing and flowering compared with nsi sij significantly improved the nitrogen content and sod activities of the invalid tillers decreased the mda content and reduced the soluble sugar content resulting in delayed tiller mortality during jointing to flowering figs 6 and 7 table 7 however sij did not promote the differentiation of young ears in invalid tillers fig 5 moreover the sugar and nitrogen contents were significantly lower in the invalid than in the effective tillers and gradually decreased between jointing and flowering fig 7 therefore high position tillers were not converted into productive spikes and directly contributed to grain yield even when soil moisture conditions were optimized by si 4 discussion 4 1 sij improves spike formation of low position tillers to increase grain yield wheat spikes which changes will significantly adjust the grain numbers and grain weight is one index that most easily influenced by abiotic stress fischer and edmeades 2010 alvarez prado et al 2017 although the spike numbers has little potential to increase wheat yield under super high yield conditions it is necessary to ensure sufficient spikes to achieve high yield gravois and mcnew 1993 ferrante et al 2017 two evidences prove in this experiment that ensuring sufficient spike numbers guaranteed the higher level of grain yield firstly grain yield changed from 7291 54 2017 2018 to 9362 16 kg ha 1 2018 2019 which mainly because the spike number in the second year is significantly greater than that in the first year table 4 although the grain number per spike and 1000 grain weight increased sharply in 2017 2018 it could not make up for the grain yield loss due to significant decrease in spike number reasons for spike number varied between two years mainly attributed to the gracimetric soil water content in the 0 200 cm soil layer before sowing the amount of irrigation at sowing and the amount of precipitation from sowing to wintering in 2017 2018 were lower than those in 2018 2019 tables 2 and 3 fig 1 which did not favor the occurrence of tillers and significantly decreased the number of tillers at wintering where the tiller number at wintering accounted for more than 87 of wheat spikes at harvest tilley et al 2019b however to maintain the spike formation of tillers during wintering and increase spike formation of spring tillers the si at jointing was an important agronomic measure gautam et al 2014 as expected sij increased grain yield from 7312 66 to 9341 04 kg ha 1 accompanied by increase in numbers of spikes from 11 67 to 35 04 table 4 further analysis found that the ms and t1 and t2 tillers comprised spikes at harvest table 5 sij mostly increased the sr of low position tillers with that of t1 increasing by 10 28 32 40 and t2 increasing by 3 92 9 84 table 5 high position tillers even when delayed mortality under the irrigation conditions table 7 did not convert into effective spikes or directly contribute to yield formation these results confirmed that optimizing soil water status at jointing improves spike formation in low position tillers to increase grain yield rather than conversion to more high position productive tillers 4 2 conversion of tillers into effective spikes by increasing sugar metabolism of young ears via sij whether the tiller can form the spikes great morphological and nutritional physiological differences between the ms and tillers need to be considered zhong et al 2008 the first tillers initiated at a low position will always have an advantage over high position tillers in terms of acquiring more photoassimilate that improve the growth and development of young ears tilley et al 2019a young ears of the ms develop spikelet and florets at the jointing stage whereas young ears of tillers are 0 5 1 5 developmental stages behind those of the ms mosaad et al 2010 lin et al 2020 hui and yuan 2012 the present study also found that the differentiation of t1 and t2 young ears was always behind by 0 1 and 0 5 2 developmental periods respectively compared with the ms between jointing and flowering fig 2 this could explain the decrease in sr as the tiller order increased we also found that the soluble sugar and sucrose contents were significantly lower in the young ears of tillers than in the ms at the early jointing stage but these gradually became equal to the ms between jointing and flowering especially in t2 fig 3 these results indicated that improving the sugar metabolism of young ears ensured that they differentiated and matched those of the ms which facilitated spike formation compared with effective tillers the reasons for invalid tillers not becoming spikes were as follows young ears ceased to differentiate at the developmental stages of w3 w4 5 fig 5 and the sugar and nitrogen contents in invalid tillers were relatively lower and continued to decrease between jointing and flowering figs 4 and 7 significant morphological differences in young ears and nutritional physiological differences in tillers led to difficulties with converting invalid tillers into effective tillers other studies have also found that irrigation at jointing significantly improves spike numbers zhao et al 2020a 2020b but less is understood about how irrigation affects spike formation the present findings showed that sij significantly increased the soluble sugar content sucrose content and nitrogen content in young ears of the ms and tillers where those indexes were positively correlated with tiller sr tables 5 and 6 in addition sij significantly reduced the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in stems which was negatively correlated with tiller sr and significantly increased the nitrogen content in stems which was not correlated with tiller sr these results suggested that responses of sugar metabolism to sij is greater than nitrogen metabolism during the spike formation process however the increased sugar content might play different roles in the differentiation of young ears because of the different sensitivities of tillers to sij the results showed that sij significantly delayed young ear differentiation of the ms and t1 at 5 20 daj fig 2a1 and 2 g1 and 2 these results were consistent with those of another study ji et al 2010 but inconsistent with findings that terminal water stress at jointing results in delays of 0 0 5 developmental stages in young ears of tillers compared with that of the ms lin et al 2020 oosterhuis and cartwright 1982 however the prolonged young ear differentiation accompanied by the increased sugar content in the ms and t1 increased floret fertility zhang et al 2021 resulting in a significant increase in the numbers of grains table 4 in contrast we also found that sij initially inhibited then promoted the differentiation of t2 young ears fig 2a3 g3 sij positively regulate the young ear differentiation of t2 tiller with more sucrose contained in young ears and less in stems to narrow gaps in young ear differentiation between t2 tiller and ms led to the formation of effective spikes fig 4a3 and b3 although sij significantly improved sod activity decreased the mda content of invalid tillers fig 6 and delayed tiller mortality between jointing and flowering table 7 it did not affect the differentiation of young ears of invalid tillers or narrow the difference in sugar and nitrogen accumulation between effective and invalid tillers figs 3 and 5 tables 4 and 5 overall if the discrepancy in young ear differentiation between tillers and the ms does not exceed two developmental stages then spike conversion can be achieved by increasing sugar metabolism in young ears via sij 4 3 sugar content in young ears was improved by sij as sugar content decreased in stems conversion of tillers to effective spikes relies on nutrient accumulation between the re greening and jointing stages for the differentiation and development of young ears langer and hanif 1973 guo et al 2009 the increased spike numbers at maturity are associated with improved carbon metabolism by tillers along with dry matter accumulation xu and zhou 2004 liu et al 2013 however the results of previous studies ignore the complexity of the various spike formation processes between jointing to flowering tilley et al 2019b laude et al 1967 abbate et al 1997 gonzález et al 2003 in reality the nutritional competition between stems and spikes obviously exists craufurd and cartwright 1989 this experiment also showed that the increased soluble sugar content and sucrose content in young ears of tillers was at the expense of decreasing soluble sugar content in stems fig 3a1 3 and b1 3 the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in young ears of tillers increased gradually from to 5 20 daj and the contents did not differ between tillers and the ms at the terminal jointing stage fig 3a1 3 and b1 3 in contrast the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in stems did not differ between tillers and ms at the time of early jointing but differences gradually appeared and increased over time compared with t1 young ears of t2 tillers had a significantly larger decrease in the soluble sugar and sucrose contents at the start of jointing a significantly decreased soluble sugar content in stems at flowering and a significantly higher sugar accumulation rate between jointing and flowering fig 3a2 3 and b2 3 these results suggested that tillers that can form spikes reduce the intensity of sugar metabolism in stems transport more sugar to young ears and promote their differentiation to catch up with the ms and meet the standard of spike formation moreover the reduction of assimilates in tillers with rising orders requires the transport of more stored materials from stems to ears which further reduces the sugar content in stems fig 3a3 and b3 this is attributed to the fact that stems are major temporary storage sites for carbohydrates in wheat crops and assimilates are transferred directly from the stem into the growing ears instead of into other organs borrell et al 1989 here sij significantly increased the soluble sugar and sucrose contents in young ears of both ms and tillers and reduced those in stems fig 4a1 3 and b1 3 compared to ms and t1 t2 tillers were more sensitive to sij and its ears contained more sucrose and stems contained less soluble sugar these led to positive regulation of t2 young ear differentiation thus reducing stem growth rates and increasing the sugar partition to spikes facilitate the further differentiation of ears and florets demotes mainard et al 1999 to improve spike numbers as well as grain yield 5 conclusions our results showed that sij mainly increased the spike formation rate sr of the first primary tiller t1 and second primary tiller t2 instead of converting more high position tillers into effective tillers reasons for low position tillers converting into spikes are the young ear differentiation of t1 and t2 tillers that can form spikes was only delayed by up to two development periods relative to the ms and the amounts of soluble sugar and sucrose in young ears paralleled those in the ms over time during jointing to flowering although sij decelerated the young ears differentiation of the ms and the t1 tiller the increased sugar content in young ears causing a significant increase in grain numbers moreover sij positively regulate the young ear differentiation of t2 tiller with more sucrose contained in young ears and less in stems to narrow gaps in young ear differentiation between t2 tiller and ms led to the formation of effective spikes reasons for high position tillers can not form spikes are the young ears mostly ceased differentiation at the stages of glume primordium present to carpel primordium present and the sugar content was significantly lower than that of low position tillers significant morphological differences in young ears and nutritional physiological differences in tillers led to high position tillers that were difficult to convert into effective tillers even under favorable conditions by sij overall tillers can be converted into effective spikes by increasing sugar metabolism in young ears via sij when the discrepancy in young ear differentiation does not exceed two developmental stages compared to ms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

produce may internalize into the edible portions of vegetables or otherwise persist on or within vegetables until harvest point of consumption given the right set of circumstances such as if the contaminated vegetable be consumed by vulnerable groups including the young old pregnant or immunocompromised foodborne illness may arise alegbeleye et al 2018 it is thus important to minimize the probability for microbial contamination of vegetables via irrigation water there are several approaches to minimize the potential for produce contamination via irrigation water including but not limited to routine surveillance of the levels of enteric pathogens preferably or indicator microbial groups in irrigation water such research endeavors can provide necessary knowledge about the microbiological safety of water and identify seasonal variations if any to characterize vulnerability or risks and where necessary minimize or control sources of microbial contamination it is useful to investigate potential on farm sources features structures and agricultural practices of pathogens into the irrigation resources some of the most relevant factors in this regard include identification characterization of livestock operations incidence of manure piles and sewage discharge amongst other potential sources of pathogens to water uyttendaele et al 2015 alegbeleye and sant ana 2020 such approach can provide useful information required to comprehensively understand and manage risks associated with microbiologically compromised irrigation water for instance quantitative microbial risk assessments qmras whose output can provide profound understanding of the risks associated with agricultural water require updated accurate data on a variety of inputs parameters including not only the occurrence and levels of microorganisms in irrigation water but characterization of relevant factors that can influence the magnitude of associated risks such as irrigation techniques amongst others uyttendaele et al 2015 a comprehensive summary of these factors can be seen in table s 1 2 and 3 of the review by alegbeleye and sant ana 2021 paucity of relevant data can limit the efficiency of qmras and minimize the capacity to understand and mitigate food safety risks associated with irrigation water using standard techniques this study periodically during two rainy

the presence of suitable hydraulic precursors such as rainfall or flooding pathogens could be washed off into surface waters or leached to groundwater the sampling time for this study was designed around precipitation patterns with regards to precipitation there are two distinct seasons in sao paulo a wet humid rainy period typically between october and march and a dry comparatively cold season usually between april and august september where there is typically little or no rain irrigation water samples were collected three times during the year from 69 vegetable farms in sao paulo brazil to protect the farmers we have not specified the locations of the farms however all farms are located in various cities and neighborhoods in sao paulo the first set of samples were collected between january and march when rainfall was plentiful this sampling period is tagged rainy 1 also referred to at times as r1 the second set of samples were collected between june and august a sampling period referred to as dry presented as d the last set of samples were collected between october and december when rainfall resumed in october after a significant period of no rain this sampling period is known as rainy 2 also referred to as r2 the exact month and year when irrigation water samples were collected from the respective farms sources are shown in table s1 the irrigation water samples are labelled based on the source of the irrigation water so that each id or identifier begins with a code representing the source of the water followed by an assigned number numeral indicating the number

afterwards 5 drops of the thioglycolate culture was transferred to lactose sulphite broth biorad brasil and incubated aerobically for 24 h at 46 c colonies that conformed to the characteristics of c perfringens based on the compiled biochemical profile were counted and recorded as presumptive clostridium perfringens identified based on cultural and biochemical characterization for all microbial tests choice of culture media and incubation temperature was validated in that wherever feasible bacterial groups recovered under comparable conditions and criteria were compared and overall methods that minimized the potential to report false positives were selected all biochemical tests were done using well isolated pure fresh bacterial culture preparations in strict accordance with well established identification enumeration guidelines forsythe 2018 ferone et al 2020 all biochemical test reagents were of analytical grade and within the time of use recommended by the manufacturer despite these however there s a potential for a light underestimation as biochemically atypical isolates which could not be repeated or verified by additional or alternate phenotypic or biochemical methods were discarded in all cases 2 4 pairing irrigation techniques with cultivated produce type some types of crops are more vulnerable to pathogenic contmaination via irrigation water or during irrigation events alegbeleye and sant ana 2021 examples of such crops include those whose edible portions lie close to the soil such as lettuce those that are irrigated more frequently and those for which it might be difficult to respect the recommendation to tail off irrigation in advance before harvest to maximize the possibility for pathogen die off on field gerba 2009 erickson et al 2010 kisluk and yaron 2012 uyttendaele et al 2015 in this study these types of crops together with those that are customarily consumed raw were grouped as high risk crops table s2 the concept consumed raw refers to vegetables that may be eaten as a dish or may be used raw in salads or sandwiches and other ready to eat foods some studies reports have indicated that because sprinkler irrigation tends to introduce water directly to the edible portion of plants it may represent a more potent risk for transfer of bacterial contaminants to irrigated produce compared to drip irrigation fonseca et al 2011 pachepsky et al 2011 kisluk and yaron 2012 allende et al 2017 o flaherty et al 2019 alegbeleye and sant ana 2021 sprinkler irrigation may also lead to airborne transport of pathogens particularly during windy conditions potentially contaminating vegetables on field or even water systems hutchison et al 2008 therefore irrigation technique on each farm was matched with the kind of vegetable cultivated categorized as high risk hrv or low risk lrv carrots lettuce radish collard greens cabbage tomatoes cucumber kale bell pepper celery beetroot chard arugula spring onions endive and chives were categorized as hrv table s2 crops categorized as lrv were eggplant spinach broccoli cauliflower asparagus green beans okra and sprouts table s2 it might be useful to emphasize that food safety risks depend on various factors and any combination of production practices on different farms can significantly influence risks these pairing of irrigation system with type of produce cultivated is based on previous research findings and is not necessarily sufficiently comprehensive or indicative of risks 2 5 statistical analyses seasonal differences in the ph of the various irrigation water source types were analyzed using two way analysis of variance anova colony forming units cfu ml counted on na agar plates culturable microorganisms were converted to log and averages of duplicate counts were calculated mean standard deviation values are reported in tables and used for all graphical representations two way anova was used to assess seasonal variations in the levels of culturable microorganisms detected in all water samples threshold significance level set at p 0 05 similarly cfu 100 ml counts from membrane filtration tests were log transformed and the mean standard deviations were calculated and reported seasonal variations in the levels of indicator bacteria detected from each water source were analyzed using two way anova one way anova was used to test whether the differences among means of bacterial counts recovered from water samples collected from respective farms at r1 d and r2 differed significantly from one another graphpad prism version 9 1 for windows graphpad software san diego california usa www graphpad com and ibm spss statistical package version 25 0 were used for statistical analyses and to illustrate graphs 3 results the ph of the irrigation water samples ranged between 6 15 and 8 55 table 1 the most commonly exploited water source in the study area was groundwater 33 followed by farm ponds 21 harvested rainwater 15 canals 10 rivers 5 potable water 4 streams 2 lakes 2 and domestic wastewater 2 fig s1 3 1 levels of culturable microorganisms in irrigation water samples levels of culturable microorganisms mean values together with the standard deviation recovered from the respective irrigation sources are shown in table 2 except otherwise stated levels of culturable microorganisms reported are in log cfu ml and only counts obtained from petri dishes incubated at 36 c are reported levels of culturable microorganisms recovered from irrigation water during r1 d and r2 sampling seasons were significantly different p 0 0001 from one another levels of culturable microorganisms recovered from irrigation water samples ranged between 1 7 and 11 0 1 7 and 9 8 1 7 and 10 1 log cfu ml during r1 d and r2 respectively table 2 there were however peculiarities in counts recovered from samples relating to the source of the irrigation water for example the lowest levels of culturable microorganisms were recorded in potable water 1 7 3 3 0 069 where counts were consistently low while the highest levels were recovered from canal water samples 4 3 0 005 11 0 0 005 table 2 equally high counts were detected in farm pond samples up to 10 3

expressed as mean log cfu 100 ml are shown in table 2 except otherwise specified all e coli counts reported and discussed are presented in log cfu 100 ml levels of e coli detected in surface waters

rv3 where 3 6 0 02 was obtained is the only source where counts exceeded 1 9 log cfu 100 ml during the dry season table 2 this finding might be an indication of a point source of enterococci into this

respective farms are presented in table 3 manure stockpile was observed near growing fields in 37 26 69 of vegetable farms surveyed while 66 of the farms apply manure biosolids table 3 animal rearing livestock production 33 as well as livestock or cattle grazing 23 were also fairly common table 3 of the 69 farms surveyed 8 i e 6 69 apply water treatment table 3 all six farms that treat the water apply chlorination at least once a year fig s2 of the 46 farms that apply manure biosolid or some other biological amendment 4 3 46 compost the manure data not shown sprinkler drip flood furrow and microsprinkler irrigation techniques are the commonly used techniques for irrigating vegetables in the study area fig 1a of these sprinkler irrigation was the commonest irrigation technique used in the study area 64 while lettuce is the most commonly cultivated produce in the studied farms fig 1b among these farms 58 irrigate high risk crops with sprinkler technique fig 2 which might be an indication of produce safety risks park et al 2016 3 3 impact of farm features and practices on levels of e coli and enterococci in irrigation water samples 3 3 1 it is apparent that cattle grazing influences levels of enterococci recovered from groundwater samples in the study area levels of enterococci were high up to 6 5 cfu 100 ml for gw 15 r1 especially in some groundwater irrigation water samples collected from farms where cattle grazing was recorded in fig 3a the disparities in levels of enterococci recovered from farms groundwater sources where cattle grazing was observed compared to those without cattle grazing activity can be seen levels of enterococci recovered from all samples may be seen in fig s3 3 3 2 impact of chlorination on levels of e coli detected in irrigation water

6 0 01 2 8 0 01 and gw8 0 2 0 2 0 3 table 2 fig 3b these results indicate and buttress the notion that chlorination has an impact on concentrations of e coli in water 4 discussions levels of culturable microorganisms provide useful information regarding the overall microbiological quality of water cabral 2010 rodrigues and cunha 2017 they provide a general indication of the integrity and cleanliness of the distribution system as well as efficiency of the treatment applied where relevant levels of culturable microorganisms might also be used to assess the safety and suitability of irrigation supplies as the risks for contaminating plant produce with microorganisms such as spoilage organisms is generally higher where the water supply contains a high load of microorganisms levels of culturable microorganisms as high as 11 and 10 4 log cfu ml recovered from c4 and c7 respectively table 1 might be an indication that the irrigation water could potentially be a source of spoilage bacteria to irrigated produce although recovery of indicator bacteria may not always be an indication that human pathogens or fecal contamination is occurring in water systems they particularly e coli are still used to assess the overall microbiological safety or to predict microbiological hazards for water systems microorganisms can be washed into surface waters via several sources and pathways including storm water runoff runoff from manure storage areas rangelands pastures and feedlots other agricultural waste as well as domestic and wildlife waste pachepsky et al 2011 buckerfield et al 2019 some of these potential sources of water contamination were identified at some of the studied farms table 3 these routes of contamination may be particularly relevant for farm ponds as the earthen ponds are dug on the farm and are near these sources of input where relevant fig s3 increasing the risks for overflow into the ponds via rainfall or other water conveyor other sources include leaking or otherwise malfunctioning septic systems sewage discharged or dumped from other sources such as recreational boats wastewater treatment plant effluents and so on can also introduce pathogens into water resources alegbeleye et al 2016 tornevi et al 2014 elisante and muzuka 2016 acute or occasional source water contamination due for example to failures in water treatment processes operations or acute wastewater discharge events upstream is also possible owens et al 2020 high levels of culturable microorganisms and indicator bacteria recorded in canals and river water samples particularly during the rainy season could probably be attributed to acute source water contamination but may also be due to stormwater carryover cabral 2010 bacteria may also be leached into surface waters via natural non anthropogenic sources including soil sediments plants and sand jung et al 2014 givens et al 2016 alegbeleye et al 2018 these sources may contribute to a certain background level in ambient waters but the extent to which these factors influence the bacteriological quality of water vary depending on local environmental and meteorological conditions generally rainwater is usually of relatively good microbiological quality although its endpoint safety depends on factors such as collection storage and distribution systems this consideration impact of piping and other holding or distribution systems on microbiological quality of irrigation water at point of use holds true for irrigation water regardless of the source each irrigation subsystem collection storage distribution and on farm application involve processes that can potentially compromise the microbiological integrity of the irrigation water alegbeleye et al 2018 rainwater may become contaminated with microorganisms through animal droppings on roofs or other water collection materials equipment for instance brids reptiles and other animal fecal matter may introduce pathogens into roof harvested rainwater especially after long periods of drought ahmed et al 2010 hamilton et al 2019 bird proofing roofs is a strategy that could minimize contamination via this route however as far as we know none of the studied farms had bird proofing systems installed by the time the study was conducted groundwater is generally considered microbiologically safe however bacterial pathogens may reach groundwater resources through different pathways including sewage overflows polluted storm water runoff and agricultural runoff well water sources located too close to flood zones animal agricultural rearing areas manure storage sites cesspools septic tanks and drainage fields are more prone to pathogenic contamination oecd and organization 2003 akoachere et al 2013 such wells may be more vulnerable to contamination after flooding particularly if the wells are shallow or otherwise poorly constructed if the well casing has cracked over time or have been submerged by floodwater for long periods of time simpson 2004 sandhu et al 2018 several other factors also influence the transport of pathogens into groundwater these include climatic and environmental factors other hydrogeological factors as well as the traits or characteristics of the pathogen alegbeleye and sant ana 2020 it might be relevant to highlight that at least one potential source of bacteria into water was identified at all farms where seasonal variations were observed in the levels of culturable and indicator microorganisms for groundwater i e gw3 gw7 gw10 gw13 gw15 gw17 gw18 gw23 table 2 3 the only exception was gw14 where no potential source of bacteria was identified table 2 3 despite seasonal variations in levels of indicator bacteria in gw14 counts were generally low during rainy and dry sampling season 0 24 0 34 1 97 0 07 table 3 table 2 clostridium perfringens have been suggested as an indicator organism for non point miller pierce and rhoads 2019 and point fecal pollution vierheilig et al 2013 its occurrence in surface waters is usually linked to significant sewage inputs miller pierce and rhoads 2019 clostridium perfringens is also associated with sulphite reduction and prevalence of presumptive c perfringens in irrigation water samples from canals might be an indication that discharges of raw or poorly treated agricultural and industrial residues are impacting these water sources marcheggiani et al 2008 overall the microbiological quality of potable water groundwater and harvested rainwater was mostly better than the quality of canal farm ponds streams and rivers this finding tallies with the conclusions of other studies that surface waters e g canals rivers streams ponds and lakes are vulnerable to microbiological contamination uyttendaele et al 2015 ritter et al 2002 toro et al 2022 likewise in general compared to surface water samples minimal seasonal fluctuations were observed in the levels of detected bacteria in domestic wastewaters harvested rainwater groundwater and potable water 4 1 impact of farm features and practices particularly cattle grazing chlorination and manure management practices on levels of enterococci and e coli in irrigation water samples livestock wastes can harbor pathogens and studies have linked groundwater but surface water contamination as well to livestock operations mcallister and topp 2012 rubeck et al 2022 enterococci are usually present in human and animal fecal matter and have the capacity to persist in the environment fecal matter while described as a potential source of enterococci may not be the sole or major source since enterococci are also usually occurring in soil and plant matter boehm and sassoubre 2014 it is important for future studies to use source tracking approaches to properly characterize the source route of enterococci into the groundwater resources in the study area although chlorination is a recommended water treatment strategy shown to reduce levels of microorganisms including pathogens in water collivignarelli et al 2018 it is not common among studied farmers where 6 69 farms apply chlorination table 3 although best management practices require that manure storage areas be operated to minimize risk of runoff and seepage some of the manure handling and management practices observed in the study area may increase the risk for leaching associated pathogens to groundwater and potential overflow into proximal surface waters composting of animal manure biosolids also proven to minimize risks for water and produce contamination and recommended is not commonly applied with 3 46 farms that apply biological amendments composting their manure data not shown composting refers to when temperature cycles of stacked or piled manure are carefully monitored turned periodically to maintain optimal aeration and uniform heat distribution to all areas of the pile for recommended time period alegbeleye and sant ana 2020 rainfall may wash pathogens off from manure stockpiles into nearby irrigation sources such as farm ponds and groundwater and it is preferable that manure stockpiles are not held on farms without requisite protection 5 conclusions this study assessed the microbiological quality of irrigation water used to grow vegetables in farms around sao paulo brazil indicator bacteria were detected in the water resources used to irrigate vegetables in the studied farms the microbiological quality of irrigation water was variable based on the source with the bacteriological quality of irrigation water sourced from potable water groundwater and harvested rainwater mostly better than the quality of water samples collected from farms that utilize surface water resources canals farm ponds streams and rivers for irrigation seasonal variations were observed in the microbiological quality of irrigation water samples especially in surface water sources levels of indicator bacteria were higher during the rainy season compared to during the dry season an indication that stormwater might be transferring indicator bacteria into the water resources from point or non point sources of pollution it is necessary to explore approaches to track identify and control minimize potential sources of microorganisms into irrigation water resources based on the levels of indicator bacteria recovered from the irrigation water samples especially surface water samples during the rainy season irrigation water in the area may be a potent food safety risk it might be helpful for relevant authorities in the area to develop regulatory standards for acceptable levels of indicator bacteria in irrigation water in the area efforts to generate more extensive better coordinated monitoring data and develop microbial profiles of irrigation water used by vegetable farmers in the area is also highly desirable the output of such endeavor will contribute significantly to minimizing food safety risks in the area cattle grazing seemed to significantly influence the levels of enterococci recovered from irrigation water samples collected from farms that use groundwater for irrigation generally samples especially groundwater samples collected from farms where cattle grazing was observed contained higher levels of enterococci compared to those with no cattle grazing activity chlorination influenced the levels of e coli with water collected from farms that apply chlorination containing comparatively lower levels of e coli composting a recommended manure biosolid management strategy which differs from manure stockpiling is not commonly adopted in the study area the most commonly applied irrigation technique in the area is sprinkler irrigation while the most commonly cultivated produce is lettuce it might be useful to expertly determine suitable irrigation practices for various vegetable categories with the most important goal to be for farmers to adopt irrigation techniques that pose minimal risks for transfer of microorganisms to the edible portions of vegetables overall action such as improved farmer enlightenment engagement and accessibility to water testing and treatment provisions is required to improve the microbiological safety of irrigation water and public health protection in the area one major limitation of this study is that while fecal indicator microorganisms provide a general picture of the microbiological safety of irrigation water and irrigation systems it would be better to use advanced techniques that would indicate disease risks associated with water the use of contemporary molecular identification techniques that specifically target pathogens may be more representative another area that could be improved upon is the sample collection regime a more coordinated sample collection effort where all irrigation water samples are collected in the same month within the different seasons from all farms may provide more representative basis for comparisons and development of water and food safety risk assessment profiles overall it is very difficult to fully guarantee the microbiological safety of irrigation water but research has shown that a multiple barrier approach can efficiently minimize food safety risks associated with irrigation water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9053,irrigation water samples were collected from 69 farms in sao paulo during two rainy seasons and one dry season levels of culturable microorganisms were analyzed using direct plating technique while levels of e coli enterococci and clostridium perfringens were determined using membrane filtration agroecosystem features including the incidence of manure stockpile manure lagoon and livestock grazing amongst others were observed and recorded in the study area groundwater 33 was the most commonly exploited water resource for irrigating vegetables while the least utilized resources were potable water 4 streams 2 lakes 2 and domestic wastewater 2 other water resources exploited for irrigation in the area were farm ponds 21 harvested rainwater 15 canals 10 and rivers 5 the microbiological quality of water used to irrigate vegetables in the study area was variable depending on factors including source and treatment chlorination applied the levels of culturable microorganisms recovered from the samples ranged between 11 0 and 1 7 log cfu ml during the rainy and dry seasons respectively while the levels of e coli enterococci and clostridium perfringens detected in irrigation water samples were in the range of 0 6 0 6 5 and 0 5 8 log cfu 100 ml respectively irrigation water collected from farms that utilize surface waters such as canals and farm ponds generally contained higher levels of bacteria in general bacterial contamination varied among sources in the following order surface water groundwater municipal water levels of bacteria detected in groundwater were comparatively low and in about 60 of the cases for groundwater no seasonal fluctuation in levels was observed at the farms where seasonal fluctuations were observed for the levels

centers for disease control and prevention cdc suggested that fresh spinach implicated in a foodborne illness outbreak may have been contaminated by water gelting et al 2011 uyttendaele et al 2015 a 2018 e coli outbreak associated with romaine lettuce was linked to tainted irrigation canal water in arizona us bottichio et al 2020 in another recent outbreak linked to romaine lettuce the outbreak strain e coli o157 h7 was identified in sediment collected within an agricultural water reservoir in california during traceback investigations cdc 2019 enteric pathogens if introduced unto fresh produce may internalize into the edible portions of vegetables or otherwise persist on or within vegetables until harvest point of consumption given the right set of circumstances such as if the contaminated vegetable be consumed by vulnerable groups including the young old pregnant or immunocompromised foodborne illness may arise alegbeleye et al 2018 it is thus important to minimize the probability for microbial contamination of vegetables via irrigation water there are several approaches to minimize the potential for produce contamination via irrigation water including but not limited to routine surveillance of the levels of enteric pathogens preferably or indicator microbial groups in irrigation water such research endeavors can provide necessary knowledge about the microbiological safety of water and identify seasonal variations if any to characterize vulnerability or risks and where necessary minimize or control sources of microbial contamination it is useful to investigate potential on farm sources features structures and agricultural practices of pathogens into the irrigation resources some of the most relevant factors in this regard include identification characterization of livestock operations incidence of manure piles and sewage discharge amongst other potential sources of pathogens to water uyttendaele et al 2015 alegbeleye and sant ana 2020 such approach can provide useful information required to comprehensively understand and manage risks associated with microbiologically compromised irrigation water for instance quantitative microbial risk assessments qmras whose output can provide profound understanding of the risks associated with agricultural water require updated accurate data on a variety of inputs parameters including not only the occurrence and levels of microorganisms in irrigation water but characterization of relevant factors that can influence the magnitude of associated risks such as irrigation techniques amongst others uyttendaele et al 2015 a comprehensive summary of these factors can be seen in table s 1 2 and 3 of the review by alegbeleye and sant ana 2021 paucity of relevant data can limit the efficiency of qmras and minimize the capacity to understand and mitigate food safety risks associated with irrigation water using standard techniques this study periodically during two rainy and one dry season assessed the bacteriological quality of irrigation water samples collected from 69 farms in sao paulo brazil it also identified on farm potential sources of microorganisms into irrigation water resource s assessed prevalent irrigation techniques among farms characterized irrigated crop type and irrigation technique combinations some other pertinent risk scenarios farm management strategies such as manure treatment as well as application of water treatment chlorination amongst others 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection since studies have indicated that in the presence of suitable hydraulic precursors such as rainfall or flooding pathogens could be washed off into surface waters or leached to groundwater the sampling time for this study was designed around precipitation patterns with regards to precipitation there are two distinct seasons in sao paulo a wet humid rainy period typically between october and march and a dry comparatively cold season usually between april and august september where there is typically little or no rain irrigation water samples were collected three times during the year from 69 vegetable farms in sao paulo brazil to protect the farmers we have not specified the locations of the farms however all farms are located in various cities and neighborhoods in sao paulo the first set of samples were collected between january and march when rainfall was plentiful this sampling period is tagged rainy 1 also referred to at times as r1 the second set of samples were collected between june and august a sampling period referred to as dry presented as d the last set of samples were collected between october and december when rainfall resumed in october after a significant period of no rain this sampling period is known as rainy 2 also referred to as r2 the exact month and year when irrigation water samples were collected from the respective farms sources are shown in table s1 the irrigation water samples are labelled based on the source of the irrigation water so that each id or identifier begins with a code representing the source of the water followed by an assigned number numeral indicating the number of the farm from where the irrigation water was collected thus the irrigation water samples are labelled as follows domestic wastewater dw 1 2 canal c1 7 stream s 1 2 river rv 1 4 farm pond fp 1 15

colonies that fit the biochemical profile of e coli were recorded as presumptive e coli based on biochemical reaction batt 2014 2 3 2 enumeration of enterococci from irrigation water samples enumeration of enterococci was done according to the us environmental protection agency usepa approved method 1600 usepa 2006 the membrane filters were incubated on modified enterococcus indoxyl beta d glucoside agar mei difco in a humidified chamber at 41 for 24 h colonies with a blue halo and a diameter greater than 0 5 mm were counted as enterococci these colonies were further identified based on gram reaction catalase reaction growth at 10 and 45 and growth black colonies and aesculin hydrolysis on kanamycin aesculin azide agar neogen michigan us russo et al 2019 regardless of the type of membrane filter and dilution series tested this method could not be successfully optimized for the recovery of enterococci from domestic wastewater 2 3 3 enumeration of presumptive clostridium

enumeration of presumptive clostridium perfringens in the irrigation water samples manafi et al 2012 bailey et al 2018 membrane filters were placed on freshly prepared plates which were incubated

afterwards 5 drops of the thioglycolate culture was transferred to lactose sulphite broth biorad brasil and incubated aerobically for 24 h at 46 c colonies that conformed to the characteristics of c perfringens based on the compiled biochemical profile were counted and recorded as presumptive clostridium perfringens identified based on cultural and biochemical characterization for all microbial tests choice of culture media and incubation temperature was validated in that wherever feasible bacterial groups recovered under comparable conditions and criteria were compared and overall methods that minimized the potential to report false positives were selected all biochemical tests were done using well isolated pure fresh bacterial culture preparations in strict accordance with well established identification enumeration guidelines forsythe 2018 ferone et al 2020 all biochemical test reagents were of analytical grade and within the time of use recommended by the manufacturer despite these however there s a potential for a light underestimation as biochemically atypical isolates which could not be repeated or verified by additional or alternate phenotypic or biochemical methods were discarded in all cases 2 4 pairing irrigation techniques with cultivated produce type some types of crops are more vulnerable to pathogenic contmaination via irrigation water or during irrigation events alegbeleye and sant ana 2021 examples of such crops include those whose edible portions lie close to the soil such as lettuce those that are irrigated more frequently and those for which it might be difficult to respect the recommendation to tail off irrigation in advance before harvest to maximize the possibility for pathogen die off on field gerba 2009 erickson et al 2010 kisluk and yaron 2012 uyttendaele et al 2015 in this study these types of crops together with those that are customarily consumed raw were grouped as high risk crops table s2 the concept consumed raw refers to vegetables that may be eaten as a dish or may be used raw in salads or sandwiches and other ready to eat foods some studies reports have indicated that because sprinkler irrigation tends to introduce water directly to the edible portion of plants it may represent a more potent risk for transfer of bacterial contaminants to irrigated produce compared to drip irrigation fonseca et al 2011 pachepsky et al 2011 kisluk and yaron 2012 allende et al 2017 o flaherty et al 2019 alegbeleye and sant ana 2021 sprinkler irrigation may also lead to airborne transport of pathogens particularly during windy conditions potentially contaminating vegetables on field or even water systems hutchison et al 2008 therefore irrigation technique on each farm was matched with the kind of vegetable cultivated categorized as high risk hrv or low risk lrv carrots lettuce radish collard greens cabbage tomatoes cucumber kale bell pepper celery beetroot chard arugula spring onions endive and chives were categorized as hrv table s2 crops categorized as lrv were eggplant spinach broccoli cauliflower asparagus green beans okra and sprouts table s2 it might be useful to emphasize that food safety risks depend on various factors and any combination of production practices on different farms can significantly influence risks these pairing of irrigation system with type of produce cultivated is based on previous research findings and is not necessarily sufficiently comprehensive or indicative of risks 2 5 statistical analyses seasonal differences in the ph of the various irrigation water source types were analyzed using two way analysis of variance anova colony forming units cfu ml counted on na agar plates culturable microorganisms were converted to log and averages of duplicate counts were calculated mean standard deviation values are reported in tables and used for all graphical representations two way anova was used to assess seasonal variations in the levels of culturable microorganisms detected in all water samples threshold significance level set at p 0 05 similarly cfu 100 ml counts from membrane filtration tests were log transformed and the mean standard deviations were calculated and reported seasonal variations in the levels of indicator bacteria detected from each water source were analyzed using two way anova one way anova was used to test whether the differences among means of bacterial counts recovered from water samples collected from respective farms at r1 d and r2 differed significantly from one another graphpad prism version 9 1 for windows graphpad software san diego california usa www graphpad com and ibm spss statistical package version 25 0 were used for statistical analyses and to illustrate graphs 3 results the ph of the irrigation water samples ranged between 6 15 and 8 55 table 1 the most commonly exploited water source in the study area was groundwater 33 followed by farm ponds 21 harvested rainwater 15 canals 10 rivers 5 potable water 4 streams 2 lakes 2 and domestic wastewater 2 fig s1 3 1 levels of culturable microorganisms in irrigation water samples levels of culturable microorganisms mean values together with the standard deviation recovered from the respective irrigation sources are shown in table 2 except otherwise stated levels of culturable microorganisms reported are in log cfu ml and only counts obtained from petri dishes incubated at 36 c are reported levels of culturable microorganisms recovered from irrigation water during r1 d and r2 sampling seasons were significantly different p 0 0001 from one another levels of culturable microorganisms recovered from irrigation water samples ranged between 1 7 and 11 0 1 7 and 9 8 1 7 and 10 1 log cfu ml during r1 d and r2 respectively table 2 there were however peculiarities in counts recovered from samples relating to the source of the irrigation water for example the lowest levels of culturable microorganisms were recorded in potable water 1 7 3 3 0 069 where counts were consistently low while the highest levels were recovered from canal water samples 4 3 0 005 11 0 0 005 table 2 equally high counts were detected in farm pond samples up to 10 3

microorganisms recovered from harvested rainwater and groundwater were variable and did not specifically fit a particular trend i e levels were not consistently high nor were they consistently low table 2 for example high levels of culturable microorganisms 7 log cfu ml were recovered from some harvested rainwater irrigation sources such as hr4 hr8 hr10 and hr11 while comparatively low microbial counts were recovered from other harvested rainwater sources such as hr5 1 8 0 2 3 table 2 although levels of culturable microorganisms were generally low among groundwater samples where counts lower than 6 log cfu ml between 1 7 and 5 7 0 03 were detected in 69 of samples comparatively high levels were detected in some samples such as samples gw 13 and gw 18 where during r2 sampling season 9 5 0 001 and 9 5 0 001 was detected respectively table 2 3 2 concentrations of fecal indicator microorganisms in irrigation water from different sources during r1 d and r2 sampling season in this study levels of e coli recovered from surface water irrigation samples at r1 d and r2 differed significantly p 0 0001 from one another the levels of e coli recovered from irrigation water samples expressed as mean log cfu 100 ml are shown in table 2 except otherwise specified all e coli counts reported and discussed are presented in log cfu 100 ml levels of e coli detected in surface waters were generally high during the rainy season for example levels recovered from canal c1 7 water samples during r1 and r2 sampling seasons ranged from 4 8 to 6 0 table 2 among the four irrigation samples obtained from river sources although comparatively lower counts between 3 1 and 3 8 were recovered from rv1 and rv3 table 2 high counts were recovered from rv2 5 4 and 5 2 at r1 and r2 respectively and rv4 5 6 and 4 1 recovered during r1 and r2 respectively table 2 with a few exceptions such as fp3 where 4 7 5 2 and 4 2 log cfu 100 ml were recovered in r1 d and r2 respectively levels of e coli recovered from farm pond sources fp 1 15 were generally comparatively lower during the dry season table 2 for 9 23 of the groundwater sources including gw 1 2 4 5 6 8 9 11 and 12 there were no statistically significant differences in the means of counts recovered during r1 d and r2 sampling season according to one way anova with a few exceptions 7 23 including gw 13 15 18 19 20 22 and 23 e coli counts enumerated from groundwater samples during r1 and r2 sampling season were 4 log cfu 100 ml table 2 a similar trend was observed with levels of enterococci where levels recovered from canals rivers and streams were generally low during the dry season table 2 among canals c1 c7 counts ranged between 1 4 0 03 and 2 0 0 006 with the only exception being c5 where counts of 3 3 log cfu 100 ml were recovered during the dry season manure stockpile manure lagoon and livestock production were identified at the farm where sample c5 was collected table 3 among rivers rv1 4 rv3 where 3 6 0 02 was obtained is the only source where counts exceeded 1 9 log cfu 100 ml during the dry season table 2 this finding might be an indication of a point source of enterococci into this water source features and practices including the presence of biosolid stockpile manure application and proximity to a wwtp were identified at the farm table 3 low counts of enterococci were recovered from stream water samples collected during the dry season 2 0 0 01 s1 and 1 4 0 03 s2 relatively high counts 4 8 0 05 and 5 0 0 06 were recovered from s2 during r1 and r2 sampling season table 2 among

for example gw10 15 19 20 22 and 23 relatively high counts 4 log cfu 100 ml were recovered from water samples during the dry season table 2 specific farm features and practices identified at respective farms are presented in table 3 manure stockpile was observed near growing fields in 37 26 69 of vegetable farms surveyed while 66 of the farms apply manure biosolids table 3 animal rearing livestock production 33 as well as livestock or cattle grazing 23 were also fairly common table 3 of the 69 farms surveyed 8 i e 6 69 apply water treatment table 3 all six farms that treat the water apply chlorination at least once a year fig s2 of the 46 farms that apply manure biosolid or some other biological amendment 4 3 46 compost the manure data not shown sprinkler drip flood furrow and microsprinkler irrigation techniques are the commonly used techniques for irrigating vegetables in the study area fig 1a of these sprinkler irrigation was the commonest irrigation technique used in the study area 64 while lettuce is the most commonly cultivated produce in the studied farms fig 1b among these farms 58 irrigate high risk crops with sprinkler technique fig 2 which might be an indication of produce safety risks park et al 2016 3 3 impact of farm features and practices on levels of e coli and enterococci in irrigation water samples 3 3 1 it is apparent that cattle grazing influences levels of enterococci recovered from groundwater samples in the study area levels of enterococci were high up to 6 5 cfu 100 ml for gw 15 r1 especially in some groundwater irrigation water samples collected from farms where cattle grazing was recorded in fig 3a the disparities in levels of enterococci recovered from farms groundwater sources where cattle grazing was observed compared to those without cattle grazing activity can be seen levels of enterococci recovered from all samples may be seen in fig s3 3 3 2 impact of chlorination on levels of e coli detected in irrigation water samples comparatively low e coli counts were recovered from irrigation water samples collected from farms that apply chlorination gw2 0 2 0 1 0 4 0 1 s1 1 4 0 04 3 1 0 04 gw3 1 0 0 004 2 2 0 05 fp6 2 6 0 01 2 8 0 01 and gw8 0 2 0 2 0 3 table 2 fig 3b these results indicate and buttress the notion that chlorination has an impact on concentrations of e coli in water 4 discussions levels of culturable microorganisms provide useful information regarding the overall microbiological quality of water cabral 2010 rodrigues and cunha 2017 they provide a general indication of the integrity and cleanliness of the distribution system as well as efficiency of the treatment applied where relevant levels of culturable microorganisms might also be used to assess the safety and suitability of irrigation supplies as the risks for contaminating plant produce with microorganisms such as spoilage organisms is generally higher where the water supply contains a high load of microorganisms levels of culturable microorganisms as high as 11 and 10 4 log cfu ml recovered from c4 and c7 respectively table 1 might be an indication that the irrigation water could potentially be a source of spoilage bacteria to irrigated produce although recovery of indicator bacteria may not always be an indication that human pathogens or fecal contamination is occurring in water systems they particularly e coli are still used to assess the overall microbiological safety or to predict microbiological hazards for water systems microorganisms can be washed into surface waters via several sources and pathways including storm water runoff runoff from manure storage areas rangelands pastures and feedlots other agricultural waste as well as domestic and wildlife waste pachepsky et al 2011 buckerfield et al 2019 some of these potential sources of water contamination were identified at some of the studied farms table 3 these routes of contamination may be particularly relevant for farm ponds as the earthen ponds are dug on the farm and are near these sources of input where relevant fig s3 increasing the risks for overflow into the ponds via rainfall or other water conveyor other sources include leaking or otherwise malfunctioning septic systems sewage discharged or dumped from other sources such as recreational boats wastewater treatment plant effluents and so on can also introduce pathogens into water resources alegbeleye et al 2016 tornevi et al 2014 elisante and muzuka 2016 acute or occasional source water contamination due for example to failures in water treatment processes operations or acute wastewater discharge events upstream is also possible owens et al 2020 high levels of culturable microorganisms and indicator bacteria recorded in canals and river water samples particularly during the rainy season could probably be attributed to acute source water contamination but may also be due to stormwater carryover cabral 2010 bacteria may also be leached into surface waters via natural non anthropogenic sources including soil sediments plants and sand jung et al 2014 givens et al 2016 alegbeleye et al 2018 these sources may contribute to a certain background level in ambient waters but the extent to which these factors influence the bacteriological quality of water vary depending on local environmental and meteorological conditions generally rainwater is usually of relatively good microbiological quality although its endpoint safety depends on factors such as collection storage and distribution systems this consideration impact of piping and other holding or distribution systems on microbiological quality of irrigation water at point of use holds true for irrigation water regardless of the source each irrigation subsystem collection storage distribution and on farm application involve processes that can potentially compromise the microbiological integrity of the irrigation water alegbeleye et al 2018 rainwater may become contaminated with microorganisms through animal droppings on roofs or other water collection materials equipment for instance brids reptiles and other animal fecal matter may introduce pathogens into roof harvested rainwater especially after long periods of drought ahmed et al 2010 hamilton et al 2019 bird proofing roofs is a strategy that could minimize contamination via this route however as far as we know none of the studied farms had bird proofing systems installed by the time the study was conducted groundwater is generally considered microbiologically safe however bacterial pathogens may reach groundwater resources through different pathways including sewage overflows polluted storm water runoff and agricultural runoff well water sources located too close to flood zones animal agricultural rearing areas manure storage sites cesspools septic tanks and drainage fields are more prone to pathogenic contamination oecd and organization 2003 akoachere et al 2013 such wells may be more vulnerable to contamination after flooding particularly if the wells are shallow or otherwise poorly constructed if the well casing has cracked over time or have been submerged by floodwater for long periods of time simpson 2004 sandhu et al 2018 several other factors also influence the transport of pathogens into groundwater these include climatic and environmental factors other hydrogeological factors as well as the traits or characteristics of the pathogen alegbeleye and sant ana 2020 it might be relevant to highlight that at least one potential source of bacteria into water was identified at all farms where seasonal variations were observed in the levels of culturable and indicator microorganisms for groundwater i e gw3 gw7 gw10 gw13 gw15 gw17 gw18 gw23 table 2 3 the only exception was gw14 where no potential source of bacteria was identified table 2 3 despite seasonal variations in levels of indicator bacteria in gw14 counts were generally low during rainy and dry sampling season 0 24 0 34 1 97 0 07 table 3 table 2 clostridium perfringens have been suggested as an indicator organism for non point miller pierce and rhoads 2019 and point fecal pollution vierheilig et al 2013 its occurrence in surface waters is usually linked to significant sewage inputs miller pierce and rhoads 2019 clostridium perfringens is also associated with sulphite reduction and prevalence of presumptive c perfringens in irrigation water samples from canals might be an indication that discharges of raw or poorly treated agricultural and industrial residues are impacting these water sources marcheggiani et al 2008 overall the microbiological quality of potable water groundwater and harvested rainwater was mostly better than the quality of canal farm ponds streams and rivers this finding tallies with the conclusions of other studies that surface waters e g canals rivers streams ponds and lakes are vulnerable to microbiological contamination uyttendaele et al 2015 ritter et al 2002 toro et al 2022 likewise in general compared to surface water samples minimal seasonal fluctuations were observed in the levels of detected bacteria in domestic wastewaters harvested rainwater groundwater and potable water 4 1 impact of farm features and practices particularly cattle grazing chlorination and manure management practices on levels of enterococci and e coli in irrigation water samples livestock wastes can harbor pathogens and studies have linked groundwater but surface water contamination as well to livestock operations mcallister and topp 2012 rubeck et al 2022 enterococci are usually present in human and animal fecal matter and have the capacity to persist in the environment fecal matter while described as a potential source of enterococci may not be the sole or major source since enterococci are also usually occurring in soil and plant matter boehm and sassoubre 2014 it is important for future studies to use source tracking approaches to properly characterize the source route of enterococci into the groundwater resources in the study area although chlorination is a recommended water treatment strategy shown to reduce levels of microorganisms including pathogens in water collivignarelli et al 2018 it is not common among studied farmers where 6 69 farms apply chlorination table 3 although best management practices require that manure storage areas be operated to minimize risk of runoff and seepage some of the manure handling and management practices observed in the study area may increase the risk for leaching associated pathogens to groundwater and potential overflow into proximal surface waters composting of animal manure biosolids also proven to minimize risks for water and produce contamination and recommended is not commonly applied with 3 46 farms that apply biological amendments composting their manure data not shown composting refers to when temperature cycles of stacked or piled manure are carefully monitored turned periodically to maintain optimal aeration and uniform heat distribution to all areas of the pile for recommended time period alegbeleye and sant ana 2020 rainfall may wash pathogens off from manure stockpiles into nearby irrigation sources such as farm ponds and groundwater and it is preferable that manure stockpiles are not held on farms without requisite protection 5 conclusions this study assessed the microbiological quality of irrigation water used to grow vegetables in farms around sao paulo brazil indicator bacteria were detected in the water resources used to irrigate vegetables in the studied farms the microbiological quality of irrigation water was variable based on the source with the bacteriological quality of irrigation water sourced from potable water groundwater and harvested rainwater mostly better than the quality of water samples collected from farms that utilize surface water resources canals farm ponds streams and rivers for irrigation seasonal variations were observed in the microbiological quality of irrigation water samples especially in surface water sources levels of indicator bacteria were higher during the rainy season compared to during the dry season an indication that stormwater might be transferring indicator bacteria into the water resources from point or non point sources of pollution it is necessary to explore approaches to track identify and control minimize potential sources of microorganisms into irrigation water resources based on the levels of indicator bacteria recovered from the irrigation water samples especially surface water samples during the rainy season irrigation water in the area may be a potent food safety risk it might be helpful for relevant authorities in the area to develop regulatory standards for acceptable levels of indicator bacteria in irrigation water in the area efforts to generate more extensive better coordinated monitoring data and develop microbial profiles of irrigation water used by vegetable farmers in the area is also highly desirable the output of such endeavor will contribute significantly to minimizing food safety risks in the area cattle grazing seemed to significantly influence the levels of enterococci recovered from irrigation water samples collected from farms that use groundwater for irrigation generally samples especially groundwater samples collected from farms where cattle grazing was observed contained higher levels of enterococci compared to those with no cattle grazing activity chlorination influenced the levels of e coli with water collected from farms that apply chlorination containing comparatively lower levels of e coli composting a recommended manure biosolid management strategy which differs from manure stockpiling is not commonly adopted in the study area the most commonly applied irrigation technique in the area is sprinkler irrigation while the most commonly cultivated produce is lettuce it might be useful to expertly determine suitable irrigation practices for various vegetable categories with the most important goal to be for farmers to adopt irrigation techniques that pose minimal risks for transfer of microorganisms to the edible portions of vegetables overall action such as improved farmer enlightenment engagement and accessibility to water testing and treatment provisions is required to improve the microbiological safety of irrigation water and public health protection in the area one major limitation of this study is that while fecal indicator microorganisms provide a general picture of the microbiological safety of irrigation water and irrigation systems it would be better to use advanced techniques that would indicate disease risks associated with water the use of contemporary molecular identification techniques that specifically target pathogens may be more representative another area that could be improved upon is the sample collection regime a more coordinated sample collection effort where all irrigation water samples are collected in the same month within the different seasons from all farms may provide more representative basis for comparisons and development of water and food safety risk assessment profiles overall it is very difficult to fully guarantee the microbiological safety of irrigation water but research has shown that a multiple barrier approach can efficiently minimize food safety risks associated with irrigation water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

of yield stability changes in soil water storage δsws nitrogen n budget soil total nitrogen tn content and soil organic carbon soc content to furrow ridge tillage and film or straw field mulching practices in a 6 year field experiment of rain fed spring maize zea mays l on the loess plateau from 2016 to 2021 five tillage practices included conventional tillage ct ridge tillage rt flat planting

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the increasing population of the world food security is still our focus currently 51 5 of the world s arable land is semi arid gaur and squires 2018 therefore semi arid agriculture plays a vital role in ensuring food security drought periodic rainfall shortage high evaporation and nitrogen n deficiency limit drylands productivity of rain fed farming systems in semi arid areas zhang et al 2022a even worse conventional flat cultivation tillage practice has long lasting negative legacies such as poor water and n conservation decreased soil quality etc which in turn affect the production sustainability jing et al 2022 schärer et al 2022 therefore enhancing drylands productivity by conservation tillage practices represents an essential option for achieving sustainable agriculture development stewart and lal 2018 numerous conservation tillage practices have been developed to alleviate water deficits and losses increase n use and improve crop productivity in semiarid regions some examples include plastic mulch crop residue retention and implementation of ridge tillage farming systems akhtar et al 2018 gu et al 2018 2020 zhao et al 2019 field mulching systems such as plastic film mulching and straw mulching etc effectively reduce soil water evaporation and increase soil water content ren et al 2021 wang et al 2022 ridge tillage to some extent improves soil structure coordinates the three phase ratio of soil and improves field microclimate ren et al 2016 moreover mulching combined with ridge and furrow tillage can collect more rainwater and reduce soil water loss xu et al 2018 li et al 2021a additionally mulching systems are considered effective conservation tillage to regulate soil temperature amplitude and promote mineralization qin et al 2019 these improvements in soil micro environment improve crop productivity and water use efficiency xiao et al 2019 luo et al 2020 nitrogen is essential for increasing grain yield water use efficiency and ensuring soil quality qiao et al 2022 to date grain yield water and n use efficiency etc have been fully explored with field mulching while its effect on agriculture sustainability has not been systematically investigated quantifying yield sustainability water and n balance and soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen tn content during long term of field mulching is helpful for further understanding of the improvements agriculture sustainability in response to mulching dong et al 2018 doltra et al 2019 qaswar et al 2020 tahir et al 2021 li et al 2022 however there is no consensus on the sustainability of agriculture in filed mulching systems qin et al 2015 niu et al 2020 and qin et al 2021 reported that mulching systems were widely recognized strategy for improving crop yield and yield stability however chae et al 2022 pointed out plastic film mulching negatively affected on yield and yield stability in the long term application wang et al 2022 also reported that under high air temperature and high soil moisture condition straw mulching increased fusarium head blight root stalk and ear rot and long term straw mulch increased the probability of maize disease which negatively affected crop yield and stability additionally ridge tillage significantly increases evaporation owing to ridge increase the surface area of the soil which negatively affects water balance zhang et al 2021a moreover zhang et al 2020 reported that although high film coverage increased soil water content in topsoil it also increased crop water consumption which was not conductive to maintaining soil water balance previous study reported that field mulching was an effective agriculture management to increase tn and soc mo et al 2020 in contrast li et al 2019 and ma et al 2021 considered filed mulching increased soil tn consumption and accelerated decomposition of soc hence these inconsistent results have led to increasing concern about the agriculture sustainability following long term field mulching steinmetz et al 2016 agriculture in semi arid regions plays an important role in global food security recently numerous studies on the effects of field mulching on yield water and nitrogen utilization on the semi arid areas have been investigated but lack of systematic studies on agricultural sustainability under long term field mulching we hypothesized that in semi arid regions under partial plastic film mulching condition i the reduced evaporation from plastic film mulching compensates for the increased transpiration thus plastic film mulching has no significant influence on total water consumption compared with no mulching practice meanwhile the rainwater in fallow season and rainy year could replenish for the enhanced consumption of soil water by film mulching in normal growing or dry seasons ensuring positive water balance in long term practice ii n fertilizer input and straw return etc could replenish for the high n consumption under film mulching and straw treatment so as to ensure the n balance iii higher root biomass in plastic film and straw mulching could replenish soil tn and soc loss during field mulching accordingly the mulching practices could enhance the agricultural sustainability in rain fed farming system therefore the present study aims were 1 quantify the water balance and n budget of agricultural ecosystems 2 examine the dynamics of soc and tn across consecutive years of field trials 3 assess the yield stability and variability of furrow ridge tillage plastic film mulching and maize straw mulching practices the current study contributed substantially in filling the knowledge gap about the agricultural sustainability under long time usage of different mulching and tillage systems for ensuring food supply in arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and materials a 6 year field experiment was conducted during the maize growing

the tillage systems investigated were conventional tillage ct ridge tillage rt partial plastic mulching with conventional flat cultivation fm ridge tillage with plastic film mulching on ridge rtf and maize straw mulching sm sm treatment was analyzed since 2017 and other treatments were analyzed since 2016 in combination with the tillage systems two n application rates 0 and 225 kg n ha 1 were used providing a total of 10 treatments each with three replicates consequently the experiment comprised a total of 30 plots each with an area of 6 m 5 m tillage treatments and n application rates were assigned to the main plot and subplot respectively fig 2 before sowing the plots were ploughed using a rotary cultivator to a depth of 40 cm in the fm plots both the film widths and row widths were 55 cm in the rt and rtf plots the ridges were 15 cm in height and the ridge and planted row widths were both 55 cm in the rtf plots the ridges were mulched with plastic film each sm plot was mulched with maize straws 3 5 cm in length at a rate of 5000 kg ha 1 fig 1 there were eight plant rows in each plot and the plant distance was 25 cm therefore the plant density was 65 000 plants ha 1 urea 46 4 n was used as the n fertilizer calcium superphosphate 16 p2o5 was used as the p fertilizer and potassium chloride 60 k2o was used as k fertilizer plastic film was made of transparent polyethylene 0 001

fertilization in all treatments the nitrogen fertilizer was applied at 225 kg n ha 1 in the n225 treatments with two fifths applied as basal fertilization and three fifths applied as topdressing at the trumpet stage v12 base and side dress fertilizers were applied by deep band application to a depth of 15 cm away from planting row evenly in ct and sm treatments fig 1 straw mulching has a significant soil cooling effect and low soil temperature may extend the emergence period of crops qin et al 2015 thus straw mulching was conducted in 3rd leaves stage in every season ridging plastic film mulching was conducted on basal fertilization deep bands the side dress fertilizer was deep band applied in furrow in rt or rtf treatments and it was deep band applied in no film mulching area in fm treatment the all fertilization bands were 10 15 cm away from planting row 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 yield measurements at maturity three subplots with an area of 5 m 2 were selected within each treatment plot and all the ears in each subplot were collected dried and threshed subsamples approximately 100 g of the air dried grains were dried at 75 c to a constant weight which was recorded zheng et al 2022 the grain yield was adjusted to 14 moisture the evaluation indexes of the yield stability and sustainability were calculated as follows qaswar et al 2020 li et al 2022 1

diameter soil probe jc 802b qingdao juchuang environmental co ltd qingdao china three soil profiles samples were collected in each plot and mixed to form one composite sample in ct and sm treatments six soil profiles samples were collected in each plot and mixed to form one composite sample in fm rt and rtf treatments three soil samples were from inside the mulch or on the middle of ridge and three soil samples were from outside the mulch or in furrow zhang et al 2022a composite sample were weighed dried to constant weight at 105 c and then weighed again to determine the soil water content gravimetric water content the soil water storage profile from 0 to 200 cm was calculated by multiplying the soil profile depth by the gravimetric water content and soil bulk density at that depth hou et al 2012 soil water storage change δsws and evapotranspiration et was calculated as follows bai et al 2022 4 δsws mm sws 2 sws 1 5 et mm i p u r d δsws where sws 1 and sws 2 are soil water storage

surface mm u is the water flux from deep soil layers mm d is the deep percolation mm in this experiment u was negligible owing to stable moisture below the 200 cm soil profile unpublished data it was also to be negligible according to zhang et al 2022b r was also omitted because of the relatively flat field terrain there was no irrigation therefore i equalled to zero in addition due to the low rainfall and the texture of the investigated soil it will not cause d at depths exceeding 200 cm bai et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b therefore the final equation of et was calculated as follows bai et al

plants having average height for their plot from the middle rows the shovelomics method was used for root trait measurements trachsel et al 2011 briefly stated as follow roots were sampled from each plot by extracting them from a total soil volume of 40 cm length 25 cm width 100 cm depth with seven separated soil layers 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm the volume of each soil cuboid was 20 cm length 12 5 cm width 20 cm depth except for top 2 ones which was 20 cm length 12 5 cm width 10 cm depth the maize roots were cleaned by gently with flowing water to remove the attached soil before measuring dry weight finally the root samples were dried at 75 for a stable root dry weight fig s1 2 3 4 nitrogen analysis and the nitrogen budget ten plants were sampled from each plot for n quantification at maturity the samples were divided into leaves stems tassels bracts cobs and grains thereafter the samples were dried to a constant weight in a fan oven at 75 the dried samples were ground sieved 0 25 mm sieve and digested with concentrated sulfuric acid h2so4 98 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and the n content was measured using a flow analyser seal aa3 bran

profile and n loss in runoff according to the measurement of our colleagues the annual nitrogen oxide emission was 2 3 kg ha 1 which has insignificant impact on the n balance and can be ignored n leaching from profile and n loss in runoff were assumed to be negligible because of the flat and deep soil layer 2 3 5 soil organic carbon and total nitrogen analysis soil samples were collected from the 0 20 cm soil layer at the harvest time five soil cores each 50 mm in diameter were excavated randomly and mixed to form one composite sample in each plot of ct and sm ten ones were excavated randomly in each plot of fm rt and rtf treatments respectively and mixed to form one composite sample in each plot five soil samples were from inside the mulch or on ridge and five soil samples were from outside the mulch or in furrow all fresh samples were air dried and sieved through a 0 25 mm sieve to determine soc and tn soc was determined using the dichromate oxidation method yang et al 2011 and tn was determined using the kjeldahl method zhang et al 2021b 2 4 statistical analyses the experimental data were analyzed using anova statistical analyses were performed using the sas 9 1 statistical package significance differences were accepted at p 0 05 means were compared using the least significant difference lsd test graphs were prepared using originpro 2015 software 3 results 3 1 yield yield sustainability index and coefficient of variation the significant difference p 0 05 in yield between different tillage patterns are shown in fig 3 in unfertilized treatments maize grain yield in ct varied from 1478 to 5971 kg ha 1 while it was 990 7956 2234 8543 2304 7926 1149 4807 kg ha 1 in rt fm rtf and sm treatment respectively the highest yield was observed in the plastic film mulching fm and rtf and the mean yield was 26 8 and 57 7 higher than that of the ct treatment 3582 kg ha 1 however the mean yield of sm was reduced by 36 0 compared with that of ct treatment statistical analysis revealed significant effect of n fertilization on grain yield p 0 05 maize grain yield ranged from 4400 to 9320 5091 9947 8138 15197 9132 13680 and 5894 14842 kg ha 1 in ct rt fm rtf and sm respectively under n fertilized treatments maize grain yield was maximized under plastic film mulching with 65 0 and 73 4 increase respectively in comparison with that of ct yield sustainability index syi and coefficient of variation cv were significantly affected by tillage pattern and n application p 0 05 fig 4 plastic film mulching obviously increased syi and reduced cv in both n fertilized and unfertilized treatments with 4 4 13 9 increment and 0 7 10 7 decline respectively in contrast with those of ct however syi showed negative response to sm with decrease of 2 8 3 9 than the ct in comparison syi and cv response of rt varied with n fertilization ridge tillage notably augmented syi by 7 8 and declined cv by 3 2 compared with ct under n application syi decreased by 9 1 and cv increased by 9 5 of rt in comparison with those of ct in the absence of n application 3 2 water use potential wup and changes in soil water storage δsws tillage and n had obvious effect on evaporation and transpiration in no n fertilized treatments evaporation was the main component of et the n application reduced evaporation and increased transpiration p 0 05 the seasonal transpiration of ct was 173 6 mm accounting for 41 9 of et whereas that of plastic film mulching was 233 2 mm accounting 56 3 of et straw mulching could also enhance transpiration but its effect was inferior to plastic film mulching fig 5 additionally the present study showed that the evaporation decline offset the transpiration increment under plastic film mulching which resulted in no significant difference p 0 05 in et between plastic film mulching and ct fig 5 and table 1 water use potential in all tillage patterns varied significantly between n fertilized and unfertilized treatments table 1 the average wup of all tillage patterns ranged between 88 3 91 4 in the absence of n application during six text years with highest wup in fm the wup showed positive response to n application for example the wup of all tillage patterns ranged from 100 4 to 111 2 in 2016 and 2017 table 1 nevertheless the average wup of all tillage patterns in fertilized plots was less than 100 over the six testing years but higher by 7 0 on average than the unfertilized plots across the six years test results tillage patterns and n application significantly affected δsws table 1 the present study showed that the δsws of most tillage patterns were positive in the absence of n application with 49 0 41 5 36 3 44 4 and 50 3 mm under ct rt fm rtf and sm respectively conversely n application negatively affected δsws the δsws was 23 5 30 7 38 9 and 42 0 mm under ct rt fm and rtf respectively a similar result was obtained in 2017 notably the average δsws was positive in six test years with 20 8 19 7 15 3 13 1 and 16 1 mm under ct rt fm rtf and sm respectively table 1 3 3 n budget tillage patterns and n fertilizer application significantly affected nb p 0 05 the average nb values of all tillage patterns were negative in no n fertilizer condition with 20 9 22 3 31 1 27 7 and 5 3 kg ha 1 under ct rt fm rtf and sm respectively table 2 whereas nb was obviously enhanced with n fertilized wherein the positive average nb of all tillage patterns were found with 117 9 108 6 57 6 74 9 and 94 6 kg ha 1 in ct rt fm rtf and sm respectively 3 4 soil total nitrogen the tn content of sm increased yearly regardless of n application or not fig 5 the soil tn content of sm at harvest in 2021 reflected significant 27 1 29 8 increase relative to that of 2017 fig 6 in contrast the soil tn content of plastic film mulching practice exhibited negligible variation during six years test it should be noted that mulching practices were advantageous to improve tn content with 1 7 29 8 increase compared to ct additionally all tn data in the n225 treatments were higher than those for the corresponding n0 treatments fig 6 3 5 soil organic carbon similar to the results of tn content irrespective of fertilization application the soc content of sm significantly increased yearly fig 7 the soc content of sm at harvest in 2021 increased 22 3 33 3 markedly compared with that of 2017 fig 7 in comparison the plastic film mulching had negligible effects on the soc content it was worth noting that field mulching especially straw mulching enhanced soc content with 2 6 40 3 increment relative to that of ct additionally the present study showed that all soc content associated with the n225 treatments were higher than those for the corresponding n0 treatments 4 discussion the present works confirmed our hypothesises and field mulching could not lead to the soil water imbalance and soil n and c exhaust in the successive field mulching practices with suitable n input and straw residues retention in soil therefore it could conserve agricultural production sustainable in the rain fed farming 4 1 grain yield for sustainability in food supply to the whole world and especially in china innovative tillage practices such as plastic or straw mulching ridge tillage etc have accounted a significant contribution thidar et al 2020 chai et al 2022 previous study has showed that plastic film mulching may have negative effects in the long term application not only decreasing yield and yield stability but also deteriorating soil quality chae et al 2022 however zheng et al 2022 reported plastic film mulching increased yield and decreased cv of yield similar results were obtained by this study the current study showed that regardless of n fertilizer application the plastic film mulching practices significantly increased yield and syi and decreased cv in contrast with those of ct fig 3 and fig 4 higher and more stable grain yields obtained under plastic film mulching practices are partly resulted from maintaining suitable moisture content in the soil layers zhang et al 2019 dai et al 2021 in addition favourable soil micro environment under plastic film mulching practice enhances organic carbon mineralization and stable soil nutrient supply and thus also contribute to improving grain yield li et al 2018 the effect of straw mulching on yield is complex qin et al 2022 when straw decomposes in soil it competes with crops for available n moreover a large amount of straw returned to the field intensifies this competition reducing crop yield wang et al 2018 moreover under high temperature and moisture conditions the stalk and root rots under straw mulching restricted crop nutrient uptake and growth wang et al 2020 thus negatively affected grain yield and yield stability which was consistent with the results reported by zheng et al 2022 additionally qin et al 2015 reported sm had a significant soil cooling effect and low soil temperature may extend the emergence period of crops in order to avoid the poor emergence owing to lower soil temperature caused by straw mulching we mulched the field with straws in 3rd leaf stage the current study showed that straw mulching reduced yield and increased cv in no n fertilization however n input could mitigated it compared with the field mulching practices fm rtf and sm it appeared that rt alone could not effectively increase grain yield this might be due to the limited capacity of this tillage system to collect and utilize moisture from precipitation 4 2 water use potential and changes in soil water storage recently models measurement and sap ﬂow measurement are main methods for determining transpiration fang et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 in this study the transpiration ratio of non mulching was 41 9 which agrees well with the result of 42 0 reported by chen et al 2019 however maize transpiration of plastic film mulching varies among diverse ways of measurement the transpiration ratio of plastic film mulching was 56 3 in our result which was slightly lower or similar to previously published values of 52 4 73 2 determined by sap ﬂow measurement zheng et al 2021 whereas it was much lower than the values 75 0 84 3 measured by models chen et al 2019 fang et al 2021 the results of the models are highly influenced by some factors such as meteorological variables soil water content and crop parameters jiang et al 2016 tu et al 2019 leaf area index is an important crop parameter affecting transpiration ratio and the transpiration ratio obviously enhance with leaf area index increase zheng et al 2021 the maximum leaf area index in our results 3 46 4 75 m2m 2 was lower than those reported 5 0 7 5 m2m 2 zheng et al 2021 due to low planting density 65000 plant ha 1 if the planting density increased to those reported 75000 98000 plant ha 1 chen et al 2019 fang et al 2021 the transpiration rate in our results would increase to 60 5 88 9 zhang et al 2021 reported that in arid or semi arid areas the et of plastic film mulching during the entire growing season increased or decreased compared with non mulching depending on the relationship between the effect size of reduced evaporation and the effect size of increased transpiration the present study showed that evaporation reduction in the plastic film mulching compensated for the transpiration increase fig 5 so that the seasonal et had no significant difference compared with non mulching treatment agreeing well with the findings of gong et al 2017 rainfall is the only source of water input in rain fed agricultural areas therefore increasing precipitation use via innovative agricultural management such as tillage patterns etc is essential for crop growth and yield formation in the current study plastic film mulching effectively increased wup especially in n fertilized treatment which was consistent with the result of chen et al 2022 the wup in all tillage patterns exceeded 100 during 2016 2017 indicated original soil water was consumed by maize nevertheless the total wup was less than 100 across the tested periods in both n fertilized and unfertilized treatments indicated that the present practices would not lead to diminishing soil storage water in long term perspective maintaining a positive δsws is a necessary strategy for dryland agriculture sustainability zhang et al 2022c li et al 2021 suggested that evapotranspiration positively affected the soil water storage in a long term field experiment long term experimental data showed that the partial film mulching practices used in this experiment resulted in a positive δsws during the 6 test years although there were negative δsws in 2016 and 2017 table 1 firstly the depletion of original soil water caused by field mulching could be replenished by the rainfall in fallow season li et al 2019 moreover the wup during 2018 2021 were only 80 90 table 1 indicating rainfall during 2018 2021 could replenish the excessive water consumption in 2016 and 2017 comparatively although full film mulching improved soil water content in the topsoil better than partial mulching it typically led to reduced soil water storage due to its higher water consumption caused by rapid growth and development of maize at high soil temperatures hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 additionally the partial film mulching is popular in local practices although it is not as effective as the full mulching on the mitigation of soil evaporation it is beneficial for rainfall infiltration which suits to practice in the higher precipitation areas such as south and southeast of the loess plateau or similar areas 4 3 n budget and total nitrogen high yield is partly dependent on high n consumption li et al 2019 2021b which adheres a risk of soil n depletion especially under unfertilized treatments negative n budget in all tillage practices were found without n application in the present study especially under plastic film mulching practice table 2 indicated plastic film mulching practice could accelerate original n exhaustion ma et al 2021 straw mulching mitigates soil n storage consumption owing to its low n output and additional n input from straw residues zhang et al 2017b nitrogen fertilizers play an important role in increasing crop yield and ensuring soil quality qiao et al 2022 the present study showed the nb was positive in n225 treatments which indicated n fertilizer input compensated for the high n consumption and loss tn is an important latent indicator of soil fertility and the current study reported a significant increase in soil tn under sm treatment fig 5 crop residue retention increases tn stocks owing to its positive effects on soil aggregate formation and stabilization which physically protecting soil n from microorganism mineralization balesdent et al 2000 zhang et al 2015 ma et al 2021 reported that long term plastic film mulching resulted in soil tn content reduction however negligible tn change in plastic film mulching practice was found during 2016 2021 and compared with ct it increased soil tn an increase in the soil n fixing bacteria population and activity under plastic film mulching could lead to an increase in n fixation yang et al 2021 furthermore plastic film mulching prohibited n leaching and made more fertilizer nitrogen residual in the top soil chen et al 2020 4 4 soil organic carbon changes in soc stocks are the net result of outputs and inputs within the belowground environment generally straw and root production are an important source of soc maintaining soc through the replenishment of root c inputs is a promising strategy for any sustainable agricultural technology zhang et al 2017b the soc content under sm increased yearly in our study fig 7 indicating that straw retention was better option for improving soc content which was consistent with chen et al 2018 and dong et al 2018 in contrast the effect of plastic film mulching on soc content is controversial lee et al 2019 indicated that improvements in soil moisture and temperature regimes by plastic film mulching are favourable for biological activity and increase the mineralization of soc and consume the original soc stock however the present study showed that soc stocks were stable and higher under continuous partial plastic film mulching than those under ct fig 7 plastic film mulching substantially increased plant biomass especially for root biomass fig s1 and therefore increased precursor of soc which agrees well with findings of mo et al 2020 in contrast in arid agricultural areas the full film mulching has better hydrothermal conditions than the partial film mulching thus accelerating the mineralization of soc liu et al 2014 however in the present study rt tended to reduce soc and tn which might be related to an increase in mineralization owing to soil disturbance during the creation of furrows and ridges 5 conclusions the results presented in this study validated our hypothesis compared with ct the plastic film mulching significantly increased maize yield and maintained yield stability plastic film mulching had no significant influence on total water consumption compared with no mulching practice additionally plastic film mulching could achieve positive δsws and maintained the stability of soc and tn hence plastic film mulching was an effective option for sustainable rain fed farming practice in semi arid areas however attention should be paid to the impact of microplastic contamination in future research straw mulching increased soc and tn content however higher variation of yield should be mitigated via n rational fertilization and pathogen controlling the small yield increase and low yield stability occurred in rt practice additionally the soc declined similar to ct declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the increasing population of the world food security is still our focus currently 51 5 of the world s arable land is semi arid gaur and squires 2018 therefore semi arid agriculture plays a vital role in ensuring food security drought periodic rainfall shortage high evaporation and nitrogen n deficiency limit drylands productivity of rain fed farming systems in semi arid areas zhang et al 2022a even worse conventional flat cultivation tillage practice has long lasting negative legacies such as poor water and n conservation decreased soil quality etc which in turn affect the production sustainability jing et al 2022 schärer et al 2022 therefore enhancing drylands productivity by conservation tillage practices represents an essential option for achieving sustainable agriculture development stewart and lal 2018 numerous conservation tillage practices have been developed to alleviate water deficits and losses increase n use and improve crop productivity in semiarid regions some examples include plastic mulch crop residue retention and implementation of ridge tillage farming systems akhtar et al 2018 gu et al 2018 2020 zhao et al 2019 field mulching systems such as plastic film mulching and straw mulching etc effectively reduce soil water evaporation and increase soil water content ren et al 2021 wang et al 2022 ridge tillage to some extent improves soil structure coordinates the three phase ratio of soil and improves field microclimate ren et al 2016 moreover mulching combined with ridge and furrow tillage can collect more rainwater and reduce soil water loss xu et al 2018 li et al 2021a additionally mulching systems are considered effective conservation tillage to regulate soil temperature amplitude and promote mineralization qin et al 2019 these improvements in soil micro environment improve crop productivity and water use efficiency xiao et al 2019 luo et al 2020 nitrogen is essential for increasing grain yield water use efficiency and ensuring soil quality qiao et al 2022 to date grain yield water and n use efficiency etc have been fully explored with field mulching while its effect on agriculture sustainability has not been systematically investigated quantifying yield sustainability water and n balance and soil organic carbon soc and total nitrogen tn content during long term of field mulching is helpful for further understanding of the improvements agriculture sustainability in response to mulching dong et al 2018 doltra et al 2019 qaswar et al 2020 tahir et al 2021 li et al 2022 however there is no consensus on the sustainability of agriculture in filed mulching systems qin et al 2015 niu et al 2020 and qin et al 2021 reported that mulching systems were widely recognized strategy for improving crop yield and yield stability however chae et al 2022 pointed out plastic film mulching negatively affected on yield and yield stability in the long term application wang et al 2022 also reported that under high air temperature and high soil moisture condition straw mulching increased fusarium head blight root stalk and ear rot and long term straw mulch increased the probability of maize disease which negatively affected crop yield and stability additionally ridge tillage significantly increases evaporation owing to ridge increase the surface area of the soil which negatively affects water balance zhang et al 2021a moreover zhang et al 2020 reported that although high film coverage increased soil water content in topsoil it also increased crop water consumption which was not conductive to maintaining soil water balance previous study reported that field mulching was an effective agriculture management to increase tn and soc mo et al 2020 in contrast li et al 2019 and ma et al 2021 considered filed mulching increased soil tn consumption and accelerated decomposition of soc hence these inconsistent results have led to increasing concern about the agriculture sustainability following long term field mulching steinmetz et al 2016 agriculture in semi arid regions plays an important role in global food security recently numerous studies on the effects of field mulching on yield water and nitrogen utilization on the semi arid areas have been investigated but lack of systematic studies on agricultural sustainability under long term field mulching we hypothesized that in semi arid regions under partial plastic film mulching condition i the reduced evaporation from plastic film mulching compensates for the increased transpiration thus plastic film mulching has no significant influence on total water consumption compared with no mulching practice meanwhile the rainwater in fallow season and rainy year could replenish for the enhanced consumption of soil water by film mulching in normal growing or dry seasons ensuring positive water balance in long term practice ii n fertilizer input and straw return etc could replenish for the high n consumption under film mulching and straw treatment so as to ensure the n balance iii higher root biomass in plastic film and straw mulching could replenish soil tn and soc loss during field mulching accordingly the mulching practices could enhance the agricultural sustainability in rain fed farming system therefore the present study aims were 1 quantify the water balance and n budget of agricultural ecosystems 2 examine the dynamics of soc and tn across consecutive years of field trials 3 assess the yield stability and variability of furrow ridge tillage plastic film mulching and maize straw mulching practices the current study contributed substantially in filling the knowledge gap about the agricultural sustainability under long time usage of different mulching and tillage systems for ensuring food supply in arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and materials a 6 year field experiment was conducted during the maize growing

the tillage systems investigated were conventional tillage ct ridge tillage rt partial plastic mulching with conventional flat cultivation fm ridge tillage with plastic film mulching on ridge rtf and maize straw mulching sm sm treatment was analyzed since 2017 and other treatments were analyzed since 2016 in combination with the tillage systems two n application rates 0 and 225 kg n ha 1 were used providing a total of 10 treatments each with three replicates consequently the experiment comprised a total of 30 plots each with an area of 6 m 5 m tillage treatments and n application rates were assigned to the main plot and subplot respectively fig 2 before sowing the plots were ploughed using a rotary cultivator to a depth of 40 cm in the fm plots both the film widths and row widths were 55

cm thick the maize cultivar was zea mays l xianyu 335 vanguard corporation america the phosphorus 40 kg p2o5 ha 1 and potassium 80 kg k2o ha 1 fertilisers were applied before sowing as basal fertilization in all treatments the nitrogen fertilizer was applied at 225 kg n ha 1 in the n225 treatments with two fifths applied as basal fertilization and three fifths applied as topdressing at the trumpet stage v12 base and side dress fertilizers were applied by deep band application to a depth of 15 cm away from planting row evenly in ct and sm treatments fig 1 straw mulching has a significant soil cooling effect and low soil temperature may extend the emergence period of crops qin et al 2015 thus straw mulching was conducted in 3rd leaves stage in every season ridging plastic film mulching was conducted on basal fertilization deep bands the side dress fertilizer was deep band applied in furrow in rt or rtf treatments and it was deep band applied in no film mulching area in fm treatment the all fertilization bands were 10 15 cm away from planting row 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 yield measurements at maturity three subplots with an area of 5 m 2 were selected within each treatment plot and all the ears in each subplot were collected dried and threshed subsamples approximately 100 g of the air dried grains were dried at 75 c to a constant weight which was recorded zheng et al 2022 the grain yield was adjusted to 14 moisture the evaluation indexes of the yield stability and sustainability were calculated as follows qaswar et al 2020 li et al 2022 1

years for each treatment 2 3 2 transpiration evapotranspiration and water use potential after emergence each leaf of maize was placed every seven days in a transparent bag at 8 13 o clock 13 18 o clock and 18 8 o clock and then weighed for the quality of the transpiration water the mass of the three time periods transpiration was added as the transpiration per maize in per day area based transpiration was calculated as follows yao et al 2007 3 t mm i 1 n tpp pd 10 3 where t is the total area based transpiration mm tpp is plant transpiration g plant 1 pd is plant density plants m 2 10 3 is used to convert g m 2 to mm at both the beginning and the end of each growing season the soil water content was measured gravimetrically at 20 cm intervals from 0 to 200 cm depth using a 50 mm diameter soil probe jc 802b qingdao juchuang environmental co ltd qingdao china three soil profiles samples were collected in each plot and mixed to form one composite sample in ct and sm treatments six soil profiles samples were collected in each plot and mixed to form one composite sample in fm rt and rtf treatments three soil samples were from inside the mulch or on the middle of ridge and three soil samples were from outside the mulch or in furrow zhang et al 2022a composite sample were weighed dried to constant weight at 105 c and then weighed again to determine the soil water content gravimetric water content the soil water storage profile from 0 to 200 cm was calculated by multiplying the soil profile depth by the gravimetric water content and soil bulk density at that depth hou et al 2012 soil water storage change δsws and evapotranspiration et was calculated as follows bai et al 2022 4 δsws mm sws 2 sws 1 5 et mm i p u r d δsws where sws 1 and sws 2 are soil water storage

surface mm u is the water flux from deep soil layers mm d is the deep percolation mm in this experiment u was negligible owing to stable moisture below the 200 cm soil profile unpublished data it was also to be negligible according to zhang et al 2022b r was also omitted because of the relatively flat field terrain there was no irrigation therefore i equalled to zero in addition due to the low rainfall and the texture of the investigated soil it will not cause d at depths exceeding 200 cm bai et al 2022 zhang et al 2022b therefore the final equation of et was calculated as follows bai et al 2022 6 et mm p sws the water use potential wup were calculated using the following equation zhang et al 2022b 7 wup et p 100 2 3 3 root sampling at harvest we selected three representative maize plants having average height for their plot from the middle rows the shovelomics method was used for root trait measurements trachsel et al 2011 briefly stated as follow roots were sampled from each plot by extracting them from a total soil volume of 40 cm length 25 cm width 100 cm depth with seven separated soil layers 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm the volume of each soil cuboid was 20 cm length 12 5 cm width 20 cm depth except for top 2 ones which was 20 cm length 12 5 cm width 10 cm depth the maize roots were cleaned by gently with flowing water to remove the attached soil before measuring dry weight finally the root samples were dried at 75 for a stable root dry weight fig s1 2 3 4 nitrogen analysis and the nitrogen budget ten plants were sampled from each plot for n quantification at maturity the samples were divided into leaves stems tassels bracts cobs and grains thereafter the samples were dried to a constant weight in a fan oven at 75 the dried samples were ground sieved 0 25 mm sieve and digested with concentrated sulfuric acid h2so4 98 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and the n content was measured using a flow analyser seal aa3 bran luebbe germany nitrogen accumulation na was calculated as follows 8 na kg n ha 1 leaf n stem n tassel n bract n cob n grain n ammonia volatilization was quantified using a portable ammonia detector pad method yang et al 2019 the device consisted of a closed chamber made of polyvinyl chloride height 350 cm diameter 30 cm a pad with a built in air pump bosean electronic co ltd fujian china and pipes the pad was used to measure ammonia concentration in the chamber the air entering the chamber was ammonia free ammonia emissions and fluxes were measured each testing day during 8 00 9 00 and 16

profile and n loss in runoff according to the measurement of our colleagues the annual nitrogen oxide emission was 2 3 kg ha 1 which has insignificant impact on the n balance and can be ignored n leaching from profile and n loss in runoff were assumed to be negligible because of the flat and deep soil layer 2 3 5 soil organic carbon and total nitrogen analysis soil samples were collected from the 0 20 cm soil layer at the harvest time five soil cores each 50 mm in diameter were excavated randomly and mixed to form one composite sample in each plot of ct and sm ten ones were excavated randomly in each plot of fm rt and rtf treatments respectively and mixed to form one composite sample in each plot five soil samples were from inside the mulch or on ridge and five soil samples were from outside the mulch or in furrow all fresh samples were air dried and sieved through a 0 25 mm sieve to determine soc and tn soc was determined using the dichromate oxidation method yang et al 2011 and tn was determined using the kjeldahl method zhang et al 2021b 2 4 statistical analyses the experimental data were analyzed using anova statistical analyses were performed using the sas 9 1 statistical package significance differences were accepted at p 0 05 means were compared using the least significant difference lsd test graphs were prepared using originpro 2015 software 3 results 3 1 yield yield sustainability index and coefficient of variation the significant difference p 0 05 in yield between different tillage patterns are shown in fig 3 in unfertilized treatments maize grain yield in ct varied from 1478 to 5971 kg ha 1 while it was 990 7956 2234 8543 2304 7926 1149 4807 kg ha 1 in rt fm rtf and sm treatment respectively the highest yield was observed in the plastic film mulching fm and rtf and the mean yield was 26 8 and 57 7 higher than that of the ct treatment 3582 kg ha 1 however the mean yield of sm was reduced by 36 0 compared with that of ct treatment statistical analysis revealed significant effect of n fertilization on grain yield p 0 05 maize grain yield ranged from 4400 to 9320 5091 9947 8138 15197 9132 13680 and 5894 14842 kg ha 1 in ct rt fm rtf and sm respectively under n fertilized treatments maize grain yield was maximized under plastic film mulching with 65 0 and 73 4 increase respectively in comparison with that of ct yield sustainability index syi and coefficient of variation cv were significantly affected by tillage pattern and n application p 0 05 fig 4 plastic film mulching obviously increased syi and reduced cv in both n fertilized and unfertilized treatments with 4 4 13 9 increment and 0 7 10 7 decline respectively in contrast with those of ct however syi showed negative response to sm with decrease of 2 8 3 9 than the ct in comparison syi and cv response of rt varied with n fertilization ridge tillage notably augmented syi by 7 8 and declined cv by 3 2 compared with ct under n application syi decreased by 9 1 and cv increased by 9 5 of rt in comparison with those of ct in the absence of n application 3 2 water use potential wup and changes in soil water storage δsws tillage and n had obvious effect on evaporation and transpiration in no n fertilized treatments evaporation was the main component of et the n application reduced evaporation and increased transpiration p 0 05 the seasonal transpiration of ct was 173 6 mm accounting for 41 9 of et whereas that of plastic film mulching was 233 2 mm accounting 56 3 of et straw mulching could also enhance transpiration but its effect was inferior to plastic film mulching fig 5 additionally the present study showed that the evaporation decline offset the transpiration increment under plastic film mulching which resulted in no significant difference p 0 05 in et between plastic film mulching and ct fig 5 and table 1 water use potential in all tillage patterns varied significantly between n fertilized and unfertilized treatments table 1 the average wup of all tillage patterns ranged between 88 3 91 4 in the absence of n application during six text years with highest wup in fm the wup showed positive response to n application for example the wup of all tillage patterns ranged from 100 4 to 111 2 in 2016 and 2017 table 1 nevertheless the average wup of all tillage patterns in fertilized plots was less than 100 over the six testing years but higher by 7 0 on average than the unfertilized plots across the six years test results tillage patterns and n application significantly affected δsws table 1 the present study showed that the δsws of most tillage patterns were positive in the absence of n application with 49 0 41 5 36 3 44 4 and 50 3 mm under ct rt fm rtf and sm respectively conversely n application negatively affected δsws the δsws was 23 5 30 7 38 9 and 42 0 mm under ct rt fm and rtf respectively a similar result was obtained in 2017 notably the average δsws was positive in six test years with 20 8 19 7 15 3 13 1 and 16 1 mm under ct rt fm rtf and sm respectively table 1 3 3 n budget tillage patterns and n fertilizer application significantly affected nb p 0 05 the average nb values of all tillage patterns were negative in no n fertilizer condition with 20 9 22 3 31 1 27 7 and 5 3 kg ha 1 under ct rt fm rtf and sm respectively table 2 whereas nb was obviously enhanced with n fertilized wherein the positive average nb of all tillage patterns were found with 117 9 108 6 57 6 74 9 and 94 6 kg ha 1 in ct rt fm rtf and sm respectively 3 4 soil total nitrogen the tn content of sm increased yearly regardless of n application or not fig 5 the soil tn content of sm at harvest in 2021 reflected significant 27 1 29 8 increase relative to that of 2017 fig 6 in contrast the soil tn content of plastic film mulching practice exhibited negligible variation during six years test it should be noted that mulching practices were advantageous to improve tn content with 1 7 29 8 increase compared to ct additionally all tn data in the n225 treatments were higher than those for the corresponding n0 treatments fig 6 3 5 soil organic carbon similar to the results of tn content irrespective of fertilization application the soc content of sm significantly increased yearly fig 7 the soc content of sm at harvest in 2021 increased 22 3 33 3 markedly compared with that of 2017 fig 7 in comparison the plastic film mulching had negligible effects on the soc content it was worth noting that field mulching especially straw mulching enhanced soc content with 2 6 40 3 increment relative to that of ct additionally the present study showed that all soc content associated with the n225 treatments were higher than those for the corresponding n0 treatments 4 discussion the present works confirmed our hypothesises and field mulching could not lead to the soil water imbalance and soil n and c exhaust in the successive field mulching practices with suitable n input and straw residues retention in soil therefore it could conserve agricultural production sustainable in the rain fed farming 4 1 grain yield for sustainability in food supply to the whole world and especially in china innovative tillage practices such as plastic or straw mulching ridge tillage etc have accounted a significant contribution thidar et al 2020 chai et al 2022 previous study has showed that plastic film mulching may have negative effects in the long term application not only decreasing yield and yield stability but also deteriorating soil quality chae et al 2022 however zheng et al 2022 reported plastic film mulching increased yield and decreased cv of yield similar results were obtained by this study the current study showed that regardless of n fertilizer application the plastic film mulching practices significantly increased yield and syi and decreased cv in contrast with those of ct fig 3 and fig 4 higher and more stable grain yields obtained under plastic film mulching practices are partly resulted from maintaining suitable moisture content in the soil layers zhang et al 2019 dai et al 2021 in addition favourable soil micro environment under plastic film mulching practice enhances organic carbon mineralization and stable soil nutrient supply and thus also contribute to improving grain yield li et al 2018 the effect of straw mulching on yield is complex qin et al 2022 when straw decomposes in soil it competes with crops for available n moreover a large amount of straw returned to the field intensifies this competition reducing crop yield wang et al 2018 moreover under high temperature and moisture conditions the stalk and root rots under straw mulching restricted crop nutrient uptake and growth wang et al 2020 thus negatively affected grain yield and yield stability which was consistent with the results reported by zheng et al 2022 additionally qin et al 2015 reported sm had a significant soil cooling effect and low soil temperature may extend the emergence period of crops in order to avoid the poor emergence owing to lower soil temperature caused by straw mulching we mulched the field with straws in 3rd leaf stage the current study showed that straw mulching reduced yield and increased cv in no n fertilization however n input could mitigated it compared with the field mulching practices fm rtf and sm it appeared that rt alone could not effectively increase grain yield this might be due to the limited capacity of this tillage system to collect and utilize moisture from precipitation 4 2 water use potential and changes in soil water storage recently models measurement and sap ﬂow measurement are main methods for determining transpiration fang et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 in this study the transpiration ratio of non mulching was 41 9 which agrees well with the result of 42 0 reported by chen et al 2019 however maize transpiration of plastic film mulching varies among diverse ways of measurement the transpiration ratio of plastic film mulching was 56 3 in our result which was slightly lower or similar to previously published values of 52 4 73 2 determined by sap ﬂow measurement zheng et al 2021 whereas it was much lower than the values 75 0 84 3 measured by models chen et al 2019 fang et al 2021 the results of the models are highly influenced by some factors such as meteorological variables soil water content and crop parameters jiang et al 2016 tu et al 2019 leaf area index is an important crop parameter affecting transpiration ratio and the transpiration ratio obviously enhance with leaf area index increase zheng et al 2021 the maximum leaf area index in our results 3 46 4 75 m2m 2 was lower than those reported 5 0 7 5 m2m 2 zheng et al 2021 due to low planting density 65000 plant ha 1 if the planting density increased to those reported 75000 98000 plant ha 1 chen et al 2019 fang et al 2021 the transpiration rate in our results would increase to 60 5 88 9 zhang et al 2021 reported that in arid or semi arid areas the et of plastic film mulching during the entire growing season increased or decreased compared with non mulching depending on the relationship between the effect size of reduced evaporation and the effect size of increased transpiration the present study showed that evaporation reduction in the plastic film mulching compensated for the transpiration increase fig 5 so that the seasonal et had no significant difference compared with non mulching treatment agreeing well with the findings of gong et al 2017 rainfall is the only source of water input in rain fed agricultural areas therefore increasing precipitation use via innovative agricultural management such as tillage patterns etc is essential for crop growth and yield formation in the current study plastic film mulching effectively increased wup especially in n fertilized treatment which was consistent with the result of chen et al 2022 the wup in all tillage patterns exceeded 100 during 2016 2017 indicated original soil water was consumed by maize nevertheless the total wup was less than 100 across the tested periods in both n fertilized and unfertilized treatments indicated that the present practices would not lead to diminishing soil storage water in long term perspective maintaining a positive δsws is a necessary strategy for dryland agriculture sustainability zhang et al 2022c li et al 2021 suggested that evapotranspiration positively affected the soil water storage in a long term field experiment long term experimental data showed that the partial film mulching practices used in this experiment resulted in a positive δsws during the 6 test years although there were negative δsws in 2016 and 2017 table 1 firstly the depletion of original soil water caused by field mulching could be replenished by the rainfall in fallow season li et al 2019 moreover the wup during 2018 2021 were only 80 90 table 1 indicating rainfall during 2018 2021 could replenish the excessive water consumption in 2016 and 2017 comparatively although full film mulching improved soil water content in the topsoil better than partial mulching it typically led to reduced soil water storage due to its higher water consumption caused by rapid growth and development of maize at high soil temperatures hu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 additionally the partial film mulching is popular in local practices although it is not as effective as the full mulching on the mitigation of soil evaporation it is beneficial for rainfall infiltration which suits to practice in the higher precipitation areas such as south and southeast of the loess plateau or similar areas 4 3 n budget and total nitrogen high yield is partly dependent on high n consumption li et al 2019 2021b which adheres a risk of soil n depletion especially under unfertilized treatments negative n budget in all tillage practices were found without n application in the present study especially under plastic film mulching practice table 2 indicated plastic film mulching practice could accelerate original n exhaustion ma et al 2021 straw mulching mitigates soil n storage consumption owing to its low n output and additional n input from straw residues zhang et al 2017b nitrogen fertilizers play an important role in increasing crop yield and ensuring soil quality qiao et al 2022 the present study showed the nb was positive in n225 treatments which indicated n fertilizer input compensated for the high n consumption and loss tn is an important latent indicator of soil fertility and the current study reported a significant increase in soil tn under sm treatment fig 5 crop residue retention increases tn stocks owing to its positive effects on soil aggregate formation and stabilization which physically protecting soil n from microorganism mineralization balesdent et al 2000 zhang et al 2015 ma et al 2021 reported that long term plastic film mulching resulted in soil tn content reduction however negligible tn change in plastic film mulching practice was found during 2016 2021 and compared with ct it increased soil tn an increase in the soil n fixing bacteria population and activity under plastic film mulching could lead to an increase in n fixation yang et al 2021 furthermore plastic film mulching prohibited n leaching and made more fertilizer nitrogen residual in the top soil chen et al 2020 4 4 soil organic carbon changes in soc stocks are the net result of outputs and inputs within the belowground environment generally straw and root production are an important source of soc maintaining soc through the replenishment of root c inputs is a promising strategy for any sustainable agricultural technology zhang et al 2017b the soc content under sm increased yearly in our study fig 7 indicating that straw retention was better option for improving soc content which was consistent with chen et al 2018 and dong et al 2018 in contrast the effect of plastic film mulching on soc content is controversial lee et al 2019 indicated that improvements in soil moisture and temperature regimes by plastic film mulching are favourable for biological activity and increase the mineralization of soc and consume the original soc stock however the present study showed that soc stocks were stable and higher under continuous partial plastic film mulching than those under ct fig 7 plastic film mulching substantially increased plant biomass especially for root biomass fig s1 and therefore increased precursor of soc which agrees well with findings of mo et al 2020 in contrast in arid agricultural areas the full film mulching has better hydrothermal conditions than the partial film mulching thus accelerating the mineralization of soc liu et al 2014 however in the present study rt tended to reduce soc and tn which might be related to an increase in mineralization owing to soil disturbance during the creation of furrows and ridges 5 conclusions the results presented in this study validated our hypothesis compared with ct the plastic film mulching significantly increased maize yield and maintained yield stability plastic film mulching had no significant influence on total water consumption compared with no mulching practice additionally plastic film mulching could achieve positive δsws and maintained the stability of soc and tn hence plastic film mulching was an effective option for sustainable rain fed farming practice in semi arid areas however attention should be paid to the impact of microplastic contamination in future research straw mulching increased soc and tn content however higher variation of yield should be mitigated via n rational fertilization and pathogen controlling the small yield increase and low yield stability occurred in rt practice additionally the soc declined similar to ct declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
