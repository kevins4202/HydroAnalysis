8605,modern anthropogenic activities have significantly increased nitrate no3 concentrations in surface waters stable isotopes δ15n and δ18o in no3 offer a tool to deconvolute some of the human made changes in the nitrogen cycle they are often graphically illustrated on a template designed to identify different sources of no3 and denitrification in the two decades since this template was developed δ15n and δ18o no3 have been measured in a variety of ecosystems and through the nitrogen cycle however its interpretation is often fuzzy or complex this default is no longer helpful because it does not describe surface water ecosystems well and biases researchers towards denitrification as the no3 removal pathway even in well oxygenated systems where denitrification is likely to have little to no influence on the nitrogen cycle we propose a different scheme to encourage a better understanding of the nitrogen cycle and interpretation of no3 isotopes we use a mechanistic understanding of no3 formation to place bounds on the oxygen isotope axis and provide a means to adjust for different environmental water isotope values so data from multiple sites and times of year can be appropriately compared we demonstrate that any interpretation of our example datasets canada kenya united kingdom show clear evidence of denitrification or a mixture of no3 sources simply because many data points fall outside of arbitrary boxes which cannot be supported once the range of potential δ18o no3 values has been considered keywords nitrate isotopes lakes rivers 1 introduction stable isotopes δ15n and δ18o in nitrate no3 have been commonly measured for 4 decades see heaton 1986 and papers therein methods have evolved from off line agno3 precipitation e g chang et al 1999 silva et al 2000 to chemical and microbial reduction to n2o and subsequent continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry analyses sigman et al 2001 mcilvin and altabet 2005 since no3 is a very common global pollutant contributes to eutrophication of surface waters vitousek et al 1997 and is the most common groundwater pollutant spalding and exner 1993 a key application of no3 isotopes was to identify no3 sources through combining a number of individual studies this lead to publication of a δ18o no3 vs δ15n no3 schematic biplot with suggested ranges for different sources of no3 kendall 1998 it has been modified a few times e g kendall et al 2008 xue et al 2009 kendall et al 2015 but the fundamental concept remained the same its application for interpreting no3 isotopes has become widespread but this figure is not really fit for this purpose and is commonly over interpreted here we discuss the assumptions inherent in this figure and key improvements needed for improved understanding of no3 isotopes in surface waters 2 background the schematic biplot figure was originally designed for interpreting groundwater data where no3 isotope values of different no3 sources are preserved except by chemo denitrification e g böttcher et al 1990 aravena et al 1993 aravena and robertson 1998 some researchers identified that forests receiving a lot of nitrogen deposition export no3 in streams and this no3 does not retain the atmospheric deposition isotope values e g spoelstra et al 2001 pardo et al 2004 this was early evidence that measured no3 isotopes in surface water showed that they should be carefully used for source identification because of various biological alterations along their flowpath as method improvements allowed more no3 isotope data to be generated a schematic figure that recognised biotic and abiotic processing of no3 between its sources and sampling point needed to be developed knowledge of isotope fractionation during no3 production and consumption was summarised in kendall 1998 yet despite the many figures in this chapter one figure described as simplified has become the ubiquitous interpretation scheme this figure visually summarises a compilation of no3 isotope data with boxes by dominant sources of nitrate and encourages researchers to think only about one process denitrification although this process may be uncommon in well oxygenated lake surfaces or streams and rivers in this way we need a better schematic figure that explicitly recognises the differences between no3 sources and processes that produce and consume no3 the nitrogen axis had been used as the primary differentiator between sources however given the wide range of possible δ15n values in manure sewage and soils e g 30 range in soil alone craine et al 2015 and the obvious fact that nitrogen will be biologically cycled in those systems source identification cannot be done with boxes on a figure moreover a system with three no3 sources and only one measurement δ15n is underdetermined measuring locally appropriate sources of nitrogen as potential initial δ15n values is the appropriate way to constrain this axis instead of relying on the broad assumption that a single set of boxes derived from a limited number of measurements are globally appropriate bateman and kelly 2007 without locally appropriate values the borders between no3 sources become very blurred on the δ15n no3 axis e g kendall et al 2015 and this provides no useful resolution in the measured surface water data and no direct ability to identify sources in some cases nitrogen from fertilizers and legumes will be mixed into the soil nitrogen pool e g oelmann et al 2007 before no3 is exported to surface waters e g deutsch et al 2006 in such cases the exported δ15n no3 values will be controlled largely by the soil nitrogen pool and land use history rather than a single year of precipitation and fertilizer input e g loo et al 2017 in this scenario the soil nitrogen averages all of its nitrogen inputs and no3 subsequently exported from the soil to surface water maintains this average unless there is direct input of isotopically district no3 to the surface waters hence the large overlap in the no3 sources boxes that does not contribute to source identification e g kendall et al 2015 the oxygen axis has groups that can be defined a priori i high δ18o values from no3 produced in the atmosphere where the δ18o value depends strongly on latitude michalski et al 2012 and ii low δ18o values where the δ18o value depends strongly on the δ18o of h2o where the no3 is formed snider et al 2010 the δ18o value of no3 produced by autotrophic and heterotrophic nitrification can be bounded in two ways first canonical two step nitrification from nh4 to nh2oh to no2 to no3 adds one o atom from o2 in the first step and one o atom from h2o in each of the next two steps hollocher et al 1981 andersson and hooper 1983 aleem et al 1965 hollocher 1984 dispirito and hooper 1986 isotope fractionation during these steps occurs but is not always expressed such as when no2 is fully consumed buchwald and casciotti 2010 casciotti et al 2010 snider et al 2010 abiotic equilibrium of oxygen may occur between h2o and no2 and increase the δ18o value of the no2 casciotti et al 2007 in surface soils the pore gas δ18o o2 value is very likely near the atmospheric value of 23 5 vs smow kroopnick and craig 1972 however in productive aquatic ecosystems the diel variability of δ18o o2 values can be large e g 26 range in gammons et al 2011 23 range in venkiteswaran et al 2015 18 range in hotchkiss and hall jr 2014 14 range in wassenaar et al 2010 and 13 range in parker et al 2005 though this range can be estimated by one set of diel samples during the most productive part of the year and analyzed via a variety of techniques e g barth et al 2004 wassenaar and koehler 1999 second incubation experiments with various levels of δ18o h2o indicate that the contribution of δ18o h2o values to the final δ18o no3 value is often much greater than the minimum two thirds and sometimes close to 1 snider et al 2010 thus the range of δ18o values of no3 produced in situ can be bounded by knowledge of δ18o o2 and δ18o h2o values a minimum of the δ18o h2o value and a maximum of ⅓ δ18o o2 ⅔ δ18o h2o however abiotic exchange of oxygen between h2o and no2 may increase this theoretical minimum value when the diel range in δ18o o2 values is considered the maximum δ18o values of no3 produced in situ will vary by upwards of 10 i e ⅓ of the diel range of δ18o o2 values e g 9 in gammons et al 2011 8 in venkiteswaran et al 2015 6 in hotchkiss and hall jr 2014 5 in wassenaar et al 2010 and 4 range in parker et al 2005 data in silver bow creek montana usa

isotopes we selected six rivers from canada kenya and the united kingdom each with different climate regions seasonal variation in flow and δ18o h2o values the grand river ontario canada is the largest river draining into the canadian side of lake erie there are five cities 30 wastewater treatment plants and extensive modern agriculture along the 300 km river in its 6800 km2 basin

hannaford and marsh 2008 the baseflow index for the river at this location is 0 67 reflecting the influence of influent groundwater sourced from the limestone aquifers located in the headwaters and the extensive floodplain gravel aquifers during the summer a significant component of flow is supported by effluent from wastewater treatment works wwtw bowes et al 2010 five sites upstream and

this are widespread across southern england allen et al 2010 they are characterised by a high baseflow index 0 9 and a shallow hyporheic zone the primary source of nitrogen therefore comes from no3 in groundwater due to fertilizer use samples were collected at steady state flow 2 2 methods canadian samples for no3 isotopes were collected in hdpe bottles and filtered in the field to 0 45 µm samples were kept cold and dark until returned to the lab where they were frozen until analysed samples for h2o isotopes were collected in hdpe bottles without headspace canadian analyses were performed at the environmental isotope laboratory at the university of waterloo no3 isotope samples were analysed via the chemical denitrifier method where no3 is reduced to n2o with cadmium and sodium azide mcilvin and altabet 2005 the resultant n2o gas was analysed on an isoprime continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer now elementar cheadle hulme uk with a precision of 0 3 for δ15n no3 and 0 5

traditional biplot our data from canada kenya and the united kingdom fall in a wide swath fig 1 a data from each country has a wider range of δ15n no3 values than δ18o no3 values ranges of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are 6 6 to 14 8 and 0 66 to 4 6 in canada 1 1 to 18 0 and 2 1 to 19 7 in kenya and 3 4 to 17 2 and 0 95 to 9 9 in the united kingdom additionally data from each country has a positive relationship between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 2 tailed parametric p 0 006 for each country but this relationship also contains seasonal changes in ambient δ18o h2o values temperature and nitrogen sources and processes that confound direct comparison of the data this means that without additional independent information there are several possible explanations for the data that are more complex than simply assigning a source of no3 based on the δ15n values or assigning a single process based on a simplistic pattern in the δ18o no3 vs δ15n no3 values for example varying contributions of the δ18o h2o values two or more sources of nitrogen uptake and release of varying amounts of ammonium and no3 and denitrification in varying combinations may have produced the observed patterns in our data it is critical to avoid wrongly invoking denitrification as the primary explanation for individual points on the traditional biplot as this risks suggesting nitrogen removal from the ecosystem when other explanations for the data need to be considered certainly any interpretation that our data show clear evidence of denitrification or a mixture of no3 sources because many data points fall outside of arbitrary boxes with the traditional δ18o axis fig 1a cannot be supported once the range of potential δ18o no3 values has been considered fig 1b moreover almost all measured δ18o no3 values fall within the range of expected δ18o no3 values based on nitrification with variable amount of h2o exchange fig 1b thus the theoretical range of δ18o no3 values should be generated for each field site rather than a single catch all approach globally δ18o h2o values of surface water vary widely along a meteoric water line but they can be predicted by latitude and databases such as waterisotopes org though direct measurement is much simpler than no3 isotopes additionally to make δ18o no3 data comparable between seasons and sites δ18o no3 data should be displayed vs the δ18o h2o value from the same sample i e same location and time rather than vs smow 1 1 unitless δ values are converted from relative to smow to relative to h2o as δ 18 o n o 3 h 2 o δ 18 o n o 3 smow 1 δ 18 o h 2 o smow 1 1 this is the 18o 16o ratio of no3 divided by the 18o 16o ratio of h2o rather than by the 18o 16o ratio of smow this is akin to the way δ18o po4 3 values are plotted relative to their temperature specific equilibrium point with δ18o h2o e g davies et al 2014 paytan et al 2002 in order to remove the influence of difference δ18o h2o values fig 1b here the differences in δ18o no3 values between countries is much reduced and most δ18o no3 values are near the upper end of the δ18o no3 values predicted from microbial transformation of nitrogen there is a positive linear relationship between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 in the kenya and uk data p 1 0 4 but not canada p 0 4 some variability due to watershed size and seasonality can also be considered with this approach first as watershed size increases above a river sampling point the average duration the nitrogen spends in the watershed increases and thus the likelihood that the sampled no3 had been assimilated and released multiple times approaches 100 second initial δ18o no3 values entirely depend on the ambient δ18o h2o and δ18o o2 at the time of nitrification and not the δ18o value of the no3 added to the watershed at some point upstream if the nitrogen has been cycled at least once thus changes in δ18o h2o between seasons or throughout watersheds e g yue et al 2018 are accounted for by reporting δ18o no3 relative to the h2o we recognise that in our approach that the δ18o h2o measured concomitantly with the δ18o no3 does not completely represent the h2o that relevant during the most recent production of each no3 molecule indeed the δ18o h2o during no3 formation is not necessarily that which is found in the river during sampling due to mixing of a plethora of sources of n and h2o similarly small or slow flowing rivers maybe subject to significant seasonal evaporation resulting in increases in ambient δ18o h2o values that may temporally differ from when no3 was formed these issues reinforce the need to collect samples of waters where no3 is formed to recognise that no3 is continuously cycled in surface waters and to explicitly make a distinction between n sources and processing the implication here is that identifying the source of the no3 cannot be done with δ18o no3 values increases in δ15n and δ18o no3 values which are often interpreted as evidence of denitrification with closed system assumptions e g böttcher et al 1990 cannot be uniquely separated from multiple processes that recycle nitrogen in surface waters necessarily this requires us to move beyond looking only for denitrification in our δ15n and δ18o no3 data and towards how multiple processes and sources interact to produce the values measured in surface waters likely this will ultimately require development of process based no3 isotope models for surface waters and will be informed by measurements of other nitrogen species transformation processes and associated isotope enrichment factors e g venkiteswaran et al 2019 only once the appropriate range of initial δ18o no3 values has been determined can processes such as nitrification denitrification and no3 assimilation be considered here the δ15n and δ18o no3 values in the environment will be pulled in multiple directions at the same time the magnitude of change depends on multiple factors that are difficult or impossible to statically display in a biplot 1 mineralization of organic nitrogen and subsequent nitrification may decrease δ15n and δ18o no3 values depending on if there is a difference between the δ15n value of organic nitrogen and no3 and the δ18o contributions of o2 and h2o 2 ammonia and no3 uptake and release by riverine periphyton and macrophytes may have differing impacts since isotope fractionation during ammonia uptake is non linearly dependant on concentration fogel and cifuentes 1993 hoch et al 1992 and denitrification in riparian zones and anoxic river and lake sediments may increase δ15n and δ18o no3 values if there is residual no3 to measure in all cases changes in the δ15n and δ18o no3 values are more complex than a single arrow for denitrification suggests kendall 1998 a recent review has summarised the modelling approaches and isotope fractionation factors necessary to interpret measured δ15n and δ18o no3 values in soils denk et al 2017 with this process based understanding it is clear that a single vector or slope on a biplot for denitrification is inappropriate for surface waters 4 summary and conclusions in order to move beyond the simple source apportionment assumptions commonly made in no3 isotope biplots and to explicitly acknowledge that there are a variety of processes that alter the δ15n and δ18o no3 values in situ we therefore recommend measuring δ18o h2o values at the same time as δ18o no3 values and report δ18o no3 values vs δ18o h2o instead of smow to make appropriate comparisons with time and across sites combining δ18o h2o and δ18o o2 values to develop appropriate site specific ranges of δ18o no3 produced in situ and measuring locally relevant δ15n source values to significantly reduce the range of δ15n values of nitrogen input to aquatic systems declaration of competing

traditional biplot our data from canada kenya and the united kingdom fall in a wide swath fig 1 a data from each country has a wider range of δ15n no3 values than δ18o no3 values ranges of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 are 6 6 to 14 8 and 0 66 to 4 6 in canada 1 1 to 18 0 and 2 1 to 19 7 in kenya and 3 4 to 17 2 and 0 95 to 9 9 in the united kingdom additionally data from each country has a positive relationship between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 2 tailed parametric p 0 006 for each country but this relationship also contains seasonal changes in ambient δ18o h2o values temperature and nitrogen sources and processes that confound direct comparison of the data this means that without additional independent information there are several possible explanations for the data that are more complex than simply assigning a source of no3 based on the δ15n values or assigning a single process based on a simplistic pattern in the δ18o no3 vs δ15n no3 values for example varying contributions of the δ18o h2o values two or more sources of nitrogen uptake and release of varying amounts of ammonium and no3 and denitrification in varying combinations may have produced the observed patterns in our data it is critical to avoid wrongly invoking denitrification as the primary explanation for individual points on the traditional biplot as this risks suggesting nitrogen removal from the ecosystem when other explanations for the data need to be considered certainly any interpretation that our data show clear evidence of denitrification or a mixture of no3 sources because many data points fall outside of arbitrary boxes with the traditional δ18o axis fig 1a cannot be supported once the range of potential δ18o no3 values has been considered fig 1b moreover almost all measured δ18o no3 values fall within the range of expected δ18o no3 values based on nitrification with variable amount of h2o exchange fig 1b thus the theoretical range of δ18o no3 values should be generated for each field site rather than a single catch all approach globally δ18o h2o values of surface water vary widely along a meteoric water line but they can be predicted by latitude and databases such as waterisotopes org though direct measurement is much simpler than no3 isotopes additionally to make δ18o no3 data comparable between seasons and sites δ18o no3 data should be displayed vs the δ18o h2o value from the same sample i e same location and time rather than vs smow 1 1 unitless δ values are converted from relative to smow to relative to h2o as δ 18 o n o 3 h 2 o δ 18 o n o 3 smow 1 δ 18 o h 2 o smow 1 1 this is the 18o 16o ratio of no3 divided by the 18o 16o ratio of h2o rather than by the 18o 16o ratio of smow this is akin to the way δ18o po4 3 values are plotted relative to their temperature specific equilibrium point with δ18o h2o e g davies et al 2014 paytan et al 2002 in order to remove the influence of difference δ18o h2o values fig 1b here the differences in δ18o no3 values between countries is much reduced and most δ18o no3 values are near the upper end of the δ18o no3 values predicted from microbial transformation of nitrogen there is a positive linear relationship between δ18o no3 and δ15n no3 in the kenya and uk data p 1 0 4 but not canada p 0 4 some variability due to watershed size and seasonality can also be considered with this approach first as watershed size increases above a river sampling point the average duration the nitrogen spends in the watershed increases and thus the likelihood that the sampled no3 had been assimilated and released multiple times approaches 100 second initial δ18o no3 values entirely depend on the ambient δ18o h2o and δ18o o2 at the time of nitrification and not the δ18o value of the no3 added to the watershed at some point upstream if the nitrogen has been cycled at least once thus changes in δ18o h2o between seasons or throughout watersheds e g yue et al 2018 are accounted for by reporting δ18o no3 relative to the h2o we recognise that in our approach that the δ18o h2o measured concomitantly with the δ18o no3 does not completely represent the h2o that relevant during the most recent production of each no3 molecule indeed the δ18o h2o during no3 formation is not necessarily that which is found in the river during sampling due to mixing of a plethora of sources of n and h2o similarly small or slow flowing rivers maybe subject to significant seasonal evaporation resulting in increases in ambient δ18o h2o values that may temporally differ from when no3 was formed these issues reinforce the need to collect samples of waters where no3 is formed to recognise that no3 is continuously cycled in surface waters and to explicitly make a distinction between n sources and processing the implication here is that identifying the source of the no3 cannot be done with δ18o no3 values increases in δ15n and δ18o no3 values which are often interpreted as evidence of denitrification with closed system assumptions e g böttcher et al 1990 cannot be uniquely separated from multiple processes that recycle nitrogen in surface waters necessarily this requires us to move beyond looking only for denitrification in our δ15n and δ18o no3 data and towards how multiple processes and sources interact to produce the values measured in surface waters likely this will ultimately require development of process based no3 isotope models for surface waters and will be informed by measurements of other nitrogen species transformation processes and associated isotope enrichment factors e g venkiteswaran et al 2019 only once the appropriate range of initial δ18o no3 values has been determined can processes such as nitrification denitrification and no3 assimilation be considered here the δ15n and δ18o no3 values in the environment will be pulled in multiple directions at the same time the magnitude of change depends on multiple factors that are difficult or impossible to statically display in a biplot 1 mineralization of organic nitrogen and subsequent nitrification may decrease δ15n and δ18o no3 values depending on if there is a difference between the δ15n value of organic nitrogen and no3 and the δ18o contributions of o2 and h2o 2 ammonia and no3 uptake and release by riverine periphyton and macrophytes may have differing impacts since isotope fractionation during ammonia uptake is non linearly dependant on concentration fogel and cifuentes 1993 hoch et al 1992 and denitrification in riparian zones and anoxic river and lake sediments may increase δ15n and δ18o no3 values if there is residual no3 to measure in all cases changes in the δ15n and δ18o no3 values are more complex than a single arrow for denitrification suggests kendall 1998 a recent review has summarised the modelling approaches and isotope fractionation factors necessary to interpret measured δ15n and δ18o no3 values in soils denk et al 2017 with this process based understanding it is clear that a single vector or slope on a biplot for denitrification is inappropriate for surface waters 4 summary and conclusions in order to move beyond the simple source apportionment assumptions commonly made in no3 isotope biplots and to explicitly acknowledge that there are a variety of processes that alter the δ15n and δ18o no3 values in situ we therefore recommend measuring δ18o h2o values at the same time as δ18o no3 values and report δ18o no3 values vs δ18o h2o instead of smow to make appropriate comparisons with time and across sites combining δ18o h2o and δ18o o2 values to develop appropriate site specific ranges of δ18o no3 produced in situ and measuring locally relevant δ15n source values to significantly reduce the range of δ15n values of nitrogen input to aquatic systems declaration of competing

8606,forecasts of tropical cyclones have seen rapid improvements in recent years as expanding computational capacity permits more runs of finer resolution meteorological models with increasing representation of physical processes however the utilization of a hydrodynamic component in these models is often neglected meaning flood forecasts typically output point water levels that give little indication of a projected inundation extent on the ground here we append this critical component to the forecast cascade by coupling fathom us a continental scale hydraulic model which employs the lisflood fp numerical scheme to forecasts of streamflow rainfall and coastal surge height from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa medium term 2 15 days flood inundation forecasts as well as hindcasts driven by real time observations were executed for hurricane harvey by rapidly simulating pluvial and coastal flood hazard and extracting fluvial flood maps from an existing us wide simulation library the resultant 30 m resolution depth grids were then validated against post event observations collated by the us geological survey across the disaster zone the hindcast forecast model captured on average 78 75 of the benchmark flood extent obtained a critical success index of 0 66 0 57 and deviated from observed high water marks by 1 m 1 2 m when compared to a simpler gis based approach the hydraulic model exhibited much higher skill in replicating observations this study shows that fully hydrodynamic approaches can be practicably employed in large scale forecast frameworks at high resolution to produce skillful projections of inundation extent without significantly affecting the forecast lead time keywords flooding hydrodynamic modeling flood

damages of over 1 trillion and 220 000 deaths worldwide munich re 2018a recent devastating events particularly flooding both freshwater and saltwater arising from tropical cyclones have sharply focused the issue in the minds of the public and policy makers alike in 2017 hurricanes harvey irma and maria collectively caused 220 billion of damage in the gulf of mexico typhoon haiyan claimed the lives of over 6000 people and caused 10 billion worth of damage in east asia in 2013 and in 2008 cyclone nargis caused 140 000 fatalities and 4 billion of economic damage in myanmar munich re 2018b a growing body of evidence suggests that such tropical cyclones will become more intense kang and elsner 2016 sobel et al 2016 van oldenborgh et al 2017 emanuel 2017 and move more slowly once they make landfall kossin 2018 as a result of climate change with more precipitation falling over a longer duration tropical cyclone driven flood impacts are likely to increase in the future on top of the freshwater component of such events the low atmospheric pressure and strong onshore winds arising from tropical cyclones result in coastal inundation regardless of potential changes to these storm characteristics under climate change increased sea levels in a warming world are likely to exacerbate coastal flood impacts in light of this there is a clear need for substantial risk reduction measures to mitigate against present and future flood consequences one facet of such measures is improved flood forecasting which permits a short term response to be mounted e g temporary defense

2012 as outlined in fig 1 direct meteorological and hydrological observations e g of rainfall from gauges or radar of wind speed from anemometers or radar or of river flows from an upstream gauge can form the source data of the forecast cascade if spatial coverage is sufficient but such information is often unavailable or generates forecasts with short lead times a few hours to a maximum of perhaps 1 2 days in very large basins limiting their usefulness to increase lead times medium term forecasts 2 15 days use numerical weather prediction nwp models as the primary input data source to the model cascade and nwp systems have benefitted from the rapid advances in computational capacity seen in recent years high performance computing hpc resources have had the dual effect of permitting nwp models to run at increasingly fine spatial and temporal resolutions so that atmospheric dynamics can be more accurately represented buizza et al 1999 and allowing multiple nwp simulations in an

2010 bhola et al 2018 adams et al 2018 or employ simplified representations of hydraulic processes to reduce computational costs paiva et al 2013 zheng et al 2018a this is predominantly because most of the computational time available is afforded to the nwp models maximizing resolution and producing probabilistic ensemble simulations cloke and pappenberger 2009 alongside the prevailing view that full physics hydraulic models are too computationally expensive to be used in operational forecasts leskens et al 2014 bhola et al 2018 yet tropical cyclones demand forecasts of multiple flood drivers and end users would greatly benefit from detailed local predictions of flood extent and depth to enable a more complete risk calculation official riverine flood forecasts in the us are issued by the noaa national weather service nws through weather forecast offices these forecasts are generated by river forecast centers rfcs providing accurate information to inform public alerts and warnings for

mouth of the potomac river reported accuracies were similar to adams et al 2018 while these 1d approaches provide rapid and accurate riverine forecasts they require channel cross section data which are only sparsely available and considerable manual set up by skilled practitioners furthermore their focus only on large river flooding means the significant pluvial hazard posed by tropical cyclones remained unmodelled here we present a medium term 2 15 days tropical cyclone flood inundation forecasting product which is capable of being used in an operational system and demonstrate that high resolution hydraulic models can now be practicably employed at large scale in such frameworks where accurate local forecasts are lacking we forecasted hurricane harvey by coupling streamflow rainfall and storm surge predictions from noaa to fathom us wing et al 2017 a continental scale hydraulic flood model of the us and used this to produce daily flood depth footprints at 30 m resolution updating the hydrologic inputs with post event observations as they became available we also produced a model hindcast in real time after the event we tested the forecast and hindcast model against ground

process by sampling from pre existing flood maps of the entire continental us simulation quality e g grid resolution physical process representation is not hampered by the need for a forecast with reasonable latency the extraction process takes only seconds leedal et al 2010 for fluvial flooding the response to extreme streamflow in a river basin is relatively well confined to that particular locality meaning any plausible flood event will match a pre computed event agnostic inundation simulation of that area provided enough runs with different boundary conditions are executed how rainfall and surge vary in time and space however is less related to the hydrologic conditioning of the ground surface in other words simulating these perils ahead of time is inadvisable given the a priori specification of suitable extraction zones is less defensible than for fluvial flooding as such the noaa rainfall and surge information is input to fathom us to generate new event specific depth grids

freshwater flooding component is set out in wing et al 2017 the us implementation is itself a variant of the global model first described by sampson et al 2015 it has been rigorously tested against thousands of bespoke flood inundation studies carried out by us government agencies concluding that the large scale methodology is approaching the accuracy of traditional local models wing et al 2017 the framework permits rapid construction and execution of model domains as defined by the forecast footprint of us hurricane landfalls its computational hydraulic engine is driven by a variant of the lisflood fp hydraulic model which solves a local inertial form of the shallow water equations in two dimensions over a regular grid 30 m 1 arc second resolution in this case using a highly efficient numerical solution bates et al 2010 de almeida and bates 2013 this grid is populated with elevation values from the 1 arc second version of the usgs national elevation dataset ned with levee information from the us army corps of engineers national levee database explicitly represented this digital elevation model dem has complete coverage of the conterminous us and is thus the crucial component of the framework s applicability to simulate inundation for all potential hurricane landfall locations in the us river hydrography is represented by hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 with those rivers wider than the grid resolution being burnt directly into the dem and narrower streams being represented by the subgrid 1d model of neal et al 2012 fluvial modelling is executed by inserting river discharge information which is ultimately linked to an rffa derived aep an nwm streamflow forecast or a usgs river gauge observation at the relevant inflow points in the stream network while the pluvial model takes spatial rainfall data and drops it directly onto the land surface rain on grid sampson et al 2013 assumptions relating to infiltration capacity are made based on soil information from the harmonized world soil database in conjunction with a modified hortonian infiltration equation morin and benyamini 1977 in urban areas identified using satellite luminosity data elvidge et al 2007 the infiltration capacity is defined using assumed urban drainage design standards the storm surge model component was conceived by bates et al 2005 who adapted the 2d lisflood fp code traditionally used in fluvial settings for coastal flooding using lisflood fp for such an application has precedent as examples smith et al 2012 evaluated its suitability for coastal inundation modelling in the uk and quinn et al 2014 applied the code in a coastal flood risk assessment in this component the coastal boundary line of the model domain is set within oceanic cells just offshore of the coastal flood defenses for each cell along the coastal boundary the predicted peak surge height was extracted from p surge output and used to scale the tidal time series at that location to create a fractional surge height time series water enters the model domain along the boundary in accordance with this time series and the hydraulic model simulates the dynamics of the surge as it interacts with the shoreline and moves inland 2d burnt in the dem and 1d subgrid channels are represented here also meaning the ability of the storm surge to propagate inland via river channels is properly represented a crucial component of coastal flood models e g maskell et al 2014 2 2 nwm hand model noaa nwc the noaa national water center has recently explored the coupling of the national water model to the height above nearest drainage method rodda 2005 rennó et al 2008 nobre et al 2011 2016 this effort forms part of the national flood interoperability experiment maidment 2016 which like this paper seeks to append the neglected receptor component to the flood forecasting cascade fig 1 the hand approach normalizes the dem so that a given pixel takes the value of the vertical distance to the stream it drains to a rating curve is then used to translate nwm flow forecasts to stage for a given river cell and any land cells that drain to this stream location and have a hand value less than the stage become flooded planar approximations such as these which do not consider flow physics have been shown to be less skillful than models which represent the dynamics of flood inundation since the inception of raster based hydraulic modelling bates and de roo 2000 and again more recently afshari et al 2018 owing to their omission of mass and momentum conservation laws in isolated test cases however particularly on confined floodplains with steep valley sides and straight river reaches a planar approach may offer satisfactory performance bates and de roo 2000 furthermore the reduction in model skill may be considered acceptable where rapid solutions are required to large computation problems afshari et al 2018 liu et al 2018 geographies where these methods are appropriate are difficult to specify a priori though since they have not undergone the same level of wide area testing as hydrodynamic approaches e g wing et al 2017 in evaluating the simpler hand based approach alongside the more complex hydraulic model presented here the trade off between including the physics of water flow in a forecast model and computational efficiency can be quantified the nwm hand model was executed for hurricane harvey noaa nwc et al 2018 using the usgs ned at 1 3 arc second resolution as the dem the model was run each day with nwm analysis and assimilation outputs providing a snapshot of the flood extent caused by harvey at that time by taking the maximum extent from all of these hand based simulations an analogous comparison can be made with the fathom hindcast both models intended to simulate the maximum flood extent when driven with observations 2 3 validation data we evaluated the hurricane harvey forecast and hindcast footprints against ground observations of flood extent and depth made by the usgs watson et al 2018 after the event usgs field teams visited impacted basins and collected high water marks hwms in accordance with the guidelines of koenig et al 2016 these are surveyed from the debris or stain lines left by the receding water on the sides of buildings trees fences and other structures horizontal co ordinates are obtained with a gps while vertical heights are referenced to the navd88 datum the 2123 resultant hwms were in combination with usgs gauging station maximum water levels interpolated technique described in musser et al 2016 across 1 4 3 m resolution dems built with lidar data for fourteen sites this provided the current best reconstruction of flood extents from the observed water level data though these observation data are used as a benchmark in this study they are not error free watson et al 2018 listed uncertainties for specific data points in their study and these range from 0 01 m 0 55 m mean 0 07 m though no information was specified regarding the method of quantification for further details see watson et al 2018 2 4 validation metrics firstly the gridded flood depth benchmark data derived from observed water levels were used to test the extent to which the models captured the overall spatial pattern of the flooding for this the same binary pattern measures were used as in wing et al 2017 1 hit r a t e m 1 b 1 m 1 b 1 m 0 b 1 2 false a l a r m r a t i o m 1 b 0 m 1 b 0 m 1 b 1 3 critical s u c c e s s i n d e x m 1 b 1 m 1 b 1 m 0 b 1 m 1 b 0 4 error b i a s m 1 b 0 m 0 b 1 where m and b represent model and benchmark cells respectively and the subscript 1 and 0 indicate if the cell considered is wet and dry respectively the hit rate metric hr eq 1 penalizes type ii errors and is thus a measure of the model s tendency to underpredict the benchmark flood extent it can be interpreted as the proportion of benchmark flooded areas that were replicated by the model the false alarm ratio far eq 2 penalizes type i errors and so represents the tendency of the model to overpredict the benchmark flood extent this metric can be interpreted as the proportion of modelled flooded areas that are dry in the benchmark the critical success index csi eq 3 penalizes both type i and type ii errors thus being a metric that accounts for both under and overprediction it ranges between 0 no match between model and benchmark and 1 perfect match between model and benchmark and can be thought of as representing the model performance over floodplain areas only as it excludes areas that do not inundate in both the model and benchmark data finally error bias eb eq 4 is the ratio of type i to type ii errors values greater than 1 indicate the model tends to overpredict while values less than 1 indicate a tendency to underpredict with respect to the benchmark secondly we calculated the difference in water surface elevation wse specified by the usgs hwms and the models these differences are analyzed in three ways 5 root m e a n s q u a r e d e r r o r n 1 n o n m n 2 n 6 mean a b s o l u t e e r r o r n 1 n o n m n n 7 mean e r r o r n 1 n o n m n n where on and mn is the wse at a given observation point and corresponding model cell respectively n is the number of hwms analyzed and everything else is as above the original dataset was trimmed down to 1134 points so that the analysis was confined to high quality hwms that were not taken at the same location and which were referenced against the same geodetic datum both root mean squared error rmse eq 5 and mean absolute error mae eq 6 measure the average magnitude of the errors where an error is on mn rmse is a quadratic scoring rule meaning greater weight is given to larger errors while mae is linear all errors have equal weight mean error me eq 7 calculates the average error whilst still accounting for their sign a negative me indicates the model has a tendency to overpredict observed wses while a positive one suggests underprediction 3 results and discussion 3 1 flood extent comparison the results of the flood extent comparison between the fathom hindcast model driven with observed streamflow rainfall and surge heights and usgs benchmarks for each of their fourteen study sites are shown in table 1 a and fig 3 most of the usgs flood extent is captured by the model with 78 of observed wet pixels being correctly identified as such in the model on average across all sites many of the sites with high hrs also have relatively high fars e g tres palacios river fig 3a lower san bernard river fig 3l and upper brazos river fig 3b driving a lower overall correspondence and overpredictive bias as indicated by their csis and ebs respectively conversely many lower hr sites have very low fars e g upper and lower neches river fig 3k and 3 m and cow bayou fig 3f generating comparable csis and ebs 1 indicating underprediction some high hr sites have correspondingly high csis owing to low fars e g lower brazos river fig 3e and middle san bernard river fig 3j suggesting there is a strong match between model and benchmark flood extents csis which are the most discriminatory metric range from a poor 0 5 the model is correct as often as it is incorrect on the upper san bernard river fig 3i to an excellent 0 9 a 90 match between model and benchmark on the lower brazos river fig 3b across the domain an average csi of 0 66 indicates that roughly 2 in every 3 model pixels in the functional floodplain match the benchmark further to the details in section 2 3 the usgs benchmark flood inundation extent is subject to uncertainty it is generated via interpolation between point hwms themselves containing vertical error rather than a genuine 2d observation meaning the accuracy of these maps is heavily dependent on the spatial resolution of the hwms without representing the physics of flow that generated the hwms in a hydraulic model e g timing and interaction of adjacent streamflows the interpolation procedure may produce unrealistic inundation extent boundaries where unconstrained by point observations to put the pattern scores into context the wing et al 2017 model attained average csis of 0 75 against detailed local models with a maximum of 0 90 global flood models average csis of 0 50 obtaining up to 0 70 in isolated test cases against a variety of local models and satellite derived flood extents sampson et al 2015 winsemius et al 2016 dottori et al 2016 ward et al 2017 local flood models that have been manually built and extensively calibrated generally achieve csi scores of 0 70 0 80 when compared to satellite observations of flood inundation aronica et al 2002 pappenberger et al 2007 di baldassarre et al 2009 wood et al 2016 and up to 0 9 when benchmarked against very high quality data e g bates et al 2006 altenau et al 2017 fleischmann et al 2019 propose that a hydrodynamic model provides locally relevant estimates of flood extent when csi 0 65 it should be noted that the csi metric is sensitive to the selected study area however favoring overpredictive models of larger floods on flat terrain compared to the reverse case stephens et al 2014 the results shown here are towards the higher end of those in the literature though many of these are for smaller floods where high csis are difficult to obtain the hindcast model performance is however shy of the very high csis exhibited by calibrated local model observation comparisons the results thus indicate that across the model domain the hindcast hydraulic model presented here has some skill in replicating benchmark patterns the results of the comparison between the nwm hand model and the usgs benchmark are shown in table 1b it is evident here that the nwm hand model has lower predictive skill when benchmarked against the usgs flood extents mean hrs indicate 46 of flooded areas are correctly captured with mean csis suggesting just over 4 in every 10 pixels in the functional floodplain are identified correctly it should be noted that the nwm hand model structure is only capable of representing fluvial flood hazard meaning both hydrologically isolated flooding from intense local rainfall and coastal surge will not be captured hurricane harvey was predominantly a pluvial event flooding arose in many areas due to intense local rainfall on the land surface rather than from rivers flowing out of bank fig 4 shows how different the fathom and nwm hand models look when this runoff component is represented in an area to the ne of houston hand being a fluvial only model perhaps explains why coastal basins e g two sites in matagorda bay have such low scores since storm surge may have played an important role here the lack of a rainfall component may explain poor performance on small streams the upper san bernard river has a drainage area of 500 km2 and the san jacinto river site contains headwater streams with drainage areas as small as 20 km2 and both exhibit extremely poor performance with nwm hand the flood hazard arising on these small streams is not driven by traditional fluvial flooding processes where aggregation effects lead to a large low amplitude flood wave which propagates downstream but by the rapid lateral surface flow of intense local rainfall generating a flash flood this further contextualizes the scores obtained by the fathom model at these sites too where despite possessing a pluvial model component the difficulties in simulating this phenomenon are evident with that being said for even the relatively simple problem of modelling the brazos river which has a flat floodplain confined by steep valley sides nwm hand correctly identifies less than half of the pixels the hydrodynamic fathom model in contrast correctly identifies between 74 and 90 of flooding from the brazos for reference csis obtained by hand models have been reported between 0 5 and 0 9 for a selection of watersheds in the us when comparing hand approaches to observational data or hydrodynamic methods zheng et al 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2018 afshari et al 2018 the results from the nwm hand model presented here do not appear to be as skillful as those presented in these smaller scale studies further despite this approach making use of higher resolution 10 m terrain data it is outperformed by a coarser 30 m hydrodynamic model this suggests that the importance of higher grid resolution is only realized when physical processes are represented further to testing the fathom and nwm hand models that were driven with real time observations the fathom forecast variant was also benchmarked against the usgs flood extents it was driven with nwm peak flows from a 3 day forecast commencing at 1800 gmt 6 on 27th august 2017 as well as forecast rainfall and surge data from this time hurricane harvey generated peak streamflows across the domain for over 5 days beyond the horizon of the 3 day forecast model presented here the forecast model output chosen for validation here captures temporally the main hurricane impact in texas which was felt prior to 31st august 2017 the results of this comparison are shown in table 2 where the fathom forecast model sees a performance drop with respect to its hindcast variant mean csi drops by 0 09 and mean hr drops by 0 03 while hrs actually increase for most sites when compared to hindcast performance as high as 99 9 on the lower san bernard river this is amidst a backdrop of increased ebs that indicate a heavy bias towards overprediction mean eb of 84 02 compared to a more modest 1 42 in the hindcast it s worth noting here though that ebs are measured on a logarithmic scale since underprediction is indicated by values less than 1 and overprediction by values greater than 1 a value of 0 5 has the same magnitude bias as a value of 2 yet the mean of these two values is 1 25 not 1 underrepresented by this mean eb therefore are the extremely high underpredictive biases evident on the lower and upper neches river and cow and pine island bayous the use of forecasted rather than observed model inputs is therefore widening the tails of the bias distribution ebs moving further from 1 and reducing overall performance csis decreasing with that being said capturing on average three quarters of benchmark inundated pixels hr while keeping false alarms at 23 far is indicative of fair performance in the forecast model aside from structural errors in the hydraulic model and its components e g the dem the hindcast model contends only with errors in the measured data it is driven with though this is not insignificant 25 40 error in measured flows is common and can be even higher when flows are extreme di baldassarre and montanari 2009 coxon et al 2015 westerberg et al 2016 it is likely to be much lower than uncertainties in the boundary conditions used in the forecast hydraulic model these uncertainties though are typically explored by the use of ensemble prediction systems eps in meteorological e g buizza 2005 and hydrological e g thielen et al 2009 forecast models where many realizations of projected weather or water levels are simulated for a single site cloke and pappenberger 2009 these probabilistic frameworks thus permit some measure of forecast predictability to be quantified in the models presented here there is only a single deterministic flood extent for each day s forecast the reason for this is two fold firstly the noaa nwm itself currently produces deterministic streamflow forecasts for its medium range variant nwm v1 1 was the version in existence during hurricane harvey but current and future versions will improve on this functionality e g nwm v2 will have a 7 member ensemble in the medium range forecast were a probability distribution of projected river discharge available the rapid extraction algorithm that samples from a pre existing library of fluvial flood maps could feasibly produce 2d grids where each cell represents the probability density function of water depth this process takes only seconds so scaling to a probabilistic framework remains trivial secondly the computational expense of running new hydrodynamic pluvial and coastal flood models in an eps would add significant computational burden with that being said running an ensemble of the hydraulic model presented here a single deterministic run requires 120 processor hours would be a manageable task for the hpc facilities of leading forecast centers and so probabilistic depth grids of these flood drivers could be constructed too incorporating the hydrodynamic model in an eps would be a relatively straightforward addition to the method proposed here but is one which is beyond the scope of the current paper digging deeper into the forecast uncertainties observations of peak streamflow from 63 usgs river gauges across the footprint domain are compared to the corresponding nwm streamflow forecast from 27th august 2017 all river gauges used experienced peak flow during this forecast s 3 day time horizon by volume the mean absolute error as in eq 6 but for discharge rather than water surface elevation comes to 2970 m3s 1 for reference this error is equivalent to roughly 80 of the peak discharge experienced on the lower brazos river during hurricane harvey errors as a proportion of the observed discharge are shown in fig 5 the mae is 290 with a very high bias towards overprediction mean error of 281 forecast discharge on the buffalo bayou near addicks was an eighteenfold overestimate an implausible 7129 m3s 1 when 390 m3s 1 was observed in some cases though the nwm was very accurate for instance on the east fork of the san jacinto river near new caney 3492 m3s 1 was forecasted while 3398 m3s 1 was observed it should be noted that this a single forecast from single point in time while the medium range nwm variant is run four times a day for 80 time horizons the testing presented here therefore will not be representative of nwm performance during harvey and should not be viewed as an authoritative assessment of model skill it may be ill fortune that the particular fathom flood extent forecast selected for this study was driven by anomalously poor discharge forecasts but their benchmarking against observed flows provides useful context for analyzing the skill of the 2d flood forecast furthermore the nwm was in its infancy around the time of harvey v1 1 improvements both to date and in the future v2 of this hydrological model after rigorous validation exercises will result in much closer replication of observed streamflows than those presented here official noaa rfc forecasts are of much greater accuracy adams 2016 but do not have total coverage of us rivers in fig 6 the discharge errors at usgs observation sites are plotted and polygons representing the fourteen sites are colored by their error bias from table 2 many of the usgs gauging stations do not relate to sites where usgs benchmark flood extents were generated perhaps explaining why the csis in table 2 are not as low as the discharge errors in fig 5 might suggest stations are heavily concentrated in houston of which only some are relevant to just one of the fourteen study sites san jacinto river fig 6g equally many of the sites do not have a representative usgs gauging station but for those that do biases in the forecast discharge are often replicated in the inundation extent where the site polygon and gauge point are of a similar color in fig 6 forecast flood inundation in the east of the domain was driven by nwm discharges that are generally biased towards underprediction which is reflected in the bias of the flood extent big cow creek fig 6c upper fig 6k and lower neches river fig 6m cow bayou fig 6f pine island bayou fig 6n most of the remaining sites have an overpredictive flood extent bias where nearby gauges indicate that the nwm forecast discharge was overpredictive also upper fig 6b and lower brazos river fig 6e and san jacinto river fig 6g the conclusions drawn in this section generally verify those found in the wider literature that models based on some formulation of the shallow water equations produce a more accurate simulation of flood extent than simple planar approximations though a performance differential of this magnitude has not been documented previously for fluvial flooding in bates et al 2005 the planar method obtained a csi of 0 11 when simulating coastal floods as fully hydrodynamic approaches become increasingly computationally tractable the advantages of using gis based methods will further diminish intuitively the performance of the fathom forecast model is lower than that of its hindcast counterpart partly due to some significant errors in the nwm forecast streamflows and perhaps forecast rainfall relative to observations also yet these results evidence that despite these limitations the forecast model has fair skill in replicating benchmark flood extents for harvey 3 2 high water mark comparison the fathom models were further tested against the raw hwms that the usgs used to construct the benchmark flood extents in the preceding section these observational data represent the maximum water surface elevation surveyed by usgs field teams as a result of hurricane harvey at a given point for the hindcast model the mean absolute wse error between the selected observation points and the modelled value at the same location is 1 03 m the influence of a small number of large outlying error values means that the rmse is significantly higher at 1 71 m fig 7 a outlines the distribution of these wse differences exhibiting a gaussian distribution about a central tendency close to 0 mean error 0 15 m 50 of the errors lie between 0 43 m q25 and 0 90 m q75 while 90 of the errors are between 2 32 m q5 and 2 12 m q95 fig 7b exhibits the expected shallowing and widening of the error distribution when analyzing the fathom forecast model mae rises to 1 22 m rmse 1 88 m however this does not represent a drastic reduction in skill from hindcast to forecast point comparisons of surveyed vs simulated wses are a particularly stringent test for a model of this scale indeed such examinations are rarely carried out for analogous models particularly uncalibrated large scale high resolution ones which include urban areas and smaller streams meaning context setting for these results is quite difficult the wilson et al 2007 model of the amazon obtained an rmse of 2 37 m 0 99 m at high water when comparing simulated water levels to those derived from satellite altimetry data schumann et al 2013 calibrated their 1 km resolution forecasting model of the lower zambezi river to within 0 27 m of icesat derived water levels this though is the product of using a smooth coarse resolution dem of a very flat and wide floodplain meaning wses change very little as the flood extent grows obtaining low errors under such circumstances is much less challenging than in the test case presented here especially when the zambezi model has been calibrated to observations neal et al 2009 in a high resolution reach scale hydraulic model of an urban area built with local data obtained a maximum rmse of 0 28 m when calibrated to hwms as another example the standard deviation of errors in the calibrated mignot et al 2006 model of an urban area in france was 0 53 m it should be noted that hydraulic models that have been calibrated may not necessarily be more inherently skillful meaning these local scale model errors may not be analogous to the uncalibrated large scale model presented here as an example of an operational noaa flood forecast adams et al 2018 compare modelled hindcasts of their large scale framework in the midwest to usgs gauged stages and found errors of 0 5 m while this is more accurate than the model presented here it required thousands of manual bathymetric surveys to build meaning the adams et al 2018 model only simulates flooding on large rivers of known geometry in the context of hurricane harvey where flooding from small streams and surface runoff accounted for a considerable portion of the hazard this noaa exemplar model may not have attained similar errors when benchmarked against high water marks on the floodplain and particularly where flooding was predominantly pluvial zheng 2018 tested the nwm hand model of maximum inundation outlined in the preceding section noaa nwc et al 2018 against this same set of usgs hwms and found the standard deviation of model error to be 4 m previous studies have also quantified the errors in surveyed hwms that such models are calibrated to or validated against errors are generally 0 3 0 5 m schumann et al 2007 neal et al 2009 horritt et al 2010 fewtrell et al 2011 owing to deposition during a hiatus in flood recession i e not high water wall seepage or debris line width these are broadly consistent with the maximum errors reported for the hwms used in this study but average errors are generally 0 1 m watson et al 2018 it is clear that the automatically generated forecast and hindcast models in this paper do not obtain comparable wse errors to bespoke hydraulic models in the wider literature or noaa nws rfc forecasts though without hydraulic model calibration local data and manual operation they were never likely to it is also important to point out the difference in purpose between this and other models rather than seeking to perfectly replicate a given flood event with few limitations regarding processing and computation time this is a forecast product designed to quickly indicate areas susceptible to flooding from an incoming storm to enable an immediate response rapid exposure assessments and resource allocation by first responders do not demand a highly accurate map of water depths but rather a broad indication of the spatial patterns in flooding that may occur pitt 2008 price et al 2012 despite some sacrifice to point precision e g with respect to the accuracy of the 155 discrete forecast inundation points in noaa ahps the framework s total coverage both in geography and flood driver serves to fill the information gaps left by sporadic yet accurate local forecasts besides efforts to reduce wse errors in the hydraulic model are of little value when considering the commensurate or larger errors in the meteorological and hydrological models that precede it in the forecast cascade cangialosi 2018 noted that intensity and track errors in the noaa nhc 3 day forecasts during the 2017 hurricane season were 7 ms 1 and 150 km respectively the maximum total rainfall in the noaa wpc 3 day forecast was 1000 mm yet a maximum of over 1500 mm was observed blake and zelinsky 2018 hydrological models used to translate rainfall to streamflow may also be significantly uncertain even if the meteorological inputs were error free blöschl et al 2013 generally accepted benchmarks for satisfactory performance in hydrological models are i within 25 error in simulated discharge and ii a nash sutcliffe efficiency of greater than 0 5 meaning model mean square discharge error represents less than half of the observed variance moriasi et al 2007 refsgaard and knudsen 1996 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 with source and pathway uncertainties such as these propagating into the receptor component of the forecast cascade fig 1 the hydraulic model deviating from observations by an average of 1 m is unsurprising yet may still be useful for event early warning and first responder preparedness in the absence of local modelling strategies 659 of the hwms collected by the usgs also reported the height of the water above the ground surface meaning a surveyed ground elevation can be calculated by subtracting this measurement of water depth from the wse comparing these elevation values to those contained at the corresponding location in the dem provides further context for the errors shown in fig 7a and b again it should be noted that the observed data contends with error in both the surveyed water surface elevation and its height above the ground such errors could plausibly be half a meter or more watson et al 2018 fig 7c shows the spread of these elevation errors the dem rmse is 3 77 m though this is heavily biased by a handful of implausibly high errors maximum negative error 58 9 m maximum positive error 20 9 m which are just as likely to be due to human error in the manual ground survey as erroneous values in the dem reducing the influence of these errors by considering mae the quantity stands at 1 19 m with forecast and hindcast wse maes of 1 21 and 1 03 m respectively the water levels simulated by the model are similar to or outperform the accuracy of the dem implying two key findings firstly much of the wse error is attributable to the quality of the usgs ned the source of the model dem in this domain it stands to reason then that in domains with a greater proportion of lidar in the ned ground and thus water surface elevation error would drop once again the assertion made by horritt and bates 2002 still holds topography is the major control on flood inundation patterns secondly although it seems counterintuitive that errors in wse can be smaller than the dem from which they are derived this underlines the idea that relative rather than absolute dem accuracy is much more important in hydraulic modelling how the elevation varies between pixels in a locality controls the movement of water over a floodplain not a pixel s elevation relative to a vertical datum though this does not apply for simulations of coastal flooding typically relative dem errors are much lower than absolute ones gesch et al 2014 quantified a 20 reduction in the standard deviation of relative compared to absolute errors in the ned at 1 3 arc second resolution fig 8 displays the spatial distribution of the wse errors for the hindcast areas of high performance in white errors between 0 5 and 0 5 m are evident across the domain particularly in matagorda and brazoria counties south of houston approx 29 2 n 95 5 w to the south of the top left panel in fig 8 jefferson and hardin counties to houston s east approx 30 1 n 94 3 w and in parts of houston s harris county itself approx 29 9 n 95 4 w there is clear clustering to areas of poor performance coastal areas in the southwest of the domain around corpus christi have a positive bias indicating the model underpredicted observed hwms in these areas this is also the case around village creek north of beaumont approx 30 4 n 94 2 w clusters of very high negative errors are present along houston s buffalo bayou approx 29 8 n 95 5 w to the north of the top left panel in fig 8 and the calcasieu river in lake charles 30 2 n 93 2 w to the east of the top right panel in fig 8 signaling model overprediction of wses incorporating fig 9 into this interpretation which exhibits the spatial distribution of the dem errors in fig 7c it may be expected that areas of high wse error are also areas of high ground elevation error observing figs 8 and 9 in tandem suggests that this is not the case areas of low wse error to the south of houston are in fact dominated by relatively high ground elevation error as colors move away from white towards red and black while ground elevation errors in areas identified as having high wse error houston and lake charles are low or if anything of the opposite sign to the wse errors this reinforces the suggestion that relative and not absolute dem accuracy is pre eminent and draws on the well documented challenges of hydraulic modelling in urban areas yu and lane 2006a mason et al 2007 hunter et al 2008 especially at large scales wing et al 2017 high wse errors are generally confined to urban areas in this study where horizontal rather than vertical elevation accuracy i e grid resolution controls flood model performance to a much greater extent than elsewhere this is due to the increased prevalence of hydraulically important anthropogenic features small scale flow paths building walls levees roads and much else which are unresolved by the elevation data since they are smaller than the width of a grid cell in the absence of the computational capacity available to run large scale models at very high resolution e g sampson et al 2012 which is some distance from feasibility given doubling the granularity of grid resolution increases computation time by an order of magnitude savage et al 2016 the solution to this problem may lie with nested or variable resolution grids where high risk cities can be modelled at finer resolution e g sanders et al 2010 kim et al 2014 sanders and schubert 2019 or innovative sub grid scale solutions e g yu and lane 2006b sanders et al 2008 schubert and sanders 2012 guinot et al 2017 the bottleneck of the latter approach being obtaining parameterization data at large scale 4 conclusions this paper presents a flood forecasting product for hurricanes in the us that has the potential to be used operationally in the absence of accurate local forecasts comprehensively testing it against ground truth data collected by the usgs the framework takes available hydrologic noaa forecasts as inputs to an existing continental scale model structure wing et al 2017 accounting for all primary flood drivers in order to rapidly simulate event water depth grids for a given domain anywhere in the us comparing model hindcasts of hurricane harvey to benchmark data of its maximum flood extent indicates that the model has skill in picking up the spatial patterns of inundation mean csi value of 0 66 when benchmarked against surveyed water surface elevations the model misestimates this quantity by roughly 1 m on average this is amidst a backdrop of similar errors in the dem and up to 0 5 m of error in the measured hwms the model in forecast mode experiences only a moderate drop in performance relative to the hindcast we conclude this to be commensurate to or beneath likely uncertainties in the preceding components of the forecast cascade as well as similar to errors in the underlying dem with expanded lidar coverage within the usgs ned the model presented here may approach the accuracy of operational noaa inundation forecasts adams et al 2018 mashriqui et al 2014 but with total coverage and for a diverse range of flood drivers leading forecast centers generally only produce point water levels and flows e g river discharge storm surge height neglecting the crucial receptor component that translates this information to a 2d grid of flood depths in favor of focusing almost exclusively on improved meteorological modelling contemporary 1d approaches by noaa rfcs are likely more accurate and computationally efficient in fluvial settings but these are only available in limited areas with accurate local data this paper shows that large scale hydraulic modelling of fluvial pluvial and coastal flooding can and should play a role in medium term forecasts outperforming simpler gis based approaches with the hydrodynamics of pluvial and coastal flooding from hurricane harvey taking only 6 hours to run on a single node of 20 cores and extractions from a pre computed library of fluvial flood maps taking only seconds forecast centers can couple such a module to their existing medium term forecast frameworks and provide benefits to a plethora of end users while sacrificing only a marginal portion of available computation time the principle of sampling from a pre computed inventory of flood maps could permit this framework to be applied in a probabilistic ensemble forecast an important method in accounting for model and exogenic errors this will be addressed in forthcoming research employing a true hydrodynamic model which properly represents the physics of floodplain flow is shown to outstrip the performance of a simplified gis based approach while these planar approximations have gained in popularity due to their quick and dirty solutions to computationally intensive problems we have demonstrated that this is not a substitute for 2d hydraulic modelling in this instance mass and momentum conserving hydraulic codes are shown to be suitably fast and much more accurate than zero

8606,forecasts of tropical cyclones have seen rapid improvements in recent years as expanding computational capacity permits more runs of finer resolution meteorological models with increasing representation of physical processes however the utilization of a hydrodynamic component in these models is often neglected meaning flood forecasts typically output point water levels that give little indication of a projected inundation extent on the ground here we append this critical component to the forecast cascade by coupling fathom us a continental scale hydraulic model which employs the lisflood fp numerical scheme to forecasts of streamflow rainfall and coastal surge height from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa medium term 2 15 days flood inundation forecasts as well as hindcasts driven by real time observations were executed for hurricane harvey by rapidly simulating pluvial and coastal flood hazard and extracting fluvial flood maps from an existing us wide simulation library the resultant 30 m resolution depth grids were then validated against post event observations collated by the us geological survey across the disaster zone the hindcast forecast model captured on average 78 75 of the benchmark flood extent obtained a critical success index of 0 66 0 57 and deviated from observed high water marks by 1 m 1 2 m when compared to a simpler gis based approach the hydraulic model exhibited much higher skill in replicating observations this study shows that fully hydrodynamic approaches can be practicably employed in large scale forecast frameworks at high resolution to produce skillful projections of inundation extent without significantly affecting the forecast lead time keywords flooding hydrodynamic modeling flood

landfall kossin 2018 as a result of climate change with more precipitation falling over a longer duration tropical cyclone driven flood impacts are likely to increase in the future on top of the freshwater component of such events the low atmospheric pressure and strong onshore winds arising from tropical cyclones result in coastal inundation regardless of potential changes to these storm

full physics hydraulic models are too computationally expensive to be used in operational forecasts leskens et al 2014 bhola et al 2018 yet tropical cyclones demand forecasts of multiple flood drivers

locality meaning any plausible flood event will match a pre computed event agnostic inundation simulation of that area provided enough runs with different boundary conditions are executed how rainfall and surge vary in time and space however is less related to the hydrologic conditioning of the ground surface in other words simulating these perils ahead of time is inadvisable given the a priori

freshwater flooding component is set out in wing et al 2017 the us implementation is itself a variant of the global model first described by sampson et al 2015 it has been rigorously tested against thousands of bespoke flood inundation studies carried out by us government agencies concluding that the large scale methodology is approaching the accuracy of traditional local models wing et al 2017 the framework permits rapid construction and execution of model domains as defined by the forecast footprint of us hurricane landfalls its computational hydraulic engine is driven by a variant of the lisflood fp hydraulic model which solves a local inertial form of the shallow water equations in two dimensions over a regular grid 30 m 1 arc second resolution in this case using a highly efficient numerical solution bates et al 2010 de almeida and bates 2013 this grid is populated with elevation values from the 1 arc second version of the usgs national elevation dataset ned with levee information from the us army corps of engineers national levee database explicitly represented this digital elevation model dem has complete coverage of the conterminous us and is thus the crucial component of the framework s applicability to simulate inundation for all potential hurricane landfall locations in the us river hydrography is represented by hydrosheds lehner et al 2008 with those rivers wider than the grid resolution being burnt directly into the dem and narrower streams being represented by the subgrid 1d model of neal et al 2012 fluvial modelling is executed by inserting river discharge information which is ultimately linked to an rffa derived aep an nwm streamflow forecast or a usgs river gauge observation at the relevant inflow points in the stream network while the pluvial model takes spatial rainfall data and drops it directly onto the land surface rain on grid sampson et al 2013 assumptions relating to infiltration capacity are made based on soil information from the harmonized world soil database in conjunction with a modified hortonian infiltration equation morin and benyamini 1977 in urban areas identified using satellite luminosity data elvidge et al 2007 the infiltration capacity is defined using assumed urban drainage design standards the storm surge model component was conceived by bates et al 2005 who adapted the 2d lisflood fp code traditionally used in fluvial settings for coastal flooding using lisflood fp for such an application has precedent as examples smith et al 2012 evaluated its suitability for coastal inundation modelling in the uk and quinn et al 2014 applied the code in a coastal flood risk assessment in this component the coastal boundary line of the model domain is set within oceanic cells just offshore of the coastal flood defenses for each cell along the coastal boundary the predicted peak surge height was extracted from p surge output and used to scale the tidal time series at that location to create a fractional surge height time series water enters the model domain along the boundary in accordance with this time series and the hydraulic model simulates the dynamics of the surge as it interacts with the shoreline and moves inland 2d burnt in the dem and 1d subgrid channels are represented here also meaning the ability of the storm surge to propagate inland via river channels is properly represented a crucial component of coastal flood models e g maskell et al 2014 2 2 nwm hand model noaa nwc the noaa national water center has recently explored the coupling of the national water model to the height above nearest drainage method rodda 2005 rennó et al 2008 nobre et al 2011 2016 this effort forms part of the national flood interoperability experiment maidment 2016 which like this paper seeks to append the neglected receptor component to the flood forecasting cascade fig 1 the hand approach normalizes the dem so that a given pixel takes the value of the vertical distance to the stream it drains to a rating curve is then used to translate nwm flow forecasts to stage for a given river cell and any land cells that drain to this stream location and have a hand value less than the stage become flooded planar approximations such as these which do not consider flow physics have been shown to be less skillful than models which represent the dynamics of flood inundation since the inception of raster based hydraulic modelling bates and de roo 2000 and again more recently afshari et al 2018 owing to their omission of mass and momentum conservation laws in isolated test cases however particularly on confined floodplains with steep valley sides and straight river reaches a planar approach may offer satisfactory performance bates and de roo 2000 furthermore the reduction in model skill may be considered acceptable where rapid solutions are required to large computation problems afshari et al 2018 liu et al 2018 geographies where these methods are appropriate are difficult to specify a priori though since they have not undergone the same level of wide area testing as hydrodynamic approaches e g wing et al 2017 in evaluating the simpler hand based approach alongside the more complex hydraulic model presented here the trade off between including the physics of water flow in a forecast model and computational efficiency can be quantified the nwm hand model was executed for hurricane harvey noaa nwc et al 2018 using the usgs ned at 1 3 arc second resolution as the dem the model was run each day with nwm analysis and assimilation outputs providing a snapshot of the flood extent caused by harvey at that time by taking the maximum extent from all of these hand based simulations an analogous comparison can be made with the fathom hindcast both models intended to simulate the maximum flood extent when driven with observations 2 3 validation data we evaluated the hurricane harvey forecast and hindcast footprints against ground observations of flood extent and depth made by the usgs watson et al 2018 after the event usgs field teams visited impacted basins and collected high water marks hwms in accordance with the guidelines of koenig et al 2016 these are surveyed from the debris or stain lines left by the receding water on the sides of buildings trees fences and other structures horizontal co ordinates are obtained with a gps while vertical heights are referenced to the navd88 datum the 2123 resultant hwms were in combination with usgs gauging station maximum water levels interpolated technique described in musser et al 2016 across 1 4 3 m resolution dems built with lidar data for fourteen sites this provided the current best reconstruction of flood extents from the observed water level data though these observation data are used as a benchmark in this study they are not error free watson et al 2018 listed uncertainties for specific data points in their study and these range from 0 01 m 0 55 m mean 0 07 m though no information was specified regarding the method of quantification for further details see watson et al 2018 2 4 validation metrics firstly the gridded flood depth benchmark data derived from observed water levels were used to test the extent to which the models captured the overall spatial pattern of the flooding for this the same binary pattern measures were used as in wing et al 2017 1 hit r a t e m 1 b 1 m 1 b 1 m 0 b 1 2 false a l a r m r a t i o m 1 b 0 m 1 b 0 m 1 b 1 3 critical s u c c e s s i n d e x m 1 b 1 m 1 b 1 m 0 b 1 m 1 b 0 4 error b i a s m 1 b 0 m 0 b 1 where m and b represent model and benchmark cells respectively and the subscript 1 and 0 indicate if the cell considered is wet and dry respectively the hit rate metric hr eq 1 penalizes type ii errors and is thus a measure of the model s tendency to underpredict the benchmark flood extent it can be interpreted as the proportion of benchmark flooded areas that were replicated by the model the false alarm ratio far eq 2 penalizes type i errors and so represents the tendency of the model to overpredict the benchmark flood extent this metric can be interpreted as the proportion of modelled flooded areas that are dry in the benchmark the critical success index csi eq 3 penalizes both type i and type ii errors thus being a metric that accounts for both under and overprediction it ranges between 0 no match between model and benchmark and 1 perfect match between model and benchmark and can be thought of as representing the model performance over floodplain areas only as it excludes areas that do not inundate in both the model and benchmark data finally error bias eb eq 4 is the ratio of type i to type ii errors values greater than 1 indicate the model tends to overpredict while values less than 1 indicate a tendency to underpredict with respect to the benchmark secondly we calculated the difference in water surface elevation wse specified by the usgs hwms and the models these differences are analyzed in three ways 5 root m e a n s q u a r e d e r r o r n 1 n o n m n 2 n 6 mean a b s o l u t e e r r o r n 1 n o n m n n 7 mean e r r o r n 1 n o n m n n where on and mn is the wse at a given observation point and corresponding model cell respectively n is the number of hwms analyzed and everything else is as above the original dataset was trimmed down to 1134 points so that the analysis was confined to high quality hwms that were not taken at the same location and which were referenced against the same geodetic datum both root mean squared error rmse eq 5 and mean absolute error mae eq 6 measure the average magnitude of the errors where an error is on mn rmse is a quadratic scoring rule meaning greater weight is given to larger errors while mae is linear all errors have equal weight mean error me eq 7 calculates the average error whilst still accounting for their sign a negative me indicates the model has a tendency to overpredict observed wses while a positive one suggests underprediction 3 results and discussion 3 1 flood extent comparison the results of the flood extent comparison between the fathom hindcast model driven with observed streamflow rainfall and surge heights and usgs benchmarks for each of their fourteen study sites are shown in table 1 a and fig 3 most of the usgs flood extent is captured by the model with 78 of observed wet pixels being correctly identified as such in the model on average across all sites many of the sites with high hrs also have relatively high fars e g tres palacios river fig 3a lower san bernard river fig 3l and upper brazos river fig 3b driving a lower overall correspondence and overpredictive bias as indicated by their csis and ebs respectively conversely many lower hr sites have very low fars e g upper and lower neches river fig 3k and 3 m and cow bayou fig 3f generating comparable csis and ebs 1 indicating underprediction some high hr sites have correspondingly high csis owing to low fars e g lower brazos river fig 3e and middle san bernard river fig 3j suggesting there is a strong match between model and benchmark flood extents csis which are the most discriminatory metric range from a poor 0 5 the model is correct as often as it is incorrect on the upper san bernard river fig 3i to an excellent 0 9 a 90 match between model and benchmark on the lower brazos river fig 3b across the domain an average csi of 0 66 indicates that roughly 2 in every 3 model pixels in the functional floodplain match the benchmark further to the details in section 2 3 the usgs benchmark flood inundation extent is subject to uncertainty it is generated via interpolation between point hwms themselves containing vertical error rather than a genuine 2d observation meaning the accuracy of these maps is heavily dependent on the spatial resolution of the hwms without representing the physics of flow that generated the hwms in a hydraulic model e g timing and interaction of adjacent streamflows the interpolation procedure may produce unrealistic inundation extent boundaries where unconstrained by point observations to put the pattern scores into context the wing et al 2017 model attained average csis of 0 75 against detailed local models with a maximum of 0 90 global flood models average csis of 0 50 obtaining up to 0 70 in isolated test cases against a variety of local models and satellite derived flood extents sampson et al 2015 winsemius et al 2016 dottori et al 2016 ward et al 2017 local flood models that have been manually built and extensively calibrated generally achieve csi scores of 0 70 0 80 when compared to satellite observations of flood inundation aronica et al 2002 pappenberger et al 2007 di baldassarre et al 2009 wood et al 2016 and up to 0 9 when benchmarked against very high quality data e g bates et al 2006 altenau et al 2017 fleischmann et al 2019 propose that a hydrodynamic model provides locally relevant estimates of flood extent when csi 0 65 it should be noted that the csi metric is sensitive to the selected study area however favoring overpredictive models of larger floods on flat terrain compared to the reverse case stephens et al 2014 the results shown here are towards the higher end of those in the literature though many of these are for smaller floods where high csis are difficult to obtain the hindcast model performance is however shy of the very high csis exhibited by calibrated local model observation comparisons the results thus indicate that across the model domain the hindcast hydraulic model presented here has some skill in replicating benchmark patterns the results of the comparison between the nwm hand model and the usgs benchmark are shown in table 1b it is evident here that the nwm hand model has lower predictive skill when benchmarked against the usgs flood extents mean hrs indicate 46 of flooded areas are correctly captured with mean csis suggesting just over 4 in every 10 pixels in the functional floodplain are identified correctly it should be noted that the nwm hand model structure is only capable of representing fluvial flood hazard meaning both hydrologically isolated flooding from intense local rainfall and coastal surge will not be captured hurricane harvey was predominantly a pluvial event flooding arose in many areas due to intense local rainfall on the land surface rather than from rivers flowing out of bank fig 4 shows how different the fathom and nwm hand models look when this runoff component is represented in an area to the ne of houston hand being a fluvial only model perhaps explains why coastal basins e g two sites in matagorda bay have such low scores since storm surge may have played an important role here the lack of a rainfall component may explain poor performance on small streams the upper san bernard river has a drainage area of 500 km2 and the san jacinto river site contains headwater streams with drainage areas as small as 20 km2 and both exhibit extremely poor performance with nwm hand the flood hazard arising on these small streams is not driven by traditional fluvial flooding processes where aggregation effects lead to a large low amplitude flood wave which propagates downstream but by the rapid lateral surface flow of intense local rainfall generating a flash flood this further contextualizes the scores obtained by the fathom model at these sites too where despite possessing a pluvial model component the difficulties in simulating this phenomenon are evident with that being said for even the relatively simple problem of modelling the brazos river which has a flat floodplain confined by steep valley sides nwm hand correctly identifies less than half of the pixels the hydrodynamic fathom model in contrast correctly identifies between 74 and 90 of flooding from the brazos for reference csis obtained by hand models have been reported between 0 5 and 0 9 for a selection of watersheds in the us when comparing hand approaches to observational data or hydrodynamic methods zheng et al 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2018 afshari et al 2018 the results from the nwm hand model presented here do not appear to be as skillful as those presented in these smaller scale studies further despite this approach making use of higher resolution 10 m terrain data it is outperformed by a coarser 30 m hydrodynamic model this suggests that the importance of higher grid resolution is only realized when physical processes are represented further to testing the fathom and nwm hand models that were driven with real time observations the fathom forecast variant was also benchmarked against the usgs flood extents it was driven with nwm peak flows from a 3 day forecast commencing at 1800 gmt 6 on 27th august 2017 as well as forecast rainfall and surge data from this time hurricane harvey generated peak streamflows across the domain for over 5 days beyond the horizon of the 3 day forecast model presented here the forecast model output chosen for validation here captures temporally the main hurricane impact in texas which was felt prior to 31st august 2017 the results of this comparison are shown in table 2 where the fathom forecast model sees a performance drop with respect to its hindcast variant mean csi drops by 0 09 and mean hr drops by 0 03 while hrs actually increase for most sites when compared to hindcast performance as high as 99 9 on the lower san bernard river this is amidst a backdrop of increased ebs that indicate a heavy bias towards overprediction mean eb of 84 02 compared to a more modest 1 42 in the hindcast it s worth noting here though that ebs are measured on a logarithmic scale since underprediction is indicated by values less than 1 and overprediction by values greater than 1 a value of 0 5 has the same magnitude bias as a value of 2 yet the mean of these two values is 1 25 not 1 underrepresented by this mean eb therefore are the extremely high underpredictive biases evident on the lower and upper neches river and cow and pine island bayous the use of forecasted rather than observed model inputs is therefore widening the tails of the bias distribution ebs moving further from 1 and reducing overall performance csis decreasing with that being said capturing on average three quarters of benchmark inundated pixels hr while keeping false alarms at 23 far is indicative of fair performance in the forecast model aside from structural errors in the hydraulic model and its components e g the dem the hindcast model contends only with errors in the measured data it is driven with though this is not insignificant 25 40 error in measured flows is common and can be even higher when flows are extreme di baldassarre and montanari 2009 coxon et al 2015 westerberg et al 2016 it is likely to be much lower than uncertainties in the boundary conditions used in the forecast hydraulic model these uncertainties though are typically explored by the use of ensemble prediction systems eps in meteorological e g buizza 2005 and hydrological e g thielen et al 2009 forecast models where many realizations of projected weather or water levels are simulated for a single site cloke and pappenberger 2009 these probabilistic frameworks thus permit some measure of forecast predictability to be quantified in the models presented here there is only a single deterministic flood extent for each day s forecast the reason for this is two fold firstly the noaa nwm itself currently produces deterministic streamflow forecasts for its medium range variant nwm v1 1 was the version in existence during hurricane harvey but current and future versions will improve on this functionality e g nwm v2 will have a 7 member ensemble in the medium range forecast were a probability distribution of projected river discharge available the rapid extraction algorithm that samples from a pre existing library of fluvial flood maps could feasibly produce 2d grids where each cell represents the probability density function of water depth this process takes only seconds so scaling to a probabilistic framework remains trivial secondly the computational expense of running new hydrodynamic pluvial and coastal flood models in an eps would add significant computational burden with that being said running an ensemble of the hydraulic model presented here a single deterministic run requires 120 processor hours would be a manageable task for the hpc facilities of leading forecast centers and so probabilistic depth grids of these flood drivers could be constructed too incorporating the hydrodynamic model in an eps would be a relatively straightforward addition to the method proposed here but is one which is beyond the scope of the current paper digging deeper into the forecast uncertainties observations of peak streamflow from 63 usgs river gauges across the footprint domain are compared to the corresponding nwm streamflow forecast from 27th august 2017 all river gauges used experienced peak flow during this forecast s 3 day time horizon by volume the mean absolute error as in eq 6 but for discharge rather than water surface elevation comes to 2970 m3s 1 for reference this error is equivalent to roughly 80 of the peak discharge experienced on the lower brazos river during hurricane harvey errors as a proportion of the observed discharge are shown in fig 5 the mae is 290 with a very high bias towards overprediction mean error of 281 forecast discharge on the buffalo bayou near addicks was an eighteenfold overestimate an implausible 7129 m3s 1 when 390 m3s 1 was observed in some cases though the nwm was very accurate for instance on the east fork of the san jacinto river near new caney 3492 m3s 1 was forecasted while 3398 m3s 1 was observed it should be noted that this a single forecast from single point in time while the medium range nwm variant is run four times a day for 80 time horizons the testing presented here therefore will not be representative of nwm performance during harvey and should not be viewed as an authoritative assessment of model skill it may be ill fortune that the particular fathom flood extent forecast selected for this study was driven by anomalously poor discharge forecasts but their benchmarking against observed flows provides useful context for analyzing the skill of the 2d flood forecast furthermore the nwm was in its infancy around the time of harvey v1 1 improvements both to date and in the future v2 of this hydrological model after rigorous validation exercises will result in much closer replication of observed streamflows than those presented here official noaa rfc forecasts are of much greater accuracy adams 2016 but do not have total coverage of us rivers in fig 6 the discharge errors at usgs observation sites are plotted and polygons representing the fourteen sites are colored by their error bias from table 2 many of the usgs gauging stations do not relate to sites where usgs benchmark flood extents were generated perhaps explaining why the csis in table 2 are not as low as the discharge errors in fig 5 might suggest stations are heavily concentrated in houston of which only some are relevant to just one of the fourteen study sites san jacinto river fig 6g equally many of the sites do not have a representative usgs gauging station but for those that do biases in the forecast discharge are often replicated in the inundation extent where the site polygon and gauge point are of a similar color in fig 6 forecast flood inundation in the east of the domain was driven by nwm discharges that are generally biased towards underprediction which is reflected in the bias of the flood extent big cow creek fig 6c upper fig 6k and lower neches river fig 6m cow bayou fig 6f pine island bayou fig 6n most of the remaining sites have an overpredictive flood extent bias where nearby gauges indicate that the nwm forecast discharge was overpredictive also upper fig 6b and lower brazos river fig 6e and san jacinto river fig 6g the conclusions drawn in this section generally verify those found in the wider literature that models based on some formulation of the shallow water equations produce a more accurate simulation of flood extent than simple planar approximations though a performance differential of this magnitude has not been documented previously for fluvial flooding in bates et al 2005 the planar method obtained a csi of 0 11 when simulating coastal floods as fully hydrodynamic approaches become increasingly computationally tractable the advantages of using gis based methods will further diminish intuitively the performance of the fathom forecast model is lower than that of its hindcast counterpart partly due to some significant errors in the nwm forecast streamflows and perhaps forecast rainfall relative to observations also yet these results evidence that despite these limitations the forecast model has fair skill in replicating benchmark flood extents for harvey 3 2 high water mark comparison the fathom models were further tested against the raw hwms that the usgs used to construct the benchmark flood extents in the preceding section these observational data represent the maximum water surface elevation surveyed by usgs field teams as a result of hurricane harvey at a given point for the hindcast model the mean absolute wse error between the selected observation points and the modelled value at the same location is 1 03 m the influence of a small number of large outlying error values means that the rmse is significantly higher at 1 71 m fig 7 a outlines the distribution of these wse differences exhibiting a gaussian distribution about a central tendency close to 0 mean error 0 15 m 50 of the errors lie between 0 43 m q25 and 0 90 m q75 while 90 of the errors are between 2 32 m q5 and 2 12 m q95 fig 7b exhibits the expected shallowing and widening of the error distribution when analyzing the fathom forecast model mae rises to 1 22 m rmse 1 88 m however this does not represent a drastic reduction in skill from hindcast to forecast point comparisons of surveyed vs simulated wses are a particularly stringent test for a model of this scale indeed such examinations are rarely carried out for analogous models particularly uncalibrated large scale high resolution ones which include urban areas and smaller streams meaning context setting for these results is quite difficult the wilson et al 2007 model of the amazon obtained an rmse of 2 37 m 0 99 m at high water when comparing simulated water levels to those derived from satellite altimetry data schumann et al 2013 calibrated their 1 km resolution forecasting model of the lower zambezi river to within 0 27 m of icesat derived water levels this though is the product of using a smooth coarse resolution dem of a very flat and wide floodplain meaning wses change very little as the flood extent grows obtaining low errors under such circumstances is much less challenging than in the test case presented here especially when the zambezi model has been calibrated to observations neal et al 2009 in a high resolution reach scale hydraulic model of an urban area built with local data obtained a maximum rmse of 0 28 m when calibrated to hwms as another example the standard deviation of errors in the calibrated mignot et al 2006 model of an urban area in france was 0 53 m it should be noted that hydraulic models that have been calibrated may not necessarily be more inherently skillful meaning these local scale model errors may not be analogous to the uncalibrated large scale model presented here as an example of an operational noaa flood forecast adams et al 2018 compare modelled hindcasts of their large scale framework in the midwest to usgs gauged stages and found errors of 0 5 m while this is more accurate than the model presented here it required thousands of manual bathymetric surveys to build meaning the adams et al 2018 model only simulates flooding on large rivers of known geometry in the context of hurricane harvey where flooding from small streams and surface runoff accounted for a considerable portion of the hazard this noaa exemplar model may not have attained similar errors when benchmarked against high water marks on the floodplain and particularly where flooding was predominantly pluvial zheng 2018 tested the nwm hand model of maximum inundation outlined in the preceding section noaa nwc et al 2018 against this same set of usgs hwms and found the standard deviation of model error to be 4 m previous studies have also quantified the errors in surveyed hwms that such models are calibrated to or validated against errors are generally 0 3 0 5 m schumann et al 2007 neal et al 2009 horritt et al 2010 fewtrell et al 2011 owing to deposition during a hiatus in flood recession i e not high water wall seepage or debris line width these are broadly consistent with the maximum errors reported for the hwms used in this study but average errors are generally 0 1 m watson et al 2018 it is clear that the automatically generated forecast and hindcast models in this paper do not obtain comparable wse errors to bespoke hydraulic models in the wider literature or noaa nws rfc forecasts though without hydraulic model calibration local data and manual operation they were never likely to it is also important to point out the difference in purpose between this and other models rather than seeking to perfectly replicate a given flood event with few limitations regarding processing and computation time this is a forecast product designed to quickly indicate areas susceptible to flooding from an incoming storm to enable an immediate response rapid exposure assessments and resource allocation by first responders do not demand a highly accurate map of water depths but rather a broad indication of the spatial patterns in flooding that may occur pitt 2008 price et al 2012 despite some sacrifice to point precision e g with respect to the accuracy of the 155 discrete forecast inundation points in noaa ahps the framework s total coverage both in geography and flood driver serves to fill the information gaps left by sporadic yet accurate local forecasts besides efforts to reduce wse errors in the hydraulic model are of little value when considering the commensurate or larger errors in the meteorological and hydrological models that precede it in the forecast cascade cangialosi 2018 noted that intensity and track errors in the noaa nhc 3 day forecasts during the 2017 hurricane season were 7 ms 1 and 150 km respectively the maximum total rainfall in the noaa wpc 3 day forecast was 1000 mm yet a maximum of over 1500 mm was observed blake and zelinsky 2018 hydrological models used to translate rainfall to streamflow may also be significantly uncertain even if the meteorological inputs were error free blöschl et al 2013 generally accepted benchmarks for satisfactory performance in hydrological models are i within 25 error in simulated discharge and ii a nash sutcliffe efficiency of greater than 0 5 meaning model mean square discharge error represents less than half of the observed variance moriasi et al 2007 refsgaard and knudsen 1996 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 with source and pathway uncertainties such as these propagating into the receptor component of the forecast cascade fig 1 the hydraulic model deviating from observations by an average of 1 m is unsurprising yet may still be useful for event early warning and first responder preparedness in the absence of local modelling strategies 659 of the hwms collected by the usgs also reported the height of the water above the ground surface meaning a surveyed ground elevation can be calculated by subtracting this measurement of water depth from the wse comparing these elevation values to those contained at the corresponding location in the dem provides further context for the errors shown in fig 7a and b again it should be noted that the observed data contends with error in both the surveyed water surface elevation and its height above the ground such errors could plausibly be half a meter or more watson et al 2018 fig 7c shows the spread of these elevation errors the dem rmse is 3 77 m though this is heavily biased by a handful of implausibly high errors maximum negative error 58 9 m maximum positive error 20 9 m which are just as likely to be due to human error in the manual ground survey as erroneous values in the dem reducing the influence of these errors by considering mae the quantity stands at 1 19 m with forecast and hindcast wse maes of 1 21 and 1 03 m respectively the water levels simulated by the model are similar to or outperform the accuracy of the dem implying two key findings firstly much of the wse error is attributable to the quality of the usgs ned the source of the model dem in this domain it stands to reason then that in domains with a greater proportion of lidar in the ned ground and thus water surface elevation error would drop once again the assertion made by horritt and bates 2002 still holds topography is the major control on flood inundation patterns secondly although it seems counterintuitive that errors in wse can be smaller than the dem from which they are derived this underlines the idea that relative rather than absolute dem accuracy is much more important in hydraulic modelling how the elevation varies between pixels in a locality controls the movement of water over a floodplain not a pixel s elevation relative to a vertical datum though this does not apply for simulations of coastal flooding typically relative dem errors are much lower than absolute ones gesch et al 2014 quantified a 20 reduction in the standard deviation of relative compared to absolute errors in the ned at 1 3 arc second resolution fig 8 displays the spatial distribution of the wse errors for the hindcast areas of high performance in white errors between 0 5 and 0 5 m are evident across the domain particularly in matagorda and brazoria counties south of houston approx 29 2 n 95 5 w to the south of the top left panel in fig 8 jefferson and hardin counties to houston s east approx 30 1 n 94 3 w and in parts of houston s harris county itself approx 29 9 n 95 4 w there is clear clustering to areas of poor performance coastal areas in the southwest of the domain around corpus christi have a positive bias indicating the model underpredicted observed hwms in these areas this is also the case around village creek north of beaumont approx 30 4 n 94 2 w clusters of very high negative errors are present along houston s buffalo bayou approx 29 8 n 95 5 w to the north of the top left panel in fig 8 and the calcasieu river in lake charles 30 2 n 93 2 w to the east of the top right panel in fig 8 signaling model overprediction of wses incorporating fig 9 into this interpretation which exhibits the spatial distribution of the dem errors in fig 7c it may be expected that areas of high wse error are also areas of high ground elevation error observing figs 8 and 9 in tandem suggests that this is not the case areas of low wse error to the south of houston are in fact dominated by relatively high ground elevation error as colors move away from white towards red and black while ground elevation errors in areas identified as having high wse error houston and lake charles are low or if anything of the opposite sign to the wse errors this reinforces the suggestion that relative and not absolute dem accuracy is pre eminent and draws on the well documented challenges of hydraulic modelling in urban areas yu and lane 2006a mason et al 2007 hunter et al 2008 especially at large scales wing et al 2017 high wse errors are generally confined to urban areas in this study where horizontal rather than vertical elevation accuracy i e grid resolution controls flood model performance to a much greater extent than elsewhere this is due to the increased prevalence of hydraulically important anthropogenic features small scale flow paths building walls levees roads and much else which are unresolved by the elevation data since they are smaller than the width of a grid cell in the absence of the computational capacity available to run large scale models at very high resolution e g sampson et al 2012 which is some distance from feasibility given doubling the granularity of grid resolution increases computation time by an order of magnitude savage et al 2016 the solution to this problem may lie with nested or variable resolution grids where high risk cities can be modelled at finer resolution e g sanders et al 2010 kim et al 2014 sanders and schubert 2019 or innovative sub grid scale solutions e g yu and lane 2006b sanders et al 2008 schubert and sanders 2012 guinot et al 2017 the bottleneck of the latter approach being obtaining parameterization data at large scale 4 conclusions this paper presents a flood forecasting product for hurricanes in the us that has the potential to be used operationally in the absence of accurate local forecasts comprehensively testing it against ground truth data collected by the usgs the framework takes available hydrologic noaa forecasts as inputs to an existing continental scale model structure wing et al 2017 accounting for all primary flood drivers in order to rapidly simulate event water depth grids for a given domain anywhere in the us comparing model hindcasts of hurricane harvey to benchmark data of its maximum flood extent indicates that the model has skill in picking up the spatial patterns of inundation mean csi value of 0 66 when benchmarked against surveyed water surface elevations the model misestimates this quantity by roughly 1 m on average this is amidst a backdrop of similar errors in the dem and up to 0 5 m of error in the measured hwms the model in forecast mode experiences only a moderate drop in performance relative to the hindcast we conclude this to be commensurate to or beneath likely uncertainties in the preceding components of the forecast cascade as well as similar to errors in the underlying dem with expanded lidar coverage within the usgs ned the model presented here may approach the accuracy of operational noaa inundation forecasts adams et al 2018 mashriqui et al 2014 but with total coverage and for a diverse range of flood drivers leading forecast centers generally only produce point water levels and flows e g river discharge storm surge height neglecting the crucial receptor component that translates this information to a 2d grid of flood depths in favor of focusing almost exclusively on improved meteorological modelling contemporary 1d approaches by noaa rfcs are likely more accurate and computationally efficient in fluvial settings but these are only available in limited areas with accurate local data this paper shows that large scale hydraulic modelling of fluvial pluvial and coastal flooding can and should play a role in medium term forecasts outperforming simpler gis based approaches with the hydrodynamics of pluvial and coastal flooding from hurricane harvey taking only 6 hours to run on a single node of 20 cores and extractions from a pre computed library of fluvial flood maps taking only seconds forecast centers can couple such a module to their existing medium term forecast frameworks and provide benefits to a plethora of end users while sacrificing only a marginal portion of available computation time the principle of sampling from a pre computed inventory of flood maps could permit this framework to be applied in a probabilistic ensemble forecast an important method in accounting for model and exogenic errors this will be addressed in forthcoming research employing a true hydrodynamic model which properly represents the physics of floodplain flow is shown to outstrip the performance of a simplified gis based approach while these planar approximations have gained in popularity due to their quick and dirty solutions to computationally intensive problems we have demonstrated that this is not a substitute for 2d hydraulic modelling in this instance mass and momentum conserving hydraulic codes are shown to be suitably fast and much more accurate than zero physics approaches even over large scales where such simulations have historically been intractable looking to the future improved representation of terrestrial features through sub grid parameterization e g guinot et al 2017 sanders and schubert 2019 more comprehensive inventories of defense structures scussolini et al 2016 and large scale acquisition of river channel information

8607,the optimal allocation and utilization of irrigation water are particularly significant but complex in multi stage pumping water irrigation systems which involve both water distribution processes and machine operation management this paper proposes a regional optimization coordination model for optimizing irrigation water allocation in complex multi stage pumping water irrigation system which is developed according to actual water use problems in guhai pumping water irrigation system gpis located in ningxia hui autonomous region northwest china the model is a three level hieratical structure with minimum water deficiency and energy cost as two objectives for better describing the coordination and constraint between multiple levels of irrigation planning and decision making the three levels deal with the optimal schemes of pumping and allocating water in each single pumping irrigation subdistrict pis first level among multi stage pumping irrigation subdistrict of each subsystem second level and among different subsystems third level respectively the model is solved by using decomposition coordination method and each level is connected and iterated through the exchange of coordinating variables the model is applied and tested in the optimizations of pumping and allocating water for each pis in each period in gpis results show that the range of water deficiency among different pis is significantly reduced and pumping water amount for the lower stage pis is particularly increased under different conditions of total water delivery amount spatial temporal contradictions of water supply among multi stage pumping stations could be effectively alleviated through optimizations the application indicates that the optimization coordination model is practical and effective for decision making of irrigation water management in the complex multi stage pumping water irrigation system and could be a reference for other similar irrigation systems worldwide keywords irrigation water allocation optimization multi stage pumping stations decomposition coordination method multi objective 1 introduction the optimization of irrigation system is an effective measure to realize reasonable high efficient and sustainable use of water resources in irrigated areas playán and mateos 2006 relevant researches have been widely conducted since 1960s worldwide with deepening of researches and development of techniques the connotation of water allocation optimization is increasingly abundant the scale of researches has been extended from water allocation optimizations on field and crop scale to joint optimizations of multilevel decision making and different water sources on regional scale shang and mao 2006 safavi et al 2010 ge et al 2013 homayounfar et al 2014 the research contents have also been enlarged from only water quantity allocation concerns to considering water quality and related eco environmental benefits fleifle et al 2014 allam et al 2016 heydari et al 2016 as for research methods the traditional programing methods like linear programing non linear programing and dynamic programing etc singh 2014 have recently been evolved to intelligent programing methods like genetic algorithm ga artificial neural network ann ant colony optimization aco particle swarm optimization pao and simulated annealing algorithm sa haq et al 2008 brown et al 2010 noory et al 2011 singh 2015 nguyen et al 2016 optimization models are not just limited to single programing models but developed to coupling models of mathematical models simulation techniques and vector optimization theory etc singh and panda 2013 makaremi et al 2017 naghibi et al 2017 mathematical descriptions of optimization questions have begun to consider the trade off of different aspects by using multiple objectives e g economic benefits and environmental implication rather than just single objective singh 2012 marques et al 2015 li et al 2018 meanwhile several uncertainty theories have been widely introduced into optimization models for considering the uncertainties in actual irrigation optimization problems in recent years li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in these researches the optimization in multi stage pumping water irrigation systems mpis is a more complicated problem which not only involve optimizations of water distribution system but also the regulations of pumping station system in recent years several attempts have been done to develop different optimization models to assist the operation of complex pumping water irrigation system makaremi et al 2017 ming et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 most of researches are focused on the optimal design and operation of pumping stations related to the energy costs such as pumping head optimization operation scheduling of pumping stations and operation efficiency improved garcía et al 2014 moradi jalal et al 2003 napolitano et al 2016 while water allocation optimization in the mpis refers to both water distribution management and pumping station operation which is usually characterized by multi objective and multi level structure on a regional scale however the mathematical sophistication of optimization models characteristics of multi dimension or oversimplification of irrigation network etc restricted the model applications and acceptances boulos et al 2001 as a result it is meaningful to develop reasonable effective and practical optimization models for regional optimization of irrigation water use in mpis rather than overly complicate and sensitive models the decomposition coordination method for large system has an advantage of decomposing complex problems into the combination of relatively simple optimization problems which reduce the dimensions of optimizations on a regional scale for example shangguan et al 2002 developed a three level optimization model to solve optimal water allocation from canals to crops jiang et al 2016 developed a regional economic optimization model with two level structures for regional optimal allocation of irrigation water lu et al 2019 developed a multi level non linear optimization model for groundwater remediation management with considering the leader follower relationships among multiple levels meanwhile multi objective programing is also widely applied to deal with harmonization management between multiple aspect of economy environment ecology and society hu et al 2016 davijani et al 2016 li et al 2019 various multi objective optimization models have been developed through combining with different theories or methods such as stochastic multi objective programming model fuzzy multi objective programming model and dynamic multi objective programming model etc bai et al 2015 alizadeh et al 2017 li et al 2019b it is an important way for the optimization of complex systems to develop multi objective hierarchical analysis by combining large system theory and multi objective method thus the optimizations referring to different benefit based relationships or decision making levels in complex mpis could be described using a multi level multi objective optimization coordination model therefore in this paper a multi level optimization coordination model with multi objectives is developed for optimal irrigation water allocation according to the characteristics of multi stage pumping water irrigation system based on the decomposition coordination method for large system the model is constructed with a three level hierarchical structure in order to better describe and coordinate the irrigation planning processes between different decision making levels in the whole irrigation system the minimum water requirement and energy cost shaft power are taken as two objectives and different periods are considered for detailed schedules for water allocation and operation the model is then applied and tested to obtain optimal schemes of pumping and allocating water for different stage of pumping station systems and different irrigated areas under conditions of limited water resources this study aims at dealing with the optimal allocation of irrigation water in complex multi stage pumping water irrigation systems with considering different levels of decision making processes 2 irrigation system description the guhai pumping water irrigation system gpis 36 11 37 18 n 105 35 106 12 e is located in the middle arid area of the ningxia hui autonomous region northwest china the gpis is 100 km long from north to south and 10 km wide from east to west covering an acreage of approximately 738 km2 fig 1 while the elevation varies from about 1205 m in the north to about 1621 m in the south the study area has a continental arid climate characterized by average annual precipitation of only 286 mm 70 of which occurring during july to september while the mean annual reference evapotranspiration et o reaches to about 996 mm the growing season is generally from march to september and the major irrigated crops include corn spring wheat and some economic crops e g lycium barbarum etc while the local agriculture is mostly dependent on irrigation due to low rainfall two different irrigation methods are mainly applied in gpis which are traditional irrigation e g flood or border irrigation and high efficient irrigation e g drip irrigation respectively the gpis is characterized by its machine driven irrigation due to larger elevation difference of approximately 420 m from north to south there are 25 major pumping stations and more than 200 pumping units as well as several secondary pumping water systems in total at present the source of irrigation water comes from the yellow river in the north and is transported from north to south through multi stage pumping stations fig 1 the total designed pumping flow is 41 2 m3 s 1 and the designed capacity of delivery water is 487 million m3 the gpis mainly consists of three subsystems each of which is controlled by several pumping stations and main channels fig 1 subsystem 1 pumps water through 12 major pumping stations with total pumping head of 479 7 m subsystem 2 pumps water mainly through 8 major pumping stations with total pumping head of 382 5 m subsystem 3 contains 4 stages of pumping stations with total pumping head of 253 1 m the details of each subsystem are listed in table 1 water delivery and allocation are complicated processes in gpis which not only includes the joint operation of multi stage pumping stations but also the allocation of water amount among different subsystems and pumping stations as well as different irrigated areas water allocation in the whole system depends on the available water delivery amount crop water requirement the operation of pumping stations and the regulation of canal systems therefore the gpis can be regarded as a large system with multilevel decision making processes and complex structures which could be described and solved by using decomposition coordination method for large system 3 mathematic model 3 1 model generalization for simplification the optimization model only considered the processes of pumping and allocating water among the major pumping stations and took other secondary pumping stations as parts of water distribution therefore each pumping station had only one upper stage station and one lower stage station each pumping station and its water supply subdistrict were defined as a pumping irrigation subdistrict pis and each subsystem numbered 1 to 3 could thus be regarded as a cascade system of multi stage pumping irrigation subdistricts the gpis could be thus taken as a large system that consists of three cascade pumping irrigation subsystems and an initial pumping station quanyan station the water was delivered from the yellow river through the initial pumping station and then was transported to each subsystem and each pis through multi stage pumping and allocating and finally to different irrigated areas meanwhile two types of irrigated areas were identified in the model so as to differentiate these two different irrigation methods the water allocation for each pis refers to the total water amount allocated to its water supply subdistrict including traditional and high efficient irrigated areas the simplified network of water supply in gpis is shown in fig 2 based on the decomposition coordination method for large system an optimization coordination model with a three level hierarchical structure was developed for gpis so as to better describe its multi level and interrelated characteristics each level developed a simple optimization model with two objectives for considering the water limitation and energy cost in the processes of water allocation the first level dealt with the optimization of water allocation within each single pis and thus contained 24 independent models in total the second level dealt with the optimization of water allocation among multi stage pumping stations which contained three independent models corresponding to three subsystems the third level performed the optimization as a whole for water allocation among three subsystems these three levels were solved individually and coordinated through the information exchanges of pumping flow water requirement and energy cost of each pis and subsystem the whole model was operated iteratively among three levels until the ending criterion was reached while the optimal solutions of each level were constrained by the updated coordinated variables in each iteration the detailed structure of the optimization coordination model is presented in fig 3 3 2 model formulation the detailed mathematical description of the optimization coordination model is presented in this section to present the model a list of notations is provided in table 2 it should be noted that the water requirement defined for each level is gross water requirement with considering the water use efficiency of irrigation system 3 2 1 first level optimization of water allocation within each single pumping irrigation subdistrict in each period the purpose of this level is to optimize water allocation between traditional irrigated areas and high efficient irrigated areas as well as the regulation of pumping units in order to minimize the water deficiency amount and energy cost within each single pis the detailed mathematical model is as follows objective function to minimize the total water deficiency amount and total shaft power of the pumping station in each pis i e 1 min f n j

where 9 81 is the acceleration of gravity m s 2 3 2 2 second level optimization of water allocation among multi stage pumping irrigation subdistricts in each subsystem in each period the model of this level was formulated for optimizing water allocation among different stages of pis in each subsystem the objective is to minimize the total water deficiency amount and total shaft power of each subsystem the objective functions are formulated as follows 11 min f n j 1 j f n j j 1 j i 1 i d n j i s n j i 2 12 min z n j 1 j z n j j 1 j i 1 i c n j q n j i h n j where 13 d n j i r n j i k n j i

capacity and river water level and can be determined based on the designed flow of main canals in the third level model in this paper 3 3 model solution the three level optimization coordination model was solved based on the decomposition coordination method for large system the multi objective model in each level was transformed to a single objective function using the minimum deviation method which is a modified method based on global criterion method proos et al 2001 marler and arora 2004 and the idea of relative deviation the mathematical formulations of multiple objectives in the three levels could thus be respectively described as follows 27 the first level w n j f n j f min n j f max n j f min n j z n j z min n j z max n j z min n j 28 the second level w n f n f min n f max n f min n z n z min n z max n z min n 29 the third level w f f min f max f min z z min z max z min the execution started from the first level through initially giving a set of pumping flow q n j i and water allocation s n j i taking water allocation and pumping flow of each level model as the coordinated variables the coupling constraints should be satisfied for water allocation using eqs 5 and 6 and eqs 18 and 20 the steps for solving are presented in a flowchart fig 4 which is described as follows 1 the initial values for pumping flow and water allocation were given to the first level model based on the historical data 2 under the given pumping flow and water allocation of each pumping station the first level model was operated for optimal allocation of pumping flow among units i e q n j m and water amount between traditional and high efficient irrigated areas i e x n j i and y n j i the optimal schemes of operation and water allocation were obtained for each pis in each subsystem as well as the energy cost per unit of pumping water c n j and water requirement d n j i within each pis 3 the energy cost c n j and water requirement d n j i were then input into the second level then under the initially given q n i and s n i of each subsystem the second level was optimized based on the imported c n j and d n j i to obtain the optimal allocation of pumping flow and water allocation among multi stage pumping stations q n i j and s n i j meanwhile the energy cost per unit of pumping water c n and water requirement d n i for each subsystem were also obtained and imported to the third level as initial conditions for optimization 4 with the approved total water delivery amount s the third level model was operated based on the c n and d n i to obtain the optimal allocation of pumping flow and water supply among different subsystems q n i and s n i as well as total energy cost z and water requirement d of the whole system 5 the optimized results q and s from the second and third level models were transferred back to the first and second level models as new coordinated variables respectively 6 with the feedback of updated coordinated variables q and s the steps of 2 5 were conducted repeatedly 7 this calculation was repeatedly iterated until the objective value of the third level w reached the criterion as follow 30 w p w p 1 w p 1 ε where p is the number of iterations ε is the maximum threshold of the difference between two iterations and was set to 0 005 here 4 model application 4 1 model setup considering different scenarios the basic data required by the model were collected from the guhai irrigation district management department including total amount of approved water delivery crop pattern irrigation schedules and parameters of each pumping station e g total net pumping head number and parameters of pumping units designed operation mode designed max pumping flow irrigated areas of each pis etc as well as the actual pumping water and water allocation schemes for each pis in recent years the water requirements in different levels of the model were calculated according to several terms i e crop pattern irrigated area irrigation schedules and water use efficiency of canal systems according to field surveys high efficient irrigation methods are mainly applied to local economic crops while other crops still used traditional irrigation methods thus the irrigated areas and irrigation schedules of economic crops and other crops were used to calculate water requirement i e d n j i for the two types of irrigated areas respectively the water diversion in gpis lasts from april to august meanwhile there is a winter irrigation in november thus in this study the irrigation period was subdivided into 6 of time intervals and every time interval was set to 30 days equally the parameters of each pumping station and units were determined according to the collected actual parameters the maximum number of pumping units within each station was identified based on the total number of units actually installed in this pumping station but not considered spare units the present situation adopted the actual total water diversion amount and water allocation scheme in gpis in 2017 three scenarios of total water diversion amount in the whole system were defined according to the approved maximum water diversion and minimum total water requirement table 3 where the total water diversion was gradually increased reduced by 5 until it approached the maximum minimum limitation 4 2 results and discussion 4 2 1 optimal water allocation among multi stage pumping stations under the level of present water diversion amount the comparison of optimized results of water allocation with present values for gpis is shown in table 4 in the present situation the pumping stations at all stages pumped and allocated water at the same time which easily caused larger water shortage in the whole system especially in the lower stage pis since the limited total water diversion and unreasonable planning of water allocation while through optimizations the differences between water allocation and requirement hereafter referred to as water deficiency in each pis was decreased from the present values of 5 10 6 33 million m3 to the optimized values of 0 03 0 66 million m3 with a significant reduction of variation range table 4 positive value represented water surplus it indicated that the optimized water allocation for each pis was much closer to the water requirement of each pis and the optimal scheme was more reasonable in the present situation water deficiency in subsystem 1 was the most significant since it has maximum pumping water stages 12 stages and highest pumping head 428 7 m and thus greater difficulties in the coordination between different stages of pumping station as for subsystem 3 the pumping water amount was larger than its total requirement due to its only 4 stage pumping stations and small irrigated areas after optimizations the total amount of water allocation was increased in subsystem 1 while were slightly decreased in subsystem 2 and 3 table 4 meanwhile the pumping and allocating water amounts of the lower stage pis were increased in all subsystems table 4 which significantly alleviated the contradiction of water allocation between upper stage and lower stage pis at present in addition despite the shaft power was increased for many pumping stations after optimizations due to its increased pumping flow the total shaft power of the whole system changed insignificantly as compared with the present values table 4 under the level of present water diversion amount the optimal schemes of pumping and allocating water for each pis in different periods are shown as figs 5 and 6 the optimized water allocation basically met the water requirement of each pis in different periods fig 5 since the water requirements are generally larger in the key periods of crop growth june to august the pumping and allocating water amounts were relatively larger during these months than others for each pis in the optimal schemes figs 5 and 6 meanwhile the pumping and allocating water amounts during different periods were all increased for the lower stage pis as compared with the present schemes while they were decreased in some periods for the upper stage pis due to the constraints of the total water amount figs 5 and 6 in general the spatiotemporal contradiction of water allocation in the multi stage pumping water system was relieved through the optimizations of water supply regulation both water requirements in key periods of crop growth and pumping water amount for lower stage pumping stations were effectively satisfied 4 2 2 optimal schemes of water allocation and operation schedules within single pumping irrigation subdistrict in the optimizations detailed water allocation schemes in each period within each single pis were obtained and presented as allocation ratio in fig 7 the allocation ratio was defined as the ratio of water allocation between different irrigated areas during each period to the total water allocation of this pumping irrigation subdistrict since the water allocation between traditional irrigated and high efficient irrigated areas was based on its water requirement in different periods the water allocation schemes within each single pis were affected by crop water requirements and also closely related to the irrigated area and crop pattern with the increases of water requirement in key growing periods june to august water allocations in these months were all increased for both traditional and high efficient irrigated areas which accounted for more than 20 of the total water allocation of most pis fig 7 while the ratio of water allocation between these two types of irrigated areas was mainly determined by the planting ratio of economic crops and grain crops the pis with higher planting ratio of economic crops generally had a larger ratio of water allocation for high efficient irrigated areas for example the water allocation ratio of high efficient irrigated areas was approximately 80 in the pis of 2 1 and 2 3 in different periods due to more than 50 of the planting ratio of economic crops fig 7 and table 1 the water allocation for high efficient irrigation usually needs sedimentation in ponds firstly for removing sediment from the yellow river thus the results were helpful for local irrigation managers to make decisions in advance while the 1 2 to 1 4 and 3 1 pumping stations were only employed to lift water for lower stage pis there were nearly no irrigated areas in these pis and thus no water allocation in the optimizations meanwhile the operating state of all units and its pumping flow within each pumping stations were optimized in this study and the optimized operation schedules are presented as table 5 the pumping flow referred to the total flow of all operating units in the pumping station and was regulated mainly by changing the number of operating units and its pumping flow in each period the pumping flow of each pumping station was the largest in the peak periods of water requirement july to august thus the number of operating units also reached to maximum table 5 in contrast the number of operating units was relatively less in the period of lower water requirement april may and november in order to guarantee appropriate pumping flow and efficiency of each unit which could improve the total operational efficiency and reduce the energy cost in each pumping station 4 2 3 optimized results under different scenarios of water supply the effects of water diversion amount changes on the optimizations were discussed further when the total water diversion amount was adequate e g scenario 1 the pumping water amount in each pis was restricted by both energy cost and water requirement hence the water allocation for each pis was not quite larger than its water requirements fig 8 there were also minor differences between the pumping water amount in scenario 1 and that in present optimal schemes fig 9 while with relatively less water diversion amount e g scenario 3 the optimizations were mainly constrained by water requirements hence pumping water amount would be maximized as far as possible in order to reduce the water deficiency as shown in figs 8 and 9 the pumping water amount in each pis was decreased as the decrease of the total water diversion amount and its water deficiency was increased accordingly however the variation range of water deficiency in the whole irrigation system was still lower than the present values despite the total water deficiency was larger than the present fig 8 the pumping water amount in each pis was decreased by 3 15 in scenario 3 as compared to the optimized results at present while the pumping water amount in lower stage pis was still increased as compared with the present fig 9 particularly water allocation was more uniformly distributed among different pis and similar to its water requirement without significant deficits 15 in all scenarios fig 8 for example when the total water delivery amount was reduced by 10 scenario 3 the water deficiency of each pis ranged from 0 07 to 1 91 million m3 which was less than the present range 5 10 to 6 33 million m3 the scenario analysis further indicated that the optimization coordination model could better coordinate water allocation between different stages of pis under different conditions of water diversion 5 conclusion a regional multi level multi objective optimization coordination model was formulated for optimizing water allocation in complex multi stage pumping water irrigation system which taking the guhai pumping water irrigation system gpis of ningxia hui autonomous region northwest china as a case study the model had a three level hieratical structure and was solved based on the decomposition coordination method for large system the first level dealt with the optimal water allocation among different irrigated areas within each single pumping irrigation subdistrict pis the second level sought out the optimal schemes of pumping and allocating water among multi stage pumping irrigation subdistrict in each subsystem the third level concerns the optimal allocation of water supply among different subsystems in each level minimizing water requirement and energy cost shaft power were taken as two objectives and different irrigation periods were considered to obtain detailed schedules for water allocation and operation the three levels could be solved independently and meanwhile was connected through the exchange of irrigation water allocation and energy cost of each level this model could better describe the coordination and constraints of multi level planning and decision making processes as well as the effects of multiple factors including the operating rules of pumping stations reasonable allocation between different pumping stations and units and water limitations optimal schemes of water allocation for each pis of different subsystem were proposed including schemes of pumping and allocating water among each pis and water allocation and operation within each pis the optimized results showed that the range of water deficiency among different pis was reduced from the present values of 5 10 6 33 million m3 to the optimized values of 0 03 0 66 million m3 under the level of present water delivery amount particularly both the pumping water amount and water allocation were increased for the lower stage pis in each subsystem meanwhile the water requirement of each pis in each period could be better satisfied to certain extend through optimizations particularly in the peak period of irrigation e g june august scenarios analysis for three water delivery levels showed that the ranges of water deficiency were smaller than the present range under all levels of water delivery amount model application indicated that the model could better balance the spatial temporal contradictions of water supply among different subsystems and multi stage pumping stations under different conditions of water delivery in summary this paper presents a practical and efficient method for optimizing water allocation in complex multi stage pumping water systems which can also be applied for references in other similar irrigation systems additionally further studies can be conducted for better decision making support such as considering the uncertainty of crop water requirement and predicting water requirement in advance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

8607,the optimal allocation and utilization of irrigation water are particularly significant but complex in multi stage pumping water irrigation systems which involve both water distribution processes and machine operation management this paper proposes a regional optimization coordination model for optimizing irrigation water allocation in complex multi stage pumping water irrigation system which is developed according to actual water use problems in guhai pumping water irrigation system gpis located in ningxia hui autonomous region northwest china the model is a three level hieratical structure with minimum water deficiency and energy cost as two objectives for better describing the coordination and constraint between multiple levels of irrigation planning and decision making the three levels deal with the optimal schemes of pumping and allocating water in each single pumping irrigation subdistrict pis first level among multi stage pumping irrigation subdistrict of each subsystem second level and among different subsystems third level respectively the model is solved by using decomposition coordination method and each level is connected and iterated through the exchange of coordinating variables the model is applied and tested in the optimizations of pumping and allocating water for each pis in each period in gpis results show that the range of water deficiency among different pis is significantly reduced and pumping water amount for the lower stage pis is particularly increased under different conditions of total water delivery amount spatial temporal contradictions of water supply among multi stage pumping stations could be effectively alleviated through optimizations the application indicates that the optimization coordination model is practical and effective for decision making of irrigation water management in the complex multi stage pumping water irrigation system and could be a reference for other similar irrigation systems worldwide keywords irrigation water allocation optimization multi stage pumping stations decomposition coordination method multi objective 1 introduction the optimization of irrigation system is an effective measure to realize reasonable high efficient and sustainable use of water resources in irrigated areas playán and mateos 2006 relevant researches have been widely conducted since 1960s worldwide with deepening of researches and development of techniques the connotation of water allocation optimization is increasingly abundant the scale of researches has been extended from water allocation optimizations on field and crop scale to joint optimizations of multilevel decision making and different water sources on regional scale shang and mao 2006 safavi et al 2010 ge et al 2013 homayounfar et al 2014 the research contents have also been enlarged from only water quantity allocation concerns to considering water quality and related eco environmental benefits fleifle et al 2014 allam et al 2016 heydari et al 2016 as for research methods the traditional programing methods like linear programing non linear programing and dynamic programing etc singh 2014 have recently been

et al 2008 brown et al 2010 noory et al 2011 singh 2015 nguyen et al 2016 optimization models are not just limited to single programing models but developed to coupling models of mathematical models simulation techniques and vector optimization theory etc singh and panda 2013 makaremi et al 2017 naghibi et al 2017 mathematical descriptions of optimization questions have begun to consider the trade off of different aspects by using multiple objectives e g economic benefits and environmental implication rather than just single objective singh 2012 marques et al 2015 li et al 2018 meanwhile several uncertainty theories have been widely introduced into optimization models for considering the uncertainties in actual irrigation optimization problems in recent years li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in these researches the optimization in multi stage pumping water irrigation systems mpis is a more complicated problem which not only involve optimizations of water distribution system but also the regulations of pumping station system in recent years several attempts have been done to develop different optimization models to assist the operation of complex pumping water irrigation system makaremi et al 2017 ming et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 most of researches are focused on the optimal design and operation of pumping stations related to the energy costs such as pumping head optimization operation scheduling of pumping stations and operation efficiency improved garcía et al 2014 moradi jalal et al 2003 napolitano et al 2016 while water allocation optimization in the mpis refers to both water distribution management and pumping station operation which is usually characterized by multi objective and multi level structure on a regional scale however the mathematical sophistication of optimization models characteristics of multi dimension or oversimplification of irrigation network etc restricted the model applications and acceptances boulos et al 2001 as a result it is meaningful to develop reasonable effective and practical optimization models for regional optimization of irrigation water use in mpis rather than overly complicate and sensitive models the decomposition coordination method for large system has an advantage of decomposing complex problems into the combination of relatively simple optimization problems which reduce the dimensions of optimizations on a regional scale for example shangguan et al 2002 developed a three level optimization model to solve optimal water allocation from canals to crops jiang et al 2016 developed a regional economic optimization model with two level structures for regional optimal allocation of irrigation water lu et al 2019 developed a multi level non linear optimization model for groundwater remediation management with considering the leader follower relationships among multiple levels meanwhile multi objective programing is also widely applied to deal with harmonization management between multiple aspect of economy environment ecology and society hu et al 2016 davijani et al 2016 li et al 2019 various multi objective optimization models have been developed through combining with different theories or methods such as stochastic multi objective programming model fuzzy multi objective programming model and dynamic multi objective programming model etc bai et al 2015 alizadeh et al 2017 li et al 2019b it is an important way for the optimization of complex systems to develop multi objective hierarchical analysis by combining large system theory and multi objective method thus the optimizations referring to different benefit based relationships or decision making levels in complex mpis could be described using a multi level multi objective optimization coordination model therefore in this paper a multi level optimization coordination model with multi objectives is developed for optimal irrigation water allocation according to the characteristics of multi stage pumping water irrigation system based on the decomposition coordination method for large system the model is constructed with a three level hierarchical structure in order to better describe and coordinate the irrigation planning processes between different decision making levels in the whole irrigation system the minimum water requirement and energy cost shaft power are taken as two objectives and different periods are considered for detailed schedules for water allocation and operation the model is then applied and tested to obtain optimal schemes of pumping and allocating water for different stage of pumping station systems and different irrigated areas under conditions of limited water resources this study aims at dealing with the optimal allocation of irrigation water in complex multi stage pumping water irrigation systems with considering different levels of decision making processes 2 irrigation system description the guhai pumping water irrigation system gpis 36 11 37 18 n 105 35 106 12 e is located in the middle arid area of the ningxia hui autonomous region northwest china the gpis is 100 km long from north to south and 10 km wide from east to west covering an acreage of approximately 738 km2 fig 1 while the elevation varies from about 1205 m in the north to about 1621 m in the south the study area has a continental arid climate characterized by average annual precipitation of only 286 mm 70 of which occurring during july to september while the mean annual reference evapotranspiration et o reaches to about 996 mm the growing season is generally from march to september and the major irrigated crops include corn spring wheat and some economic crops e g lycium barbarum etc while the local agriculture is mostly dependent on irrigation due to low rainfall two different irrigation methods are mainly applied in gpis which are traditional irrigation e g flood or border irrigation and high efficient irrigation e g drip irrigation respectively the gpis is characterized by its machine driven irrigation due to larger elevation difference of approximately 420 m from north to south there are 25 major pumping stations and more than 200 pumping units as well as several secondary pumping water systems in total at present the source of irrigation water comes from the yellow river in the north and is transported from north to south through multi stage pumping stations fig 1 the total designed pumping flow is 41 2 m3 s 1 and the designed capacity of delivery water is 487 million m3 the gpis mainly consists of three subsystems each of which is controlled by several pumping stations and main channels fig 1 subsystem 1 pumps water through 12 major pumping stations with total pumping head of 479 7 m subsystem 2 pumps water mainly through 8 major pumping stations with total pumping head of 382 5 m subsystem 3 contains 4 stages of pumping stations with total pumping head of 253 1 m the details of each subsystem are listed in table 1 water delivery and allocation are complicated processes in gpis which not only includes the joint operation of multi stage pumping stations but also the allocation of water amount among different subsystems and pumping stations as well as different irrigated areas water allocation in the whole system depends on the available water delivery amount crop water requirement the operation of pumping stations and the regulation of canal systems therefore the gpis can be regarded as a large system with multilevel decision making processes and complex structures which could be described and solved by using decomposition coordination method for large system 3 mathematic model 3 1 model generalization for simplification the optimization model only considered the processes of pumping and allocating water among the major pumping stations and took other secondary pumping stations as parts of water distribution therefore each pumping station had only one upper stage station and one lower stage station each pumping station and its water supply subdistrict were defined as a pumping irrigation subdistrict pis and each subsystem numbered 1 to 3 could thus be regarded as a cascade system of multi stage pumping irrigation subdistricts the gpis could be thus taken as a large system that consists of three cascade pumping irrigation subsystems and an initial pumping station quanyan station the water was delivered from the yellow river through the initial pumping station and then was transported to each subsystem and each pis through multi stage pumping and allocating and finally to different irrigated areas meanwhile two types of irrigated areas were identified in the model so as to differentiate these two different irrigation methods the water allocation for each pis refers to the total water amount allocated to its water supply subdistrict including traditional and high efficient irrigated areas the simplified network of water supply in gpis is shown in fig 2 based on the decomposition coordination method for large system an optimization coordination model with a three level hierarchical structure was developed for gpis so as to better describe its multi level and interrelated characteristics each level developed a simple optimization model with two objectives for considering the water limitation and energy cost in the processes of water allocation the first level dealt with the optimization of water allocation within each single pis and thus contained 24 independent models in total the second level dealt with the optimization of water allocation among multi stage pumping stations which contained three independent models corresponding to three subsystems the third level performed the optimization as a whole for water allocation among three subsystems these three levels were solved individually and coordinated through the information exchanges of pumping flow water requirement and energy cost of each pis and subsystem the whole model was operated iteratively among three levels until the ending criterion was reached while the optimal solutions of each level were constrained by the updated coordinated variables in each iteration the detailed structure of the optimization coordination model is presented in fig 3 3 2 model formulation the detailed mathematical description of the optimization coordination model is presented in this section to present the model a list of notations is provided in table 2 it should be noted that the water requirement defined for each level is gross water requirement with considering the water use efficiency of irrigation system 3 2 1 first level optimization of water allocation within each single pumping irrigation subdistrict in each period the purpose of this level is to optimize water allocation between traditional irrigated areas and high efficient irrigated areas as well as the regulation of pumping units in order to minimize the water deficiency amount and energy cost within each single pis the detailed mathematical model is as follows objective function to minimize the total water deficiency amount and total shaft power of the pumping station in each pis i e 1 min f n j

capacity and river water level and can be determined based on the designed flow of main canals in the third level model in this paper 3 3 model solution the three level optimization coordination model was solved based on the decomposition coordination method for large system the multi objective model in each level was transformed to a single objective function using the minimum deviation method which is a modified method based on global criterion method proos et al 2001 marler and arora 2004 and the idea of relative deviation the mathematical formulations of multiple objectives in the three levels could thus be respectively described as follows 27 the first level w n j f n j f min n j f max n j f min n j z n j z min n j z max n j z min n j 28 the second level w n f n f min n f max n f

water allocation s n j i taking water allocation and pumping flow of each level model as the coordinated variables the coupling constraints should be satisfied for water allocation using eqs 5 and 6 and eqs 18 and 20 the steps for solving are presented in a flowchart fig 4 which is described as follows 1 the initial values for pumping flow and water allocation were given to the first level model based on the historical data 2 under the given pumping flow and water allocation of each pumping station the first level model was operated for optimal allocation of pumping flow among units i e q n j m and water amount between traditional and high efficient irrigated areas i e x n j i and y n j i the optimal schemes of operation and water allocation were obtained for each pis in each subsystem as well as the energy cost per unit of pumping water c n j and water requirement d n j i within each pis 3 the energy cost c n j and water requirement d n j i were then input into the second level then under the initially given q n i and s n i of each subsystem the second level was optimized based on the imported c n j and d n j i to obtain the optimal allocation of pumping flow and water allocation among multi stage pumping stations q n i j and s n i j meanwhile the energy cost per unit of pumping water c n and water requirement d n i for each subsystem were also obtained and imported to the third level as initial conditions for optimization 4 with the approved total water delivery amount s the third level model was operated based on the c n and d n i to obtain the optimal allocation of pumping flow and water supply among different subsystems q n i and s n i as well as total energy cost z and water requirement d of the whole system 5 the optimized results q and s from the second and third level models were transferred back to the first and second level models as new coordinated variables respectively 6 with the feedback of updated coordinated variables q and s the steps of 2 5 were conducted repeatedly 7 this calculation was repeatedly iterated until the objective value of the third level w reached the criterion as follow 30 w p w p 1 w p 1 ε where p is the number of iterations ε is the maximum threshold of the difference between two iterations and was set to 0 005 here 4 model application 4 1 model setup considering different scenarios the basic data required by the model were collected from the guhai irrigation district management department including total amount of approved water delivery crop pattern irrigation schedules and parameters of each pumping station e g total net pumping head number and parameters of pumping units designed operation mode designed max pumping flow irrigated areas of each pis etc as well as the actual pumping water and water allocation schemes for each pis in recent years the water requirements in different levels of the model were calculated according to several terms i e crop pattern irrigated area irrigation schedules and water use efficiency of canal systems according to field surveys high efficient irrigation methods are mainly applied to local economic crops while other crops still used traditional irrigation methods thus the irrigated areas and irrigation schedules of economic crops and other crops were used to calculate water requirement i e d n j i for the two types of irrigated areas respectively the water diversion in gpis lasts from april to august meanwhile there is a winter irrigation in november thus in this study the irrigation period was subdivided into 6 of time intervals and every time interval was set to 30 days equally the parameters of each pumping station and units were determined according to the collected actual parameters the maximum number of pumping units within each station was identified based on the total number of units actually installed in this pumping station but not considered spare units the present situation adopted the actual total water diversion amount and water allocation scheme in gpis in 2017 three scenarios of total water diversion amount in the whole system were defined according to the approved maximum water diversion and minimum total water requirement table 3 where the total water diversion was gradually increased reduced by 5 until it approached the maximum minimum limitation 4 2 results and discussion 4 2 1 optimal water allocation among multi stage pumping stations under the level of present water diversion amount the comparison of optimized results of water allocation with present values for gpis is shown in table 4 in the present situation the pumping stations at all stages pumped and allocated water at the same time which easily caused larger water shortage in the whole system especially in the lower stage pis since the limited total water diversion and unreasonable planning of water allocation while through optimizations the differences between water allocation and requirement hereafter referred to as water deficiency in each pis was decreased from the present values of 5 10 6 33 million m3 to the optimized values of 0 03 0 66 million m3 with a significant reduction of variation range table 4 positive value represented water surplus it indicated that the optimized water allocation for each pis was much closer to the water requirement of each pis and the optimal scheme was more reasonable in the present situation water deficiency in subsystem 1 was the most significant since it has maximum pumping water stages 12 stages and highest pumping head 428 7 m and thus greater difficulties in the coordination between different stages of pumping station as for subsystem 3 the pumping water amount was larger than its total requirement due to its only 4 stage pumping stations and small irrigated areas after optimizations the total amount of water allocation was increased in subsystem 1 while were slightly decreased in subsystem 2 and 3 table 4 meanwhile the pumping and allocating water amounts of the lower stage pis were increased in all subsystems table 4 which significantly alleviated the contradiction of water allocation between upper stage and lower stage pis at present in addition despite the shaft power was increased for many pumping stations after optimizations due to its increased pumping flow the total shaft power of the whole system changed insignificantly as compared with the present values table 4 under the level of present water diversion amount the optimal schemes of pumping and allocating water for each pis in different periods are shown as figs 5 and 6 the optimized water allocation basically met the water requirement of each pis in different periods fig 5 since the water requirements are generally larger in the key periods of crop growth june to august the pumping and allocating water amounts were relatively larger during these months than others for each pis in the optimal schemes figs 5 and 6 meanwhile the pumping and allocating water amounts during different periods were all increased for the lower stage pis as compared with the present schemes while they were decreased in some periods for the upper stage pis due to the constraints of the total water amount figs 5 and 6 in general the spatiotemporal contradiction of water allocation in the multi stage pumping water system was relieved through the optimizations of water supply regulation both water requirements in key periods of crop growth and pumping water amount for lower stage pumping stations were effectively satisfied 4 2 2 optimal schemes of water allocation and operation schedules within single pumping irrigation subdistrict in the optimizations detailed water allocation schemes in each period within each single pis were obtained and presented as allocation ratio in fig 7 the allocation ratio was defined as the ratio of water allocation between different irrigated areas during each period to the total water allocation of this pumping irrigation subdistrict since the water allocation between traditional irrigated and high efficient irrigated areas was based on its water requirement in different periods the water allocation schemes within each single pis were affected by crop water requirements and also closely related to the irrigated area and crop pattern with the increases of water requirement in key growing periods june to august water allocations in these months were all increased for both traditional and high efficient irrigated areas which accounted for more than 20 of the total water allocation of most pis fig 7 while the ratio of water allocation between these two types of irrigated areas was mainly determined by the planting ratio of economic crops and grain crops the pis with higher planting ratio of economic crops generally had a larger ratio of water allocation for high efficient irrigated areas for example the water allocation ratio of high efficient irrigated areas was approximately 80 in the pis of 2 1 and 2 3 in different periods due to more than 50 of the planting ratio of economic crops fig 7 and table 1 the water allocation for high efficient irrigation usually needs sedimentation in ponds firstly for removing sediment from the yellow river thus the results were helpful for local irrigation managers to make decisions in advance while the 1 2 to 1 4 and 3 1 pumping stations were only employed to lift water for lower stage pis there were nearly no irrigated areas in these pis and thus no water allocation in the optimizations meanwhile the operating state of all units and its pumping flow within each pumping stations were optimized in this study and the optimized operation schedules are presented as table 5 the pumping flow referred to the total flow of all operating units in the pumping station and was regulated mainly by changing the number of operating units and its pumping flow in each period the pumping flow of each pumping station was the largest in the peak periods of water requirement july to august thus the number of operating units also reached to maximum table 5 in contrast the number of operating units was relatively less in the period of lower water requirement april may and november in order to guarantee appropriate pumping flow and efficiency of each unit which could improve the total operational efficiency and reduce the energy cost in each pumping station 4 2 3 optimized results under different scenarios of water supply the effects of water diversion amount changes on the optimizations were discussed further when the total water diversion amount was adequate e g scenario 1 the pumping water amount in each pis was restricted by both energy cost and water requirement hence the water allocation for each pis was not quite larger than its water requirements fig 8 there were also minor differences between the pumping water amount in scenario 1 and that in present optimal schemes fig 9 while with relatively less water diversion amount e g scenario 3 the optimizations were mainly constrained by water requirements hence pumping water amount would be maximized as far as possible in order to reduce the water deficiency as shown in figs 8 and 9 the pumping water amount in each pis was decreased as the decrease of the total water diversion amount and its water deficiency was increased accordingly however the variation range of water deficiency in the whole irrigation system was still lower than the present values despite the total water deficiency was larger than the present fig 8 the pumping water amount in each pis was decreased by 3 15 in scenario 3 as compared to the optimized results at present while the pumping water amount in lower stage pis was still increased as compared with the present fig 9 particularly water allocation was more uniformly distributed among different pis and similar to its water requirement without significant deficits 15 in all scenarios fig 8 for example when the total water delivery amount was reduced by 10 scenario 3 the water deficiency of each pis ranged from 0 07 to 1 91 million m3 which was less than the present range 5 10 to 6 33 million m3 the scenario analysis further indicated that the optimization coordination model could better coordinate water allocation between different stages of pis under different conditions of water diversion 5 conclusion a regional multi level multi objective optimization coordination model was formulated for optimizing water allocation in complex multi stage pumping water irrigation system which taking the guhai pumping water irrigation system gpis of ningxia hui autonomous region northwest china as a case study the model had a three level hieratical structure and was solved based on the decomposition coordination method for large system the first level dealt with the optimal water allocation among different irrigated areas within each single pumping irrigation subdistrict pis the second level sought out the optimal schemes of pumping and allocating water among multi stage pumping irrigation subdistrict in each subsystem the third level concerns the optimal allocation of water supply among different subsystems in each level minimizing water requirement and energy cost shaft power were taken as two objectives and different irrigation periods were considered to obtain detailed schedules for water allocation and operation the three levels could be solved independently and meanwhile was connected through the exchange of irrigation water allocation and energy cost of each level this model could better describe the coordination and constraints of multi level planning and decision making processes as well as the effects of multiple factors including the operating rules of pumping stations reasonable allocation between different pumping stations and units and water limitations optimal schemes of water allocation for each pis of different subsystem were proposed including schemes of pumping and allocating water among each pis and water allocation and operation within each pis the optimized results showed that the range of water deficiency among different pis was reduced from the present values of 5 10 6 33 million m3 to the optimized values of 0 03 0 66 million m3 under the level of present water delivery amount particularly both the pumping water amount and water allocation were increased for the lower stage pis in each subsystem meanwhile the water requirement of each pis in each period could be better satisfied to certain extend through optimizations particularly in the peak period of irrigation e g june august scenarios analysis for three water delivery levels showed that the ranges of water deficiency were smaller than the present range under all levels of water delivery amount model application indicated that the model could better balance the spatial temporal contradictions of water supply among different subsystems and multi stage pumping stations under different conditions of water delivery in summary this paper presents a practical and efficient method for optimizing water allocation in complex multi stage pumping water systems which can also be applied for references in other similar irrigation systems additionally further studies can be conducted for better decision making support such as considering the uncertainty of crop water requirement and predicting water requirement in advance declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

8608,combining metamodels with data assimilation schemes allows the incorporation of up to date information in metamodels offering new opportunities for operational water resources management we developed a data assimilation scheme for the unsaturated zone metamodel metaswap using openda which is an open source data assimilation framework a twin experiment showed the feasibility of applying an ensemble kalman filter as a data assimilation method for updating metamodels furthermore we assessed the accuracy of root zone soil moisture model estimates when assimilating the regional smap l3 enhanced surface soil moisture product the model accuracy is assessed using in situ soil moisture measurements collected at 12 locations in the twente region the netherlands although the accuracy of the model estimates does not improve in terms of correlation coefficient the accuracy does improve in terms of root mean square error and bias therefore the assimilation of surface soil moisture observations has value for updating root zone soil moisture model estimates in addition the accuracy of the model estimates improves on both regional and local spatial scales the increasing availability of remotely sensed soil moisture data will lead to new possibilities for integrating metamodelling and data assimilation in operational water resources management however we expect that significant investments in computational capacities are necessary for effective implementation in decision making keywords data assimilation ensemble kalman filter hydrological modelling metamodelling remote sensing smap soil moisture 1 introduction the application of integrated physically based hydrological models is increasing in water resources management guswa et al 2014 kurtz et al 2017 such modelling tools are typically used for water resources management on various spatial and temporal scales water managers can use model output for decision making while taking into account uncertainties of among others input data boundary and initial conditions and model structure beven and alcock 2012 to reduce the uncertainties inherent to integrated physically based hydrological modelling data assimilation schemes are often applied liu et al 2012 weerts et al 2014 data assimilation schemes aim to find an optimal combination of merging hydrological model state estimates with observations several studies have shown the value of data assimilation schemes for integrated surface subsurface modelling camporese et al 2009a camporese et al 2009b zhang et al 2016 botto et al 2018 zhao and yang 2018 some specifically focusing on operational applications hendricks franssen et al 2011 de rosnay et al 2013 kurtz et al 2017 he et al 2019 combining integrated physically based modelling with data assimilation schemes often needs considerable computational capacities which limit the application of data assimilation schemes in operational water resources management several studies propose metamodelling as a tool to significantly decrease computation times van walsum and groenendijk 2008 ratto et al 2012 razavi et al 2012 fraser et al 2013 berends et al 2018 haberlandt 2010 defines a metamodel as a substitute for a complex simulation model consisting of simplified but often non linear and dynamic relationships metamodels can be trained using results from simulation experiments with available process models expert knowledge and observations if available the decrease in computational time is a trade off since metamodels generally have lower accuracies than the models from which they are derived fraser et al 2013 metamodels are usually based on models which are calibrated using training datasets such datasets consist of a specific period of hydrological observations since physically based models typically include parameters which are difficult to obtain for large spatial domains yilmaz et al 2010 calibration is an important aspect of hydrological model development beven and binley 1992 however it is practically impossible to monitor hydrological variables in situ on catchment scales due to time and budget constraints remote sensing data provide a means for monitoring across large spatial domains a recent development is the emergence of high resolution satellite based surface soil moisture observations petropoulos et al 2015 balsamo et al 2018 soil moisture is a key variable in integrated hydrological modelling since the unsaturated zone relates atmospheric land surface and subsurface processes brocca et al 2017 satellite based soil moisture products provide valuable information for hydrological models if they are used in combination with data assimilation schemes houser et al 1998 moradkhani 2008 reichle 2008 liu et al 2012 several studies investigated the applicability of remotely sensed soil moisture data for data assimilation using data products from satellites such as amsr e sahoo et al 2013 wanders et al 2014a wanders et al 2014b ascat gruber et al 2015 loizu et al 2018 smos lievens et al 2015 srivastava et al 2015 h saf laiolo et al 2015 smap koster et al 2018 blyverket et al 2019 a combination of amsr 2 and smos gevaert et al 2018 and a combination of sentinel 1 and smap lievens et al 2017 ratto et al 2012 state that integrating metamodelling with data assimilation schemes could significantly contribute to the operational use of metamodels and remotely sensed soil moisture products for decision making in operational water resources management in this study we use the netherlands hydrological instrument nhi a tool used for decision making in operational water resources management in the netherlands nhi is an integrated physically based modelling framework developed for hydrological simulations on several spatial scales de lange et al 2014 a few studies focus on the combination of the unsaturated zone metamodel metaswap as part of nhi and the assimilation of actual evapotranspiration estimates schuurmans et al 2011 hartanto et al 2017 however not on assimilating soil moisture observations the goal of this study is to evaluate the applicability of a data assimilation scheme for updating root zone soil moisture estimates of a metamodel using a regional surface soil moisture product based on smap satellite data chan et al 2018 the main research question is to what extent can we increase the accuracy of root zone soil moisture estimates of a metamodel by assimilating satellite based regional surface soil moisture observations section 2 gives a description of the data assimilation framework the metamodel the data and the research methodology results are shown in section 3 and discussed in section 4 conclusions are drawn in section 5 a list of abbreviations can be found in appendix a a description of the data assimilation scheme is found in appendix b 2 methodology 2 1 data assimilation framework we apply a sequential data assimilation scheme that applies statistical uncertainty measures for assigning weights to both model estimates and observations sequential data assimilation improves the accuracy of model estimates in two ways firstly these methods update model states which lead to more accurate model estimates at the update step secondly the updated model state estimates are used as input for the next modelling time step which reduces model error propagation sequential data assimilation schemes require calculation of the model mean state x and corresponding model state error covariance matrix p due to the size of p in hydrological model calculations it is generally not feasible to explicitly calculate p an alternative approach is the ensemble kalman filter enkf which is a sequential data assimilation scheme suitable for high dimensional systems evensen 1994 the enkf is a monte carlo implementation of kalman filtering for non linear problems the enkf uses a sample of evolved model states to estimate the covariance matrix p this ensemble of model runs is created by perturbing model forcing parameters and or states the model perturbations should represent total model uncertainty and require the development of an error model among others reichle et al 2002 and crow and wood 2003 showed the potential of applying an enkf in soil moisture modelling we refer to appendix b for a description of enkf data assimilation theory we implemented an enkf scheme using openda which is an open source framework for implementing data assimilation schemes in hydrological modelling www openda org applications of openda can be found in ridler et al 2014 and van velzen et al 2016 openda is a relatively easy to implement solution for coupling hydrological models and data assimilation schemes we coupled this framework with the unsaturated zone metamodel metaswap described in section 2 2 by means of the openda black box wrapper implementation of the black box wrapper does not require changes in model code and allows for reading and editing of model input and output files the source code of openda including the metaswap black box wrapper is freely accessible at https github com openda association openda for the remainder of this paper we refer to this coupling as metaswap openda 2 2 model description the nhi modelling framework consists of coupled hydrological models for unsaturated flow saturated flow and surface water flow and distribution de lange et al 2014 fig 1 shows a schematic overview of the models and the coupling between them the models are coupled in a modular way which means that individual models can run independently in this research we use the subsurface part of the landelijk hydrologisch model lhm which is the dutch national application of nhi the subsurface part consists of two coupled hydrological models the metamodel metaswap van walsum and groenendijk 2008 represents unsaturated zone dynamics and modflow 2005 harbaugh et al 2017 represents saturated zone dynamics the subsurface part of lhm is schematized on a rectangular grid with a spatial resolution of 250 m by 250 m and a simulation time step of one day 2 2 1 metaswap the soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model metaswap computes the vertical transfer of water in a one dimensional column between the atmosphere and the saturated zone van walsum and groenendijk 2008 metaswap is a metamodel based on the open source swap model van dam et al 2008 swap solves unsaturated soil water flow on field scales by applying the richards equation metaswap applies a simplified approach in which the one dimensional partial differential richards equation is replaced by two ordinary differential equations an equation for vertical variations assuming steady state flow and an equation accounting for variations in time steady state solutions are stored in a database of pre computed soil saturation profiles at discrete intervals of soil moisture conditions and groundwater depths the unsaturated zone is discretized into up to 18 vertical aggregation boxes starting with the root zone and ending with a box extending into the saturated zone these boxes are linked as reservoirs the soil saturation degree of each box is retrieved from the pre computed database during each time step metaswap needs several spatial datasets as input the actueel hoogtebestand nederland ahn is used as a digital elevation model actueel hoogtebestand nederland 2019 the landelijk grondgebruik nederland lgn dataset supplies land cover data hazeu 2014 precipitation and makkink reference crop evapotranspiration rasters obtained from knmi data are used as model forcing knmi 2018b knmi 2018a the bofek2012 dataset supplies soil physical parameters for 72 soil units in the netherlands wösten et al 2013 van walsum and van der bolt 2013 verified the metaswap meta approach for these soil units by comparing transpiration output of metaswap with transpiration output of the swap model the meta approach leads to faster calculation times in comparison with swap while the transpiration output of metaswap did not deviate more than 5 from the swap output the metamodelling concept of metaswap has implications for applying data assimilation schemes firstly vegetation dynamics are parametrized using a pre defined root zone depth growth pattern as the root zone depth varies in the growing season also the depth of the first aggregation box of metaswap varies data assimilation results are therefore only comparable for periods with similar root zone depths like summer or winter periods secondly the data assimilation scheme requires a model restart after each update step the use of a single precision format in the model restart files introduces small differences in the restarted model run van walsum 2017 section 4 1 discusses the effect of the model restart on model accuracy 2 2 2 modflow modflow 2005 is a software package for simulating 3d groundwater flow harbaugh et al 2017 the schematization of modflow in lhm consists of seven layers these seven aquifers and aquitards represent the hydrogeological layers distinguished in the dutch national hydrogeological database regis de lange et al 2014 modflow is coupled to metaswap using a shared state variable phreatic groundwater head for modflow and groundwater level for metaswap respectively van walsum and veldhuizen 2011 during each time step groundwater levels are determined by iteration of modflow and metaswap the iteration stops when the difference in groundwater head of modflow and groundwater level of metaswap is within a pre defined limit 2 2 3 data assimilation for metaswap modflow models the potential of data assimilation for coupled metaswap modflow models has been studied before schuurmans et al 2011 assimilated satellite based actual evapotranspiration data using a constant gain kalman filter to update actual evapotranspiration model estimates furthermore hartanto et al 2017 used satellite based actual evapotranspiration data in combination with a particle filter to improve discharge simulations due to the availability of high resolution soil moisture observations we extend the findings of schuurmans et al 2011 and hartanto et al 2017 by assessing the applicability of soil moisture observations to update soil moisture states of metaswap in the aforementioned studies the entire metaswap grid was scaled with a single factor per time step therefore not accounting for the spatial distribution of the observations the openda framework enables assimilation of multiple observations at various locations 2 3 study area the study area is the twente region in the east of the netherlands see fig 2 the region includes part of the dinkel and regge catchments and is situated in a temperate marine climate zone hendriks et al 2014 annual precipitation rates vary between 800 and 850 mm kaandorp et al 2018 the region is relatively flat with an elevation between 3 to 85 m a s l and has a size of approximately 40 km by 50 km glacial ridges form elevated features in the landscape the main soil types are sand and loamy sand while the main land use is agriculture the water system is free draining and water management is mainly performed by operating a system of weirs and pumps 2 4 data we use the smap soil moisture active passive l3 enhanced radiometer only daily gridded soil moisture product for the data assimilation scheme entekhabi et al 2010 chan et al 2018 o neill et al 2018 the value of smap data for hydrological data assimilation has been shown in several studies kolassa et al 2017 lievens et al 2017 koster et al 2018 blyverket et al 2019 the delivery of the enhanced smap soil moisture products was motivated by the gap that emerged after failure of the smap radar chan et al 2018 das et al 2018 the 9 km resolution of the enhanced data products is achieved through an optimal interpolation technique applied to the antenna temperature from which the brightness temperature t b is calculated subsequently the same soil moisture retrieval procedure is followed as is applied to the native t b data we use the baseline smap l3 enhanced product which relies on the single channel algorithm at v polarization sca v the smap l3 enhanced product is available approximately every 2 3 days for the twente region colliander et al 2017 found that smap soil moisture products generally perform well in the twente region chan et al 2018 assessed the accuracy of the enhanced smap l3 products in the twente region using in situ soil moisture measurements at 5 cm soil depth from the twente network see next section for the period april 2015 october 2016 and found an unbiased root mean square error urmse of 0 056 m 3 m 3 for this study we used the soil moisture retrievals from the morning satellite overpasses during the morning the moisture and temperature profiles across the soil vegetation system are more uniform which is one of the assumptions underlying retrieval algorithms indeed chan et al 2018 found more reliable soil moisture estimates for data collected in the morning compared to the data collected in the afternoon furthermore we use in situ soil moisture measurements from a monitoring network operating since 2009 the network is maintained by the faculty of itc of the university of twente the network consists of 20 stations equipped with decagon em50 data loggers and probes for measuring both soil moisture and soil temperature dente et al 2012 decagon ec tm probes were installed when the network was first developed gradually the probes were replaced by 5tm probes soil type specific calibration functions have been developed for both sensors the expected accuracies are 0 023 m 3 m 3 for the ec tm probes and 0 027 m 3 m 3 for the 5tm probes respectively the station locations are shown in fig 2 the sensors are installed in agricultural fields except station 20 which is installed in a forest area the stations provide a reading every 15 min since july 2009 at nominal soil depths of 5 10 20 40 and 80 cm installation of the monitoring network is similar to the installation of the raam soil moisture monitoring network described in benninga et al 2018 the in situ measurements are used to validate the assimilation results 2 5 error model noise definition we perturb the metaswap ensemble members for the enkf scheme by adding noise to the model forcing syed et al 2004 show that precipitation and potential evaporation are the most dominant forcing terms for the hydrological cycle in addition uncertainties in precipitation measurements dominate errors in subsurface and runoff predictions mcmillan et al 2011 tian et al 2013 show that a multiplicative error model outperforms an additive error model for daily precipitation measurements we perturb input rasters of daily precipitation and daily makkink reference evapotranspiration with gaussian white multiplicative noise the noise is described using the distribution mean and standard deviation we assume that the errors in the input data are not systematic and therefore in the case of multiplicative noise the distribution mean is set equal to one the standard deviation of the precipitation error distribution function is often arbitrarily set ranging from 15 weerts and el serafy 2006 up to 50 pauwels and de lannoy 2006 of the nominal precipitation value we found that the model ensemble does not collapse when using a standard deviation defined as 25 of the maximum daily precipitation rate the average annual maximum daily precipitation rate in the twente area is close to 30 mm for the years between 1961 and 2014 golroudbary et al 2017 knmi 2018b correspondingly we assume that the error distribution of the precipitation input has a standard deviation of 7 5 mm in a similar way we assume a standard deviation of 2 mm for the reference evapotranspiration input knmi 2018a furthermore using the knmi precipitation and reference evapotranspiration datasets we found that the correlation length of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration is larger than our region of interest approximately 40 km by 50 km therefore we assume a spatial correlation length of 50 km for the noise in every direction which means that the spatial anisotropy of precipitation fields is not considered in addition the smap observations are perturbed with gaussian white additive noise for data assimilation applications drusch et al 2009 and de rosnay et al 2013 defined the soil moisture satellite observational error as a standard deviation with a value of 0 010 m 3 m 3 we use a standard deviation of 0 056 m 3 m 3 for defining the satellite observation error this error was retrieved from the study of chan et al 2018 which focuses on the smap product and the twente region 2 6 experimental setup we set up two experiments to assess the applicability of the enkf for updating soil moisture estimates of the metamodel metaswap first we test the metaswap openda data assimilation implementation by performing a synthetic experiment often referred to as a twin experiment then we evaluate data assimilation in a real world application on regional and local spatial scales using the smap satellite data the flowcharts visualized in fig 3 show the research steps for the two experiments 2 6 1 twin experiment a twin experiment allows testing of a data assimilation implementation in an idealized situation remy et al 2002 robinson and lermusiaux 2002 irrgang et al 2017 the goal is to assess whether the enkf scheme improves the accuracy of soil moisture model estimates when all error statistics are known the twin experiment is performed for the in situ station locations and for a period of two months the twin experiment spans the period may 1 2015 to july 1 2015 the twin experiment consists of three model runs twin truth this run represents the true state of root zone soil moisture in the period may 1 2015 to july 1 2015 the run produces synthetic soil moisture observations which are assimilated in the twin enkf run the synthetic observations are assumed to be perfectly accurate twin ol this run represents a reference simulation without data assimilation also known as an open loop ol run to resemble an imperfect model we perturbed the forcing data of this run white multiplicative noise with a nominal value of 2 is added to the forcing data to resemble model uncertainty twin enkf this run applies the enkf using the metaswap openda framework to correct root zone soil moisture by assimilating the synthetic soil moisture observations from the twin truth run the run contains the same uncertainty as the twin ol run by using the same perturbed forcing data in general increasing the ensemble size will lead to a better representation of model uncertainty zhang et al 2016 however due to computational limitations one has to find a balance between computational costs and appropriate ensemble size he et al 2019 to determine the number of ensemble members we varied the ensemble size 8 16 32 and 64 members and assessed the corresponding root mean square error rmse of the twin enkf run we found that at least 32 ensemble members are needed to get a good representation of model uncertainty see fig 5 the twin experiment is successful if the accuracy of the twin enkf soil moisture estimates increases with respect to the soil moisture estimates of the twin ol run the accuracy is assessed using three performance indicators the rmse for the absolute deviation the model bias for the systematic deviation and the pearson correlation coefficient r for the dynamics the rmse is defined as 1 rmse i 1 n θ i obs θ i pred 2 n in which θ i obs are the observed soil moisture estimates in this case the synthetic observations from the twin truth run θ i pred are the predicted soil moisture estimates from the twin ol and twin enkf runs and n is the number of observations the closer the rmse is to zero the more accurate the model predictions are next the model bias is defined as 2 bias i 1 n θ i obs θ i pred n again the closer the bias is to zero the less biased the model predictions are last the pearson correlation coefficient r is defined as 3 r i 1 n θ obs θ obs θ pred θ pred i 1 n θ obs θ obs 2 i 1 n θ pred θ pred 2 in which θ obs and θ pred are the averaged observed and predicted soil moisture estimates the correlation coefficient r can range between 1 and 1 a value of 1 1 indicates a perfect positive negative linear relationship between θ obs and θ pred 2 6 2 assimilation of smap observations next we performed an enkf data assimilation run with the smap l3 enhanced observations an enkf run is performed for the full year 2016 to capture soil moisture variability in both wet and dry periods 32 ensemble members are used to resemble model uncertainty the ensemble members are initialized with a spin up period between january 1 2014 and january 1 2016 furthermore a deterministic model run without data assimilation is performed we refer to this run as smap ol to distinguish between this run and the twin ol run the updated soil moisture model estimates and the open loop run are validated by evaluating the rmse model bias and correlation coefficient r performance indicators using the in situ soil moisture measurements the in situ measurements are daily averaged both satellite soil moisture and in situ soil moisture observations are inherently different with respect to each other in situ soil moisture measurements contain significant uncertainties related to accuracy precision and spatial support lekshmi et al 2014 these uncertainties limit validation possibilities on local scales upscaling in situ measurements to regional averages reduces sampling errors cosh et al 2006 crow et al 2012 zhao and yang 2018 therefore we evaluate the results on both regional and local spatial scales a typical regional scale is the management area of a regional water authority which is approximately the size of the study area we define field scale as a typical local scale which is resembled by individual soil moisture monitoring stations first the regional scale applicability of the smap l3 enhanced product for data assimilation is assessed by evaluating the performance indicators for both the in situ data and the model estimates the in situ data and model estimates are spatially averaged we refer to these results as smap enkf avg the following twelve in situ stations have a complete data series for the year 2016 and are used for the averaging 1 2 4 7 9 12 13 15 17 18 19 20 the locations are shown in fig 2 then the local scale applicability of the smap l3 enhanced product is assessed by evaluating the performance indicators for the stations used for the regional averaging as described in section 2 2 1 data assimilation results using the metaswap model are only comparable for periods with similar root zone depths therefore we split the year 2016 in a summer and winter period the length of the summer period depends on the parametrized vegetation type the root zone depth of the grass vegetation type varies between 0 20 m in winter and 0 40 m in summer the root zone depth of the maize vegetation type varies between 0 10 m in winter and 0 40 m in summer the root zone depth of the forest vegetation type does not vary to define a summer period for this vegetation type we split the year in half table 1 shows the parametrized vegetation type and summer period length since the first aggregation box of metaswap represents the root zone up to 40 cm depth we use the in situ measurements at 10 cm depth for the winter period and the in situ measurements at 20 cm depth for the summer period because the model result is an aggregate of the root zone soil moisture profile we consider the measurements at these depths representative for the winter and summer periods since the most abundant vegetation type in the list of selected stations is grass we assume that the summer period of grass is representative for the regional average results 3 results 3 1 twin experiment first we show the synthetic twin experiment results fig 4 shows the performance indicators for the twin ol and twin enkf runs as described in section 2 6 1 the twin ol run represents a model run with randomly added errors the twin enkf run is the result of assimilating synthetic observations of perfect accuracy to update the soil moisture model state estimates in general the results indicate that the metaswap openda implementation is able to correct for synthetically added errors for which the error structure is known in terms of rmse and model bias the accuracy of model estimates improves in the twin enkf run in comparison with the twin ol run the rmse of the twin ol run ranges from 0 0013 to 0 010 m 3 m 3 while the rmse of the twin enkf run ranges from 0 to 0 0032 m 3 m 3 the bias of the twin ol run ranges from 0 0010 to 0 0090 m 3 m 3 while the bias of the twin enkf run ranges from 0 00010 to 0 0024 m 3 m 3 furthermore in terms of correlation coefficient r the accuracy of model estimates generally increases in the twin enkf run compared with the twin ol run the correlation coefficient of the twin ol run ranges from 0 98 to 1 while the correlation coefficient of the twin enkf run ranges from 0 99 to 1 however the accuracy of the twin enkf run is lower for three stations 7 11 and 16 in terms of correlation coefficient furthermore we assessed whether the ensemble size of 32 members is sufficient fig 5 shows the change in rmse of the twin enkf run when increasing the number of ensemble members the rmse of the ensemble mean decreases for larger ensemble sizes the decrease in rmse flattens out for an ensemble size larger than 32 therefore we assume that an ensemble of 32 members is a good balance between accuracy and computational requirements 3 2 smap assimilation regional comparison this section presents the findings of assimilating smap data into the metamodel metaswap fig 6 shows the enkf data assimilation results for the regional soil moisture estimates in the year 2016 the regional estimates are obtained by spatially averaging the soil moisture model estimates of each in situ location a visual comparison of the smap ol and smap enkf avg runs shows an improvement for both the winter and summer periods of the smap enkf avg run except in the beginning of may furthermore the accuracy of model estimates only slightly improves in the period between january 1 april 1 table 2 shows the rmse model bias and correlation coefficient for the winter and summer periods in terms of rmse and model bias the accuracy of model estimates improves in the smap enkf run in comparison with the smap ol run the decrease in rmse and model bias is larger in the summer period in terms of correlation coefficient the accuracy of model estimates decreases in the smap enkf run in comparison with the smap ol run the decrease in correlation coefficient is smaller in the summer period 3 3 smap assimilation local comparison an overview of the local scale assimilation results is shown in table 2 for the winter period in terms of rmse the assimilation increases the accuracy of local soil moisture estimates for 8 out of 12 stations in terms of model bias the assimilation increases the accuracy for 7 out of 12 stations in terms of correlation coefficient the assimilation increases the accuracy for 3 out of 12 stations for the summer period in terms of rmse the assimilation increases the accuracy of local soil moisture estimates for 10 out of 12 stations in terms of model bias the assimilation increases the accuracy for 11 out of 12 stations in terms of correlation coefficient the assimilation increases the accuracy for 5 out of 12 stations furthermore the enkf corrects the low correlation found during the summer period in the smap ol run for station 17 however the enkf is not able to correct for the negative correlation found during the winter period in the smap ol run for station 2 next we focus on local results for two stations station 9 where the updated estimates clearly improve and station 7 for which the accuracy declines fig 7 shows the assimilation results for station 9 the accuracy of the model estimates increases in the enkf run similar to the patterns found for the regional soil moisture estimates in terms of rmse and model bias the accuracy of model estimates improves in both the winter and summer period in terms of correlation coefficient the accuracy of model estimates improves in the summer period and declines in the winter period fig 8 shows the assimilation results for station 7 since the parametrized vegetation type at this station is maize the length of the summer period is different than for station 9 see table 1 while the accuracy of model estimates slightly improves in terms of rmse and correlation coefficient the accuracy in terms of model bias declines in the winter period furthermore the accuracy of model estimates shows no improvement in terms of rmse and model bias and a small decline in terms of correlation coefficient in the summer period the enkf does not significantly affect the model estimates a possible explanation is that the smap l3 enhanced product does not reflect local root zone conditions for this station a thick clay layer can be found below the root zone at station 7 in addition the subsurface of the field contains pipes which drain excess water during wet winter periods 4 discussion 4 1 application of data assimilation for metamodelling twin experiment we assessed whether data assimilation can be a tool to integrate soil moisture observations into unsaturated zone metamodels the metamodelling concept of metaswap depends on the database with pre calculated soil saturation profiles updating this database is a time consuming process the twin experiment and smap enkf runs show that data assimilation forms a good alternative to update the metamodel the twin experiment indicates that applying an enkf with perfectly accurate synthetic observations increases the accuracy of the soil moisture estimates of metaswap and does not lead to model instabilities or other spurious model behaviour therefore we conclude that the metaswap openda implementation is suitable for assimilating soil moisture observations into the metamodel metaswap also we found that an ensemble size of 32 members gives a good representation of model uncertainty it is important to note that although fig 4 shows that the accuracy of soil moisture estimates increases in the twin enkf run also an inherent model uncertainty exists that cannot be mitigated using data assimilation for example the enkf reduces the rmse to a lower limit even when using observations of perfect accuracy this inherent uncertainty is among others caused by the restart procedure of metaswap after each update step as is described in section 2 2 1 4 2 application of data assimilation for metamodelling smap experiment table 2 shows that the metaswap openda implementation has value in an experiment with smap l3 enhanced surface soil moisture observations the accuracy of model estimates improves on both regional and local scales in terms of rmse and model bias the improvement is larger for the summer period than for the winter period in terms of correlation coefficient the improvement in accuracy is less distinct in the winter period only three stations show an improvement in correlation coefficient in the summer period almost half of the stations show an improvement in correlation coefficient the larger variability of the smap surface soil moisture observations with respect to the in situ root zone measurements might explain the impact of the assimilation on the correlation coefficient also the availability of smap observations influences the effectiveness of the assimilation for example less smap observations are available in the period january 1 2016 april 1 2016 in comparison with the rest of 2016 consequently the model state is less often updated during the smap enkf run in the period up to april 1 2016 affecting the performance of the enkf in the defined winter period 4 3 regional versus local spatial scales the smap l3 enhanced product corresponds well with the in situ measurements on a regional scale chan et al 2018 therefore the accuracy of regional scale soil moisture model estimates increase after assimilation of the smap l3 enhanced product in terms of rmse and model bias data assimilation results on local scales largely depend on how well the smap l3 enhanced product represents local field conditions we want to stress that both the in situ measurements and lhm simulations contain uncertainties e g they might not be representative for local field conditions as explained in section 2 6 2 new remote sensing products from satellites such as sentinel 1 are expected to make the leap from regional to local field scales balsamo et al 2018 for example bauer marschallinger et al 2019 developed a high resolution surface soil moisture product based on sentinel 1 satellite data and a change detection algorithm the spatial resolution of this product is 1 km by 1 km we expect that such high resolution surface soil moisture products will lead to new possibilities for soil moisture data assimilation in operational water resources management furthermore the model bias and correlation coefficient show that while the enkf is able to correct for systematic model errors the variability of the smap l3 enhanced surface soil moisture product does not always reflect dynamics in deeper layers carranza et al 2018 show a strong vertical variability between soil moisture at 5 and 40 cm depth in the twente region the vertical variability forms a challenge for data assimilation applications since most if not all remotely sensed soil moisture data concerns surface soil moisture due to sensor constraints however the smap enkf run shows that a root zone soil moisture model can be updated by assimilating smap surface soil moisture observations the results in table 2 show that assimilating the 9 km resolution surface smap l3 enhanced observations increases the accuracy of local soil moisture model estimates for more than half of the stations thus the smap surface soil moisture product has significant value in data assimilation approaches renzullo et al 2014 dumedah et al 2015 and blyverket et al 2019 also show the value of assimilating satellite based surface soil moisture observations into a hydrological model to update root zone soil moisture estimates we want to accentuate the impact of the smap observation on december 6 2016 this observation significantly impacts the assimilation run as visible in fig 6 and fig 7 the in situ measurements do not indicate a steep reduction in soil moisture on that day so the smap observation may be erroneous temperatures dropped below 0 c on december 6 2016 which probably significantly affected the smap reading similarly the smap l3 enhanced product does not reflect field conditions well during may 2016 which also significantly affects the assimilation run 4 4 implications for operational water resources management the assimilation of high resolution remotely sensed soil moisture products leads to new possibilities for integrated physically based hydrological models in operational water resources management pezij et al 2019 found that hydrological models are currently not considered by dutch regional operational water managers as decisive tools for decision making among others regional operational water managers identified model accuracy as a limiting factor data assimilation is a tool to increase the accuracy and hence the application of hydrological modelling in operational water management yet combining data assimilation schemes and integrated physically based modelling for operational water resources management is currently limited due to among others computational requirements sun et al 2016 even with the application of metamodels for simulating hydrological processes at field scale high performance computing hpc facilities are often required for efficient implementation of data assimilation schemes furthermore the implementation of remote sensing data in operational management requires additional investments in data acquiring processing and storage facilities however we expect that due to the development of new computational methods these challenges become less of an issue in the future he et al 2019 for example kurtz et al 2017 show the potential of combining data assimilation and integrated physically based hydrological modelling with cloud computing techniques for operational water resources management ma et al 2015 identifies several promising tools such as cluster based hpc systems and cloud computing for fast calculations and parallel file systems for big data storage however the implementation of such tools requires investments in computational infrastructure we expect that in the near future research and investments into these promising new tools will increase which will help to integrate the application of data assimilation schemes in operational water resources management 5 conclusions we assessed the applicability of satellite based regional scale surface soil moisture observations to increase the accuracy of root zone soil moisture estimates of a metamodel this study shows that combining metamodels with data assimilation schemes allows incorporating new information in metamodels therefore integrating hydrological metamodelling and satellite based soil moisture observations leads to new opportunities for operational water resources management a data assimilation scheme was developed for the unsaturated zone metamodel metaswap using the openda open source data assimilation framework a synthetic experiment known as a twin experiment showed the value of integrating metamodelling and an ensemble kalman filter enkf data assimilation scheme furthermore the applicability of the 9 km by 9 km resolution smap l3 enhanced surface soil moisture product for the metaswap openda framework was assessed for the year 2016 on a regional scale the updated root zone soil moisture model estimates show a larger skill in terms of rmse and model bias in terms of correlation coefficient the skill of the updated root zone soil moisture model estimates is slightly lower than in the open loop run the decline is partly explained by the larger variability of the assimilated surface soil moisture observations with respect to the in situ root zone soil moisture measurements on a local scale similar results were found however the applicability of the smap l3 enhanced product on local scales depends on how well the smap product represents local field conditions in addition we show that the assimilation of surface soil moisture observations leads to increased accuracy of root zone soil moisture model estimates the improvement of the soil moisture model estimates is larger in the summer period than in the winter period of 2016 the limited availability of smap l3 enhanced soil moisture observations in the first months of 2016 might explain this difference the limited availability is caused by among others freezing of the soil in winter periods as a final remark high resolution surface soil moisture products will lead to new opportunities in terms of data assimilation in operational water resources management nevertheless significant developments and investments in terms of computation capacities are required for operational application of remote sensing data in data assimilation schemes however recent developments in hpc and cloud computing are expected to contribute to the integration of data assimilation in operational water

due to the size of the model state error covariance matrix p in hydrological model predictions it is generally not feasible to explicitly calculate p an alternative approach is to estimate p using a

8608,combining metamodels with data assimilation schemes allows the incorporation of up to date information in metamodels offering new opportunities for operational water resources management we developed a data assimilation scheme for the unsaturated zone metamodel metaswap using openda which is an open source data assimilation framework a twin experiment showed the feasibility of applying an ensemble kalman filter as a data assimilation method for updating metamodels furthermore we assessed the accuracy of root zone soil moisture model estimates when assimilating the regional smap l3 enhanced surface soil moisture product the model accuracy is assessed using in situ soil moisture measurements collected at 12 locations in the twente region the netherlands although the accuracy of the model estimates does not improve in terms of correlation coefficient the accuracy does improve in terms of root mean square error and bias therefore the assimilation of surface soil moisture observations has value for updating root zone soil moisture model estimates in addition the accuracy of the model estimates improves on both regional and local spatial scales the increasing availability of remotely sensed soil moisture data will lead to new possibilities for integrating metamodelling and data assimilation in operational water resources management however we expect that significant investments in computational capacities are necessary for effective implementation in decision making keywords data assimilation ensemble kalman filter hydrological modelling metamodelling remote sensing smap soil moisture 1 introduction the application of integrated physically based hydrological models is increasing in water resources management guswa et al 2014 kurtz et al 2017 such modelling tools are typically used for water resources management on various spatial and temporal scales water managers can use model output for decision making while taking into account uncertainties of among others input data boundary and initial conditions and model structure beven and alcock 2012 to reduce the uncertainties inherent to integrated physically based hydrological modelling data assimilation schemes are often applied liu et al 2012 weerts et al 2014 data assimilation schemes aim to find an optimal combination of merging hydrological model state estimates with observations several studies have shown the value of data assimilation schemes for integrated surface subsurface modelling camporese et al 2009a camporese et al 2009b zhang et al 2016 botto et al 2018 zhao and yang 2018 some specifically focusing on operational applications hendricks franssen et al 2011 de rosnay et al 2013 kurtz et al 2017 he et al 2019 combining integrated physically based modelling with data assimilation schemes often needs considerable computational capacities which limit the application of data assimilation schemes in operational water resources management several studies propose metamodelling as a tool to significantly decrease computation times van walsum and groenendijk 2008 ratto et al 2012 razavi et al 2012 fraser et al 2013 berends et al 2018 haberlandt 2010 defines a metamodel as a substitute for a complex simulation model consisting of simplified but often non linear and dynamic relationships metamodels can be trained using results from simulation experiments with available process models expert knowledge and observations if available the decrease in computational time is a trade off since metamodels generally have lower accuracies than the models from which they are derived fraser et al 2013 metamodels are usually based on models which are calibrated using training datasets such datasets consist of a specific period of hydrological observations since physically based models typically include parameters which are difficult to obtain for large spatial domains yilmaz et al 2010 calibration is an important aspect of hydrological model development beven and binley 1992 however it is practically impossible to monitor hydrological variables in situ on catchment scales due to time and budget constraints remote sensing data provide a means for monitoring across large spatial domains a recent development is the emergence of high resolution satellite based surface soil moisture observations petropoulos et al 2015 balsamo et al 2018 soil moisture is a key variable in integrated hydrological modelling since the unsaturated zone relates atmospheric land surface and subsurface processes brocca et al 2017 satellite based soil moisture products provide valuable information for hydrological models if they are used in combination with data assimilation schemes houser et al 1998 moradkhani 2008 reichle 2008 liu et al 2012 several studies investigated the applicability of remotely sensed soil moisture data for data assimilation using data products from satellites such as amsr e sahoo et al 2013 wanders et al 2014a wanders et al 2014b ascat gruber et al 2015 loizu et al 2018 smos lievens et al 2015 srivastava et al 2015 h saf laiolo et al 2015 smap koster et al 2018 blyverket et al 2019 a combination of amsr 2 and smos gevaert et al 2018 and a combination of sentinel 1 and smap lievens et al 2017 ratto et al 2012 state that integrating metamodelling with data assimilation schemes could significantly contribute to the operational use of metamodels and remotely sensed soil moisture products for decision making in operational water resources management in this study we use the netherlands hydrological instrument nhi a tool used for decision making in operational water resources management in the netherlands nhi is an integrated physically based modelling framework developed for hydrological simulations on several spatial scales de lange et al 2014 a few studies focus on the combination of the unsaturated zone metamodel metaswap as part of nhi and the assimilation of actual evapotranspiration estimates schuurmans et al 2011 hartanto et al 2017 however not on assimilating soil moisture observations the goal of this study is to evaluate the applicability of a data assimilation scheme for updating root zone soil moisture estimates of a metamodel using a regional surface soil moisture product based on smap satellite data chan et al 2018 the main research question is to what extent can we increase the accuracy of root zone soil moisture estimates of a metamodel by assimilating satellite based regional surface soil moisture observations section 2 gives a description of the data assimilation framework the metamodel the data and the research methodology results are shown in section 3 and discussed in section 4 conclusions are drawn in section 5 a list of abbreviations can be found in appendix a a description of the data assimilation scheme is found in appendix b 2 methodology 2 1 data assimilation framework we apply a sequential data assimilation scheme that applies statistical uncertainty measures for assigning weights to both model estimates and observations sequential data assimilation improves the accuracy of model estimates in two ways firstly these methods update model states which lead to more accurate model estimates at the update step secondly the updated model state estimates are used as input for the next modelling time step which reduces model error propagation sequential data assimilation schemes require calculation of the model mean state x and corresponding model state error covariance matrix p due to the size of p in hydrological model calculations it is generally not feasible to explicitly calculate p an alternative approach is the ensemble kalman filter enkf which is a sequential data assimilation scheme suitable for high dimensional systems evensen 1994 the enkf is a monte carlo implementation of kalman filtering for non linear problems the enkf uses a sample of evolved model states to estimate the covariance matrix p this ensemble of model runs is created by perturbing model forcing parameters and or states the model perturbations should represent total model uncertainty and require the development of an error model among others reichle et al 2002 and crow and wood 2003 showed the potential of applying an enkf in soil moisture modelling we refer to appendix b for a description of enkf data assimilation theory we implemented an enkf scheme using openda which is an open source framework for implementing data assimilation schemes in hydrological modelling www openda org applications of openda can be found in ridler et al 2014 and van velzen et al 2016 openda is a relatively easy to implement solution for coupling hydrological models and data assimilation schemes we coupled this framework with the unsaturated zone metamodel metaswap described in section 2 2 by means of the openda black box wrapper implementation of the black box wrapper does not require changes in model code and allows for reading and editing of model input and output files the source code of openda including the metaswap black box wrapper is freely accessible at https github com openda association openda for the remainder of this paper we refer to this coupling as metaswap openda 2 2 model description the nhi modelling framework consists of coupled hydrological models for unsaturated flow saturated flow and surface water flow and distribution de lange et al 2014 fig 1 shows a schematic overview of the models and the coupling between them the models are coupled in a modular way which means that individual models can run independently in this research we use the subsurface part of the landelijk hydrologisch model lhm which is the dutch national application of nhi the subsurface part consists of two coupled hydrological models the metamodel metaswap van walsum and groenendijk 2008 represents unsaturated zone dynamics and modflow 2005 harbaugh et al 2017 represents saturated zone dynamics the subsurface part of lhm is schematized on a rectangular grid with a spatial resolution of 250 m by 250 m and a simulation time step of one day 2 2 1 metaswap the soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model metaswap computes the vertical transfer of water in a one dimensional column between the atmosphere and the saturated zone van walsum and groenendijk 2008 metaswap is a metamodel based on the open source swap model van dam et al 2008 swap solves unsaturated soil water flow on field scales by applying the richards equation metaswap applies a simplified approach in which the one dimensional partial differential richards equation is replaced by two ordinary differential equations an equation for vertical variations assuming steady state flow and an equation accounting for variations in time steady state solutions are stored in a database of pre computed soil saturation profiles at discrete intervals of soil moisture conditions and groundwater depths the unsaturated zone is discretized into up to 18 vertical aggregation boxes starting with the root zone and ending with a box extending into the saturated zone these boxes are linked as reservoirs the soil saturation degree of each box is retrieved from the pre computed database during each time step metaswap needs several spatial datasets as input the actueel hoogtebestand nederland ahn is used as a digital elevation model actueel hoogtebestand nederland 2019 the landelijk grondgebruik nederland lgn dataset supplies land cover data hazeu 2014 precipitation and makkink reference crop evapotranspiration rasters obtained from knmi data are used as model forcing knmi 2018b knmi 2018a the bofek2012 dataset supplies soil physical parameters for 72 soil units in the netherlands wösten et al 2013 van walsum and van der bolt 2013 verified the metaswap meta approach for these soil units by comparing transpiration output of metaswap with transpiration output of the swap model the meta approach leads to faster calculation times in comparison with swap while the transpiration output of metaswap did not deviate more than 5 from the swap output the metamodelling concept of metaswap has implications for applying data assimilation schemes firstly vegetation dynamics are parametrized using a pre defined root zone depth growth pattern as the root zone depth varies in the growing season also the depth of the first aggregation box of metaswap varies data assimilation results are therefore only comparable for periods with similar root zone depths like summer or winter periods secondly the data assimilation scheme requires a model restart after each update step the use of a single precision format in the model restart files introduces small differences in the restarted model run van walsum 2017 section 4 1 discusses the effect of the model restart on model accuracy 2 2 2 modflow modflow 2005 is a software package for simulating 3d groundwater flow harbaugh et al 2017 the schematization of modflow in lhm consists of seven layers these seven aquifers and aquitards represent the hydrogeological layers distinguished in the dutch national hydrogeological database regis de lange et al 2014 modflow is coupled to metaswap using a shared state variable phreatic groundwater head for modflow and groundwater level for metaswap respectively van walsum and veldhuizen 2011 during each time step groundwater levels are determined by iteration of modflow and metaswap the iteration stops when the difference in groundwater head of modflow and groundwater level of metaswap is within a pre defined limit 2 2 3 data assimilation for metaswap modflow models the potential of data assimilation for coupled metaswap modflow models has been studied before schuurmans et al 2011 assimilated satellite based actual evapotranspiration data using a constant gain kalman filter to update actual evapotranspiration model estimates furthermore hartanto et al 2017 used satellite based actual evapotranspiration data in combination with a particle filter to improve discharge simulations due to the availability of high resolution soil moisture observations we extend the findings of schuurmans et al 2011 and hartanto et al 2017 by assessing the applicability of soil moisture observations to update soil moisture states of metaswap in the aforementioned studies the entire metaswap grid was scaled with a single factor per time step therefore not accounting for the spatial distribution of the observations the openda framework enables assimilation of multiple observations at various locations 2 3 study area the study area is the twente region in the east of the netherlands see fig 2 the region includes part of the dinkel and regge catchments and is situated in a temperate marine climate zone hendriks et al 2014 annual precipitation rates vary between 800 and 850 mm kaandorp et al 2018 the region is relatively flat with an elevation between 3 to 85 m a s l and has a size of approximately 40 km by 50 km glacial ridges form elevated features in the landscape the main soil types are sand and loamy sand while the main land use is agriculture the water system is free draining and water management is mainly performed by operating a system of weirs and pumps 2 4 data we use the smap soil moisture active passive l3 enhanced radiometer only daily gridded soil moisture product for the data assimilation scheme entekhabi et al 2010 chan et al 2018 o neill et al 2018 the value of smap data for hydrological data assimilation has been shown in several studies kolassa et al 2017 lievens et al 2017 koster et al 2018 blyverket et al 2019 the delivery of the enhanced smap soil moisture products was motivated by the gap that emerged after failure of the smap radar chan et al 2018 das et al 2018 the 9 km resolution of the enhanced data products is achieved through an optimal interpolation technique applied to the antenna temperature from which the brightness temperature t b is calculated subsequently the same soil moisture retrieval procedure is followed as is applied to the native t b data we use the baseline smap l3 enhanced product which relies on the single channel algorithm at v polarization sca v the smap l3 enhanced product is available approximately every 2 3 days for the twente region colliander et al 2017 found that smap soil moisture products generally perform well in the twente region chan et al 2018 assessed the accuracy of the enhanced smap l3 products in the twente region using in situ soil moisture measurements at 5 cm soil depth from the twente network see next section for the period april 2015 october 2016 and found an unbiased root mean square error urmse of 0 056 m 3 m 3 for this study we used the soil moisture retrievals from the morning satellite overpasses during the morning the moisture and temperature profiles across the soil vegetation system are more uniform which is one of the assumptions underlying retrieval algorithms indeed chan et al 2018 found more reliable soil moisture estimates for data collected in the morning compared to the data collected in the afternoon furthermore we use in situ soil moisture measurements from a monitoring network operating since 2009 the network is maintained by the faculty of itc of the university of twente the network consists of 20 stations equipped with decagon em50 data loggers and probes for measuring both soil moisture and soil temperature dente et al 2012 decagon ec tm probes were installed when the network was first developed gradually the probes were replaced by 5tm probes soil type specific calibration functions have been developed for both sensors the expected accuracies are 0 023 m 3 m 3 for the ec tm probes and 0 027 m 3 m 3 for the 5tm probes respectively the station locations are shown in fig 2 the sensors are installed in agricultural fields except station 20 which is installed in a forest area the stations provide a reading every 15 min since july 2009 at nominal soil depths of 5 10 20 40 and 80 cm installation of the monitoring network is similar to the installation of the raam soil moisture monitoring network described in benninga et al 2018 the in situ measurements are used to validate the assimilation results 2 5 error model noise definition we perturb the metaswap ensemble members for the enkf scheme by adding noise to the model forcing syed et al 2004 show that precipitation and potential evaporation are the most dominant forcing terms for the hydrological cycle in addition uncertainties in precipitation measurements dominate errors in subsurface and runoff predictions mcmillan et al 2011 tian et al 2013 show that a multiplicative error model outperforms an additive error model for daily precipitation measurements we perturb input rasters of daily precipitation and daily makkink reference evapotranspiration with gaussian white multiplicative noise the noise is described using the distribution mean and standard deviation we assume that the errors in the input data are not systematic and therefore in the case of multiplicative noise the distribution mean is set equal to one the standard deviation of the precipitation error distribution function is often arbitrarily set ranging from 15 weerts and el serafy 2006 up to 50 pauwels and de lannoy 2006 of the nominal precipitation value we found that the model ensemble does not collapse when using a standard deviation defined as 25 of the maximum daily precipitation rate the average annual maximum daily precipitation rate in the twente area is close to 30 mm for the years between 1961 and 2014 golroudbary et al 2017 knmi 2018b correspondingly we assume that the error distribution of the precipitation input has a standard deviation of 7 5 mm in a similar way we assume a standard deviation of 2 mm for the reference evapotranspiration input knmi 2018a furthermore using the knmi precipitation and reference evapotranspiration datasets we found that the correlation length of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration is larger than our region of interest approximately 40 km by 50 km therefore we assume a spatial correlation length of 50 km for the noise in every direction which means that the spatial anisotropy of precipitation fields is not considered in addition the smap observations are perturbed with gaussian white additive noise for data assimilation applications drusch et al 2009 and de rosnay et al 2013 defined the soil moisture satellite observational error as a standard deviation with a value of 0 010 m 3 m 3 we use a standard deviation of 0 056 m 3 m 3 for defining the satellite observation error this error was retrieved from the study of chan et al 2018 which focuses on the smap product and the twente region 2 6 experimental setup we set up two experiments to assess the applicability of the enkf for updating soil moisture estimates of the metamodel metaswap first we test the metaswap openda data assimilation implementation by performing a synthetic experiment often referred to as a twin experiment then we evaluate data assimilation in a real world application on regional and local spatial scales using the smap satellite data the flowcharts visualized in fig 3 show the research steps for the two experiments 2 6 1 twin experiment a twin experiment allows testing of a data assimilation implementation in an idealized situation remy et al 2002 robinson and lermusiaux 2002 irrgang et al 2017 the goal is to assess whether the enkf scheme improves the accuracy of soil moisture model estimates when all error statistics are known the twin experiment is performed for the in situ station locations and for a period of two months the twin experiment spans the period may 1 2015 to july 1 2015 the twin experiment consists of three model runs twin truth this run represents the true state of root zone soil moisture in the period may 1 2015 to july 1 2015 the run produces synthetic soil moisture observations which are assimilated in the twin enkf run the synthetic observations are assumed to be perfectly accurate twin ol this run represents a reference simulation without data assimilation also known as an open loop ol run to resemble an imperfect model we perturbed the forcing data of this run white multiplicative noise with a nominal value of 2 is added to the forcing data to resemble model uncertainty twin enkf this run applies the enkf using the metaswap openda framework to correct root zone soil moisture by assimilating the synthetic soil moisture observations from the twin truth run the run contains the same uncertainty as the twin ol run by using the same perturbed forcing data in general increasing the ensemble size will lead to a better representation of model uncertainty zhang et al 2016 however due to computational limitations one has to find a balance between computational costs and appropriate ensemble size he et al 2019 to determine the number of ensemble members we varied the ensemble size 8 16 32 and 64 members and assessed the corresponding root mean square error rmse of the twin enkf run we found that at least 32 ensemble members are needed to get a good representation of model uncertainty see fig 5 the twin experiment is successful if the accuracy of the twin enkf soil moisture estimates increases with respect to the soil moisture estimates of the twin ol run the accuracy is assessed using three performance indicators the rmse for the absolute deviation the model bias for the systematic deviation and the pearson correlation coefficient r for the dynamics the rmse is defined as 1 rmse i 1 n θ i obs θ i pred 2 n in which θ i obs are the observed soil moisture estimates in this case the synthetic observations from the twin truth run θ i pred are the predicted soil moisture estimates from the twin ol and twin enkf runs and n is the number of observations the closer the rmse is to zero the more accurate the model predictions are next the model bias is defined as 2 bias i 1 n θ i obs θ i pred n again the closer the bias is to zero the less biased the model predictions are last the pearson correlation coefficient r is defined as 3 r i 1 n θ obs θ obs θ pred θ pred i 1 n θ obs θ obs 2 i 1 n θ pred θ pred 2 in which θ obs and θ pred are the averaged observed and predicted soil moisture estimates the correlation coefficient r can range between 1 and 1 a value of 1 1 indicates a perfect positive negative linear relationship between θ obs and θ pred 2 6 2 assimilation of smap observations next we performed an enkf data assimilation run with the smap l3 enhanced observations an enkf run is performed for the full year 2016 to capture soil moisture variability in both wet and dry periods 32 ensemble members are used to resemble model uncertainty the ensemble members are initialized with a spin up period between january 1 2014 and january 1 2016 furthermore a deterministic model run without data assimilation is performed we refer to this run as smap ol to distinguish between this run and the twin ol run the updated soil moisture model estimates and the open loop run are validated by evaluating the rmse model bias and correlation coefficient r performance indicators using the in situ soil moisture measurements the in situ measurements are daily averaged both satellite soil moisture and in situ soil moisture observations are inherently different with respect to each other in situ soil moisture measurements contain significant uncertainties related to accuracy precision and spatial support lekshmi et al 2014 these uncertainties limit validation possibilities on local scales upscaling in situ measurements to regional averages reduces sampling errors cosh et al 2006 crow et al 2012 zhao and yang 2018 therefore we evaluate the results on both regional and local spatial scales a typical regional scale is the management area of a regional water authority which is approximately the size of the study area we define field scale as a typical local scale which is resembled by individual soil moisture monitoring stations first the regional scale applicability of the smap l3 enhanced product for data assimilation is assessed by evaluating the performance indicators for both the in situ data and the model estimates the in situ data and model estimates are spatially averaged we refer to these results as smap enkf avg the following twelve in situ stations have a complete data series for the year 2016 and are used for the averaging 1 2 4 7 9 12 13 15 17 18 19 20 the locations are shown in fig 2 then the local scale applicability of the smap l3 enhanced product is assessed by evaluating the performance indicators for the stations used for the regional averaging as described in section 2 2 1 data assimilation results using the metaswap model are only comparable for periods with similar root zone depths therefore we split the year 2016 in a summer and winter period the length of the summer period depends on the parametrized vegetation type the root zone depth of the grass vegetation type varies between 0 20 m in winter and 0 40 m in summer the root zone depth of the maize vegetation type varies between 0 10 m in winter and 0 40 m in summer the root zone depth of the forest vegetation type does not vary to define a summer period for this vegetation type we split the year in half table 1 shows the parametrized vegetation type and summer period length since the first aggregation box of metaswap represents the root zone up to 40 cm depth we use the in situ measurements at 10 cm depth for the winter period and the in situ measurements at 20 cm depth for the summer period because the model result is an aggregate of the root zone soil moisture profile we consider the measurements at these depths representative for the winter and summer periods since the most abundant vegetation type in the list of selected stations is grass we assume that the summer period of grass is representative for the regional average results 3 results 3 1 twin experiment first we show the synthetic twin experiment results fig 4 shows the performance indicators for the twin ol and twin enkf runs as described in section 2 6 1 the twin ol run represents a model run with randomly added errors the twin enkf run is the result of assimilating synthetic observations of perfect accuracy to update the soil moisture model state estimates in general the results indicate that the metaswap openda implementation is able to correct for synthetically added errors for which the error structure is known in terms of rmse and model bias the accuracy of model estimates improves in the twin enkf run in comparison with the twin ol run the rmse of the twin ol run ranges from 0 0013 to 0 010 m 3 m 3 while the rmse of the twin enkf run ranges from 0 to 0 0032 m 3 m 3 the bias of the twin ol run ranges from 0 0010 to 0 0090 m 3 m 3 while the bias of the twin enkf run ranges from 0 00010 to 0 0024 m 3 m 3 furthermore in terms of correlation coefficient r the accuracy of model estimates generally increases in the twin enkf run compared with the twin ol run the correlation coefficient of the twin ol run ranges from 0 98 to 1 while the correlation coefficient of the twin enkf run ranges from 0 99 to 1 however the accuracy of the twin enkf run is lower for three stations 7 11 and 16 in terms of correlation coefficient furthermore we assessed whether the ensemble size of 32 members is sufficient fig 5 shows the change in rmse of the twin enkf run when increasing the number of ensemble members the rmse of the ensemble mean decreases for larger ensemble sizes the decrease in rmse flattens out for an ensemble size larger than 32 therefore we assume that an ensemble of 32 members is a good balance between accuracy and computational requirements 3 2 smap assimilation regional comparison this section presents the findings of assimilating smap data into the metamodel metaswap fig 6 shows the enkf data assimilation results for the regional soil moisture estimates in the year 2016 the regional estimates are obtained by spatially averaging the soil moisture model estimates of each in situ location a visual comparison of the smap ol and smap enkf avg runs shows an improvement for both the winter and summer periods of the smap enkf avg run except in the beginning of may furthermore the accuracy of model estimates only slightly improves in the period between january 1 april 1 table 2 shows the rmse model bias and correlation coefficient for the winter and summer periods in terms of rmse and model bias the accuracy of model estimates improves in the smap enkf run in comparison with the smap ol run the decrease in rmse and model bias is larger in the summer period in terms of correlation coefficient the accuracy of model estimates decreases in the smap enkf run in comparison with the smap ol run the decrease in correlation coefficient is smaller in the summer period 3 3 smap assimilation local comparison an overview of the local scale assimilation results is shown in table 2 for the winter period in terms of rmse the assimilation increases the accuracy of local soil moisture estimates for 8 out of 12 stations in terms of model bias the assimilation increases the accuracy for 7 out of 12 stations in terms of correlation coefficient the assimilation increases the accuracy for 3 out of 12 stations for the summer period in terms of rmse the assimilation increases the accuracy of local soil moisture estimates for 10 out of 12 stations in terms of model bias the assimilation increases the accuracy for 11 out of 12 stations in terms of correlation coefficient the assimilation increases the accuracy for 5 out of 12 stations furthermore the enkf corrects the low correlation found during the summer period in the smap ol run for station 17 however the enkf is not able to correct for the negative correlation found during the winter period in the smap ol run for station 2 next we focus on local results for two stations station 9 where the updated estimates clearly improve and station 7 for which the accuracy declines fig 7 shows the assimilation results for station 9 the accuracy of the model estimates increases in the enkf run similar to the patterns found for the regional soil moisture estimates in terms of rmse and model bias the accuracy of model estimates improves in both the winter and summer period in terms of correlation coefficient the accuracy of model estimates improves in the summer period and declines in the winter period fig 8 shows the assimilation results for station 7 since the parametrized vegetation type at this station is maize the length of the summer period is different than for station 9 see table 1 while the accuracy of model estimates slightly improves in terms of rmse and correlation coefficient the accuracy in terms of model bias declines in the winter period furthermore the accuracy of model estimates shows no improvement in terms of rmse and model bias and a small decline in terms of correlation coefficient in the summer period the enkf does not significantly affect the model estimates a possible explanation is that the smap l3 enhanced product does not reflect local root zone conditions for this station a thick clay layer can be found below the root zone at station 7 in addition the subsurface of the field contains pipes which drain excess water during wet winter periods 4 discussion 4 1 application of data assimilation for metamodelling twin experiment we assessed whether data assimilation can be a tool to integrate soil moisture observations into unsaturated zone metamodels the metamodelling concept of metaswap depends on the database with pre calculated soil saturation profiles updating this database is a time consuming process the twin experiment and smap enkf runs show that data assimilation forms a good alternative to update the metamodel the twin experiment indicates that applying an enkf with perfectly accurate synthetic observations increases the accuracy of the soil moisture estimates of metaswap and does not lead to model instabilities or other spurious model behaviour therefore we conclude that the metaswap openda implementation is suitable for assimilating soil moisture observations into the metamodel metaswap also we found that an ensemble size of 32 members gives a good representation of model uncertainty it is important to note that although fig 4 shows that the accuracy of soil moisture estimates increases in the twin enkf run also an inherent model uncertainty exists that cannot be mitigated using data assimilation for example the enkf reduces the rmse to a lower limit even when using observations of perfect accuracy this inherent uncertainty is among others caused by the restart procedure of metaswap after each update step as is described in section 2 2 1 4 2 application of data assimilation for metamodelling smap experiment table 2 shows that the metaswap openda implementation has value in an experiment with smap l3 enhanced surface soil moisture observations the accuracy of model estimates improves on both regional and local scales in terms of rmse and model bias the improvement is larger for the summer period than for the winter period in terms of correlation coefficient the improvement in accuracy is less distinct in the winter period only three stations show an improvement in correlation coefficient in the summer period almost half of the stations show an improvement in correlation coefficient the larger variability of the smap surface soil moisture observations with respect to the in situ root zone measurements might explain the impact of the assimilation on the correlation coefficient also the availability of smap observations influences the effectiveness of the assimilation for example less smap observations are available in the period january 1 2016 april 1 2016 in comparison with the rest of 2016 consequently the model state is less often updated during the smap enkf run in the period up to april 1 2016 affecting the performance of the enkf in the defined winter period 4 3 regional versus local spatial scales the smap l3 enhanced product corresponds well with the in situ measurements on a regional scale chan et al 2018 therefore the accuracy of regional scale soil moisture model estimates increase after assimilation of the smap l3 enhanced product in terms of rmse and model bias data assimilation results on local scales largely depend on how well the smap l3 enhanced product represents local field conditions we want to stress that both the in situ measurements and lhm simulations contain uncertainties e g they might not be representative for local field conditions as explained in section 2 6 2 new remote sensing products from satellites such as sentinel 1 are expected to make the leap from regional to local field scales balsamo et al 2018 for example bauer marschallinger et al 2019 developed a high resolution surface soil moisture product based on sentinel 1 satellite data and a change detection algorithm the spatial resolution of this product is 1 km by 1 km we expect that such high resolution surface soil moisture products will lead to new possibilities for soil moisture data assimilation in operational water resources management furthermore the model bias and correlation coefficient show that while the enkf is able to correct for systematic model errors the variability of the smap l3 enhanced surface soil moisture product does not always reflect dynamics in deeper layers carranza et al 2018 show a strong vertical variability between soil moisture at 5 and 40 cm depth in the twente region the vertical variability forms a challenge for data assimilation applications since most if not all remotely sensed soil moisture data concerns surface soil moisture due to sensor constraints however the smap enkf run shows that a root zone soil moisture model can be updated by assimilating smap surface soil moisture observations the results in table 2 show that assimilating the 9 km resolution surface smap l3 enhanced observations increases the accuracy of local soil moisture model estimates for more than half of the stations thus the smap surface soil moisture product has significant value in data assimilation approaches renzullo et al 2014 dumedah et al 2015 and blyverket et al 2019 also show the value of assimilating satellite based surface soil moisture observations into a hydrological model to update root zone soil moisture estimates we want to accentuate the impact of the smap observation on december 6 2016 this observation significantly impacts the assimilation run as visible in fig 6 and fig 7 the in situ measurements do not indicate a steep reduction in soil moisture on that day so the smap observation may be erroneous temperatures dropped below 0 c on december 6 2016 which probably significantly affected the smap reading similarly the smap l3 enhanced product does not reflect field conditions well during may 2016 which also significantly affects the assimilation run 4 4 implications for operational water resources management the assimilation of high resolution remotely sensed soil moisture products leads to new possibilities for integrated physically based hydrological models in operational water resources management pezij et al 2019 found that hydrological models are currently not considered by dutch regional operational water managers as decisive tools for decision making among others regional operational water managers identified model accuracy as a limiting factor data assimilation is a tool to increase the accuracy and hence the application of hydrological modelling in operational water management yet combining data assimilation schemes and integrated physically based modelling for operational water resources management is currently limited due to among others computational requirements sun et al 2016 even with the application of metamodels for simulating hydrological processes at field scale high performance computing hpc facilities are often required for efficient implementation of data assimilation schemes furthermore the implementation of remote sensing data in operational management requires additional investments in data acquiring processing and storage facilities however we expect that due to the development of new computational methods these challenges become less of an issue in the future he et al 2019 for example kurtz et al 2017 show the potential of combining data assimilation and integrated physically based hydrological modelling with cloud computing techniques for operational water resources management ma et al 2015 identifies several promising tools such as cluster based hpc systems and cloud computing for fast calculations and parallel file systems for big data storage however the implementation of such tools requires investments in computational infrastructure we expect that in the near future research and investments into these promising new tools will increase which will help to integrate the application of data assimilation schemes in operational water resources management 5 conclusions we assessed the applicability of satellite based regional scale surface soil moisture observations to increase the accuracy of root zone soil moisture estimates of a metamodel this study shows that combining metamodels with data assimilation schemes allows incorporating new information in metamodels therefore integrating hydrological metamodelling and satellite based soil moisture observations leads to new opportunities for operational water resources management a data assimilation scheme was developed for the unsaturated zone metamodel metaswap using the openda open source data assimilation framework a synthetic experiment known as a twin experiment showed the value of integrating metamodelling and an ensemble kalman filter enkf data assimilation scheme furthermore the applicability of the 9 km by 9 km resolution smap l3 enhanced surface soil moisture product for the metaswap openda framework was assessed for the year 2016 on a regional scale the updated root zone soil moisture model estimates show a larger skill in terms of rmse and model bias in terms of correlation coefficient the skill of the updated root zone soil moisture model estimates is slightly lower than in the open loop run the decline is partly explained by the larger variability of the assimilated surface soil moisture observations with respect to the in situ root zone soil moisture measurements on a local scale similar results were found however the applicability of the smap l3 enhanced product on local scales depends on how well the smap product represents local field conditions in addition we show that the assimilation of surface soil moisture observations leads to increased accuracy of root zone soil moisture model estimates the improvement of the soil moisture model estimates is larger in the summer period than in the winter period of 2016 the limited availability of smap l3 enhanced soil moisture observations in the first months of 2016 might explain this difference the limited availability is caused by among others freezing of the soil in winter periods as a final remark high resolution surface soil moisture products will lead to new opportunities in terms of data assimilation in operational water resources management nevertheless significant developments and investments in terms of computation capacities are required for operational application of remote sensing data in data assimilation schemes however recent developments in hpc and cloud computing are expected to contribute to the integration of data assimilation in operational water

due to the size of the model state error covariance matrix p in hydrological model predictions it is generally not feasible to explicitly calculate p an alternative approach is to estimate p using a sample of evolved model states leading to a lower rank estimation of p this ensemble of model runs is created by perturbing model forcing parameters and or states the model perturbations η have to be defined in such a way that the model ensemble represents total model uncertainty this method introduced by evensen 1994 is generally known as an ensemble kalman filter enkf we apply a stochastic or perturbed observations enkf burgers et al 1998 houtekamer and mitchell 1998 applying an enkf consists of a forecast f and analysis step a the forecast and analysis model state ensembles are represented as b 1 x f x 1 f x 2 f x n f b 2 x a x 1 a x 2 a x n a where x f is the forecasted model state x a is the analysis model state and n is the ensemble size the subscript indicates the

short daily to monthly and long seasonal to decadal timescales the u s geological survey s national water quality assessment nawqa enhanced trends network etn program instrumented and sampled three wells in the edwards aquifer in south central texas the wells were instrumented to provide high frequency continuous subhourly water quality data temperature ph specific conductance and dissolved oxygen which were augmented by the collection of discrete samples about 6 per year for a range of geochemical constituents including selected isotopes and age tracers etn data 2013 2017 are considered with data from additional sites for the same time period and also historical records over more than 80 years of climatic and hydrologic conditions during the four year study hydrologic conditions transitioned from very dry to very wet sites in the updip unconfined part of the aquifer showed notable changes in water level and geochemistry 1 in response to rainfall recharge events and 2 over the multiyear dry wet cycle sites in the downdip confined part of the aquifer showed changes in water level spring discharge over similar timescales although the response is more muted geochemistry at the downdip confined sites however varied slowly and minimally indicating that the geochemical response of the deeper aquifer is decoupled from recent hydrologic responses changes at the updip unconfined sites reflect mixing with recent recharge whereas the downdip confined sites were dominated by mineral solution reactions resulting from longer decadal residence times mean groundwater ages interpreted from measured age tracers and lumped parameter models range from 7 to 700 years where mixed with premodern downdip water but were mostly modern the aquifer is characterized by updip to downdip trends in geochemistry with respect to water rock interaction and groundwater age fourier spectral analysis of historical records indicate hydrologic variability has occurred at dominant periods of 30 and 15 years in conjunction with age tracers these results provide insight into timescales at which the aquifer s public supply is vulnerable to changes in the water quality of recharge keywords karst water quality groundwater age edwards aquifer trends 1 introduction decades of study have led to comprehensive methods and techniques for characterizing groundwater quality understanding the timescales on which groundwater quality changes however and what drives these changes is less clear yet this knowledge informs groundwater management protection and resource sustainability this is especially true in karst aquifers where rapid recharge and groundwater flow rates can quickly affect water levels and spring discharge hess and white 1988 ford and williams 2007 karst aquifers are important sources of drinking water supplying about 25 of the global population ford and williams 2007 as well as habitat for a diversity of fauna humphreys 2011 because karst is characterized by rapid transport of recharge through voids and conduits rapid changes in water quality are well documented e g lakey and krothe 1996 winston and criss 2004 mahler and massei 2007 thus a karst setting is well suited to assess the magnitude timescales and controls on temporal changes in groundwater quality to better understand how groundwater quality changes over short daily to monthly and long seasonal to decadal timescales the u s geological survey s national water quality assessment nawqa project began a monitoring and sampling program in 2013 that combined high frequency monitoring and discrete sample collection in small well networks 1 3 wells across different hydrologic settings one of these enhanced trends networks etn is in the edwards balcones fault zone aquifer

endemic and threatened or endangered species texas state university 2018 studies of karst groundwater have long focused on springs as spring discharge provides an integrated response of the aquifer system quinlan 1989 few groundwater studies have incorporated high frequency monitoring of groundwater quality although newly available tools now make it feasible for specific constituents e g opsahl et al 2017 page et al 2017 saraceno et al 2018 traditional sampling methods for groundwater quality are often time consuming which constrain data collection even relatively frequent sample collection e g quarterly or monthly might not be representative of the timescales on which water quality varies 2 setting 2 1 hydrologic setting the edwards aquifer fig 1 developed in extensively karstified lower cretaceous carbonate rocks in a narrow band along the balcones fault zone late cenozoic faulting formed a series of high angle en echelon faults with down to the coast displacement resulting in blocks of aquifer rocks that are partially to completely offset and divide the confined and unconfined parts of the aquifer maclay and small 1983 hydrostratigraphic units are located progressively deeper in the downdip subsurface due to faulting the aquifer ranges in thickness from 107 to 152 m and is characterized by relatively high transmissivities maclay 1995 upland streams flow to the south

flow is to the east and northeast and is focused in highly permeable units maclay and small 1986 maclay and land 1988 in the unconfined part of the aquifer groundwater also flows downdip to the confined zone most aquifer recharge occurs as streamflow losses across the recharge zone along with some recharge through karst features in interstream areas maclay and land 1988 thorkildsen and mcelhaney 1992 lindgren et al 2004 recharge is often dynamic and rapid intense storms with heavy rainfall are common generating runoff in ephemeral streams natural discharge occurs at large regional springs such as comal springs fig 1 as well smaller springs and numerous groundwater supply wells previous studies of the edwards aquifer have characterized the water quality as excellent with few contaminant concentrations exceeding human health based benchmarks bush et al 2000 edwards aquifer authority 2015 lindsey et al 2009 land cover in the region is largely undeveloped forest and

chlorination for disinfection o conner 2018 nonetheless detectable concentrations of contaminants such as pesticides and volatile organic compounds indicate that anthropogenic activities on the land surface affect the aquifer bush et al 2000 bexar county s population grew by more than 40 between 2000 and 2017 u s census bureau 2018 and recent studies indicate that urbanization increases the

central texas bomar 1995 as is flash flooding in response to intense storms and heavy rainfall focused recharge events result from streamflow in response to rainfall runoff during this study climatic and hydrologic conditions were variable fig 2 drought conditions preceded the study and prevailed initially providing baseline information for when little aquifer recharge occurred wet conditions in 2015 resulted in extensive recharge and an accompanying regional hydrologic response transitioning to wetter than normal conditions that mostly persisted through mid 2017 fig 2 during the latter part

concentration for each model based on the mean age distribution type and parameters and the atmospheric tracer inputs model parameters are calibrated to minimize the misfit between the measured and simulated tracer concentrations each tracer has associated uncertainties thus the use of multiple tracers where possible often improves constraints on groundwater age not all tracers were interpreted

among sites figs 2 and 3 resulting in 5 8 samples per year most samples were collected without regard to hydrologic conditions but typically not within several days of a runoff and recharge generating rainfall rainfall recharge event a small number of samples from the parkwood well were collected specifically to characterize the aquifer response to recharge events these samples were collected as

intermittent and generally rapid water level increases occurred following rainfall and aquifer recharge events at the two unconfined wells shavano and parkwood these rapid and short lived increases in water level were commonly accompanied by similarly rapid and short lived decreases in specific conductance in contrast specific conductance at the confined aquifer sites z ded psw1 psw2 and comal 1

increased at all sites but there were no generally consistent temporal trends in physicochemistry e g specific conductance increased both over the study period and relative to hydrologic conditions at

study period figs 4 6 table s2 numerous constituents showed increases or decreases at individual wells over the study period but these were not generally consistent from site to site these differences

unconfined sites to downgradient confined sites table 2 many of these systematic changes in geochemistry reflect carbonate reactions groundwater samples were ca hco3 or ca mg hco3 type waters table 2 like many karst aquifers edwards aquifer groundwater is oxic and ph neutral the median dissolved oxygen concentration and ph value for all discrete samples were 5 7 mg l and 6 9 respectively samples

whereas groundwater equilibrates rapidly with calcite dolomite reaction rates are slow white 1988 fourier spectral analysis results for timeseries for comal springs discharge and water levels for well

supplemental information table s1 4 2 age tracer results and interpretation reported mean ages represent a distribution of ages mixing of water of different ages has been shown to be important for karst aquifers because of the complex network of conduit fracture and matrix porosity plummer and busenberg 2005 long and putnam 2006 repeat collection of age tracers allowed for investigation of the variability of residence time and the relation between age estimates and changes in hydrologic conditions and water quality calibrating measured age tracers to lpms provides a practical and consistent approach to consider variations in tracer based age as a tool to better understand scales of water quality change age tracer interpretations and lpms are summarized in tables 3 and s3 and musgrove et al 2019 all analyzed samples has measurable 3h concentrations ranging from 0 71 to 1 61 tritium units tu table 3 3h values decreased downdip from shavano median of 1 40 tu to psw2 the deepest well median of 0 85 tu with intermediate values at the midgradient psw1 median of 1 03 tu the few values available for ancillary wells were similar ranging from 0 98 to 1 41 tu slightly lower values occurred at comal 1 0 98 1 09 tu 3h results indicate that edwards aquifer groundwater is dominated by modern water but that age generally increases with depth and distance along flow gradients 14c is infrequently useful for dating modern water because of numerous uncertainties 14c concentrations are often altered or diluted from the atmospheric signal by exchanges among carbon reservoirs such as organic carbon and carbonates in soils and aquifer materials han and plummer 2016 additionally with additions of bomb pulse carbon to the atmosphere atmospheric 14c values since 1950 have a large range that often significantly exceeds 100 pmc in modern groundwaters the long 14c half life allows for little decay in modern water radioactive decay over a period of 100 years would result in a 14c decrease of 1 pmc measured 14c values ranged from 54 66 to 88 22 pmc table s3 14c values from psw1 and psw2 had a relatively narrow range 2 pmc at each well the range was larger 6 pmc at the unconfined shavano well 14c values were lower than expected for modern groundwater indicating that geochemical dilution is an important process in this carbonate aquifer numerous approaches have been proposed to adjust groundwater 14c values to account for processes altering the 14c content along flow paths han and plummer 2016 for this study the 14c analytical correction model described by han and plummer 2013 was used adjusted 14c values exceeded 100 pmc table s3 indicative of modern water and likely overcorrection for most samples where values were 100 pmc these results are consistent with uncertainties for 14c for modern water and thus 14c results were not considered in most lpms for estimating tracer based ages 14c results were used in lpms at psw2 other age tracer concentrations sf6 3hetrit were used in lpms as available and suitable tables 3 s3 many sf6 concentrations were higher than that possible for air water equilibrium indicative of contamination by non atmospheric sources a dispersion model dm or 2 component mixture binary mixing model bmm of modern water and an older component where each component is described by a dm jurgens et al 2012 consistently provided the most realistic lpms mixing models were used at psw1 and psw2 at psw1 a bmm approach using multiple age tracers where available yielded more realistic results than models based only on 3h and only results for the 8 samples with multiple age tracers are discussed herein at psw1 and psw2 the age of the older bmm component was determined by iteration with lpms then accounting for the age and proportion of the young fraction tracer based mean groundwater ages generally increased from the upgradient unconfined sites to the downgradient confined sites fig 8 table 3 ages at shavano significantly decreased over the study period kendall tau 0 40 from a median of 23 years during the dry period to a median of 15 years during the wet period fig 8 table 3 dry period and wet period ages are statistically different based on comparison with the nonparametric mann whitney u test 5 discussion 5 1 water quality changes across the hydrologic gradient spatial variability in water quality across the aquifer provides insight into regional processes controlling aquifer geochemistry geochemical tracers of mineral solution reactions in carbonate groundwater systems include mg ca and sr ca ratios sr isotopes 87sr 86sr and dolomite saturation indices plummer 1977 oetting et al 1996 musgrove and banner 2004 musgrove et al 2010 wong et al 2011 with progressive geochemical evolution e g by processes of calcite recrystallization incongruent dolomite dissolution and prior precipitation of calcite along flow paths groundwater mg ca and sr ca ratios generally increase with increased residence time typically along flow paths median mg ca ratios increase downdip and downgradient with the highest values at psw2 fig 7 table 2 which is indicative of increased mineral solution reactions a corresponding decrease in 87sr 86sr values table 2 that approach those for the cretaceous age aquifer rocks koepnick et al 1985 is similarly indicative of increased water rock interaction associated with longer groundwater residence times musgrove and banner 2004 also consistent are mean ages which generally increased from the upgradient unconfined sites to the downgradient confined sites fig 8 tables 2 and 3 the deepest well psw2 is near the freshwater saline water interface fig 1 which represents the transition from a zone of more active flow of fresh groundwater to a downdip zone of less active flow of saline groundwater the geochemical composition of water at psw2 is different than other confined aquifer sites table 2 with a composition indicative of mixing with a small component of downdip saline water e g elevated cl so4 f li and sr concentrations as a result groundwater geochemistry at psw2 is not fully representative of the regional downgradient confined aquifer but rather the terminal freshwater system adjacent to the saline water interface the saline zone is characterized by numerous complex hydrochemical facies clement and sharp 1988 oetting et al 1996 which might locally influence the adjacent freshwater zone saline zone groundwater has been affected by halite and incongruent gypsum dissolution oetting et al 1996 which might contribute to higher cl and so4 concentrations respectively interaction with celestite srso4 or strontianite srco3 in saline zone aquifer rocks maclay and small 1983 likely contributes to elevated sr concentrations oetting et al 1996 musgrove et al 2010 elevated concentrations of f and li are also associated with saline zone groundwater lambert et al 2009 lpm mean groundwater ages for psw2 based on a mixture with a component of premodern water table s3 are older than other edwards sites fig 8 and consistent with mixing with a small saline zone component this has been previously proposed to account for dissolved he results for groundwater near the saline zone boundary hunt et al 2010 5 2 water quality changes across time and hydrologic conditions temporal variability in water levels and water quality across the aquifer was notably different in pattern between sites water levels and spring discharge responded rapidly hours to days to rainfall events that generated streamflow and corresponding aquifer recharge figs 2 and 3 water levels and spring discharge also varied in response to the multiyear change in hydrologic conditions from dry to wet with higher water levels and discharge during the wet period fig 3 the geochemical response was more notable in the upgradient unconfined sites than in the downgradient confined aquifer sites fig 3 table 2 which we address separately 5 2 1 upgradient unconfined aquifer sites water level changes at the unconfined sites shavano and parkwood showed a flashy response to recharge events particularly during the dry period with rapid increases immediately after rainfall and recharge quickly followed by a relatively rapid recession fig 3 water level increases were accompanied by decreases in specific conductance from dilution with recent recharge flow in karst is often considered relative to two endmember flow types 1 quick flow or conduit flow which is recharge that moves rapidly through the aquifer to discharge at wells or springs and 2 slow flow or diffuse flow which is water stored within the matrix atkinson 1977 martin and screaton 2001 most karst aquifers have some degree of both flow types although categorization along this continuum is useful for understanding the degree of aquifer karstification and corresponding insights into water availability and water quality atkinson 1977 florea and vacher 2006 the flashy response to recharge pulses and inverse relation between water level and specific conductance at the unconfined wells are indicative of their connection to a well developed conduit system as hydrologic conditions transitioned from the dry period to the wet period the response of the unconfined sites became less flashy figs 3 and 9 that is water level rises were smaller and whereas the initial response remained relatively rapid the subsequent recovery was slower with sustained water level increases this shift in aquifer response from the dry period to the wet period reflects a change in aquifer dynamics as regional water levels and correspondingly aquifer storage increased conduits can occur at different elevations within the aquifer and depending on water levels can be saturated or drained affecting overall aquifer transmissivity and storativity larocque et al 1998 when aquifer water levels are low such as during the dry period recharge pulses move rapidly through the drained conduit system with little dilution in contrast when aquifer water levels are high such as during the wet period conduits may be saturated and recharge water can advect into the aquifer matrix vaute et al 1997 under these relatively wet and high water level conditions the response of focused recharge at the unconfined wells is muted with dilution by water within the conduits and an increase in the amount of water going into storage which contributes to the sustained water level increases this conceptual understanding of karst aquifers has been previously described to account for differences in aquifer response under different hydrologic conditions mahler and massei 2007 wong et al 2012 although more like each other in their response to recharge events than to the confined aquifer sites there are differences in the response patterns at shavano and parkwood to changes in hydrologic conditions fig 3 for most rainfall recharge events particularly during the dry period the response at shavano was greater than at parkwood with larger magnitude changes in both specific conductance and water level these differences indicate that the hydrologic response for the unconfined part of the aquifer is not spatially uniform but is affected by variable factors such as recharge amount and sources proximity to recharge flow paths to the wells and the nature and degree of the conduit network that these wells intercept consideration of spatial differences in groundwater geochemistry might reflect differences in the nature and sources of recharge across the unconfined aquifer for example parkwood has notably higher specific conductance tds cl and no3 n concentrations table 2 fig 4 which might indicate a larger component of recharge affected by urbanization such as from septic sewage and wastewater systems wilhelm et al 1994 panno et al 2006 differences in host rock mineralogy and subsequent mineral solution reactions might also contribute to localized differences in groundwater quality many geochemical constituents at parkwood are more variable than at shavano fig 4 specifically because of samples collected at parkwood in response to rainfall recharge events these samples are characterized by lower concentrations of major ions and no3 n which reflect the composition of recent dilute recharge relative to background groundwater geochemistry in contrast samples from shavano were not collected directly in response to rainfall recharge events and geochemical changes reflect background or diffuse flow water quality the shift to younger groundwater ages at shavano during the wet period fig 8 reflects an increased component of recent recharge whereas differences in recharge sources likely contribute to differences in the groundwater geochemistry at shavano and parkwood similar tracer based ages and shifts to younger ages from dry to wet conditions are consistent with influxes of recent recharge via conduits to the aquifer 5 2 2 downgradient confined aquifer sites at the downgradient confined aquifer sites water level spring discharge responses were more muted for individual rainfall and recharge events than at the upgradient unconfined sites fig 3 the hydrologic response was regionally consistent indicating that these changes likely reflect more regional hydrologic conditions that is changes in water levels measured at z ded and well j 17 and discharge at comal springs were strongly and positively correlated kendall tau correlations for each pair over the 4 year study period are 0 85 the geochemical response of the aquifer to changing patterns of recharge however was decoupled from the hydraulic response at the downgradient confined aquifer sites geochemical constituents did not vary in response to individual recharge events and showed little variability from the dry period to the wet period relative to the upgradient unconfined sites figs 3 6 table 2 there were small changes in some geochemical constituents at some sites over the study period but these were generally not consistent for example decreases in major ions i e na cl so4 at comal 1 are not observed at the other downgradient confined sites and in fact these constituents increased slightly at z ded figs 4 6 several processes might account for the overall lack of geochemical response at the downgradient confined aquifer sites if geochemical variability within the aquifer at the timescale of recharge events is limited to the conduit network wells that are not connected to conduits would be dominated by diffuse flow paths and thus have more homogeneous geochemistry a regionally extensive system of conduits is likely present in the confined aquifer hovorka et al 2004 lindgren et al 2004 worthington 2004 whereas some wells in the downgradient confined aquifer are likely connected to conduit flow paths those included in this study show no evidence of conduit flow this is not necessarily surprising as conduits typically occupy a small proportion of an aquifer and any well would have a small probability of intercepting a conduit worthington 1999 specific flow paths to individual wells are likely highly variable not all unconfined wells might be responsive to rainfall recharge events if their contributing flow paths are dominated by diffuse flow correspondingly if connected to conduit flow paths confined aquifer wells would likely demonstrate temporal geochemical variability and perhaps younger tracer based ages than measured in this study e g musgrove et al 2011 it is also possible that the amount of recharge entering the aquifer and specifically the matrix was small relative to the total amount of water in storage and thus not likely to influence groundwater geochemistry at wells unless connected to the conduit network the total available storage in the aquifer ranges from 27 to 68 billion m3 22 to 55 million acre feet maclay and land 1988 texas water development board 2016 mean annual aquifer recharge of 855 million m3 693 000 acre feet 1934 2014 edwards aquifer authority 2015 would comprise at most almost 3 of the aquifer s available storage in dry years when recharge is low e g estimated recharge for 2014 was 132 million m3 107 000 acre feet edwards aquifer authority 2015 this recharge would be less likely to affect geochemistry in the confined aquifer although total aquifer storage is also less during dry conditions maclay and land 1988 alternatively flow paths to the downgradient confined aquifer sites may be sufficiently long that water quality is well mixed and homogenized regardless of the conduit diffuse or mixed nature of the dominant flow paths tracer based ages for the downgradient confined aquifer sites were on the order of decades or older at psw2 due to mixing with a premodern saline zone component fig 8 which is consistent with this hypothesis nonetheless mean groundwater ages estimated at psw1 decreased slightly from the dry period median 55 years to the wet period median 40 years fig 8 consistent with younger water moving downgradient and mixing with groundwater in storage lpm results for psw1 were based on a mixture for which the proportion of the young fraction increased from the dry period to the wet period fig 8 5 3 summary and implications timescales of change and aquifer vulnerability the etn study design a combination of continuous monitoring and discrete sampling provides new insights into timescales of water quality variability karst aquifer dynamics and aquifer vulnerability aquifer vulnerability is of concern for karst which is susceptible to contamination because of features such as thin soils focused recharge and rapid flow paths white 1988 a comparison of the edwards and floridan aquifers concluded that vulnerability to contamination in both aquifers is strongly influenced by rapid flow paths and the dominance of modern water musgrove et al 2014 estimates of mean age are not representative of the first arrival of any contaminant introduced with recharge and transported rapidly through conduits results of dye tracer tests in the edwards aquifer provide an endmember of the most rapid travel times based on straight line distances and first appearance indicating a wide but generally rapid range of flow velocities from 13 to 5300 m per day johnson et al 2010 in the upgradient unconfined part of the aquifer rapid changes in specific conductance in response to recharge events are consistent with rapid flow velocities fig 3 whereas longer residence times and increased dilution and mixing attenuates geochemical variability at downgradient confined sites the public supply from these wells remains vulnerable to degradation of the quality of recharge water on what timescales might we expect water quality changes in the confined and deeper parts of the edwards aquifer from which public supply wells primarily draw results of this study indicate that much of the downgradient confined part of the aquifer is buffered from short term variations in water quality but remains vulnerable to water quality changes in recharging surface water such as from nutrients and pesticides over decadal timescales as contaminants are incorporated into matrix storage and move through the aquifer this vulnerability is evident for example at comal springs where the concentration of no3 n has doubled over recent decades likely in response to increased loading in aquifer recharge musgrove et al 2016 central texas climate precipitation and drought have been linked with global circulation features ropelewski and halpert 1996 hu and feng 2001 and paleoclimate archives document variations in climatic and hydrologic conditions over millennial timescales e g cleveland et al 2011 feng et al 2014 wong et al 2015 fourier spectral analysis of available modern hydrologic records comal springs discharge and well j 17 water levels indicates that the aquifer responds to multidecadal climatic signals at dominate periods of 30 and 15 years table s1 although the determination of the drivers of these specific periods is beyond the scope of this study these results provide insight into the timescales on which we might expect hydrologic variability and potential changes in water quality in the deep confined aquifer the relatively small and inconsistent changes in water quality at the confined aquifer sites during this 4 year study might be in response to such decadal scale drivers but provide an incomplete picture differences in trends in water quality constituents between sites might result from being out of phase in response to these drivers based on different age distributions the deep confined aquifer is buffered from changes in water quality in response to individual recharge events or even multi year dry wet cycles such long lag times of response to changing land uses such as urbanization or best management practices might have both positive and negative effects on groundwater quality changes effects of increasing urbanization over the edwards aquifer are a topic of considerable interest with recent studies demonstrating effects to groundwater quality caused by urbanization mahler and massei 2007 musgrove et al 2016 opsahl et al 2018 one implication of long lag times for the confined part of the aquifer is that any management actions to address water quality will also affect water quality at long lag times e g böhlke 2002 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

with data from additional sites for the same time period and also historical records over more than 80 years of climatic and hydrologic conditions during the four year study hydrologic conditions transitioned from very dry to very wet sites in the updip unconfined part of the aquifer showed notable changes in water level and geochemistry 1 in response to rainfall recharge events and 2 over the multiyear dry wet cycle sites in the downdip confined part of the aquifer showed changes in water level spring discharge over similar timescales although the response is more muted geochemistry at the downdip confined sites however varied slowly and minimally indicating that the geochemical response of the deeper aquifer is decoupled from recent hydrologic responses changes at the updip unconfined sites reflect mixing with recent recharge whereas the downdip confined sites were dominated by mineral solution reactions resulting from longer decadal residence times mean groundwater ages

keywords karst water quality groundwater age edwards aquifer trends 1 introduction decades of study have led to comprehensive methods and techniques for characterizing groundwater quality understanding the timescales on which groundwater quality changes however and what drives these changes is less clear yet this knowledge informs groundwater management protection and resource sustainability this is especially true in karst aquifers where rapid recharge and groundwater flow rates can quickly affect water levels and spring discharge hess and white 1988 ford and williams 2007 karst aquifers are important sources of drinking water supplying about 25 of the global population ford and williams 2007 as well as habitat for a diversity of fauna humphreys 2011 because karst is characterized by rapid transport of recharge through voids and conduits rapid changes in water quality are well documented e g lakey and krothe 1996 winston and criss 2004 mahler and massei 2007 thus a karst setting is well suited to assess the magnitude timescales and controls on temporal changes in groundwater quality to better understand how groundwater quality changes over short daily to monthly and long seasonal to decadal timescales the u s geological survey s national water quality assessment nawqa project began a monitoring and sampling program in 2013 that combined high frequency monitoring and discrete sample collection in small well networks 1 3 wells across different hydrologic settings one of these enhanced trends networks etn is in the edwards balcones fault zone aquifer

endemic and threatened or endangered species texas state university 2018 studies of karst groundwater have long focused on springs as spring discharge provides an integrated response of the aquifer

et al 2017 page et al 2017 saraceno et al 2018 traditional sampling methods for groundwater quality are often time consuming which constrain data collection even relatively frequent sample collection

mcelhaney 1992 lindgren et al 2004 recharge is often dynamic and rapid intense storms with heavy rainfall are common generating runoff in ephemeral streams natural discharge occurs at large regional

age tracers were modeled using a modified version of the program tracerlpm jurgens et al 2012 jurgens 2016 tracerlpm calibrates measured tracer data with lpms and outputs a predicted final tracer concentration for each model based on the mean age distribution type and parameters and the atmospheric tracer inputs model parameters are calibrated to minimize the misfit between the measured and simulated tracer concentrations each tracer has associated uncertainties thus the use of multiple tracers where possible often improves constraints on groundwater age not all tracers were interpreted in lpms for all samples because of analytical limitations or suitability of tracer results and many of the final lpms were based solely on 3h table 3 utility of measured tracers was evaluated graphically for each site and sample based on cross plots of tracers relative to lpm model fits final model selection and resulting tracer based age interpretations were based on model fits and

among sites figs 2 and 3 resulting in 5 8 samples per year most samples were collected without regard to hydrologic conditions but typically not within several days of a runoff and recharge generating rainfall rainfall recharge event a small number of samples from the parkwood well were collected specifically to characterize the aquifer response to recharge events these samples were collected as conditions permitted and based on water level rises following rainfall recharge events results for a variety of constituents for these specific samples at the parkwood well e g no3 n reflect rapid changes in water quality in response to mixing with more dilute recent recharge fig 4 timeseries of specific conductance water level and spring discharge showed differences among sites fig 3 during the dry period water levels and other indicators of regional hydrologic conditions comal springs discharge and well j 17 water level were relatively low reflecting drought conditions figs 2 and 3 intermittent and generally rapid water level increases occurred following rainfall and aquifer recharge events at the two unconfined wells shavano and parkwood these rapid and short lived increases in water level were commonly accompanied by similarly rapid and short lived decreases in specific conductance in contrast specific conductance at the confined aquifer sites z ded psw1 psw2 and comal 1 showed little short term variability as hydrologic conditions transitioned from dry to wet in mid 2015 water levels at all wells increased and stayed relatively high for the remainder of the study physicochemical constituents were statistically evaluated for temporal trends and relations with changes in water level or spring discharge over the study period table s2 water level spring discharge increased at all sites but there were no generally consistent temporal trends in physicochemistry e g specific conductance increased both over the study period and relative to hydrologic conditions at most sites shavano psw1 z ded psw2 but decreased at others parkwood and comal 1 because hydrologic conditions over the study period transitioned from dry to wet temporal trends and relations with water level are generally consistent selected geochemical constituents were statistically evaluated for temporal trends and relation with changes in water levels and spring discharge comal 1 over the study period figs 4 6 table s2 numerous constituents showed increases or decreases at individual wells over the study period but these were not generally consistent from site to site these differences

ca fig 7 table 2 and sr ca values and dolomite saturation indices table 2 increased from upgradient to downgradient sites numerous geochemical constituents showed consistent changes from upgradient unconfined sites to downgradient confined sites table 2 many of these systematic changes in geochemistry reflect carbonate reactions groundwater samples were ca hco3 or ca mg hco3 type waters table 2 like many karst aquifers edwards aquifer groundwater is oxic and ph neutral the median dissolved oxygen concentration and ph value for all discrete samples were 5 7 mg l and 6 9 respectively samples from all sites were near saturation with respect to calcite median saturation index si ranges from 0 14 to 0 01 but undersaturated with respect to dolomite median si ranges from 0 95 to 0 23 table 2 whereas groundwater equilibrates rapidly with calcite dolomite reaction rates are slow white 1988 fourier spectral analysis results for timeseries for comal springs discharge and water levels for well

supplemental information table s1 4 2 age tracer results and interpretation reported mean ages represent a distribution of ages mixing of water of different ages has been shown to be important for karst aquifers because of the complex network of conduit fracture and matrix porosity plummer and busenberg 2005 long and putnam 2006 repeat collection of age tracers allowed for investigation of the variability of residence time and the relation between age estimates and changes in hydrologic conditions and water quality calibrating measured age tracers to lpms provides a practical and consistent approach to consider variations in tracer based age as a tool to better understand scales of water quality change age tracer interpretations and lpms are summarized in tables 3 and s3 and musgrove et al 2019 all analyzed samples has measurable 3h concentrations ranging from 0 71 to 1 61 tritium units tu table 3 3h values decreased downdip from shavano median of 1 40 tu to psw2 the deepest well median of 0 85 tu with intermediate values at the midgradient psw1 median of 1 03 tu the few values available for ancillary wells were similar ranging from 0 98 to 1 41 tu slightly lower values occurred at comal 1 0 98 1 09 tu 3h results indicate that edwards aquifer groundwater is dominated by modern water but that age generally increases with depth and distance along flow gradients 14c is infrequently useful for dating modern water because of numerous uncertainties 14c concentrations are often altered or diluted from the atmospheric signal by exchanges among carbon reservoirs such as organic carbon and carbonates in soils and aquifer materials han and plummer 2016 additionally with additions of bomb pulse carbon to the atmosphere atmospheric 14c values since 1950 have a large range that often significantly exceeds 100 pmc in modern groundwaters the long 14c half life allows for little decay in modern water radioactive decay over a period of 100 years would result in a 14c decrease of 1 pmc measured 14c values ranged from 54 66 to 88 22 pmc table s3 14c values from psw1 and psw2 had a relatively narrow range 2 pmc at each well the range was larger 6 pmc at the unconfined shavano well 14c values were lower than expected for modern groundwater indicating that geochemical dilution is an important process in this carbonate aquifer numerous approaches have been proposed to adjust groundwater 14c values to account for processes altering the 14c content along flow paths han and plummer 2016 for this study the 14c analytical correction model described by han and plummer 2013 was used adjusted 14c values exceeded 100 pmc table s3 indicative of modern water and likely overcorrection for most samples where values were 100 pmc these results are consistent with uncertainties for 14c for modern water and thus 14c results were not considered in most lpms for estimating tracer based ages 14c results were used in lpms at psw2 other age tracer concentrations sf6 3hetrit were used in lpms as available and suitable tables 3 s3 many sf6 concentrations were higher than that possible for air water equilibrium indicative of contamination by non atmospheric sources a dispersion model dm or 2 component mixture binary mixing model bmm of modern water and an older component where each component is described by a dm jurgens et al 2012 consistently provided the most realistic lpms mixing models were used at psw1 and psw2 at psw1 a bmm approach using multiple age tracers where available yielded more realistic results than models based only on 3h and only results for the 8 samples with multiple age tracers are discussed herein at psw1 and psw2 the age of the older bmm component was determined by iteration with lpms then accounting for the age and proportion of the young fraction tracer based mean groundwater ages generally increased from the upgradient unconfined sites to the downgradient confined sites fig 8 table 3 ages at shavano significantly decreased over the study period kendall tau 0 40 from a median of 23 years during the dry period to a median of 15 years during the wet period fig 8 table 3 dry period and wet period ages are statistically different based on comparison with the nonparametric mann whitney u test 5 discussion 5 1 water quality changes across the hydrologic gradient spatial variability in water quality across the aquifer provides insight into regional processes controlling aquifer geochemistry geochemical tracers of mineral solution reactions in carbonate groundwater systems include mg ca and sr ca ratios sr isotopes 87sr 86sr and dolomite saturation indices plummer 1977 oetting et al 1996 musgrove and banner 2004 musgrove et al 2010 wong et al 2011 with progressive geochemical evolution e g by processes of calcite recrystallization incongruent dolomite dissolution and prior precipitation of calcite along flow paths groundwater mg ca and sr ca ratios generally increase with increased residence time typically along flow paths median mg ca ratios increase downdip and downgradient with the highest values at psw2 fig 7 table 2 which is indicative of increased mineral solution reactions a corresponding decrease in 87sr 86sr values table 2 that approach those for the cretaceous age aquifer rocks koepnick et al 1985 is similarly indicative of increased water rock interaction associated with longer groundwater residence times musgrove and banner 2004 also consistent are mean ages which generally increased from the upgradient unconfined sites to the downgradient confined sites fig 8 tables 2 and 3 the deepest well psw2 is near the freshwater saline water interface fig 1 which represents the transition from a zone of more active flow of fresh groundwater to a downdip zone of less active flow of saline groundwater the geochemical composition of water at psw2 is different than other confined aquifer sites table 2 with a composition indicative of mixing with a small component of downdip saline water e g elevated cl so4 f li and sr concentrations as a result groundwater geochemistry at psw2 is not fully representative of the regional downgradient confined aquifer but rather the terminal freshwater system adjacent to the saline water interface the saline zone is characterized by numerous complex hydrochemical facies clement and sharp 1988 oetting et al 1996 which might locally influence the adjacent freshwater zone saline zone groundwater has been affected by halite and incongruent gypsum dissolution oetting et al 1996 which might contribute to higher cl and so4 concentrations respectively interaction with celestite srso4 or strontianite srco3 in saline zone aquifer rocks maclay and small 1983 likely contributes to elevated sr concentrations oetting et al 1996 musgrove et al 2010 elevated concentrations of f and li are also associated with saline zone groundwater lambert et al 2009 lpm mean groundwater ages for psw2 based on a mixture with a component of premodern water table s3 are older than other edwards sites fig 8 and consistent with mixing with a small saline zone component this has been previously proposed to account for dissolved he results for groundwater near the saline zone boundary hunt et al 2010 5 2 water quality changes across time and hydrologic conditions temporal variability in water levels and water quality across the aquifer was notably different in pattern between sites water levels and spring discharge responded rapidly hours to days to rainfall events that generated streamflow and corresponding aquifer recharge figs 2 and 3 water levels and spring discharge also varied in response to the multiyear change in hydrologic conditions from dry to wet with higher water levels and discharge during the wet period fig 3 the geochemical response was more notable in the upgradient unconfined sites than in the downgradient confined aquifer sites fig 3 table 2 which we address separately 5 2 1 upgradient unconfined aquifer sites water level changes at the unconfined sites shavano and parkwood showed a flashy response to recharge events particularly during the dry period with rapid increases immediately after rainfall and recharge quickly followed by a relatively rapid recession fig 3 water level increases were accompanied by decreases in specific conductance from dilution with recent recharge flow in karst is often considered relative to two endmember flow types 1 quick flow or conduit flow which is recharge that moves rapidly through the aquifer to discharge at wells or springs and 2 slow flow or diffuse flow which is water stored within the matrix atkinson 1977 martin and screaton 2001 most karst aquifers have some degree of both flow types although categorization along this continuum is useful for understanding the degree of aquifer karstification and corresponding insights into water availability and water quality atkinson 1977 florea and vacher 2006 the flashy response to recharge pulses and inverse relation between water level and specific conductance at the unconfined wells are indicative of their connection to a well developed conduit system as hydrologic conditions transitioned from the dry period to the wet period the response of the unconfined sites became less flashy figs 3 and 9 that is water level rises were smaller and whereas the initial response remained relatively rapid the subsequent recovery was slower with sustained water level increases this shift in aquifer response from the dry period to the wet period reflects a change in aquifer dynamics as regional water levels and correspondingly aquifer storage increased conduits can occur at different elevations within the aquifer and depending on water levels can be saturated or drained affecting overall aquifer transmissivity and storativity larocque et al 1998 when aquifer water levels are low such as during the dry period recharge pulses move rapidly through the drained conduit system with little dilution in contrast when aquifer water levels are high such as during the wet period conduits may be saturated and recharge water can advect into the aquifer matrix vaute et al 1997 under these relatively wet and high water level conditions the response of focused recharge at the unconfined wells is muted with dilution by water within the conduits and an increase in the amount of water going into storage which contributes to the sustained water level increases this conceptual understanding of karst aquifers has been previously described to account for differences in aquifer response under different hydrologic conditions mahler and massei 2007 wong et al 2012 although more like each other in their response to recharge events than to the confined aquifer sites there are differences in the response patterns at shavano and parkwood to changes in hydrologic conditions fig 3 for most rainfall recharge events particularly during the dry period the response at shavano was greater than at parkwood with larger magnitude changes in both specific conductance and water level these differences indicate that the hydrologic response for the unconfined part of the aquifer is not spatially uniform but is affected by variable factors such as recharge amount and sources proximity to recharge flow paths to the wells and the nature and degree of the conduit network that these wells intercept consideration of spatial differences in groundwater geochemistry might reflect differences in the nature and sources of recharge across the unconfined aquifer for example parkwood has notably higher specific conductance tds cl and no3 n concentrations table 2 fig 4 which might indicate a larger component of recharge affected by urbanization such as from septic sewage and wastewater systems wilhelm et al 1994 panno et al 2006 differences in host rock mineralogy and subsequent mineral solution reactions might also contribute to localized differences in groundwater quality many geochemical constituents at parkwood are more variable than at shavano fig 4 specifically because of samples collected at parkwood in response to rainfall recharge events these samples are characterized by lower concentrations of major ions and no3 n which reflect the composition of recent dilute recharge relative to background groundwater geochemistry in contrast samples from shavano were not collected directly in response to rainfall recharge events and geochemical changes reflect background or diffuse flow water quality the shift to younger groundwater ages at shavano during the wet period fig 8 reflects an increased component of recent recharge whereas differences in recharge sources likely contribute to differences in the groundwater geochemistry at shavano and parkwood similar tracer based ages and shifts to younger ages from dry to wet conditions are consistent with influxes of recent recharge via conduits to the aquifer 5 2 2 downgradient confined aquifer sites at the downgradient confined aquifer sites water level spring discharge responses were more muted for individual rainfall and recharge events than at the upgradient unconfined sites fig 3 the hydrologic response was regionally consistent indicating that these changes likely reflect more regional hydrologic conditions that is changes in water levels measured at z ded and well j 17 and discharge at comal springs were strongly and positively correlated kendall tau correlations for each pair over the 4 year study period are 0 85 the geochemical response of the aquifer to changing patterns of recharge however was decoupled from the hydraulic response at the downgradient confined aquifer sites geochemical constituents did not vary in response to individual recharge events and showed little variability from the dry period to the wet period relative to the upgradient unconfined sites figs 3 6 table 2 there were small changes in some geochemical constituents at some sites over the study period but these were generally not consistent for example decreases in major ions i e na cl so4 at comal 1 are not observed at the other downgradient confined sites and in fact these constituents increased slightly at z ded figs 4 6 several processes might account for the overall lack of geochemical response at the downgradient confined aquifer sites if geochemical variability within the aquifer at the timescale of recharge events is limited to the conduit network wells that are not connected to conduits would be dominated by diffuse flow paths and thus have more homogeneous geochemistry a regionally extensive system of conduits is likely present in the confined aquifer hovorka et al 2004 lindgren et al 2004 worthington 2004 whereas some wells in the downgradient confined aquifer are likely connected to conduit flow paths those included in this study show no evidence of conduit flow this is not necessarily surprising as conduits typically occupy a small proportion of an aquifer and any well would have a small probability of intercepting a conduit worthington 1999 specific flow paths to individual wells are likely highly variable not all unconfined wells might be responsive to rainfall recharge events if their contributing flow paths are dominated by diffuse flow correspondingly if connected to conduit flow paths confined aquifer wells would likely demonstrate temporal geochemical variability and perhaps younger tracer based ages than measured in this study e g musgrove et al 2011 it is also possible that the amount of recharge entering the aquifer and specifically the matrix was small relative to the total amount of water in storage and thus not likely to influence groundwater geochemistry at wells unless connected to the conduit network the total available storage in the aquifer ranges from 27 to 68 billion m3 22 to 55 million acre feet maclay and land 1988 texas water development board 2016 mean annual aquifer recharge of 855 million m3 693 000 acre feet 1934 2014 edwards aquifer authority 2015 would comprise at most almost 3 of the aquifer s available storage in dry years when recharge is low e g estimated recharge for 2014 was 132 million m3 107 000 acre feet edwards aquifer authority 2015 this recharge would be less likely to affect geochemistry in the confined aquifer although total aquifer storage is also less during dry conditions maclay and land 1988 alternatively flow paths to the downgradient confined aquifer sites may be sufficiently long that water quality is well mixed and homogenized regardless of the conduit diffuse or mixed nature of the dominant flow paths tracer based ages for the downgradient confined aquifer sites were on the order of decades or older at psw2 due to mixing with a premodern saline zone component fig 8 which is consistent with this hypothesis nonetheless mean groundwater ages estimated at psw1 decreased slightly from the dry period median 55 years to the wet period median 40 years fig 8 consistent with younger water moving downgradient and mixing with groundwater in storage lpm results for psw1 were based on a mixture for which the proportion of the young fraction increased from the dry period to the wet period fig 8 5 3 summary and implications timescales of change and aquifer vulnerability the etn study design a combination of continuous monitoring and discrete sampling provides new insights into timescales of water quality variability karst aquifer dynamics and aquifer vulnerability aquifer vulnerability is of concern for karst which is susceptible to contamination because of features such as thin soils focused recharge and rapid flow paths white 1988 a comparison of the edwards and floridan aquifers concluded that vulnerability to contamination in both aquifers is strongly influenced by rapid flow paths and the dominance of modern water musgrove et al 2014 estimates of mean age are not representative of the first arrival of any contaminant introduced with recharge and transported rapidly through conduits results of dye tracer tests in the edwards aquifer provide an endmember of the most rapid travel times based on straight line distances and first appearance indicating a wide but generally rapid range of flow velocities from 13 to 5300 m per day johnson et al 2010 in the upgradient unconfined part of the aquifer rapid changes in specific conductance in response to recharge events are consistent with rapid flow velocities fig 3 whereas longer residence times and increased dilution and mixing attenuates geochemical variability at downgradient confined sites the public supply from these wells remains vulnerable to degradation of the quality of recharge water on what timescales might we expect water quality changes in the confined and deeper parts of the edwards aquifer from which public supply wells primarily draw results of this study indicate that much of the downgradient confined part of the aquifer is buffered from short term variations in water quality but remains vulnerable to water quality changes in recharging surface water such as from nutrients and pesticides over decadal timescales as contaminants are incorporated into matrix storage and move through the aquifer this vulnerability is evident for example at comal springs where the concentration of no3 n has doubled over recent decades likely in response to increased loading in aquifer recharge musgrove et al 2016 central texas climate precipitation and drought have been linked with global circulation features ropelewski and halpert 1996 hu and feng 2001 and paleoclimate archives document variations in climatic and hydrologic conditions over millennial timescales e g cleveland et al 2011 feng et al 2014 wong et al 2015 fourier spectral analysis of available modern hydrologic records comal springs discharge and well j 17 water levels indicates that the aquifer responds to multidecadal climatic signals at dominate periods of 30 and 15 years table s1 although the determination of the drivers of these specific periods is beyond the scope of this study these results provide insight into the timescales on which we might expect hydrologic variability and potential changes in water quality in the deep confined aquifer the relatively small and inconsistent changes in water quality at the confined aquifer sites during this 4 year study might be in response to such decadal scale drivers but provide an incomplete picture differences in trends in water quality constituents between sites might result from being out of phase in response to these drivers based on different age distributions the deep confined aquifer is buffered from changes in water quality in response to individual recharge events or even multi year dry wet cycles such long lag times of response to changing land uses such as urbanization or best management practices might have both positive and negative effects on groundwater quality changes effects of increasing urbanization over the edwards aquifer are a topic of considerable interest with recent studies demonstrating effects to groundwater quality caused by urbanization mahler and massei 2007 musgrove et al 2016 opsahl et al 2018 one implication of long lag times for the confined part of the aquifer is that any management actions to address water quality will also affect water quality at long lag times e g böhlke 2002 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
