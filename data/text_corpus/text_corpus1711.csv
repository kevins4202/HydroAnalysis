8555,the majority of india s rural drinking water supply is sourced from groundwater which also plays a critical role in irrigated agriculture supporting the livelihoods of millions of users however recent high abstractions are threatening the sustainable use of groundwater and action is needed to ensure continued supply increased managed aquifer recharge mar using the 200 000 existing tanks artificially created surface water bodies is one of the indian government s key initiatives to combat declining groundwater levels however few studies have directly examined the effectiveness of tank recharge particularly in the complex fractured hydrogeology of peninsular india to address this gap this study examined the impact of tanks in three crystalline bedrock catchments in karnataka southern india by analysing the isotopic and hydrochemical composition of surface waters and groundwaters combined with groundwater level observations the results indicate that tanks have limited impact on regional groundwater recharge and quality in rural areas where recharge from precipitation and groundwater recycling from irrigation dominate the recharge signal in the urban setting bengaluru impermeable surfaces increased the relative effect of recharge from point sources such as tanks and rivers but where present pipe leakage from public water supply accounted for the majority of recharge shallow groundwater levels in the inner parts of the city may lead to groundwater discharge to tanks particularly in the dry season we conclude that the importance of aquifer recharge from tanks is limited compared to other recharge sources and highly dependent on the specific setting additional studies to quantify tank recharge and revisions to the current guidelines for national groundwater recharge estimations using a less generalised approach are recommended to avoid over estimating the role tanks play in groundwater recharge keywords india groundwater recharge fractured rock hydrochemistry stable isotopes tanks 1 introduction it is estimated that nearly 700 million indians living in villages 50 of india s population depend on groundwater for basic needs kulkarni et al 2015 groundwater is also the primary water source for over 50 of india s irrigated agricultural land goi 2015 as such it is a vital resource both for public health and economic growth kulkarni et al 2015 pahuja et al 2010 shah et al 2003 the indian government reports that on a national scale groundwater abstraction of which 90 is used for irrigation was 249 billion cubic metres bcm for the year 2017 approximately two thirds of the estimated annual net extractable groundwater of 393 bcm cgwb 2019a the scale of groundwater abstraction differs across the country and since the 1980s groundwater levels have declined in several regions as a result of increased abstraction due to enhanced and more affordable pump technology nearly a third of the groundwater assessment units in peninsular india are therefore in semi critical 14 critical 5 or over exploited 17 status cgwb 2019a with strongest declines observed in the sedimentary basins in the northwestern states ambast et al 2006 cgwb 2019a macdonald et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 and in parts of southern india s crystalline basement aquifers e g in the states of karnataka and tamil nadu which cover about 60 of the country cgwb 2019a sharma et al 2018 the importance of enhanced groundwater management in india has clearly been recognized by the government of india acknowledging in the third national water policy document goi 2012b that water governance needs to be improved to alleviate a critical situation in many parts of the country one of the key suggestions is to enhance water availability by using tanks the local term for typically small surface water storage structures such as farm ponds but also larger lakes for water harvesting and managed aquifer recharge mar cgwb 2007 cgwb 2013 the use of tanks is a long standing tradition especially in southern india since ancient and medieval times dixit et al 1993 and they are said to provide flood protection water storage ecosystem services as well as recreational and aesthetic value and potential recharge to local groundwater d souza and nagendra 2011 dixit et al 1993 empri 2018 esha 2008 nagendra and ostrom 2014 patil 2011 though it is difficult to know the precise number of functional tanks in india pant and verma 2010 it is estimated that there are between 200 000 palanisami et al 2010 sharma 2003 and 500 000 reddy 2015 recent tank restoration and promotion efforts with a goal to enhance groundwater availability by means of mar have been undertaken by the national and local governments e g tamil nadu and karnataka often supported by local ngos and also received substantial support by international institutions such as the european union eu the national bank for agricultural and rural development nabard the world bank and the international water management institute iwmi richard ferroudji et al 2018 however there are few studies that directly evaluate recharge from tanks or investigate tank groundwater connectivity in india s basement setting and therefore little is known about the effectiveness and potential groundwater quality implications of tank restoration and promotion in the suggested methodology for groundwater recharge estimations used for national groundwater resource assessment and planning the indian government s groundwater resource estimation committee gec acknowledges the limited availability of field studies as a temporary measure they suggest a recharge estimation method using a fixed recharge rate of 1 4 mm day tank area as approximation gec 1997 this approach was carried forward into the most recent gec guideline gec 2017 and the latest national groundwater review cgwb 2019b however while recharge from tanks in the north indian alluvial plains is relatively high and homogeneous bhanja et al 2019 recharge to the lower permeability crystalline aquifers dominant in southern peninsular india is more complicated and likely much more spatially variable crystalline basement aquifers are formed by a combination of weathering and tectonic forces and can be best conceptualized as zones of varying degree of weathering i e a weathered upper zone termed saprolite which overlies a less weathered but fractured rock layer followed by fresher basement rock collins et al 2020 singhal and gupta 2010 in the southern indian context the thickness of the weathered zone is typically a few to several tens of meters with fracture zones extending to depths of 200 to 300 m cgwb 2012 below the relatively permeable weathered zone recharge to the crystalline basement depends on the size aperture and distribution connectivity of fractures lateral connectivity varies spatially with depth and depends on the vertical extent of the weathered zone and layout of the fracture network at depth banks et al 2009 guih√©neuf et al 2014 ofterdinger et al 2019 the connectivity may also depend on the type of fissure network for example on whether the bedrock is fractured or sheared few studies report the local impact of tanks in these crystalline basement settings in india investigating recharge from mostly small tanks with 0 4 km2 zone of influence command area in andhra pradesh reddy and behera 2009 found farmers reported shallower groundwater levels and fewer dry wells in areas with restored tanks than in areas without tanks a study using macro level data from west bengal to model the linkage between groundwater levels and tanks found an inverse relationship between tank density and depth to groundwater chowdhury and behera 2018 however in both of these studies it is not clear if the difference in groundwater level can be attributed to recharge by tanks or is influenced by other factors such as decreased groundwater abstractions in areas with higher surface water availability i e tanks other studies mainly using water balance approaches have quantified average daily percolations rates of 5 5 18 4 mm day boisson et al 2014 perrin et al 2012 singh et al 2004 and percolation efficiencies defined as the percolated fraction of tank water depletion over a given time period of 35 68 boisson et al 2014 massuel et al 2014 metha and jain 1997 perrin et al 2012 singh et al 2004 sukhija et al 1997 however little is known about how much of the infiltrated water actually recharges groundwater as not all water lost through the base of a tank can be expected to reach the groundwater table but some may be stored in the vadose zone or taken up by evapotranspiration de vries and simmers 2002 this is in particular discussed in a study by boisson et al 2014 which proposed a combined surface water and groundwater balance method in order to better consider flow within the unsaturated zone and found that only 53 88 of the potential recharge from the tank percolate reach the groundwater table in summary while some studies have assessed groundwater recharge from tanks in the indian crystalline basement using a variety of approaches most have focussed on quantifying the percolation rates of the tanks there remains significant uncertainty on how much of this infiltrated water is recharging to deeper groundwater and how much of the water is lost in the unsaturated zone therefore more site specific studies are necessary to understand the effects of tanks on groundwater recharge in the crystalline basement in this study a suite of direct measurements i e water isotopic ratios hydrochemistry and water level observations were used to investigate the degree of groundwater recharge and its impact on water quality from tank structures in three study areas in karnataka state the areas reflect agricultural land use and different geological settings fractured versus sheared crystalline basement because tanks are traditionally part of both the urban and rural landscape in southern india we also considered the city of bengaluru well known for its numerous interconnected tanks in this study specific aims were to 1 assess the connectivity of the deeper fractured basement aquifer to modern recharge processes from tanks and other sources 2 assess the significance of tank recharge compared to other recharge sources and 3 identify the contamination risk posed by tanks and other recharge sources to groundwater 2 methods 2 1 study locations this study focuses on three areas in south and southeastern karnataka there are seven perennial river basins in karnataka but due to the high inter annual variability of monsoon rainfalls and river flow and high vulnerability of local surface water sources to contamination groundwater is used as primary drinking water source in most of the state s rural area empri 2018 groundwater resources in karnataka are also heavily used for industrial and domestic water supply in major cities such as bengaluru population about 8 million and mysore population about 0 9 million and for agricultural production across the state recent 2017 estimates of groundwater withdrawals are 70 of total extractable groundwater compared to 63 on the national scale and about 26 of karnataka s taluks administrative divisions are classified as over exploited with respect to groundwater use which is 9 higher than on the national scale cgwb 2019b the selected sites for this study are the city of bengaluru two sub catchments aralamallige and hadonahalli in the rural area of the thippagondanahalli tg halli catchment about 30 km north of bengaluru and the rural berambadi catchment in the southern part of karnataka fig 1 all study areas are located in the cauvery river basin with exception of the north eastern part of bengaluru which falls into the south pennar basin table 1 lists key characteristics such as size tank density and climatology of the study areas mean annual precipitation in the areas ranges 800 900 mm year but with high annual variations fig 1e and its pattern is composed of two distinct monsoon periods namely the dominant southwest summer monsoon june september that typically produces most of the annual precipitation 85 and the northeast winter monsoon from october to december rahul et al 2016 mean temperatures are around 23 c and potential evapotranspiration usually exceeds the annual rainfall with mean values of approximately 1100 1650 mm year across the study areas sekhar et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2015 numerous long established water tanks are characteristic of all three study areas see table 1 with region specific distribution in size and set up tanks can be divided into the following broad categories river fed tanks constructed by using dams locally termed anicuts to check water along a hydraulic gradient or rain fed tanks constructed by digging a square cavity of shallow few metres depth into the ground empri 2018 tank embankments can be site specific but typically river fed tanks have little embankment aside from the check dam while smaller rain fed tanks are usually without raised embankments bengaluru has mostly cascading large 1 2 ha medium 0 4 1 2 ha and small size 0 4 ha tanks with seasonal to perennial water storage the city is naturally divided into three main river valleys and most of the city s tanks have been established by the use of anicuts to intercept rainwater and dam existing streams along topographic gradients often with drains connecting a series of cascading tanks to each other d souza and nagendra 2011 nowadays the main tank inflows are from rainfall and urban runoff including waste waters rao et al 2020 the depth of water bodies in bengaluru ranges from 0 5 m to a maximum of 9 m sankay tank the tg halli catchment is dominated by two large reservoirs namely tg halli reservoir itself in the most southern part of the catchment and hesaraghatta tank which is located about 30 km upstream from tg halli along the arkavathy river a tributary to the cauvery river in addition there are an estimate of about 600 smaller often cascading in stream tanks of which most have been constructed by checking monsoon runoff srinivasan et al 2015 in the berambadi catchment most of its 53 tanks other than the berambadi tank are ephemeral and only fill up for short periods after strong monsoon rains collins et al 2020 sharma et al 2018 there is no detailed bathymetry available for small tanks in tg halli and berambadi but the depth of these smaller ponds observed in similar studies ranges around 4 m boisson et al 2014 massuel et al 2014 sharda et al 2006 2 1 1 hydrogeology previous hydrogeological studies have been undertaken in all three areas sekhar et al 2018 investigated groundwater level dynamics in bengaluru for the period 2015 2017 at tg halli catchment ballukraya and srinivasan 2019 investigated variations in groundwater levels in the two sub catchments aralamallige and hadonahalli about 7 km and 20 km north of hesaraghatta tank respectively which corresponds to the areas used in this study the berambadi catchment is the site of the kabini critical zone observatory sekhar et al 2016 the three study areas are dominated by weathered and fractured bedrock aquifers of the banded gneiss complex with local variations in rock composition bengaluru is mainly underlain by precambrian migmatites granodiorites tonalites and gneiss with local granitic intrusions especially in the central part of the city near lalbagh lake the weathered horizon is about 15 m in thickness and overlain with red loamy to gravelly superficial deposits of varying thickness hedge and chandra 2012 a particularly thick saprolite formation of about 60 m can be found in the eastern parts of bengaluru hedge and subhash chandra 2014 groundwater levels in bengaluru are observed from extremely shallow depths of only 1 m below ground level bgl to about 70 m bgl sekhar et al 2018 the nearby tg halli catchment likewise consists of weathered to a depth of about 20 m bgl fissured and fractured granite and gneiss srinivasan et al 2015 boreholes are often deep 200 300 m but may recharge from water bearing joints at shallow depths as well as from deeper fractures thus creating a complicated flow system with many of the water bearing fractures at shallow depths an extensive study in tg halli from borehole scans and groundwater levels of 83 boreholes revealed that groundwater levels vary considerably between 28 and 222 m bgl often with large differences between adjacent proximities of 100 m boreholes ballukraya and srinivasan 2019 the berambadi catchment 200 km southwest of bengaluru is dominated by massive to extensively sheared gneiss overlain by about 1 to 5 m of regolith collins et al 2020 which is a thinner weathered zone than in the other catchments groundwater levels in berambadi have been monitored since 2010 and the observed depths to groundwater range from 10 to 70 m sekhar et al 2016 2 1 2 water and land use water demand in bengaluru has risen in recent decades and cannot be met using local water resources to overcome acute water shortages additional water is drawn from the cauvery river and imported to the city via a large pipeline river cauvery water is now the city s main drinking water source particularly in the centre of bengaluru where the density of the piped mains network is the greatest additionally numerous boreholes have been drilled after the onset of more advanced and affordable pump technology in the 1980s to increase access to groundwater across bengaluru in the outskirts of the city these are often used for drinking water as well as for small scale agricultural activities in the more rural study area of tg halli groundwater abstraction has similarly increased in recent decades and is likely one of the causes of strong decline in surface water flows srinivasan et al 2015 in the berambadi catchment groundwater is the primary source of water for most water uses increasing groundwater abstraction for agricultural production has led to water table declines of up to 50 m sharma et al 2018 however the recent strong monsoon of 2018 has resulted in significant recoveries in groundwater levels across the catchment collins et al 2020 agricultural activities in the rural catchments are intensive with 2 3 cropping seasons a year namely in summer january to may always irrigated kharif may to september frequently irrigated and rabi september to january only irrigated if rainfalls are insufficient sekhar et al 2016 the irrigation pattern means that the highest groundwater abstraction for the summer irrigation coincides with the period of deepest groundwater levels 2 2 sampling and analysis repeat samples total n 112 were collected from surface water piped mains water river water and tank water and boreholes from shallow a few metres to about 300 m depth table 2 during two sampling periods reflecting post monsoonal october 2017 and pre monsoonal march may 2018 conditions groundwater samples were collected from boreholes and in two locations from open wells and surface water where possible from nearby tanks and in few cases from rivers vrishabhavathi river in bengaluru or canals additionally 14 one off samples groundwater and surface water were taken at different locations numbers indicated in parentheses in table 2 the surface water samples were obtained as grab samples using a sampling beaker attached to a rod at about 10 20 cm depth below the water surface and about 2 3 m off the river tank edge samplers were faced upstream where applicable and there was no disturbance to the bottom sediment immediately prior or during sampling care was taken to avoid tank locations that appeared stagnant based on visual evaluation and sampling was undertaken near outflows where possible no detailed information is however available on the potential degree of stratification within the surface water bodies the samples for inorganic chemistry were filtered 0 45 Œºm cellulose membrane into two 30 ml nalgene bottles without airspace and un acidified but prior to analysis cation samples were acidified and preserved with aristar grade concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acid 0 5 v v water chemistry samples were stored at 4 c except during transportation to the uk 24 h at ambient room temperature bulk rainwater samples n 51 were collected for isotope analysis Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in two of the study areas tg halli and berambadi for the one year period september 2017 to september 2018 using a specifically designed totalizer that minimizes evaporation effects based on iaea gnip 2014 sampling intervals of the rainwater varied slightly depending on rainfall events but were approximately every two weeks because of the close proximity about 30 km and similar altitude and climatology of tg halli to bengaluru rainfall samples from tg halli are considered as representative for the bengaluru region as a whole in this study unfortunately one sample for the period 11 11 2017 to 29 12 2017 constituting about 10 of the annual rainfall from berambadi was lost in transport before analysis in each sampling round dissolved oxygen do redox potential eh temperature ph and specific electrical conductivity sec were measured in the field where possible in a flow cell with bicarbonate alkalinity hco3 concurrently determined by micro titration all surface waters and groundwaters were analysed for inorganic major minor trace elements using icp ms agilent 8900 and ion chromatography dionex ics5000 and for stable isotopes Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer vg optima at the centre for environmental geochemistry ceg uk the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o ratios were reported in reference to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow with measurement precision within 0 05 for Œ¥18o and 1 for Œ¥2h deuterium excess d excess was calculated using d excess Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥18o according to dansgaard 1964 results were visualised using r version 3 6 1 the r foundation and the ggplot2 package spatial plots were undertaken using arcgis in addition to the hydrochemical investigation pressure transducers were installed at six locations in bengaluru and in one location in berambadi to record water level variations at high frequency 15 minute intervals additional manual water level measurements dip meter were taken manually at approximately monthly intervals for five of the sampling boreholes in berambadi and five boreholes in the southern sub catchment of tg halli see fig 1 b for detailed locations of all monitored sites and supplementary material table s1 for additional information on borehole elevations and depths more comprehensive water level observations for the same period from the kabini observatory berambadi are available in collins et al 2020 3 results 3 1 stable isotopes results of the stable isotope analysis including one off samples are presented in fig 2 for rainfall samples panel a and groundwaters and surface water by sampling round panel b c along with the amount weighted mean rainfall composition for tg halli also used for bengaluru given the proximity of 30 km and berambadi tabularized data such as mean values and standard deviations for Œ¥18o Œ¥2h and d excess of surface waters and groundwaters by study area and sampling round are provided in table s2 in the supplementary material the Œ¥18o ratio of the rainfall samples n 51 ranged between 9 3 and 1 6 median 5 3 and that of Œ¥2h between 65 9 and 22 3 median 28 5 the amount weighted average for the tg halli rainfall samples was 5 2 for Œ¥18o and 30 3 for Œ¥2h and the incomplete i e missing data from one sample amount weighted average in berambadi was 3 7 for Œ¥18o and 20 0 for Œ¥2h the overall distribution of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h for the rainfall samples is similar to the local meteoric water line Œ¥2h 11 74 Œ¥2h 7 82 established by kumar et al 2010 in an earlier study in karnataka and the global meteoric waterline gmwl with Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥2h 10 fig 2 note that the local and global meteoric waterlines are nearly identical surface water samples in bengaluru from piped mains vrishabhavathi river and tanks have similar isotopic compositions to each other in the post monsoon season reflecting wet conditions but there is a slightly higher evaporative signal in the tanks compared to the piped mains and river water in the drier pre monsoon sampling this is indicated for example visually by the slightly more positive Œ¥18o fig 2c of the bengaluru tank samples and the lower pre monsoon median d excess of the bengaluru tanks 8 3 compared to the piped and river water 0 7 and 2 9 respectively see table s2 and figure s1 in the supplementary material surface waters in the rural catchments have slightly isotopically lighter composition than groundwaters in the post monsoon fig 2b and a stronger but not significant wilcoxon rank sum test pre monsoonal enrichment in heavier isotopes median d excess of 28 7 and 23 9 for tg halli and berambadi respectively compared to only 8 3 in bengaluru figure s1 table s1 groundwater isotopic compositions show a marked difference in spread between the urban and the rural catchments with a larger variation between sample locations in bengaluru compared to a very homogenous compositions in the rural catchments tg halli and berambadi fig 2 plotting close to the amount average weighted rainfall this is reflected for example by the higher three fold standard deviation for Œ¥18o in bengaluru of 0 9 compared to 0 3 for tg halli and berambadi table s1 supplementary material the observed variations in bengaluru seemed to be slightly greater in shallower boreholes but there is no significant correlation between isotopic composition and borehole depth at either study area fig 3 r 0 27 for Œ¥18o versus borehole depth closer examination of groundwater samples from bengaluru seems to suggest that samples fall into two separate groups with distinct behaviour namely an inner city group sampling sites near lalbagh iisc and sankay tank figure 4 right column which consists of groundwater samples that are more isotopically enriched i e more evaporated and have similar isotopic ratios to piped and tank waters and a second group of groundwater samples from the outskirt areas allalasandra tank vrishabhavathi and kaikondrahalli tank figure 4 left column refer to fig 1 for detailed locations samples from the outskirts are significantly wilcoxon rank sum test 0 05 for d excess and Œ¥18o less isotopically enriched as indicated for example by the lower mean Œ¥18o of tank groundwaters from the outskirts 2 9 post monsoon 2017 and 3 0 pre monsoon 2018 compared to the inner city samples 1 7 and 1 4 fig 4 3 2 hydrochemistry 3 2 1 water types and major ion chemistry a piper plot fig 5 of all analysed samples by study area and source type demonstrates that the rural catchments are almost entirely dominated by alkaline earth elements ca mg while some samples in the urban setting bengaluru are dominated by na the dominant water type in bengaluru is ca na hco3 with exception of piped water ca mg hco3 type and eight samples with cl as dominant anion most of these near kaikondrahalli tank the rural catchments tg halli and berambadi exhibit a more diverse range of water types with higher proportions of mg both in tank water and in groundwaters contrary to bengaluru cl dominance in the rural catchments only occurred in two pre monsoonal tank samples in tg halli and in none of the samples in berambadi for more detailed information on water types by study area water source and sampling round see supplementary material table s3 3 2 2 surface water major ion chemistry and field parameters piped water in bengaluru has median concentrations of ca hco3 and so4 similar to the city s tank water but is generally lower in concentrations of k na and cl fig 6 with tabular data given in supplementary material table s4 mg concentrations in piped water medians around 19 mg l are about twice as high as in the city s tank water most noteworthy no3 was detected in the post monsoonal piped water in concentrations of up to 19 7 mg l while little no3 was observed in bengaluru s tank water in either sampling round all concentrations 1 mg l no3 river water samples from vrishabhavathi river showed generally higher concentrations of all major ions and sec of around 1400 ¬µs cm fig 6 tank waters are relatively similar in composition for the three studied catchments though the bengaluru tanks have slightly higher ion concentrations with regards to ca mg hco3 and most noteworthy higher na and cl fig 6 the higher cl concentrations in bengaluru exceed those of the rural catchments roughly by 30 mg l and with higher concentrations at kaikondrahalli tank 90 mg l in both sampling rounds pre monsoonal cl medians are higher than post monsoonal ones in all study regions in bengaluru this is mainly caused by strong increases in cl concentrations in the two tanks in the outskirts increase by 101 and 73 at kaikondrahalli and allalasandra tank the inner city tanks sankay and lalbagh surrounded by a more densely piped mains network fig 1b only show increases in cl by 19 and 39 respectively sec and ph in tank waters are higher in the pre monsoon with generally larger increases in the rural catchments than in bengaluru fig 6 3 2 3 groundwater major ion chemistry and field parameters groundwaters in all three study areas have a relatively constant major ion composition over time changes by 25 except for distinct decreases in no3 by 27 41 in all study areas and mg by 27 in tg halli in the pre monsoon season ca mg and no3 concentrations in the rural catchments are significantly higher than in bengaluru while the reverse holds true for ph wilcoxon rank sum test 0 5 mg no3 hco3 and sec all follow a distribution of berambadi tg halli bengaluru median k concentrations in groundwaters are without significant differences across study areas and in time and range 5 5 to 6 8 mg l median cl concentrations followed the order tg halli bengaluru berambadi highest lowest median of 168 4 and 67 9 mg l and were slightly lower in the pre monsoon sampling decrease by 1 12 cl concentrations 100 mg l were measured in bengaluru groundwater near kaikondrahalli lalbagh and vrishabhavathi river highest measured concentration 560 9 mg l near kaikondrahalli and in tg halli in almost all samples from the aralamallige southern sub catchment maximum concentration 475 1 mg l but none of the samples from the second sub catchment hadonahalli maximum concentration 61 3 mg l in berambadi a slight trend of increasing cl concentrations from west mostly 100 mg l to east most concentrations 100 mg l was observed high concentrations of no3 exceeding the indian drinking water limit dwl of the bureau of indian standards bis of 45 mg l no3 bis 2012 were primarily detected in berambadi 85 of all samples maximum 446 3 mg l no3 and tg halli 33 maximum 162 5 mg l no3 and only at one site in bengaluru 54 8 mg l near lalbagh tank post monsoon it is noteworthy that except for a weak significant correlation for tg halli no3 did not show significant trends with the drilled depth of the sampled boreholes fig 3 for a full list of percent of samples exceeding dwls by study area see supplementary material table s3 3 2 4 chemical ratios trends with distance to surface water and estimated impact of tanks the covariant plot of na versus cl fig 7 a demonstrates that na cl ratios in bengaluru with the exception of the cl rich samples from near kaikondrahalli closely follow the 1 1 ratio for halite sources or anthropogenic nacl inputs while there is excess cl or a depletion in na observed in tg halli and berambadi especially in the post monsoon season in the covariant plot of ca versus mg fig 7b most groundwater samples in all study areas fall between the 2 1 line and 1 1 line though there is generally a stronger ion concentration and higher proportion of mg in the rural catchments compared to bengaluru this could be indicative either of local differences in geological setting or be an impact of agricultural inputs e g application of cano3 type fertilizer indicated by a weak to strong correlation between ca and no3 in rural groundwaters r 0 53 and r 0 74 for tg halli and berambadi respectively with p 0 0005 fig 7c shows the gibbs plot for tds versus na na ca weight ratio which can give information about the dominant evolution processes of waters gibbs 1970 the results indicate that neither study area exhibits strong evaporation nor precipitation dominance and there is a stronger clustering of waters from all source types in bengaluru while in the rural catchments most tank waters are separated out from the groundwater samples fig 8a shows the cl br mass ratio versus cl mg l for each study area by source type ratios between cl and br in waters from different sources usually have a typical range and due to these distinct ratios the cl br ratio can give information on mixing processes alcal√° and custodio 2008 and be used to identify recharge to groundwater whilst cl is usually detected at concentrations well above the detection limit it should be noted though that low br concentrations close to detection limits may cause some uncertainty in cl br ratios in our study 4 of the tank water samples had br concentration 1 5 times the detection limit 2 in tg halli and 2 in berambadi concentrations of around 0 015 mg l we have no repeat analysis of these samples but a presumed uncertainty of 10 would shift the br cl mass ratio at the same percentage so interpretation of these data will focus on the combination of br cl mass ratio and cl concentration without too much emphasis on the br cl mass ratios alone the cl br plots show a distinct pattern for each study area in bengaluru groundwaters have a median cl br mass ratio of 552 indicated by the dashed line fig 8a surface water cl br ratios mostly lay within 442 2222 one location allalasandra tank has a markedly low ratio of 66 post monsoon and 104 pre monsoon this is caused by unusually high br concentrations of up to 1 mg l versus the overall median of 0 1 mg l other tank waters in the inner city of bengaluru plot similarly to most of the piped water fig 8a as indicated in the previous chapter piped water and inner city tanks in bengaluru generally have lower cl than river water samples and samples from kaikondrahalli tank which also creates a distinction in the cl br plot the groundwater samples mostly cluster according to their specific location and no clear trend can be observed in tg halli groundwater has a relatively uniform cl br ratio with a median of 239 fig 8a but with a large range in cl concentrations from 14 475 mg l tank waters seem similar in cl br ratio but with some spread in cl concentrations 3 89 mg l the shift in groundwater composition is dominated by a shift along the x axis which may indicate mixing with either lower or higher cl water but with similar cl br ratio this could indicate a dilution of cl rich groundwater by the lower cl tank waters however a correlation analysis person correlation between the proximity of the borehole location to tanks does not show significantly lower cl concentration near tanks fig 8b berambadi groundwater samples show a very pronounced pattern indicative of a mixing line that could be produced by waters with constant br concentration but higher lower cl potentially this is an indication of recharge by return flow from groundwater irrigation as one may suspect similar br but increased cl due to evaporation processes mixing of this type will result in a right shift due to the increased cl and upward shift due to the change in cl br ratio some of the higher cl concentrated tank waters seen on fig 8a could be a potential endmember in this case of lower chloride concentration than the groundwaters thus diluting their cl concentration however the lack of correlation between a borehole s cl concentration and its borehole proximity to tanks does not seem indicative of this r 0 15 p 0 45 fig 8b so that the mixing of the groundwater with higher cl concentrations seem more likely aside from cl water isotopes are usually considered a conservative tracer as they are commonly detected in groundwater with the same isotopic composition as the recharging water e g rainfall recharge e g darling and bath 1988 table 3 shows the mean d excess for amount weighted rainfall tank water and groundwater mean over both sampling periods in the three study catchments it should be noted that the berambadi rainfall is missing the analysis of one sample and that a longer term several years amount weighted rainfall would be considered more reliable hence we are only using tg halli here as example for a 2 endmember mixing because there is no significant correlation between d excess and distance of the boreholes to the nearest tank supplementary material figure s2 this is in good correspondence with the lack of significant trends in fig 8b the mean of all groundwater samples is considered assuming the fraction of tank water times tank water d excess plus the fraction of amount weighted rainfall times rainfall d excess to be equal to the groundwater composition this would result in a fraction of 2 6 tg halli for tank recharge which is very low and indicates that the effective recharge of deeper groundwater within the fractured bedrock seems to be negligible compared to other recharge sources a more specifically designed monitoring network with site specific installation of deeper monitoring boreholes of varying distance from tanks could provide further details on whether significant trends of conservative tracers might be detectable on smaller scales 3 3 groundwater level observations fig 9 shows the high frequency 15 min interval and daily maximum monitored groundwater level observations from september 2017 to september 2018 for bengaluru and only until april 2018 one site in berambadi and monthly to bi monthly dipped data for tg halli and berambadi the monitored boreholes are typically cased in the weathered zone and are open bores in the fresh rock with depth of 50 163 m bgl in bengaluru 218 296 m bgl in tg halli and 61 98 m bgl in berambadi borehole head elevations in bengaluru were at elevations of 889 926 m above sea level asl except bangalore university at 831 m asl and 874 888 m asl in tg halli borehole head elevations in berambadi ranged 831 897 m asl supplementary material table s1 most monitored sites show a decreasing trend in water level between november and april when precipitation is low in bengaluru groundwater levels are shallow average daily maximum level ranging 1 9 m bgl at the three sites closest to the city centre and deeper 19 34 m bgl at sites towards the outskirts fig 9b daily groundwater level fluctuations are highly variable across sites but can be categorized into group a sites that experience high and rapid fluctuations iisc yelahanka nimhans and group b sites that show little daily fluctuations cubbon park lalbagh park bangalore university because rapid changes in groundwater level are most commonly caused by nearby groundwater abstractions it can be assumed that group a is more directly influenced by anthropogenic head changes while group b reflects a more undisturbed condition the extremely rapid drawdown in some of the boreholes level decrease of up to 3 5 m in 15 min is indicative of a high fracture connectivity and low storage in this part of the aquifer the maximum daily water level in bengaluru decreased by 1 5 m in the dry season and showed no strong overall trends but possibly some downward tendency at two sites iisc and lalbagh groundwater levels in tg halli fig 9b were only monitored from september 2017 to end of march 2018 which coincides with the pre monsoon water sampling water levels are much deeper than those in bengaluru with averages ranging 79 to 148 m bgl these levels may have dropped somewhat lower in the summer months that are not included in this dataset the strong variation in groundwater levels between sites corresponds well to previous studies ballukraya and srinivasan 2019 three of the five monitored sites indicated by the black lines fig 9b show much more rapid level increases after strong rainfalls in september to november 2017 fig 9a which is indicative of rapid fracture flow into these boreholes in berambadi groundwater levels show a distinct regional gradient with the shallowest average groundwater level 14 m bgl at the westernmost site and deepest average level 62 m bgl at the easternmost location which corresponds to observations from previous studies e g buvaneshwari et al 2017 collins et al 2020 sharma et al 2018 the monitored sites exhibit a temporal trend with post monsoon peak levels in november 2017 and a gradual decline until the onset of the new recharge in may 2018 compared to bengaluru and tg halli the seasonal groundwater level declines are more pronounced with a drop of 13 15 m from the peak level in november 2017 to the lowest recorded level in april 2018 4 discussion 4 1 evidence of connectivity of the deeper basement aquifer to modern recharge processes the observed lack of strong correlations between isotopic ratios or no3 concentrations with borehole depth in all study areas fig 3 is indicative of a well mixed system and the detection of typical anthropogenic pollutants such as no3 in high concentrations even at greater depth indicates that recharge is modern these findings are in accordance with a parallel study by collins et al 2020 who demonstrated by means of a range of hydrogeochemical techniques including the residence time tracer cfc a high degree of lateral and vertical connectivity in the berambadi catchment for example a homogenously high concentration of cfcs in both shallow and deep monitoring boreholes in this study was found indicative of recent recharge and of a well mixed groundwater system without clear vertical stratification however depending on the number and position of intercepted fractures borehole casings in the study area are usually cased down to the base of the weathered zone which likely ranges between 15 and 60 m bgl and open bores from thereon a water sample may represent an integrated sample with contributions from shallower fractures in the upper part of the fresh rock potentially overlaying chemical signatures from deeper fractures it can be concluded that the deeper basement aquifer has a component of modern recharge in all investigated catchments with either fractures or the boreholes acting as preferential pathways 4 2 comparison of relative contribution of tank recharge to other sources the variability of isotopic ratios in the groundwater samples from bengaluru fig 2 and supplementary material table s2 indicates that groundwater recharge in the urban setting is influenced by multiple sources including mains leakage urban runoff and drainage and infiltration from rainfall and surface waters conceptualized in fig 10 as expected for the complex urban setting hydraulic heads in the monitored boreholes demonstrated distinct patterns ranging from sites with little daily fluctuations cubbon park lalbagh park bangalore university to sites with high and rapid fluctuations iisc yelahanka nimhans fig 9 from a monitoring perspective these strong head changes at bengaluru highlight that manual monitoring in low storage fractured aquifers is best undertaken by taking a series of measurements over time to ensure that a representative water level is recorded monitored boreholes in areas with a higher density of the piped water supply system that delivers mainly water from the cauvery river as potable water supply generally exhibited shallow groundwater levels typically about 1 m bgl lalbagh and cubbon park the shallower groundwater level is likely caused by substantial recharge from the piped mains water network this is in accordance with other recent studies sekhar et al 2018 tomer et al 2021 the similar isotopic signature fig 4 and cl br ratios in inner city tanks piped water and groundwater fig 8 also point to a strong connection between these waters with tanks possibly being recharged by the shallow groundwater in the post monsoon season pre monsoon most groundwater levels were below the assumed average tank depth and tanks would be expected to lose water through infiltration and potentially recharge groundwater fig 10a however assumed flow is not based on precise monitoring of the tank water level and a more detailed study would be necessary to clearly identify the predominant flow direction in either case however connections and exchange of tank piped and groundwater in the inner city area is of high likelihood in the outskirts tank water is mainly fed by direct rainfall and runoff as well as treated and partially untreated sewage collected in drainage canals indicated by a higher pollutant load of these sites e g cl and to a lesser extent by the sparser mains system fig 10b this conceptualization is supported by strong post monsoonal similarity between tank water and the amount weighted average rainfall composition in the outskirts and conversely the stronger post monsoonal similarity of isotopic composition in tank waters with piped water and groundwater in the inner city areas fig 4 in the rural catchments tg halli and berambadi recharge pathways differ from the urban city in regards to a lack of water mains and the additional recharge from irrigation return flow fig 11 the rural groundwaters show higher spatial similarity in isotopic compositions e g lower standard deviations across the sample groups see supplementary material table s2 than groundwaters in bengaluru and very similar isotopic composition to the amount weighted average rainfall fig 2 this could indicate that the majority of groundwater recharge in the rural catchments is constituted either by rainfall or considering that most of this area is highly irrigated also by usually slightly more evaporated return flow from irrigated agriculture the latter is indicated by the higher evaporative change in rural groundwaters significant increase in d excess in the pre monsoon compared to bengaluru no significant change wilcoxon rank sum test supplementary material figure s1 the analysis of the cl br ratios showed groundwater samples with relatively constant cl br ratio but with a high range of cl concentrations indicative for mixing of low cl pristine groundwater with a high cl endmember for tg halli fig 8 in berambadi a typical mixing line of groundwater with an endmember with higher cl and higher cl br could be observed this mixing with cl rich water is a good indication that irrigation return flows which typically have increased cl from agrochemical inputs could be the dominant recharge source high no3 concentrations further corroborate this conclusion even though potential recharge from berambadi tanks is somewhat spatially distributed because nearby farms may supply water from the tank to fields via drainage channels collins et al 2020 this neither creates an isotopic signal in the groundwaters nor is there indication from the cl br analysis that much mixing of tank water and groundwater is taking place tank waters mostly had higher cl br but lower cl and no mixing line with tanks as endmember could be identified thus this indicates that much of the infiltrated water from tanks is lost within the unsaturated zone for example by lateral flow processes and evapotranspiration scanlon and cook 2002 and is therefore not significantly adding to groundwater recharge this finding is in contrast to those from investigations using recharge estimations based on water level fluctuation methods kumar et al 2017 and studies relating tank density to groundwater levels chowdhury and behera 2018 which observed higher groundwater levels near tanks however in both of these studies it is not clear if the higher water levels can be attributed to groundwater recharge by tanks or to other factors such as decreased groundwater abstractions in areas with higher surface water availability i e tanks or higher water storage from tanks in the vadose zone i e less need for irrigation previous studies have calculated percolation efficiencies of tanks defined as the percolated fraction of tank water depletion over a given time period of 35 68 boisson et al 2014 massuel et al 2014 metha and jain 1997 perrin et al 2012 singh et al 2004 sukhija et al 1997 however little is known about how much of the infiltrated water actually recharges groundwater as not all water lost through the base of a tank can be expected to reach the groundwater table but may be stored in the vadose zone or taken up by evapotranspiration boisson et al 2014 de vries and simmers 2002 a rare study using water level data in combination with water isotopes and chemical data to estimate recharge sources concluded that rainfall was the main source of recharge with only marginal recharge from a nearby tank saha et al 2013 thus a revised approach to directly estimate water fluxes below tanks may be beneficial for example by more local scale studies using environmental tracers as suggested by boisson et al 2014 combined with water level observations regardless of the recharge rate beneath individual tanks in the context of the landscape as a whole tanks cover small areas especially in urban setting where they are encroached on for development and hence their overall contribution to recharge may always be limited but yet it will be a useful endeavour to quantify better the unit area impacts of tanks for example we did not see significant trends of conservative tracers stable isotopes and cl pearson correlation in groundwater with distance from tanks and we estimated a recharge contribution only 2 6 from tank waters in tg halli based on a two end member mixing for d excess because of constraints on the regional data availability for example only a one year amount weighted rainfall average was obtained for this study and data on variations in tank surface areas and tank levels storage for the three regions are not available there is some uncertainty in these results and it may go beyond this study to define a per unit area value of tank recharge however a more specifically designed monitoring network with site specific installation of deeper monitoring boreholes of varying distance from tanks could provide further details on whether significant trends of conservative tracers might be detectable on smaller scales we therefore propose that studies following a hydrochemical approach as presented here combined with more site specific monitoring networks as for example outlined in knappett et al 2012 and stahl et al 2014 could be informative for the future 4 3 contamination risks posed by tanks and other sources to groundwater distinct hydrochemical patterns were observed in bengaluru e g mg and cl hotspots near kaikondrahalli tank and vrishabhavathi river and higher concentrations of no3 near lalbagh tank while contamination in the rural catchments seemed more widespread in bengaluru increased concentrations of cl were present in tank water and groundwaters and the dominating 1 1 molar ratio of na cl fig 7a and very high cl br ratio fig 8a indicates that cl contamination is related to anthropogenic sources such as effluent from households and industry alcal√° and custodio 2008 increased levels of cl were found in particular in the western outskirts of bengaluru around kaikondrahalli tank and our conceptualized model indicates that the lower groundwater levels and lower density of mains network i e lower dilution of infiltrated tank water by mains leakage will increase the risks to surface water quality this holds true for tanks but in particular also for larger perennial drainage systems such as the vrishabhavathi river which was found to have high concentrations of k so4 cl and hco3 also indicative of anthropogenic pollution in the city centre water levels were extremely shallow in the wetter part of the year and recharge mixing of tank water with mains leakage will substantially reduce the impact of tanks on groundwater recharge however it should be noted that post monsoon samples from the piped water showed high no3 concentrations up to 19 7 mg l no3 with a median of 15 2 mg l considering that most of the piped water is imported from the cauvery river which flows through agricultural areas it needs to be considered if the imported piped water might be introducing agricultural pollutants into the groundwater system similar to bengaluru high cl concentrations were detected in tg halli groundwaters seasonal median up to 168 4 mg l and berambadi seasonal median up to 76 8 for comparison buvaneshwari et al 2020 only detected cl concentration of mostly 10 mg l in a neighbouring more pristine area in similar geological setting and at a close distance to the berambadi catchment therefore the higher concentrations in berambadi compared to its neighbouring area are unlikely to be of natural origin the most likely cause of this are applied fertilizers e g mg no3 2 ca no3 2 kcl or mgcl2 from which no3 and cl are leached into the groundwater during the monsoon season buvaneshwari et al 2020 this could also explain the higher concentrations of mg in the rural catchments especially post monsoon in berambadi no3 concentrations exceeding the bis dwl drinking water limit of 45 mg l were detected most frequently 85 of all groundwater samples in berambadi with a peak concentration of 446 mg l table s5 supplementary material this is slightly higher than observed in the same catchment by buvaneshwari et al 2017 who detected peak concentrations of 360 mg l and average concentrations of 77 mg l in september 2012 and 75 mg l in june 2013 average concentrations in this study were somewhat higher with 133 mg l post monsoon october 2017 and 113 mg l pre monsoon april 2018 which shows an upward trend in nitrate pollution in recent years and re iterates that better nutrient and irrigation management is crucial to prevent further deterioration of the region s groundwater quality sharma et al 2018 5 conclusions a suite of chemical analyses stable isotopes water chemistry of samples from piped water sourced mainly from the cauvery river surface waters tank water and river water and groundwater in three catchments set in the crystalline basement of the cauvery basin karnataka india was undertaken to investigate recharge patterns and pathways the three catchments comprised the urban area of bengaluru city the state capital and rural areas with higher levels of agricultural activity north of bengaluru tg halli and the berambadi catchment in southern karnataka the focus of this study was to use hydrochemical tracers to see if significant groundwater recharge from tank water water from artificial lakes could be identified within the groundwater system the distinct isotopic ratios and hydrochemistry between tank water and groundwaters at most sites and especially in the rural catchments observed in this study suggest that these are suitable tracers of tank water recharge the groundwater chemistry results indicate that tank recharge is of limited importance to regional groundwater recharge and quality in rural areas where recharge from precipitation and groundwater recycling from irrigation dominate the recharge signal in the urban setting bengaluru impermeable surfaces increased the relative effect of recharge from point sources such as tanks and rivers but where present pipe leakage from public water supply accounted for the majority of recharge location specific differences could be observed e g between the city centre where shallow groundwater levels are predominant and groundwater as well as mains water leakage is likely to interact and possibly recharge tanks and the outskirts of bengaluru this means that to sensibly estimate recharge by tank water site specific information especially on water level fluctuations and alternative recharge sources needs to also be considered additional studies to quantify tank recharge and revisions to the current guidelines for national groundwater recharge estimations using a less generalised approach are recommended to avoid over estimating the role tanks play in groundwater recharge groundwater contamination in bengaluru from different sources was observed with distinct regional patterns e g cl and mg hotspots near kaikondrahalli tank and vrishabhavathi river and higher concentrations of no3 near lalbagh tank due to the shallow water levels in bengaluru s inner city and slight indication of recharge from tank water in the outskirts tanks in bengaluru could be a possible source of contamination due to vertical infiltration to groundwater in the dry season in the rural catchments especially berambadi contamination was more ubiquitous particularly regarding agricultural pollutants the exceedance of dwls by no3 in the rural catchments is likely the impact of diffuse recharge under fertilized areas with tanks posing a negligible risk to groundwater quality

8555,the majority of india s rural drinking water supply is sourced from groundwater which also plays a critical role in irrigated agriculture supporting the livelihoods of millions of users however recent high abstractions are threatening the sustainable use of groundwater and action is needed to ensure continued supply increased managed aquifer recharge mar using the 200 000 existing tanks artificially created surface water bodies is one of the indian government s key initiatives to combat declining groundwater levels however few studies have directly examined the effectiveness of tank recharge particularly in the complex fractured hydrogeology of peninsular india to address this gap this study examined the impact of tanks in three crystalline bedrock catchments in karnataka southern india by analysing the isotopic and hydrochemical composition of surface waters and groundwaters combined with groundwater level observations the results indicate that tanks have limited impact on regional groundwater recharge and quality in rural areas where recharge from precipitation and groundwater recycling from irrigation dominate the recharge signal in the urban setting bengaluru impermeable surfaces increased the relative effect of recharge from point sources such as tanks and rivers but where present pipe leakage from public water supply accounted for the majority of recharge shallow groundwater levels in the inner parts of the city may lead to groundwater discharge to tanks particularly in the dry season we conclude that the importance of aquifer recharge from tanks is limited compared to other recharge sources and highly dependent on the specific setting additional studies to quantify tank recharge and revisions to the current guidelines for national groundwater recharge estimations using a less generalised approach are recommended to avoid over estimating the role tanks play in groundwater recharge keywords india groundwater recharge fractured rock hydrochemistry stable isotopes tanks 1 introduction it is estimated that nearly 700 million indians living in villages 50 of india s population depend on groundwater for basic needs kulkarni et al 2015 groundwater is also the primary water source for over 50 of india s irrigated agricultural land goi 2015 as such it is a vital resource both for public health and economic growth kulkarni et al 2015 pahuja et al 2010 shah et al 2003 the indian government reports that on a national scale groundwater abstraction of which 90 is used for irrigation was 249 billion cubic metres bcm for the year 2017 approximately two thirds of the estimated annual net extractable groundwater of 393 bcm cgwb 2019a the scale of groundwater abstraction differs across the country and since the 1980s groundwater levels have declined in several regions as a result of increased abstraction due to enhanced and more affordable pump technology nearly a third of the groundwater assessment units in peninsular india are therefore in semi critical 14 critical 5 or over exploited 17 status cgwb 2019a with strongest declines observed in the sedimentary basins in the northwestern states ambast et al 2006 cgwb 2019a macdonald et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 and in parts of southern india s crystalline basement aquifers e g in the states of karnataka and tamil nadu which cover about 60 of the country cgwb 2019a sharma et al 2018 the importance of enhanced groundwater management in india has clearly been recognized by the government of india acknowledging in the third national water policy document goi 2012b that water governance needs to be improved to alleviate a critical situation in many parts of the country one of the key suggestions is to enhance water availability by using tanks the local term for typically small surface water storage structures such as farm ponds but also larger lakes for water harvesting and managed aquifer recharge mar cgwb 2007 cgwb 2013 the use of tanks is a long standing tradition especially in southern india since ancient and medieval times dixit et al 1993 and they are said to provide flood protection water storage ecosystem services as well as recreational and aesthetic value and potential recharge to local groundwater d souza and nagendra 2011 dixit et al 1993 empri 2018 esha 2008 nagendra and ostrom 2014 patil 2011 though it is difficult to know the precise number of functional tanks in india pant and verma 2010 it is estimated that there are between 200 000 palanisami et al 2010 sharma 2003 and 500 000 reddy 2015 recent tank restoration and promotion efforts with a goal to enhance groundwater availability by means of mar have been undertaken by the national and local governments e g tamil nadu and karnataka often supported by local ngos and also received substantial support by international institutions such as the european union eu the national bank for agricultural and rural development nabard the world bank and the international water management institute iwmi richard ferroudji et al 2018 however there are few studies that directly evaluate recharge from tanks or investigate tank groundwater connectivity in india s basement setting and therefore little is known about the effectiveness and potential groundwater quality implications of tank restoration and promotion in the suggested methodology for groundwater recharge estimations used for national groundwater resource assessment and planning the indian government s groundwater resource estimation committee gec acknowledges the limited availability of field studies as a temporary measure they suggest a recharge estimation method using a fixed recharge rate of 1 4 mm day tank area as approximation gec 1997 this approach was carried forward into the most recent gec guideline gec 2017 and the latest national groundwater review cgwb 2019b however while recharge from tanks in the north indian alluvial plains is relatively high and homogeneous bhanja et al 2019 recharge to the lower permeability crystalline aquifers dominant in southern peninsular india is more complicated and likely much more spatially variable crystalline basement aquifers are formed by a combination of weathering and tectonic forces and can be best conceptualized as zones of varying degree of weathering i e a weathered upper zone termed saprolite which overlies a less weathered but fractured rock layer followed by fresher basement rock collins et al 2020 singhal and gupta 2010 in the southern indian context the thickness of the weathered zone is typically a few to several tens of meters with fracture zones extending to depths of 200 to 300 m cgwb 2012 below the relatively permeable weathered zone recharge to the crystalline basement depends on the size aperture and distribution connectivity of fractures lateral connectivity varies spatially with depth and depends on the vertical extent of the weathered zone and layout of the fracture network at depth banks et al 2009 guih√©neuf et al 2014 ofterdinger et al 2019 the connectivity may also depend on the type of fissure network for example on whether the bedrock is fractured or sheared few studies report the local impact of tanks in these crystalline basement settings in india investigating recharge from mostly small tanks with 0 4 km2 zone of influence command area in andhra pradesh reddy and behera 2009 found farmers reported shallower groundwater levels and fewer dry wells in areas with restored tanks than in areas without tanks a study using macro level data from west bengal to model the linkage between groundwater levels and tanks found an inverse relationship between tank density and depth to groundwater chowdhury and behera 2018 however in both of these studies it is not clear if the difference in groundwater level can be attributed to recharge by tanks or is influenced by other factors such as decreased groundwater abstractions in areas with higher surface water availability i e tanks other studies mainly using water balance approaches have quantified average daily percolations rates of 5 5 18 4 mm day boisson et al 2014 perrin et al 2012 singh et al 2004 and percolation efficiencies defined as the percolated fraction of tank water depletion over a given time period of 35 68 boisson et al 2014 massuel et al 2014 metha and jain 1997 perrin et al 2012 singh et al 2004 sukhija et al 1997 however little is known about how much of the infiltrated water actually recharges groundwater as not all water lost through the base of a tank can be expected to reach the groundwater table but some may be stored in the vadose zone or taken up by evapotranspiration de vries and simmers 2002 this is in particular discussed in a study by boisson et al 2014 which proposed a combined surface water and groundwater balance method in order to better consider flow within the unsaturated zone and found that only 53 88 of the potential recharge from the tank percolate reach the groundwater table in summary while some studies have assessed groundwater recharge from tanks in the indian crystalline basement using a variety of approaches most have focussed on quantifying the percolation rates of the tanks there remains significant uncertainty on how much of this infiltrated water is recharging to deeper groundwater and how much of the water is lost in the unsaturated zone therefore more site specific studies are necessary to understand the effects of tanks on groundwater recharge in the crystalline basement in this study a suite of direct measurements i e water isotopic ratios hydrochemistry and water level observations were used to investigate the degree of groundwater recharge and its impact on water quality from tank structures in three study areas in karnataka state the areas reflect agricultural land use and different geological settings fractured versus sheared crystalline basement because tanks are traditionally part of both the urban and rural landscape in southern india we also considered the city of bengaluru well known for its numerous interconnected tanks in this study specific aims were to 1 assess the connectivity of the deeper fractured basement aquifer to modern recharge processes from tanks and other sources 2 assess the significance of tank recharge compared to other recharge sources and 3 identify the contamination risk posed by tanks and other recharge sources to groundwater 2 methods 2 1 study locations this study focuses on three areas in south and southeastern karnataka there are seven perennial river basins in karnataka but due to the high inter annual variability of monsoon rainfalls and river flow and high vulnerability of local surface water sources to contamination groundwater is used as primary drinking water source in most of the state s rural area empri 2018 groundwater resources in karnataka are also heavily used for industrial and domestic water supply in major cities such as bengaluru population about 8 million and mysore population about 0 9 million and for agricultural production across the state recent 2017 estimates of groundwater withdrawals are 70 of total extractable groundwater compared to 63 on the national scale and about 26 of karnataka s taluks administrative divisions are classified as over exploited with respect to groundwater use which is 9 higher than on the national scale cgwb 2019b the selected sites for this study are the city of bengaluru two sub catchments aralamallige and hadonahalli in the rural area of the thippagondanahalli tg halli catchment about 30 km north of bengaluru and the rural berambadi catchment in the southern part of karnataka fig 1 all study areas are located in the cauvery river basin with exception of the north eastern part of bengaluru which falls into the south pennar basin table 1 lists key characteristics such as size tank density and climatology of the study areas mean annual precipitation in the areas ranges 800 900 mm year but with high annual variations fig 1e and its pattern is composed of two distinct monsoon periods namely the dominant southwest summer monsoon june september that typically produces most of the annual precipitation 85 and the northeast winter monsoon from october to december rahul et al 2016 mean temperatures are around 23 c and potential evapotranspiration usually exceeds the annual rainfall with mean values of approximately 1100 1650 mm year across the study areas sekhar et al 2016 srinivasan et al 2015 numerous long established water tanks are characteristic of all three study areas see table 1 with region specific distribution in size and set up tanks can be divided into the following broad categories river fed tanks constructed by using dams locally termed anicuts to check water along a hydraulic gradient or rain fed tanks constructed by digging a square cavity of shallow few metres depth into the ground empri 2018 tank embankments can be site specific but typically river fed tanks have little embankment aside from the check dam while smaller rain fed tanks are usually without raised embankments bengaluru has mostly cascading large 1 2 ha medium 0 4 1 2 ha and small size 0 4 ha tanks with seasonal to perennial water storage the city is naturally divided into three main river valleys and most of the city s tanks have been established by the use of anicuts to intercept rainwater and dam existing streams along topographic gradients often with drains connecting a series of cascading tanks to each other d souza and nagendra 2011 nowadays the main tank inflows are from rainfall and urban runoff including waste waters rao et al 2020 the depth of water bodies in bengaluru ranges from 0 5 m to a maximum of 9 m sankay tank the tg halli catchment is dominated by two large reservoirs namely tg halli reservoir itself in the most southern part of the catchment and hesaraghatta tank which is located about 30 km upstream from tg halli along the arkavathy river a tributary to the cauvery river in addition there are an estimate of about 600 smaller often cascading in stream tanks of which most have been constructed by checking monsoon runoff srinivasan et al 2015 in the berambadi catchment most of its 53 tanks other than the berambadi tank are ephemeral and only fill up for short periods after strong monsoon rains collins et al 2020 sharma et al 2018 there is no detailed bathymetry available for small tanks in tg halli and berambadi but the depth of these smaller ponds observed in similar studies ranges around 4 m boisson et al 2014 massuel et al 2014 sharda et al 2006 2 1 1 hydrogeology previous hydrogeological studies have been undertaken in all three areas sekhar et al 2018 investigated groundwater level dynamics in bengaluru for the period 2015 2017 at tg halli catchment ballukraya and srinivasan 2019 investigated variations in groundwater levels in the two sub catchments aralamallige and hadonahalli about 7 km and 20 km north of hesaraghatta tank respectively which corresponds to the areas used in this study the berambadi catchment is the site of the kabini critical zone observatory sekhar et al 2016 the three study areas are dominated by weathered and fractured bedrock aquifers of the banded gneiss complex with local variations in rock composition bengaluru is mainly underlain by precambrian migmatites granodiorites tonalites and gneiss with local granitic intrusions especially in the central part of the city near lalbagh lake the weathered horizon is about 15 m in thickness and overlain with red loamy to gravelly superficial deposits of varying thickness hedge and chandra 2012 a particularly thick saprolite formation of about 60 m can be found in the eastern parts of bengaluru hedge and subhash chandra 2014 groundwater levels in bengaluru are observed from extremely shallow depths of only 1 m below ground level bgl to about 70 m bgl sekhar et al 2018 the nearby tg halli catchment likewise consists of weathered to a depth of about 20 m bgl fissured and fractured granite and gneiss srinivasan et al 2015 boreholes are often deep 200 300 m but may recharge from water bearing joints at shallow depths as well as from deeper fractures thus creating a complicated flow system with many of the water bearing fractures at shallow depths an extensive study in tg halli from borehole scans and groundwater levels of 83 boreholes revealed that groundwater levels vary considerably between 28 and 222 m bgl often with large differences between adjacent proximities of 100 m boreholes ballukraya and srinivasan 2019 the berambadi catchment 200 km southwest of bengaluru is dominated by massive to extensively sheared gneiss overlain by about 1 to 5 m of regolith collins et al 2020 which is a thinner weathered zone than in the other catchments groundwater levels in berambadi have been monitored since 2010 and the observed depths to groundwater range from 10 to 70 m sekhar et al 2016 2 1 2 water and land use water demand in bengaluru has risen in recent decades and cannot be met using local water resources to overcome acute water shortages additional water is drawn from the cauvery river and imported to the city via a large pipeline river cauvery water is now the city s main drinking water source particularly in the centre of bengaluru where the density of the piped mains network is the greatest additionally numerous boreholes have been drilled after the onset of more advanced and affordable pump technology in the 1980s to increase access to groundwater across bengaluru in the outskirts of the city these are often used for drinking water as well as for small scale agricultural activities in the more rural study area of tg halli groundwater abstraction has similarly increased in recent decades and is likely one of the causes of strong decline in surface water flows srinivasan et al 2015 in the berambadi catchment groundwater is the primary source of water for most water uses increasing groundwater abstraction for agricultural production has led to water table declines of up to 50 m sharma et al 2018 however the recent strong monsoon of 2018 has resulted in significant recoveries in groundwater levels across the catchment collins et al 2020 agricultural activities in the rural catchments are intensive with 2 3 cropping seasons a year namely in summer january to may always irrigated kharif may to september frequently irrigated and rabi september to january only irrigated if rainfalls are insufficient sekhar et al 2016 the irrigation pattern means that the highest groundwater abstraction for the summer irrigation coincides with the period of deepest groundwater levels 2 2 sampling and analysis repeat samples total n 112 were collected from surface water piped mains water river water and tank water and boreholes from shallow a few metres to about 300 m depth table 2 during two sampling periods reflecting post monsoonal october 2017 and pre monsoonal march may 2018 conditions groundwater samples were collected from boreholes and in two locations from open wells and surface water where possible from nearby tanks and in few cases from rivers vrishabhavathi river in bengaluru or canals additionally 14 one off samples groundwater and surface water were taken at different locations numbers indicated in parentheses in table 2 the surface water samples were obtained as grab samples using a sampling beaker attached to a rod at about 10 20 cm depth below the water surface and about 2 3 m off the river tank edge samplers were faced upstream where applicable and there was no disturbance to the bottom sediment immediately prior or during sampling care was taken to avoid tank locations that appeared stagnant based on visual evaluation and sampling was undertaken near outflows where possible no detailed information is however available on the potential degree of stratification within the surface water bodies the samples for inorganic chemistry were filtered 0 45 Œºm cellulose membrane into two 30 ml nalgene bottles without airspace and un acidified but prior to analysis cation samples were acidified and preserved with aristar grade concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acid 0 5 v v water chemistry samples were stored at 4 c except during transportation to the uk 24 h at ambient room temperature bulk rainwater samples n 51 were collected for isotope analysis Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in two of the study areas tg halli and berambadi for the one year period september 2017 to september 2018 using a specifically designed totalizer that minimizes evaporation effects based on iaea gnip 2014 sampling intervals of the rainwater varied slightly depending on rainfall events but were approximately every two weeks because of the close proximity about 30 km and similar altitude and climatology of tg halli to bengaluru rainfall samples from tg halli are considered as representative for the bengaluru region as a whole in this study unfortunately one sample for the period 11 11 2017 to 29 12 2017 constituting about 10 of the annual rainfall from berambadi was lost in transport before analysis in each sampling round dissolved oxygen do redox potential eh temperature ph and specific electrical conductivity sec were measured in the field where possible in a flow cell with bicarbonate alkalinity hco3 concurrently determined by micro titration all surface waters and groundwaters were analysed for inorganic major minor trace elements using icp ms agilent 8900 and ion chromatography dionex ics5000 and for stable isotopes Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer vg optima at the centre for environmental geochemistry ceg uk the Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o ratios were reported in reference to the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow with measurement precision within 0 05 for Œ¥18o and 1 for Œ¥2h deuterium excess d excess was calculated using d excess Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥18o according to dansgaard 1964 results were visualised using r version 3 6 1 the r foundation and the ggplot2 package spatial plots were undertaken using arcgis in addition to the hydrochemical investigation pressure transducers were installed at six locations in bengaluru and in one location in berambadi to record water level variations at high frequency 15 minute intervals additional manual water level measurements dip meter were taken manually at approximately monthly intervals for five of the sampling boreholes in berambadi and five boreholes in the southern sub catchment of tg halli see fig 1 b for detailed locations of all monitored sites and supplementary material table s1 for additional information on borehole elevations and depths more comprehensive water level observations for the same period from the kabini observatory berambadi are available in collins et al 2020 3 results 3 1 stable isotopes results of the stable isotope analysis including one off samples are presented in fig 2 for rainfall samples panel a and groundwaters and surface water by sampling round panel b c along with the amount weighted mean rainfall composition for tg halli also used for bengaluru given the proximity of 30 km and berambadi tabularized data such as mean values and standard deviations for Œ¥18o Œ¥2h and d excess of surface waters and groundwaters by study area and sampling round are provided in table s2 in the supplementary material the Œ¥18o ratio of the rainfall samples n 51 ranged between 9 3 and 1 6 median 5 3 and that of Œ¥2h between 65 9 and 22 3 median 28 5 the amount weighted average for the tg halli rainfall samples was 5 2 for Œ¥18o and 30 3 for Œ¥2h and the incomplete i e missing data from one sample amount weighted average in berambadi was 3 7 for Œ¥18o and 20 0 for Œ¥2h the overall distribution of Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h for the rainfall samples is similar to the local meteoric water line Œ¥2h 11 74 Œ¥2h 7 82 established by kumar et al 2010 in an earlier study in karnataka and the global meteoric waterline gmwl with Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥2h 10 fig 2 note that the local and global meteoric waterlines are nearly identical surface water samples in bengaluru from piped mains vrishabhavathi river and tanks have similar isotopic compositions to each other in the post monsoon season reflecting wet conditions but there is a slightly higher evaporative signal in the tanks compared to the piped mains and river water in the drier pre monsoon sampling this is indicated for example visually by the slightly more positive Œ¥18o fig 2c of the bengaluru tank samples and the lower pre monsoon median d excess of the bengaluru tanks 8 3 compared to the piped and river water 0 7 and 2 9 respectively see table s2 and figure s1 in the supplementary material surface waters in the rural catchments have slightly isotopically lighter composition than groundwaters in the post monsoon fig 2b and a stronger but not significant wilcoxon rank sum test pre monsoonal enrichment in heavier isotopes median d excess of 28 7 and 23 9 for tg halli and berambadi respectively compared to only 8 3 in bengaluru figure s1 table s1 groundwater isotopic compositions show a marked difference in spread between the urban and the rural catchments with a larger variation between sample locations in bengaluru compared to a very homogenous compositions in the rural catchments tg halli and berambadi fig 2 plotting close to the amount average weighted rainfall this is reflected for example by the higher three fold standard deviation for Œ¥18o in bengaluru of 0 9 compared to 0 3 for tg halli and berambadi table s1 supplementary material the observed variations in bengaluru seemed to be slightly greater in shallower boreholes but there is no significant correlation between isotopic composition and borehole depth at either study area fig 3 r 0 27 for Œ¥18o versus borehole depth closer examination of groundwater samples from bengaluru seems to suggest that samples fall into two separate groups with distinct behaviour namely an inner city group sampling sites near lalbagh iisc and sankay tank figure 4 right column which consists of groundwater samples that are more isotopically enriched i e more evaporated and have similar isotopic ratios to piped and tank waters and a second group of groundwater samples from the outskirt areas allalasandra tank vrishabhavathi and kaikondrahalli tank figure 4 left column refer to fig 1 for detailed locations samples from the outskirts are significantly wilcoxon rank sum test 0 05 for d excess and Œ¥18o less isotopically enriched as indicated for example by the lower mean Œ¥18o of tank groundwaters from the outskirts 2 9 post monsoon 2017 and 3 0 pre monsoon 2018 compared to the inner city samples 1 7 and 1 4 fig 4 3 2 hydrochemistry 3 2 1 water types and major ion chemistry a piper plot fig 5 of all analysed samples by study area and source type demonstrates that the rural catchments are almost entirely dominated by alkaline earth elements ca mg while some samples in the urban setting bengaluru are dominated by na the dominant water type in bengaluru is ca na hco3 with exception of piped water ca mg hco3 type and eight samples with cl as dominant anion most of these near kaikondrahalli tank the rural catchments tg halli and berambadi exhibit a more diverse range of water types with higher proportions of mg both in tank water and in groundwaters contrary to bengaluru cl dominance in the rural catchments only occurred in two pre monsoonal tank samples in tg halli and in none of the samples in berambadi for more detailed information on water types by study area water source and sampling round see supplementary material table s3 3 2 2 surface water major ion chemistry and field parameters piped water in bengaluru has median concentrations of ca hco3 and so4 similar to the city s tank water but is generally lower in concentrations of k na and cl fig 6 with tabular data given in supplementary material table s4 mg concentrations in piped water medians around 19 mg l are about twice as high as in the city s tank water most noteworthy no3 was detected in the post monsoonal piped water in concentrations of up to 19 7 mg l while little no3 was observed in bengaluru s tank water in either sampling round all concentrations 1 mg l no3 river water samples from vrishabhavathi river showed generally higher concentrations of all major ions and sec of around 1400 ¬µs cm fig 6 tank waters are relatively similar in composition for the three studied catchments though the bengaluru tanks have slightly higher ion concentrations with regards to ca mg hco3 and most noteworthy higher na and cl fig 6 the higher cl concentrations in bengaluru exceed those of the rural catchments roughly by 30 mg l and with higher concentrations at kaikondrahalli tank 90 mg l in both sampling rounds pre monsoonal cl medians are higher than post monsoonal ones in all study regions in bengaluru this is mainly caused by strong increases in cl concentrations in the two tanks in the outskirts increase by 101 and 73 at kaikondrahalli and allalasandra tank the inner city tanks sankay and lalbagh surrounded by a more densely piped mains network fig 1b only show increases in cl by 19 and 39 respectively sec and ph in tank waters are higher in the pre monsoon with generally larger increases in the rural catchments than in bengaluru fig 6 3 2 3 groundwater major ion chemistry and field parameters groundwaters in all three study areas have a relatively constant major ion composition over time changes by 25 except for distinct decreases in no3 by 27 41 in all study areas and mg by 27 in tg halli in the pre monsoon season ca mg and no3 concentrations in the rural catchments are significantly higher than in bengaluru while the reverse holds true for ph wilcoxon rank sum test 0 5 mg no3 hco3 and sec all follow a distribution of berambadi tg halli bengaluru median k concentrations in groundwaters are without significant differences across study areas and in time and range 5 5 to 6 8 mg l median cl concentrations followed the order tg halli bengaluru berambadi highest lowest median of 168 4 and 67 9 mg l and were slightly lower in the pre monsoon sampling decrease by 1 12 cl concentrations 100 mg l were measured in bengaluru groundwater near kaikondrahalli lalbagh and vrishabhavathi river highest measured concentration 560 9 mg l near kaikondrahalli and in tg halli in almost all samples from the aralamallige southern sub catchment maximum concentration 475 1 mg l but none of the samples from the second sub catchment hadonahalli maximum concentration 61 3 mg l in berambadi a slight trend of increasing cl concentrations from west mostly 100 mg l to east most concentrations 100 mg l was observed high concentrations of no3 exceeding the indian drinking water limit dwl of the bureau of indian standards bis of 45 mg l no3 bis 2012 were primarily detected in berambadi 85 of all samples maximum 446 3 mg l no3 and tg halli 33 maximum 162 5 mg l no3 and only at one site in bengaluru 54 8 mg l near lalbagh tank post monsoon it is noteworthy that except for a weak significant correlation for tg halli no3 did not show significant trends with the drilled depth of the sampled boreholes fig 3 for a full list of percent of samples exceeding dwls by study area see supplementary material table s3 3 2 4 chemical ratios trends with distance to surface water and estimated impact of tanks the covariant plot of na versus cl fig 7 a demonstrates that na cl ratios in bengaluru with the exception of the cl rich samples from near kaikondrahalli closely follow the 1 1 ratio for halite sources or anthropogenic nacl inputs while there is excess cl or a depletion in na observed in tg halli and berambadi especially in the post monsoon season in the covariant plot of ca versus mg fig 7b most groundwater samples in all study areas fall between the 2 1 line and 1 1 line though there is generally a stronger ion concentration and higher proportion of mg in the rural catchments compared to bengaluru this could be indicative either of local differences in geological setting or be an impact of agricultural inputs e g application of cano3 type fertilizer indicated by a weak to strong correlation between ca and no3 in rural groundwaters r 0 53 and r 0 74 for tg halli and berambadi respectively with p 0 0005 fig 7c shows the gibbs plot for tds versus na na ca weight ratio which can give information about the dominant evolution processes of waters gibbs 1970 the results indicate that neither study area exhibits strong evaporation nor precipitation dominance and there is a stronger clustering of waters from all source types in bengaluru while in the rural catchments most tank waters are separated out from the groundwater samples fig 8a shows the cl br mass ratio versus cl mg l for each study area by source type ratios between cl and br in waters from different sources usually have a typical range and due to these distinct ratios the cl br ratio can give information on mixing processes alcal√° and custodio 2008 and be used to identify recharge to groundwater whilst cl is usually detected at concentrations well above the detection limit it should be noted though that low br concentrations close to detection limits may cause some uncertainty in cl br ratios in our study 4 of the tank water samples had br concentration 1 5 times the detection limit 2 in tg halli and 2 in berambadi concentrations of around 0 015 mg l we have no repeat analysis of these samples but a presumed uncertainty of 10 would shift the br cl mass ratio at the same percentage so interpretation of these data will focus on the combination of br cl mass ratio and cl concentration without too much emphasis on the br cl mass ratios alone the cl br plots show a distinct pattern for each study area in bengaluru groundwaters have a median cl br mass ratio of 552 indicated by the dashed line fig 8a surface water cl br ratios mostly lay within 442 2222 one location allalasandra tank has a markedly low ratio of 66 post monsoon and 104 pre monsoon this is caused by unusually high br concentrations of up to 1 mg l versus the overall median of 0 1 mg l other tank waters in the inner city of bengaluru plot similarly to most of the piped water fig 8a as indicated in the previous chapter piped water and inner city tanks in bengaluru generally have lower cl than river water samples and samples from kaikondrahalli tank which also creates a distinction in the cl br plot the groundwater samples mostly cluster according to their specific location and no clear trend can be observed in tg halli groundwater has a relatively uniform cl br ratio with a median of 239 fig 8a but with a large range in cl concentrations from 14 475 mg l tank waters seem similar in cl br ratio but with some spread in cl concentrations 3 89 mg l the shift in groundwater composition is dominated by a shift along the x axis which may indicate mixing with either lower or higher cl water but with similar cl br ratio this could indicate a dilution of cl rich groundwater by the lower cl tank waters however a correlation analysis person correlation between the proximity of the borehole location to tanks does not show significantly lower cl concentration near tanks fig 8b berambadi groundwater samples show a very pronounced pattern indicative of a mixing line that could be produced by waters with constant br concentration but higher lower cl potentially this is an indication of recharge by return flow from groundwater irrigation as one may suspect similar br but increased cl due to evaporation processes mixing of this type will result in a right shift due to the increased cl and upward shift due to the change in cl br ratio some of the higher cl concentrated tank waters seen on fig 8a could be a potential endmember in this case of lower chloride concentration than the groundwaters thus diluting their cl concentration however the lack of correlation between a borehole s cl concentration and its borehole proximity to tanks does not seem indicative of this r 0 15 p 0 45 fig 8b so that the mixing of the groundwater with higher cl concentrations seem more likely aside from cl water isotopes are usually considered a conservative tracer as they are commonly detected in groundwater with the same isotopic composition as the recharging water e g rainfall recharge e g darling and bath 1988 table 3 shows the mean d excess for amount weighted rainfall tank water and groundwater mean over both sampling periods in the three study catchments it should be noted that the berambadi rainfall is missing the analysis of one sample and that a longer term several years amount weighted rainfall would be considered more reliable hence we are only using tg halli here as example for a 2 endmember mixing because there is no significant correlation between d excess and distance of the boreholes to the nearest tank supplementary material figure s2 this is in good correspondence with the lack of significant trends in fig 8b the mean of all groundwater samples is considered assuming the fraction of tank water times tank water d excess plus the fraction of amount weighted rainfall times rainfall d excess to be equal to the groundwater composition this would result in a fraction of 2 6 tg halli for tank recharge which is very low and indicates that the effective recharge of deeper groundwater within the fractured bedrock seems to be negligible compared to other recharge sources a more specifically designed monitoring network with site specific installation of deeper monitoring boreholes of varying distance from tanks could provide further details on whether significant trends of conservative tracers might be detectable on smaller scales 3 3 groundwater level observations fig 9 shows the high frequency 15 min interval and daily maximum monitored groundwater level observations from september 2017 to september 2018 for bengaluru and only until april 2018 one site in berambadi and monthly to bi monthly dipped data for tg halli and berambadi the monitored boreholes are typically cased in the weathered zone and are open bores in the fresh rock with depth of 50 163 m bgl in bengaluru 218 296 m bgl in tg halli and 61 98 m bgl in berambadi borehole head elevations in bengaluru were at elevations of 889 926 m above sea level asl except bangalore university at 831 m asl and 874 888 m asl in tg halli borehole head elevations in berambadi ranged 831 897 m asl supplementary material table s1 most monitored sites show a decreasing trend in water level between november and april when precipitation is low in bengaluru groundwater levels are shallow average daily maximum level ranging 1 9 m bgl at the three sites closest to the city centre and deeper 19 34 m bgl at sites towards the outskirts fig 9b daily groundwater level fluctuations are highly variable across sites but can be categorized into group a sites that experience high and rapid fluctuations iisc yelahanka nimhans and group b sites that show little daily fluctuations cubbon park lalbagh park bangalore university because rapid changes in groundwater level are most commonly caused by nearby groundwater abstractions it can be assumed that group a is more directly influenced by anthropogenic head changes while group b reflects a more undisturbed condition the extremely rapid drawdown in some of the boreholes level decrease of up to 3 5 m in 15 min is indicative of a high fracture connectivity and low storage in this part of the aquifer the maximum daily water level in bengaluru decreased by 1 5 m in the dry season and showed no strong overall trends but possibly some downward tendency at two sites iisc and lalbagh groundwater levels in tg halli fig 9b were only monitored from september 2017 to end of march 2018 which coincides with the pre monsoon water sampling water levels are much deeper than those in bengaluru with averages ranging 79 to 148 m bgl these levels may have dropped somewhat lower in the summer months that are not included in this dataset the strong variation in groundwater levels between sites corresponds well to previous studies ballukraya and srinivasan 2019 three of the five monitored sites indicated by the black lines fig 9b show much more rapid level increases after strong rainfalls in september to november 2017 fig 9a which is indicative of rapid fracture flow into these boreholes in berambadi groundwater levels show a distinct regional gradient with the shallowest average groundwater level 14 m bgl at the westernmost site and deepest average level 62 m bgl at the easternmost location which corresponds to observations from previous studies e g buvaneshwari et al 2017 collins et al 2020 sharma et al 2018 the monitored sites exhibit a temporal trend with post monsoon peak levels in november 2017 and a gradual decline until the onset of the new recharge in may 2018 compared to bengaluru and tg halli the seasonal groundwater level declines are more pronounced with a drop of 13 15 m from the peak level in november 2017 to the lowest recorded level in april 2018 4 discussion 4 1 evidence of connectivity of the deeper basement aquifer to modern recharge processes the observed lack of strong correlations between isotopic ratios or no3 concentrations with borehole depth in all study areas fig 3 is indicative of a well mixed system and the detection of typical anthropogenic pollutants such as no3 in high concentrations even at greater depth indicates that recharge is modern these findings are in accordance with a parallel study by collins et al 2020 who demonstrated by means of a range of hydrogeochemical techniques including the residence time tracer cfc a high degree of lateral and vertical connectivity in the berambadi catchment for example a homogenously high concentration of cfcs in both shallow and deep monitoring boreholes in this study was found indicative of recent recharge and of a well mixed groundwater system without clear vertical stratification however depending on the number and position of intercepted fractures borehole casings in the study area are usually cased down to the base of the weathered zone which likely ranges between 15 and 60 m bgl and open bores from thereon a water sample may represent an integrated sample with contributions from shallower fractures in the upper part of the fresh rock potentially overlaying chemical signatures from deeper fractures it can be concluded that the deeper basement aquifer has a component of modern recharge in all investigated catchments with either fractures or the boreholes acting as preferential pathways 4 2 comparison of relative contribution of tank recharge to other sources the variability of isotopic ratios in the groundwater samples from bengaluru fig 2 and supplementary material table s2 indicates that groundwater recharge in the urban setting is influenced by multiple sources including mains leakage urban runoff and drainage and infiltration from rainfall and surface waters conceptualized in fig 10 as expected for the complex urban setting hydraulic heads in the monitored boreholes demonstrated distinct patterns ranging from sites with little daily fluctuations cubbon park lalbagh park bangalore university to sites with high and rapid fluctuations iisc yelahanka nimhans fig 9 from a monitoring perspective these strong head changes at bengaluru highlight that manual monitoring in low storage fractured aquifers is best undertaken by taking a series of measurements over time to ensure that a representative water level is recorded monitored boreholes in areas with a higher density of the piped water supply system that delivers mainly water from the cauvery river as potable water supply generally exhibited shallow groundwater levels typically about 1 m bgl lalbagh and cubbon park the shallower groundwater level is likely caused by substantial recharge from the piped mains water network this is in accordance with other recent studies sekhar et al 2018 tomer et al 2021 the similar isotopic signature fig 4 and cl br ratios in inner city tanks piped water and groundwater fig 8 also point to a strong connection between these waters with tanks possibly being recharged by the shallow groundwater in the post monsoon season pre monsoon most groundwater levels were below the assumed average tank depth and tanks would be expected to lose water through infiltration and potentially recharge groundwater fig 10a however assumed flow is not based on precise monitoring of the tank water level and a more detailed study would be necessary to clearly identify the predominant flow direction in either case however connections and exchange of tank piped and groundwater in the inner city area is of high likelihood in the outskirts tank water is mainly fed by direct rainfall and runoff as well as treated and partially untreated sewage collected in drainage canals indicated by a higher pollutant load of these sites e g cl and to a lesser extent by the sparser mains system fig 10b this conceptualization is supported by strong post monsoonal similarity between tank water and the amount weighted average rainfall composition in the outskirts and conversely the stronger post monsoonal similarity of isotopic composition in tank waters with piped water and groundwater in the inner city areas fig 4 in the rural catchments tg halli and berambadi recharge pathways differ from the urban city in regards to a lack of water mains and the additional recharge from irrigation return flow fig 11 the rural groundwaters show higher spatial similarity in isotopic compositions e g lower standard deviations across the sample groups see supplementary material table s2 than groundwaters in bengaluru and very similar isotopic composition to the amount weighted average rainfall fig 2 this could indicate that the majority of groundwater recharge in the rural catchments is constituted either by rainfall or considering that most of this area is highly irrigated also by usually slightly more evaporated return flow from irrigated agriculture the latter is indicated by the higher evaporative change in rural groundwaters significant increase in d excess in the pre monsoon compared to bengaluru no significant change wilcoxon rank sum test supplementary material figure s1 the analysis of the cl br ratios showed groundwater samples with relatively constant cl br ratio but with a high range of cl concentrations indicative for mixing of low cl pristine groundwater with a high cl endmember for tg halli fig 8 in berambadi a typical mixing line of groundwater with an endmember with higher cl and higher cl br could be observed this mixing with cl rich water is a good indication that irrigation return flows which typically have increased cl from agrochemical inputs could be the dominant recharge source high no3 concentrations further corroborate this conclusion even though potential recharge from berambadi tanks is somewhat spatially distributed because nearby farms may supply water from the tank to fields via drainage channels collins et al 2020 this neither creates an isotopic signal in the groundwaters nor is there indication from the cl br analysis that much mixing of tank water and groundwater is taking place tank waters mostly had higher cl br but lower cl and no mixing line with tanks as endmember could be identified thus this indicates that much of the infiltrated water from tanks is lost within the unsaturated zone for example by lateral flow processes and evapotranspiration scanlon and cook 2002 and is therefore not significantly adding to groundwater recharge this finding is in contrast to those from investigations using recharge estimations based on water level fluctuation methods kumar et al 2017 and studies relating tank density to groundwater levels chowdhury and behera 2018 which observed higher groundwater levels near tanks however in both of these studies it is not clear if the higher water levels can be attributed to groundwater recharge by tanks or to other factors such as decreased groundwater abstractions in areas with higher surface water availability i e tanks or higher water storage from tanks in the vadose zone i e less need for irrigation previous studies have calculated percolation efficiencies of tanks defined as the percolated fraction of tank water depletion over a given time period of 35 68 boisson et al 2014 massuel et al 2014 metha and jain 1997 perrin et al 2012 singh et al 2004 sukhija et al 1997 however little is known about how much of the infiltrated water actually recharges groundwater as not all water lost through the base of a tank can be expected to reach the groundwater table but may be stored in the vadose zone or taken up by evapotranspiration boisson et al 2014 de vries and simmers 2002 a rare study using water level data in combination with water isotopes and chemical data to estimate recharge sources concluded that rainfall was the main source of recharge with only marginal recharge from a nearby tank saha et al 2013 thus a revised approach to directly estimate water fluxes below tanks may be beneficial for example by more local scale studies using environmental tracers as suggested by boisson et al 2014 combined with water level observations regardless of the recharge rate beneath individual tanks in the context of the landscape as a whole tanks cover small areas especially in urban setting where they are encroached on for development and hence their overall contribution to recharge may always be limited but yet it will be a useful endeavour to quantify better the unit area impacts of tanks for example we did not see significant trends of conservative tracers stable isotopes and cl pearson correlation in groundwater with distance from tanks and we estimated a recharge contribution only 2 6 from tank waters in tg halli based on a two end member mixing for d excess because of constraints on the regional data availability for example only a one year amount weighted rainfall average was obtained for this study and data on variations in tank surface areas and tank levels storage for the three regions are not available there is some uncertainty in these results and it may go beyond this study to define a per unit area value of tank recharge however a more specifically designed monitoring network with site specific installation of deeper monitoring boreholes of varying distance from tanks could provide further details on whether significant trends of conservative tracers might be detectable on smaller scales we therefore propose that studies following a hydrochemical approach as presented here combined with more site specific monitoring networks as for example outlined in knappett et al 2012 and stahl et al 2014 could be informative for the future 4 3 contamination risks posed by tanks and other sources to groundwater distinct hydrochemical patterns were observed in bengaluru e g mg and cl hotspots near kaikondrahalli tank and vrishabhavathi river and higher concentrations of no3 near lalbagh tank while contamination in the rural catchments seemed more widespread in bengaluru increased concentrations of cl were present in tank water and groundwaters and the dominating 1 1 molar ratio of na cl fig 7a and very high cl br ratio fig 8a indicates that cl contamination is related to anthropogenic sources such as effluent from households and industry alcal√° and custodio 2008 increased levels of cl were found in particular in the western outskirts of bengaluru around kaikondrahalli tank and our conceptualized model indicates that the lower groundwater levels and lower density of mains network i e lower dilution of infiltrated tank water by mains leakage will increase the risks to surface water quality this holds true for tanks but in particular also for larger perennial drainage systems such as the vrishabhavathi river which was found to have high concentrations of k so4 cl and hco3 also indicative of anthropogenic pollution in the city centre water levels were extremely shallow in the wetter part of the year and recharge mixing of tank water with mains leakage will substantially reduce the impact of tanks on groundwater recharge however it should be noted that post monsoon samples from the piped water showed high no3 concentrations up to 19 7 mg l no3 with a median of 15 2 mg l considering that most of the piped water is imported from the cauvery river which flows through agricultural areas it needs to be considered if the imported piped water might be introducing agricultural pollutants into the groundwater system similar to bengaluru high cl concentrations were detected in tg halli groundwaters seasonal median up to 168 4 mg l and berambadi seasonal median up to 76 8 for comparison buvaneshwari et al 2020 only detected cl concentration of mostly 10 mg l in a neighbouring more pristine area in similar geological setting and at a close distance to the berambadi catchment therefore the higher concentrations in berambadi compared to its neighbouring area are unlikely to be of natural origin the most likely cause of this are applied fertilizers e g mg no3 2 ca no3 2 kcl or mgcl2 from which no3 and cl are leached into the groundwater during the monsoon season buvaneshwari et al 2020 this could also explain the higher concentrations of mg in the rural catchments especially post monsoon in berambadi no3 concentrations exceeding the bis dwl drinking water limit of 45 mg l were detected most frequently 85 of all groundwater samples in berambadi with a peak concentration of 446 mg l table s5 supplementary material this is slightly higher than observed in the same catchment by buvaneshwari et al 2017 who detected peak concentrations of 360 mg l and average concentrations of 77 mg l in september 2012 and 75 mg l in june 2013 average concentrations in this study were somewhat higher with 133 mg l post monsoon october 2017 and 113 mg l pre monsoon april 2018 which shows an upward trend in nitrate pollution in recent years and re iterates that better nutrient and irrigation management is crucial to prevent further deterioration of the region s groundwater quality sharma et al 2018 5 conclusions a suite of chemical analyses stable isotopes water chemistry of samples from piped water sourced mainly from the cauvery river surface waters tank water and river water and groundwater in three catchments set in the crystalline basement of the cauvery basin karnataka india was undertaken to investigate recharge patterns and pathways the three catchments comprised the urban area of bengaluru city the state capital and rural areas with higher levels of agricultural activity north of bengaluru tg halli and the berambadi catchment in southern karnataka the focus of this study was to use hydrochemical tracers to see if significant groundwater recharge from tank water water from artificial lakes could be identified within the groundwater system the distinct isotopic ratios and hydrochemistry between tank water and groundwaters at most sites and especially in the rural catchments observed in this study suggest that these are suitable tracers of tank water recharge the groundwater chemistry results indicate that tank recharge is of limited importance to regional groundwater recharge and quality in rural areas where recharge from precipitation and groundwater recycling from irrigation dominate the recharge signal in the urban setting bengaluru impermeable surfaces increased the relative effect of recharge from point sources such as tanks and rivers but where present pipe leakage from public water supply accounted for the majority of recharge location specific differences could be observed e g between the city centre where shallow groundwater levels are predominant and groundwater as well as mains water leakage is likely to interact and possibly recharge tanks and the outskirts of bengaluru this means that to sensibly estimate recharge by tank water site specific information especially on water level fluctuations and alternative recharge sources needs to also be considered additional studies to quantify tank recharge and revisions to the current guidelines for national groundwater recharge estimations using a less generalised approach are recommended to avoid over estimating the role tanks play in groundwater recharge groundwater contamination in bengaluru from different sources was observed with distinct regional patterns e g cl and mg hotspots near kaikondrahalli tank and vrishabhavathi river and higher concentrations of no3 near lalbagh tank due to the shallow water levels in bengaluru s inner city and slight indication of recharge from tank water in the outskirts tanks in bengaluru could be a possible source of contamination due to vertical infiltration to groundwater in the dry season in the rural catchments especially berambadi contamination was more ubiquitous particularly regarding agricultural pollutants the exceedance of dwls by no3 in the rural catchments is likely the impact of diffuse recharge under fertilized areas with tanks posing a negligible risk to groundwater quality

8556,drought is a complex natural phenomenon which is challenging to define and to describe quantitatively canonical drought propagation scheme meteorological agricultural or soil related hydrological does not always reflect the reality in a catchment thus it is necessary to include compound or cascading effects of precipitation soil moisture and discharge interactions on different time scales to get a comprehensive picture on the drought characteristics as well as on its development and recovery we studied the linkage between droughts over multiply temporal scales and severity levels using various statistical methods for a case study of a small forested catchment in germany it was found that indeed different types of droughts are highly interconnected and their behavior can significantly differ from the classical scheme a simple empirical approach gives frequencies seasonality and trends of various combinations of droughts it showed that among all types the test site is mostly exposed to a light hydro meteorological one especially in autumn months with an increasing trend multivariate distributions can be used to evaluate joint probabilities and return periods of drought components it was revealed that the well known european drought in 2018 was also presented as an extreme case of a joint hydro meteo soil drought in the examined catchment by markov chains one can analyze the transition and persistence between droughts well established propagation pathways between different types and severity levels of droughts with high persistence for longer droughts were found for the study area keywords meteorological drought hydrological drought soil drought catchment compound event statistics 1 introduction the water balance of small catchments in humid climates is much more dynamic compared to large watersheds it exhibits higher fluctuations within a year and is much more vulnerable to extreme behavior of external drivers e g spatiotemporal variability of precipitation even a short term shortage of water in the system on a small scale can significantly change its sensible water balance and trigger drought development thus effecting the health of vegetation endangering river ecosystems and limiting groundwater recharge one of the common stumbling blocks in the study of a drought is an absence of its universal definition in the ideal case the term should be region based and application specific usually the indicators to identify a drought are divided into qualitative e g descriptive and linguistic definitions of degree of severity and quantitative obtained with statistical analysis ones a holistic drought identification and classification should include type intensity duration spatial extent impact on ecosystem and society only with consideration of all these aspects a fully objective picture on the drought could be drawn tate and gustard 2000 as information on the possible impacts is often site specific thus non transferable and sometimes tricky to obtain this study will focus on the first quantitative aspects of drought due to the ambiguity of a possible definitions and unclear interactions between various drought factors and components several researchers noticed the complexity of adequate multivariate drought characterization hao and singh 2015 kao and govindaraju 2010 although many different definitions of a drought phenomenon exist e g fao 1983 gumbel 1963 palmer 1965 schneider et al 2011 wmo 1986 there is a general agreement on the classification of drought types ams 2004 dracup et al 1980 mishra and singh 2010 wilhite and glantz 1985 a i meteorological drought is related to the deficit of precipitation over an extended period of time and is the origin of the other drought types the second type is usually named as an ii agricultural drought also sometimes referred to as soil drought it represents the lack of water to meet the needs of crop production or plant growth in general this means the deficit of root zone soil moisture and thus could be applicable to forested catchments as well where soil droughts could be both less hoyos et al 2019 and more hudson 1988 pronounced comparing to grassland and agricultural catchments a iii hydrological drought is related to deficits of surface and subsurface water meaning below normal ground water storage and streamflow however sometimes these two components are treated as separate drought type although the co occurrence and interactions between these drought types could be referred to a compound or cascading drought field et al 2012 we want to omit this term here as the main driver precipitation remains the same for all three types and in most of the cases the compound drought is considered as a drought with a heatwave zscheischler et al 2020 while a lot of recent studies follow classical cascading meteorological agricultural hydrological drought scheme bhardwaj et al 2020 wang et al 2016 yao et al 2020 yu et al 2020 the interactions spatial and temporal between these drought types in a joint way and recovery from water deficit are not well captured yet loon and laaha 2015 moreover the drought behavior is to a varying degree controlled by climate and the catchment itself haslinger et al 2014 loon and laaha 2015 van lanen et al 2013 thus different time scales and severity levels should be studied in order to detect the influence of climate and catchment characteristics on the interaction between drought types as well as on the drought propagation and recovery furthermore studies showed a potential to increase in general exposure frequency duration and severity of droughts as well as a higher chances of cascading or compounding effect by combination with other drivers e g heatwave in the future due to a regional climate change aghakouchak et al 2020 2014 field et al 2012 hao et al 2018a manning et al 2019 vogel et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 therefore it is important to continue and expand research of this topic in order to narrow methodological and knowledge gaps with regard to extremes and their impacts on nature and human society hoegh guldberg et al 2018 both models and statistics are used to explore the relationship between components of connected extreme events raymond et al 2020 while some researchers have recently started to include conceptual and physical based simulations in their studies van den hurk et al 2015 kew et al 2013 pasquier et al 2018 zscheischler et al 2018 statistical methods still serve as state of the art tools hao et al 2018b the empirical frequency approach is a relatively simple and thus currently the most commonly applied method to study the variability e g occurrence frequency trend analysis of joint drought events aghakouchak et al 2014 beniston 2009 hirschi et al 2010 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 mueller and seneviratne 2012 multivariate distribution is yet another widespread method it allows to build i e a theoretical copula model e g copula based on the extremes interdependency and assess joint behavior beyond available data range beersma and buishand 2004 kwon et al 2019 manning et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2020 zscheischler et al 2017 finally an autoregressive model which can be represented by a markov process could reveal dynamical behavior or successions like transition and persistence which cannot be determined by simply analyzing the changes in the number of extremes sattar et al 2020 sedlmeier et al 2016 tokarczyk and szali≈Ñska 2014 yeh and hsu 2019 eventually no research was found on the simultaneous application of different statistical methods in order to gain a comprehensive information on a linkage between hydrological variables of drought in a catchment moreover it should be noticed that the recent research in this field mostly refers to large scales i e big areas or gridded data and overlook the drought study on regional or local scales of small catchments scales at which typically risk reduction measures are implemented gibson et al 2020 thus the focus of this work is to study interconnections between different drought types on a catchment scale from various perspectives with a set of abovementioned statistical methods in a case study specifically this includes a definition of droughts their frequency analysis a study of joint behavior of extremes and finally an investigation on the transition between drought types and their severity levels the research questions states as following do time scale severity and seasonality influence the occurrence of different drought types in a small catchment how different are univariate and joint return periods of extreme drought events could interconnections and development of different drought types exhibit patterns of a markov process 2 study site and data the wernersbach catchment is located in the northern part of tharandt forest 20 km south west from dresden in the lower altitudes of the eastern ore mountains saxony germany fig 1 it has a mean elevation of around 370 m asl and a drainage area of 4 6 km2 observations of various hydrological meteorological canopy and soil parameters are conducted by the technische universit√§t dresden since 1966 dresden and institut f√ºr hydrologie und meteorologie 2016 the catchment is an oval shaped and has an average slope of 0 25 the channel network is mainly presented by the wernersbach creek itself length 3 2 km slope 0 03 its main left tributary triebenbach length 2 1 km slope 0 04 and a few other small creeks and ditches without naming the land cover is dominated by dense coniferous approximately 70 norway spruce old forests gr√ºnwald and bernhofer 2007 highly variable bedrock geology gneiss rhyolite sandstones and claystones from the lower cretaceous basalt forms a mosaic of diverse soil types mostly dystric cambisols podsols and stagnosols with an average depth of around 1 m and rooting zone of around 35 cm gr√ºnwald and bernhofer 2007 schw√§rzel et al 2009 the site is characterized by a sub oceanic sub continental climate with mean annual air temperature of 7 8 c and mean annual precipitation of 925 mm wernersbach creek possesses a pronounced seasonality in its flow regime while the mean annual runoff is around 0 03 m3 s and the monthly mean values vary from 0 016 m3 s september to 0 06 m3 s march observed maximum daily discharge exceeds 4 1 m3 s 2002 08 12 and occasionally channel flow can be almost interrupted in july and august i e 2018 2015 1976 2003 with low flow less than 0 0005 m3 s in the study precipitation p soil moisture sm and discharge q were used as associates of meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought respectively daily values of total precipitation were taken as an arithmetic mean from local meteorological gauges cyan circles on fig 1 and discharge data was picked up from wernersbach gauge blue triangle on fig 1 50 58 39 0 n 13 29 17 3 e precipitation is measured with hellman gauges these observations are corrected for wetting and wind drift errors karbaum 1969 richter 1995 runoff both surface and subsurface is collected with a concrete dam which blocks the creek valley until the bedrock there a standard v shaped weir is installed total discharge values then are derived from stage recordings due to poor coverage of the catchment with soil moisture sensors and inconsistency of observations it was decided to use modelled soil moisture it was simulated with the calibrated 1 d physically based lumped water balance model brook90 federer 2002 luong et al 2018 the model has a special focus on a detailed representation of vertical water fluxes within the soil water plant system at a single site the movement of the water in the system begins with the precipitation input which could directly go to the streamflow be intercepted by the canopy and stored on the ground or infiltrate into the soil soil water movement is described within multiple layers by saturated and unsaturated matrix flow and macropore flow using richard s equation available water in the soil matrix is decreasing by four major processes plant transpiration or soil evaporation groundwater recharge or streamflow discharge is modelled in a simplified way via surface and sub surface downslope flow without routing for the model setup precipitation data was taken from catchment stations while temperature global radiation relative humidity and wind speed are measured on nearby grillenburg climate station red circle on fig 1 50 57 n 13 29 e 385 m asl physically meaningful canopy and soil parameters were assigned based on existing on site measurements and the model documentation for the calibration only the flow parameters responsible for partitioning of water downward water fluxes into quick surface matrix macropore bypass downslope and groundwater flow were used more details on the model and its parameters used in the study are presented as supplementary material see data and code section as gapless discharge and precipitation records start from in january 1968 and as the model needs a warm up period it was decided to exclude the whole year of 1968 from the initial data collection thus it resulted in 51 years of data 1969 2019 for all three variables of interest 3 methods 3 1 statistical drought definition via normalization of meteorological and hydrological characteristics one of the most common procedure to define a meteorological drought from a statistical perspective is to use the standardized precipitation index spi or its variations mckee et al 1993 spi calculations are based on at least 30 year long precipitation records aggregated for the desired period of interest normally between 1 and 24 months a theoretical probability distribution function is fitted separately for each month to this data then it is transformed into a standard normal distribution world meteorological organization 2012 therefore the spi index represents deviations from the median antecedent precipitation positive or negative spi values are associated with respectively greater or lesser than median precipitation periods although this method was initially designed for precipitation it can be eventually also applied to other variables like discharge and soil moisture for example commonly allied standardized streamflow index ssi uses the same principle but typically other theoretical distributions vicente serrano et al 2012 some researchers often apply other statistical methodologies to derive drought indicators for discharge i e pathak et al 2016 soil moisture i e samaniego et al 2013 or even calculate multivariate composite drought indexes kao and govindaraju 2010 however for the sake of methodological utility we decided to apply one uniform methodology principle used in spi calculation for soil moisture as well smi conventionally a gamma distribution is fitted to precipitation time series though some researchers stagge et al 2015 svensson et al 2017 recommend to check for other possibilities due to spatial patterns in precipitation data therefore we used akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 and bayesian information criteria bic schwarz 1978 and maximum likelihood parameter estimation method to decide on the best distribution out of the following list normal lognormal logistic gamma weibull loglogistic pearson iii gumbel in case of the same or close aic and bic values a visual inspection of the cumulative distribution functions cdf was conducted and the one with the better fit of the lower tail was chosen for the fitting of univariate distributions fitdistrplus r package delignette muller and dutang 2015 was used the selection of the best distribution was done separately for each variable month and five commonly applied aggregation periods 1 3 6 9 12 months backwards in the end the most frequent distribution function was picked up for each pair of variable and aggregation periods for example for the 9 month discharge aggregations gamma distributions was the best choice for winter spring and summer months while lognormal would serve better for the fall months thus gamma distribution was assigned to ssi9 in the end the following distributions were used weibull gamma and lognormal for precipitation lognormal and gamma for discharge and weibull for soil moisture to classify various drought types the original spi classification in combination with thresholds was adjusted world meteorological organization 2012 1 5 1 0 as dry 2 0 1 5 as very dry and 2 0 as extreme dry conditions it was assumed that values of derived precipitation discharge and soil moisture indices below abovementioned thresholds respectively refer to meteorological hydrological and soil moisture droughts of different severity thus the severity class moderate is associated with dry severe with very dry and extreme with extreme dry conditions for the non drought normal conditions 1 0 interval was used it should be noticed that in the context of the presented study the spi concept itself possesses certain drawbacks at first as it normalizes the data based on monthly distribution fittings all conclusions on a possible seasonality dominance of a certain drought type will be speculative due to the arbitrariness of the resulting dominant season for example in the presence of sufficiently long time series frequencies should be uniformly distributed over the months and thus seasons secondly if a seasonality is present in the hydrological cycle of the study area the interpretation of the results can be ambiguous for instance the drought classified with the same spi values for winter and summer refers to different absolute precipitation and thus has different impacts from single and joint type drought in the catchment therefore a second alternative tatistical drought definition was additionally introduced using quantile approach namely threshold level method tallaksen et al 2004 by replacement of spi thresholds with empirical ones calculated as empirical quantiles from the original data with the same aggregation periods 1 3 6 9 12 months backwards but unlike in spi approach without a separation by months one can address the both aforementioned spi shortages among all the methods existing for estimation of the empirical quantiles we choose one which give approximately median unbiased results regardless the distribution hyndman and fan 1996 as all three variables show different best fit distributions to account for the comparability of two approaches the same severity thresholds were applied thus the empirical quantiles of 0 1587 0 0668 and 0 0228 probabilities respectively correspond to the z scores of standard normal distribution represented with spi thresholds 1 1 5 and 2 these quantiles are applied afterwards to non transformed original data to assign drought periods additionally we want to point out that even in a presence of relatively long time series the uncertainty of the drought definition from low quantile subsets can be very high for example according to link et al 2020 if analyzing even 100 year time series the confidence intervals for low quantiles could be so high that spi approach could easily misclassify severely dry 2 1 5 and extremely dry 2 conditions simultaneous occurrence of different single droughts 1d types was named as 2d e g meteorological and hydrological and 3d meteorological hydrological and soil and assigned as following for a drought of a certain severity class with joint types all associated variables should be lower than the associated severity thresholds for example if only one variable out of two exceeds an extreme threshold while the other one remains above light but below the moderate class the drought was still be classified as a light one 3 2 empirical approach the method is based on the counting of the frequency of multiple extremes hao et al 2018b which simultaneously over or undergo of a certain threshold in this study a univariate individual extreme was defined with a specific threshold value which was obtained either as an empirical quantile or as a conventional value of normalized metrics e g spi world meteorological organization 2012 as mentioned in section 3 1 afterwards these thresholds were used to obtain the frequency of joint extreme events based on the co occurrence of individual extremes within a season or a year with a presence of relative small time series length it is possible that the obtained frequencies of joint types of droughts and all possible interconnections between them are random to account for this problem a bootstrapping approach was applied thus each obtained frequency value of a certain drought type was checked if it can be reproduced accidently the single values from the original monthly data were resampled with replacement for each variable and aggregation period separately to destroy all possible correlations between variables afterwards the same frequency analysis was conducted by repeating this procedure 1000 times we obtained a relatively large sample of random frequencies for the respective drought type thus it was assumed that if the original frequency obtained from the real data was higher than 95th quantile obtained from the abovementioned sample the frequency value was significant kew et al 2013 khanal et al 2019 the uncertainty of the drought frequencies was quantified with regard to the choice of the distribution itself for this we tested how the frequencies of 1d droughts of different types aggregation periods and severity levels calculated with different theoretical distribution applied as the same for all aggregation periods functions deviate from each other additionally the obtained frequencies for univariate drought were compared with theoretical frequencies derived from standard normal distribution world meteorological organization 2012 these yield to 11 for moderate 5 3 for severe and 2 0 months decade for extreme drought further a monotonic time trend and its significance were tested using a slope of a linear regression model and a modified for a serial correlation mann kendall test with significance level according to p value 0 05 kendall 1948 mann 1945 yue and wang 2004 the results from the tests were aggregated in the following categories in case the slope and the mann kendall tests both gave significant results the trend was called very significant in case only one of the two statistics is significant the trend was labeled significant and if none of them is significant insignificant the direction of the trend was accounted with the sign of the slope to ensure a sufficient number of points to estimate the trend only those drought combinations type aggregation severity were considered which yield to a total number of at least 15 events as quite often droughts do not appear every year thus frequency for these years is 0 it was decided to base calculations on a 5 year sums window this procedure ensures a time series with almost no zero members which is indeed shorter but more reliable for the trend analysis additionally the agreement between two drought identification approaches was analyzed utilizing binary drought and no drought time series therefore sub division on the severity classes was neglected based on the binary time series hit rates were calculated as the percentage of the cases when both approaches showed the same conditions over the whole data series finally the drought seasonality was addressed with the analysis of the most dominant season per drought type and aggregation period here we restricted the dominance to the value of minimum 30 as the aggregation period as well as the drought duration often exceed season duration e g 3 months in all cases the season was assigned to the last month of the calculated index e g if spi9 for july was classified as drought season was assigned as summer to ensure reliable sample size analysis was conducted for the combinations with at least 15 drought occurrences 3 3 multivariate distribution with copulas an important part of multivariate analysis application is the fitting of both marginal and joint distributions for the marginal we used the list of distributions from section 3 1 we derived distribution parameters by the maximum likelihood estimates the best distribution was chosen based on aic and bic for two random variables x and y with defined marginal distributions m x and m y the joint cumulative distribution function f namely probability p that both x and y will fall below x and y respectively can be expressed as a copula c with some parameters par nelsen 2006 sklar 1959 1 f x y p x x y y c m x m y p a r a variety of theoretical copula families exist which are commonly used for the construction of multivariate distributions showing different properties in dependence modeling i e symmetric or asymmetric lower or upper tail dependence hao et al 2018b one parameter and empirical copulas are the most widespread because of the simplicity of the fitting however two and more parameter copulas also occur in hydro meteorological studies fan et al 2017 the selection of a copula family and the parameter estimation were based on pseudo observations of the dependent variables u which for some random variable x are defined as a simple ranked normalization of each realization 2 u x r n 1 where r denotes the rank of x in x and n is the length of x the copula functions afterwards were chosen based on aic and bic for parameter estimation the canonical maximum likelihood method was used the return period rp of a given event is usually defined as the average time elapsing between its two successive realizations in the univariate case if a random variable x has distribution function m x the return period rp for a particular value x is defined as follows serinaldi 2015 3 r p x 1 1 m x in the bivariate case or multivariate in general two types of exceedance recurrence intervals usually occur salvadori et al 2007 one is based on the or exceedance of one more variables and the other on the and exceedance of both all variables joint probabilities in the context of co occurrence of extremes within this study bivariate and type joint probabilities were used with the corresponding rp 4 rp and x y 1 1 m x x m y y c u x x u y y to implement the method vinecopula schepsmeier et al 2018 and copula yan 2007 r packages were used we applied goodness of fit tests to detect whether an underlying marginal and joint probability distribution differs from a hypothesized one this was necessary since the choice of a distribution influences the estimated return period of an extreme drought and therefore propagates an uncertainty into the estimation process marginal distributions listed in section 3 1 were tested with non parametric kolmogorov smirnov test n smirnov 1948 and copulas list of the 10 best ones according to the aic and bic were tested with cramer von mises statistics genest et al 2009 both tests null hypothesis denote that the sample is drawn from the tested distribution thus with the significance level of 5 we listed all non rejected marginal and joint distribution functions then we construct multiply possible combinations and estimate univariate and joint return periods this yielded to a large sample of possible return period realizations from which we draw 5 and 95 quantile for each extreme drought case and thus giving us a 90 confidence interval for the estimated return period 3 4 markov chain in the study we used the simplest variation of the first order markov chain in that case the markov process is considered as a time and state discrete stochastic one and transition probabilities between different states of a variable x and fulfills the markov property levin and peres 2017 5 p x t 1 x t 1 x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x t x t p x t 1 x x t x t implying that the next state x t 1 of the examined sequence is only dependent on the current state x t from a markov chain a transition probability matrix p of the size m m can be calculated where m is number of unique states in the sequence and which consists of all possible conditional probabilities p x t 1 x x t x t between the different states for a homogeneous stationary markov chain the transition probability matrix is time independent and the empirical probabilities are estimated as following 6 p ij n ij j n ij where nij is the number of events with i th state occurred after j th state with the presence of overall time series shortage approximately 600 monthly values a robust estimation of transition probabilities for all the cross combinations is not possible and thus an additional significance criterion was utilized for this reason only transition persistence probabilities larger than the standard error se p ratio later on were considered significant this assumption allowed narrowing the transition paths and concluding on the most probable behavior of drought propagation in the catchment 4 results and discussion 4 1 empirical frequencies and seasonality of single and joint type droughts fig 2 illustrates the interactions between single and joint type droughts from time series plots for 1 6 and 12 month aggregation periods spi and quantile approaches depicted similar results except a clear difference in 1 and 6 month light droughts despite a chaotic behavior of 1 month drought fig 2a already starting on a 6 month aggregation period fig 2b distinctive droughts clusters are visible it is clear that while for the short aggregation periods negative anomalies of precipitation discharge and soil moisture rarely exceeded 4 6 months per year longer water shortages often last more than half of a year barker et al 2016 all types of droughts tend to group in groups of 2 3 years in a row 1975 1977 1982 1983 1990 1992 2004 2005 2018 2019 which becomes clear especially for a 12 month aggregation period fig 2c although hari et al 2020 point out that the consecutive drought in 2018 2019 was a special event for europe in general local studies show that previous drought years found for wernersbach were also reported in the whole region of saxony moreover almost all of them also formed a group of consecutive years h√§nsel and matschullat 2006 another important outcome is that in most of the cases all joint type droughts for 6 and 12 month aggregation period occurred simultaneously or with a lag of a few months and with similar severity and duration moreover for the joint droughts of 2004 2014 and 2018 a moderate and relatively short precipitation deficit caused much longer and extreme joint discharge and soil moisture shortage especially in 2018 which agree with other studies of european drought of 2018 hari et al 2020 to quantify agreement between the results of two methods to define a drought we calculated hit rates between them for both drought and no drought identification table 1 shows that for all droughts and aggregation periods the differences between spi and empirical quantile approaches are marginal and yield on average to less than 10 disagreement less agreement can be observed for soil and hydrological droughts for 1 and 6 month aggregation periods this might be explained by the skewness of the data and uncertainties of the fitted distribution while the smallest deviations of less than 1 were found for compound 12 month droughts most likely explained by the high proportion of no drought hits in a presence of an ongoing discussions of the different approaches of drought indexes calculations i e raible et al 2017 tijdeman et al 2020 weng et al 2015 our study showed from multiply perspectives that only a minor discrepancy appear between spi and quantile method with regard to drought frequency analysis empirical frequencies and trends of different drought types and their combinations from both spi and quantile approaches are shown in fig 3 here the calculated absolute frequencies were normalized as number of drought months per decade despite differences in the calculation both approaches to define droughts showed a similar frequency estimation the spi approach resulted in more scattered frequencies for the same drought type along the aggregation periods this might be explained by the uncertainty of the fitting or usage of non uniform distributions for different aggregation periods to transform the initial data according to fig a 1 1 the uncertainty due to the choice of the distribution function could be quite high for example in case of the hydrological and meteorological moderate 1 month drought the occurrence may vary from 5 to 15 months decade while for the soil drought deviations are smaller as the absolute frequencies for the extreme drought are not high themselves 1 3 months decade the estimated uncertainties are not high as well 1 2 the quantile method showed minor deviations in the frequencies 5 for all three single type droughts of the same severity fig 3a upper rows for single droughts which is indeed in the nature of the chosen empirical quantile estimator finally the results from both approaches showed consistency with the theoretical frequencies section 3 2 with a deviation of 1 2 months decade in general the number of detected single and joint type monthly droughts within the 1969 2019 period showed a sharp drop from moderate 9 12 and 4 9 months decade respectively to severe 4 8 and 0 6 6 months decade respectively and finally extreme 1 6 and 0 3 months decade respectively droughts the frequency values from both approaches were averaged over all aggregation periods for 1d 2d and 3d droughts respectively to compare to the proportion between the occurrences of single and joint droughts resulting ratio of 100 59 47 shows that 2d and 3d droughts tend to occur with the similar frequencies however if the different severity levels are taken into account it could be seen that extreme compound 2d and 3d droughts are much rarely detected 11 7 6 100 63 53 for moderate 100 59 41 for severe and 100 33 13 for extreme droughts with increasing severity the difference in frequencies between single and joint type droughts tend to increase thus extreme and severe droughts in the catchment tend to occur as multiple ones with the increase of the aggregation period the frequency of joint type droughts except hydro soil drought is generally increasing these results indicate that the study site is exposed in general to a light but long continuing compound water deficit between joint type droughts hydro soil droughts showed higher frequencies for moderate and severe class up to half year aggregation periods additionally it can be stated that all joint occurrences with frequency of more than one per decade were estimates as significant and non random both spi and quantile approach depicted close trend results for all moderate and single type severe droughts however the quantile approach resulted in a higher number of significant trends almost all significant results were found for moderate droughts however a few significant trends were traced also for severe and extreme drought conditions this can be explained by the small number of co occurrences for extreme and severe droughts and thus by shortage of time series length for the calculations significant positive trends were found for single type hydrological and soil droughts and associated joint type drought significant decreasing trends were discovered for more than six month meteorological droughts for moderate and severe conditions fig 3b lowest rows indeed they are so drastic that their influence could be tracked to the corresponding joint type droughts 2d and 3d thought with less significant trends a positive significant trend for extreme soil droughts is backed by long drought periods in 2004 and 2018 2019 fig 2 by removing 2018 2019 from the time series and repeating the analysis it was found that the effect of this severe drought of the trend direction is minor and almost all very significant and significant trends were still detected furthermore a trend balancing effect between severity classes for some droughts can be noticed namely decreasing trends in soil hydrological and joint hydro soil drought for severe class are compensated by the increasing trends due the growth of number of moderate droughts for the corresponding classes obtained results of multidirectional trends in meteorological hydrological and soil drought frequency are consistent with existing european studies for the study region although most of the researchers concentrated on larger scales cammalleri et al 2020 hanel et al 2018 spinoni et al 2015 stagge et al 2017 overall there is a tendency of direct influence of single on joint type drought trends in some cases two approaches show multidirectional trends for the same drought type and aggregation periods 22 however for all of them at least one of the trends was insignificant which makes possible conclusions on the difference between two methods with regard to trend analysis speculative finally the comparison of normalized frequency of the last decade 2010 2019 with the rest period 1969 2009 showed overall an increase of drought occurrence in the last decade fig 3b with an exception of moderate long droughts based on a negative precipitation trend it is visible that for the moderate drought the last decade frequency increases coincident with the trend direction while for the severe class it is the opposite this might be explained by the uncertainty of the estimated trend which arises from a low number of detected droughts due to short time series length in the presence of a pronounced seasonal hydrological cycle in the wernersbach catchment it was reasonable to conduct a drought seasonality analysis as mentioned in section 3 1 only the quantile approach in this context could provide meaningful results in general the catchment gets less precipitation and higher evaporation rates thus lower water fluxes in soil and less runoff in summer and fall season thus it would be obvious to assume that drought behaves in a similar manner indeed as it is shown in fig 4 short term 1 3 month single and joint type droughts mostly appeared during the fall months disregarded by a few exceptions for single soil and meteorological drought and seasonal dominance increased from single 35 50 to 3d drought 55 70 for longer aggregation periods no dominant season could be detected here the winter and summer months appear for all drought types except single soil and hydro soil the percentage of the season dominance decreases to 30 40 moreover these aggregation periods imply the accumulated water shortage of 12 months this means that an actual start of the drought could take place in another season however these results should be treated with caution due to the uncertainties of the short subset length and initial data transformations by distribution fitting 4 2 joint dependency and return periods of antecedent precipitation and soil moisture on annual low flows annual low flow extremes usually occur within the dry phase of the catchment hydrological cycle therefore under the general conditions of low precipitation amounts over some time the constantly depleting soil and groundwater storages become the main water source for the surface runoff in the wernersbach catchment low flow conditions normally appear from july to september exactly in almost the same period maximum monthly sums of precipitation are usually recorded however in many cases they are represented as relatively short events with high intensity convective precipitation which often does not deliver a substantial contribution to recharge due to relatively small infiltration rates thus this fact coupled with the high evapotranspiration rates usual for these months soil moisture and ground water storages possess low levels on a long term perspective in order to find a good correlation between annual monthly minimum flow soil moisture and precipitation for wernersbach the antecedent averaging periods between 1 and 15 months were tested with spearman rank correlation this correlation method was chosen due to skewed distributions of the variables fig 5 a shows a high and persistent correlation between low flow and antecedent soil moisture which starts with 0 75 for 1 month reaches maximum value of 0 84 for 4 month averaging and then constantly decrease with longer aggregation periods 0 56 for 15 months negative precipitation anomalies show a lower agreement with low flow here two peaks at 4 and 12 months with correlation of 0 56 and 0 49 respectively was observed a small bootstrapping experiment with multiply 30 year moving window subsets dotted lines on fig 5a and b confirmed that the general behavior of the whole time series is indeed not a random one but a specific feature of the catchment for a few bootstrapped time series a second weak peak in soil moisture and precipitation correlation for 12 months and third peak in precipitation correlation for 9 months appear these are exactly the subsets where the prolonged effect of the 2018 drought was present and where correlation with precipitation anomalies was even higher for longer aggregation periods highest correlations were found in a good agreement for both covariates at a 4 month aggregation period this period was used in the further analysis we found that lognormal distribution function for minimum discharge and weibull distribution function for soil wetness showed the best fit according to aic and bic further based on the transformed pseudo observations 49 pairs in total a 180 degree rotated gumbel copula was selected as the best based on aic and bic values the obtained multivariate distribution model was used to compute a joint and type non exceedance probability which is the probability of a simultaneous occurrence of both variables as it is depicted in fig 6 b 32 years 65 fell beyond 0 5 joint probability and 7 years 14 beyond 0 1 which is reliable for the tail asymmetric gumbel copula the relative difference between similar univariate pq and psw for discharge and soil wetness respectively and estimated joint pjoint probabilities in the middle part are 16 i e point pq 0 5 psw 0 5 pjoint 0 421 while close to the lower tail or rare probabilities it is already 25 i e point pq 0 01 psw 0 01 pjoint 0 00755 these facts indicate a worse agreement between variables in the lower tail in this case it implies that more severe low flow and soil moisture deficits are less likely to occur as a joint extreme in addition it could be seen that 10 000 random samples drawn from the fitted multivariate distribution grey dots follow quite well the observations over the whole range this confirms indirectly the choice of both univariate and bivariate distribution families fig 6a the peculiar vertical wall formed with random points in the fig 5a with a maximum value for soil moisture values around 110 mm are results of the copula and marginal fit based on the data points the latter were checked and it was revealed that indeed no higher values of antecedent soil moisture were found in modeled time series during low flow periods for the catchment return periods were estimated based on transformation of joint and marginal cumulative distribution functions thus an analysis on the observed and theoretical extremes could be conducted as it is shown in fig 7 a there are only few outstanding extremes presented in the observation among all 2018 had the highest return periods both univariate 216 years 110 years and joint 550 years when the flow fell below 0 5 mm which corresponds to 0 1 l s and soil moisture decreased to 94 mm which corresponds to soil wetness of 67 for the majority of the data points on the other side except for 1976 2000 2003 and 2019 the estimated joint return periods were found below 20 years it can be stated that the higher the exceedance return period is the more joint values are divergent from univariate ones this conclusion was drawn after analyzing the behavior of values above 10 years of joint return period furthermore it can be noticed that for univariate return periods above 50 year random simulations gray dots tend to appear closer to axes rather than on a diagonal 1 1 line thus rare joint extremes are more likely to occur as a combination of soil wetness with lower rp and low flow with higher rp or vice versa rather than with identical rps this conclusion however goes against the situation in extreme drought in 2003 and 2018 when both extreme events occurred simultaneously it might be caused by a lack of high quantile data and thus not distinctive low tail dependence for the robust copula fitting and should be treated with caution the results of the return period s uncertainty estimations for the most severe droughts of 2018 and 2003 are presented in table 2 the number of non rejected marginal and joint distributions combinations for the tested data yielded 150 years thus a sufficient sample size was available for the estimations of 5th and 95th rp quantiles here we see that the uncertainty of the joint rp is quite high and grows exponentially with the event severity especially observed for the upper rp confidence interval the joint uncertainty is likely driven by the uncertainty of the soil moisture marginal distribution fitting since the confidential intervals for the rps are much higher than for the discharge for both 2018 and 2003 events it is also interesting to mention that the estimated rp for soil moisture extremes tend to fall closer to the 5th quantile of uncertainty band while low flow extremes follow 95th quantile 4 3 persistence and transition between normal single and joint type drought conditions a markov chain approach was applied to study persistence and transition between normal and various drought conditions for that precipitation discharge and soil moisture anomalies derived from spi approach of 1 6 and 12 months were used markov chains were estimated for each aggregation period using the following possible eight states normal n one variable drought 1d two variable drought 2d and three variable drought 3d at first we analyses the transitions between drought types fig 8 and neglected severity classes therefore all droughts were assigned to moderate class normal conditions showed the highest frequency and persistence among all states increasing from 0 8 for short up to 0 94 for longer aggregation periods it can be seen that within a 1 month chain lots of possible significant pathways from normal state exist even directly to 3d drought while for a 12 month period possible transitions are quite narrow and seldom jump over drought levels fig 7a the observed pathway down from a normal state to 3d drought starts usually from a meteorological drought this is followed by hydro soil or meteo soil 2d droughts while a backwards transition occurs through hydro soil 2d and hydro 1d drought for 1 month duration an abrupt end of 3d drought and return to normal conditions is possible in 1 out of 10 cases high persistence values for single and joint type droughts of 6 and 12 months were found with the highest values for 3d droughts although for the single type droughts this resulted from typically higher autocorrelation for longer aggregation periods which is nature for the spi approach barker et al 2016 2016 wu and kinter 2009 no studies were found on the joint impact and implications for compound droughts thus we presume that this effect could highlight the self amplified compound character of long term drought conditions which normally occur over large areas and give a feedback to the atmosphere this effect was observed in both 2003 and 2018 when prolonged heat waves and precipitation shortages caused large vapor pressure deficits senf and seidl 2021 this in turn resulted in rapid and severe depletion of soil and groundwater storages and causing serious impact and changes in ecosystems this effect was also observed in forest sites which usually have much higher climatic buffering function in comparison to agricultural or grassland landscapes to withhold a stable hydrological regime and persist drought propagation buras et al 2020 schuldt et al 2020 yet another important aspect of joint type droughts can be studied with markov chains by the analysis of the transitions between severity levels fig 9 in contrast to the first markov chain analysis we classified here different droughts with severity thresholds but neglected the their types by aggregating total number of 1d and 2d droughts respectively in fig 8 one can conclude on transitions between 1d 2d and 3d droughts of different severity for a short monthly drought the transition from a normal state to a light single type drought showed the highest 0 11 probability however a direct change to a light or moderate 2d as well as light is also possible with probability of 0 02 fig 8a however the transition to joint type conditions most likely occurs from a light 1d to a light 2d drought which then either returns most probable to a normal state or increases the level to a 3d light drought the backward transition to a normal condition was found to be equally probable through a light or moderate 2d drought and then directly to a normal state by skipping 1d level or directly from 3d to normal state thus short aggregation periods can be characterized with rapid transitions and jumps between both drought classes and severity levels the half year aggregations showed similar to 1 month drought propagation except if the catchment suffered from a 2d light drought it had the same transition probability to normal and 3d light drought states and high probability of severity increase in 3d level here the backward transition to a normal state is already more likely to happen level by level through light severity rather than by jumps 12 month droughts should have the most and smooth conservative propagation paths among the studied one which is indeed what is observed for the study site interactions between 2d 3d and normal conditions occur almost explicitly through 1d light droughts the relationship and transformations between 2d and 3d droughts as well as the return paths were found in general the same as for 6 month aggregates the comparison of three aggregation periods revealed that with long term drought conditions higher persistence and predictability could be observed moreover the consistency between drought types tended to increase while the chaotic transitions and jumps between levels decreased the highest probability of transition to the most severe 3d drought was found for 6 month aggregates the way forward to 3d drought is most likely to occur through a light single and a 2d drought and then possible increase in severity while the backward paths usually started with a severity decrease at the same drought level and only then jumped to an upper level 5 conclusion in the presence of sufficient data statistical methods can indeed give us valuable quantitative characteristics on the linkage between natural processes in a catchment in this work the most common methods to study single and compound extremes were tested in order to describe 1d 2d and 3d droughts on a catchments scale namely meteorological hydrological and soil droughts and their mixture using well known technique of standardized indices e g spi monthly aggregates of precipitation soil moisture and discharge were transformed and droughts of various severities and lengths were identified with the empirical approach one can analyze the overall frequency seasonality and trends of all drought types further by fitting theoretical multivariate distribution one can study correlation between extremes and their joint probabilities as well as return periods finally a markov chain method examines the sequences of extreme states and allows studying other aspects of relationship of drought severity length and type this set of methods delivers a comprehensively sufficient statistical description of drought behavior in a catchment the case study of the wernersbach catchment in germany showed that according to an empirical approach no clear dominant single type drought could be revealed however among different joint type droughts types the hydro meteo one prevails furthermore it was found that the higher is the severity level the smaller is the difference between single and joint type drought frequencies moreover especially joint type droughts tend to form clusters of 2 3 years in time series for 6 and 12 month aggregation periods predominance of fall droughts was detected for majority of the drought types with short aggregation periods additionally multidirectional behavior of frequency trends for meteorological and other droughts was discovered the analysis of annual monthly low flow showed that it has highest correlation with four month assimilations of precipitation and soil moisture fitted copula showed good agreement with observations with decreasing convergence of joint and univariate probabilities towards extreme events the outstanding drought of 2018 formed by low flow and soil moisture shortage with estimated recurrence period of approximately 100 year and 200 year extremes respectively and had a joint return period of approximately 550 years which is far away from random non correlated processes further analysis showed however a high uncertainty of these estimations the evaluation of transition matrices between normal and various types of drought revealed well established and plausible transition paths from a normal to a 1d and further to a 2d and a 3d drought and then backwards moreover the transition and persistence probabilities increase for longer droughts it was found that the most probable transition to a 3d drought would occur via a light single type and a light 2d drought only after reaching the 3d drought a severity development will occur while returning to a normal state will require at first a reduction of the severity level and then a jump to the upper drought type level while a simple meteorological drought might not cause direct significant implications for the study site a soil and hydrological droughts could prolonged of soil moisture deficits in a shallow soiled catchment such as wernersbach could lead to severe vegetation stress and death especially for green forest understory lack of the water in the stream i e almost interrupted flow in 2018 cause illnesses and death of aquatic biota namely algae and fishery compound effect of abovementioned droughts could lead to drastic consequences since it effects the whole land vegetation atmosphere system and its ecosystem services generally these potential damages due to oppressed dying ecosystem lead to a substantial additional costs for the forest management more frequent monitoring reforestation fish stocking etc a clear outlook on which statistical methods described in the study are better or give more information is not possible since all of them possess different properties in the characterization and modeling of single and compound droughts over different temporal scales while empirical approach can give a general and broad overview on the what and when is happening multivariate distributions help to evaluate the co occurrence of extremes they also allow modeling their dependency beyond the observation range finally the transition matrix from markov chain method possesses a potential to serve as a forecasting instrument for compound droughts which is faster and simpler in comparison to traditional operational physically based models the method could serve as a decision support system for a forestry and land management as an ecosystem risk assessment tool thus we recommend basing a selection of a statistical approach on the aspects of compound drought one wants to deal with furthermore even in a presence of long term observations results from the statistical analysis especially for joint events should be treated with caution due to manifold of different sources of uncertainties 6 data and code initial raw data daily observations of hydrological and meteorological parameters

8556,drought is a complex natural phenomenon which is challenging to define and to describe quantitatively canonical drought propagation scheme meteorological agricultural or soil related hydrological does not always reflect the reality in a catchment thus it is necessary to include compound or cascading effects of precipitation soil moisture and discharge interactions on different time scales to get a comprehensive picture on the drought characteristics as well as on its development and recovery we studied the linkage between droughts over multiply temporal scales and severity levels using various statistical methods for a case study of a small forested catchment in germany it was found that indeed different types of droughts are highly interconnected and their behavior can significantly differ from the classical scheme a simple empirical approach gives frequencies seasonality and trends of various combinations of droughts it showed that among all types the test site is mostly exposed to a light hydro meteorological one especially in autumn months with an increasing trend multivariate distributions can be used to evaluate joint probabilities and return periods of drought components it was revealed that the well known european drought in 2018 was also presented as an extreme case of a joint hydro meteo soil drought in the examined catchment by markov chains one can analyze the transition and persistence between droughts well established propagation pathways between different types and severity levels of droughts with high persistence for longer droughts were found for the study area keywords meteorological drought hydrological drought soil drought catchment compound event statistics 1 introduction the water balance of small catchments in humid climates is much more dynamic compared to large watersheds it exhibits higher fluctuations within a year and is much more vulnerable to extreme behavior of external drivers e g spatiotemporal variability of precipitation even a short term shortage of water in the system on a small scale can significantly change its sensible water balance and trigger drought development thus effecting the health of vegetation endangering river ecosystems and limiting groundwater recharge one of the common stumbling blocks in the study of a drought is an absence of its universal definition in the ideal case the term should be region based and application specific usually the indicators to identify a drought are divided into qualitative e g descriptive and linguistic definitions of degree of severity and quantitative obtained with statistical analysis ones a holistic drought identification and classification should include type intensity duration spatial extent impact on ecosystem and society only with consideration of all these aspects a fully objective picture on the drought could be drawn tate and gustard 2000 as information on the possible impacts is often site specific thus non transferable and sometimes tricky to obtain this study will focus on the first quantitative aspects of drought due to the ambiguity of a possible definitions and unclear interactions between various drought factors and components several researchers noticed the complexity of adequate multivariate drought characterization hao and singh 2015 kao and govindaraju 2010 although many different definitions of a drought phenomenon exist e g fao 1983 gumbel 1963 palmer 1965 schneider et al 2011 wmo 1986 there is a general agreement on the classification of drought types ams 2004 dracup et al 1980 mishra and singh 2010 wilhite and glantz 1985 a i meteorological drought is related to the deficit of precipitation over an extended period of time and is the origin of the other drought types the second type is usually named as an ii agricultural drought also sometimes referred to as soil drought it represents the lack of water to meet the needs of crop production or plant growth in general this means the deficit of root zone soil moisture and thus could be applicable to forested catchments as well where soil droughts could be both less hoyos et al 2019 and more hudson 1988 pronounced comparing to grassland and agricultural catchments a iii hydrological drought is related to deficits of surface and subsurface water meaning below normal ground water storage and streamflow however sometimes these two components are treated as separate drought type although the co occurrence and interactions between these drought types could be referred to a compound or cascading drought field et al 2012 we want to omit this term here as the main driver precipitation remains the same for all three types and in most of the cases the compound drought is considered as a drought with a heatwave zscheischler et al 2020 while a lot of recent studies follow classical cascading meteorological agricultural hydrological drought scheme bhardwaj et al 2020 wang et al 2016 yao et al 2020 yu et al 2020 the interactions spatial and temporal between these drought types in a joint way and recovery from water deficit are not well captured yet loon and laaha 2015 moreover the drought behavior is to a varying degree controlled by climate and the catchment itself haslinger et al 2014 loon and laaha 2015 van lanen et al 2013 thus different time scales and severity levels should be studied in order to detect the influence of climate and catchment characteristics on the interaction between drought types as well as on the drought propagation and recovery furthermore studies showed a potential to increase in general exposure frequency duration and severity of droughts as well as a higher chances of cascading or compounding effect by combination with other drivers e g heatwave in the future due to a regional climate change aghakouchak et al 2020 2014 field et al 2012 hao et al 2018a manning et al 2019 vogel et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 therefore it is important to continue and expand research of this topic in order to narrow methodological and knowledge gaps with regard to extremes and their impacts on nature and human society hoegh guldberg et al 2018 both models and statistics are used to explore the relationship between components of connected extreme events raymond et al 2020 while some researchers have recently started to include conceptual and physical based simulations in their studies van den hurk et al 2015 kew et al 2013 pasquier et al 2018 zscheischler et al 2018 statistical methods still serve as state of the art tools hao et al 2018b the empirical frequency approach is a relatively simple and thus currently the most commonly applied method to study the variability e g occurrence frequency trend analysis of joint drought events aghakouchak et al 2014 beniston 2009 hirschi et al 2010 mazdiyasni and aghakouchak 2015 mueller and seneviratne 2012 multivariate distribution is yet another widespread method it allows to build i e a theoretical copula model e g copula based on the extremes interdependency and assess joint behavior beyond available data range beersma and buishand 2004 kwon et al 2019 manning et al 2018 ribeiro et al 2020 zscheischler et al 2017 finally an autoregressive model which can be represented by a markov process could reveal dynamical behavior or successions like transition and persistence which cannot be determined by simply analyzing the changes in the number of extremes sattar et al 2020 sedlmeier et al 2016 tokarczyk and szali≈Ñska 2014 yeh and hsu 2019 eventually no research was found on the simultaneous application of different statistical methods in order to gain a comprehensive information on a linkage between hydrological variables of drought in a catchment moreover it should be noticed that the recent research in this field mostly refers to large scales i e big areas or gridded data and overlook the drought study on regional or local scales of small catchments scales at which typically risk reduction measures are implemented gibson et al 2020 thus the focus of this work is to study interconnections between different drought types on a catchment scale from various perspectives with a set of abovementioned statistical methods in a case study specifically this includes a definition of droughts their frequency analysis a study of joint behavior of extremes and finally an investigation on the transition between drought types and their severity levels the research questions states as following do time scale severity and seasonality influence the occurrence of different drought types in a small catchment how different are univariate and joint return periods of extreme drought events could interconnections and development of different drought types exhibit patterns of a markov process 2 study site and data the wernersbach catchment is located in the northern part of tharandt forest 20 km south west from dresden in the lower altitudes of the eastern ore mountains saxony germany fig 1 it has a mean elevation of around 370 m asl and a drainage area of 4 6 km2 observations of various hydrological meteorological canopy and soil parameters are conducted by the technische universit√§t dresden since 1966 dresden and institut f√ºr hydrologie und meteorologie 2016 the catchment is an oval shaped and has an average slope of 0 25 the channel network is mainly presented by the wernersbach creek itself length 3 2 km slope 0 03 its main left tributary triebenbach length 2 1 km slope 0 04 and a few other small creeks and ditches without naming the land cover is dominated by dense coniferous approximately 70 norway spruce old forests gr√ºnwald and bernhofer 2007 highly variable bedrock geology gneiss rhyolite

around 35 cm gr√ºnwald and bernhofer 2007 schw√§rzel et al 2009 the site is characterized by a sub oceanic sub continental climate with mean annual air temperature of 7 8 c and mean annual precipitation of 925 mm wernersbach creek possesses a pronounced seasonality in its flow regime while the mean annual runoff is around 0 03 m3 s and the monthly mean values vary from 0 016 m3 s

flow less than 0 0005 m3 s in the study precipitation p soil moisture sm and discharge q were used as associates of meteorological agricultural and hydrological drought respectively daily values of total precipitation were taken as an arithmetic mean from local meteorological gauges cyan circles on fig 1 and discharge data was picked up from wernersbach gauge blue triangle on fig 1 50 58 39 0 n 13 29 17 3 e precipitation is measured with hellman gauges these observations are corrected for wetting and wind drift errors karbaum 1969 richter 1995 runoff both surface and subsurface is collected with a concrete dam which blocks the creek valley until the bedrock there a standard v shaped weir is installed total discharge values then are derived from stage recordings due to poor coverage of the catchment with soil moisture sensors and inconsistency of observations it was decided to use modelled soil moisture it was simulated with the calibrated 1 d physically based lumped water balance model brook90 federer 2002 luong et al 2018 the model has a special focus on a detailed representation of vertical water fluxes within the soil water plant system at a single site the movement of the water in the system begins with the precipitation input which could directly go to the streamflow be intercepted by the canopy and stored on the ground or infiltrate into the soil soil water movement is described within multiple layers by saturated and unsaturated matrix flow and macropore flow using richard s equation available water in the soil matrix is decreasing by four major processes plant transpiration or soil evaporation groundwater recharge or streamflow discharge is modelled in a simplified way via surface and sub surface downslope flow without routing for the model setup precipitation data was taken from catchment stations while temperature global radiation relative humidity and wind speed are measured on nearby grillenburg climate station red circle on fig 1 50 57 n

responsible for partitioning of water downward water fluxes into quick surface matrix macropore bypass downslope and groundwater flow were used more details on the model and its parameters used in the study are presented as supplementary material see data and code section as gapless discharge and precipitation records start from in january 1968 and as the model needs a warm up period it was decided to exclude the whole year of 1968 from the initial data collection thus it resulted in 51 years of data 1969 2019 for all three variables of interest 3 methods 3 1 statistical drought definition via normalization of meteorological and hydrological characteristics one of the most common procedure to define a meteorological drought from a statistical perspective is to use the standardized precipitation index spi or its variations mckee et al 1993 spi calculations are based on at least 30 year long precipitation records aggregated for the desired period of interest normally between 1 and 24 months a theoretical probability distribution function is fitted separately for each month to this data then it is transformed into a standard normal distribution world meteorological organization 2012 therefore the spi index represents deviations from the median antecedent precipitation positive or negative spi values are associated with respectively greater or lesser than median precipitation periods although this method was initially designed for precipitation it can be eventually also applied to other variables like discharge and soil moisture for example commonly allied standardized streamflow index ssi uses the same principle but typically other theoretical distributions vicente serrano et al 2012 some researchers often apply other statistical methodologies to derive drought indicators for discharge i e pathak et al 2016 soil moisture i e samaniego et al 2013 or even calculate multivariate composite drought indexes kao and govindaraju 2010 however for the sake of methodological utility we decided to apply one uniform methodology principle used in spi calculation for soil moisture as well smi conventionally a gamma distribution is fitted to precipitation time series though some researchers stagge et al 2015 svensson et al 2017 recommend to check for other possibilities due to spatial patterns in precipitation data therefore we used akaike information criteria aic akaike 1974 and bayesian information criteria bic schwarz 1978 and maximum likelihood parameter estimation method to decide on the best distribution out of the following list normal lognormal logistic gamma weibull loglogistic pearson iii gumbel in case of the same or close aic and bic values a visual inspection of the cumulative distribution functions cdf was conducted and the one with the better fit of the lower tail was chosen for the fitting of univariate distributions fitdistrplus r package delignette muller and dutang 2015 was used the selection of the best distribution was done separately for each variable month and five commonly applied aggregation periods 1 3 6 9 12 months backwards in the end the most frequent distribution function was picked up for each pair of variable and aggregation periods for example for the 9 month discharge aggregations gamma distributions was the best choice for winter spring and summer months while lognormal would serve better for the fall months thus gamma distribution was assigned to ssi9 in the end the following distributions were used weibull gamma and lognormal for precipitation lognormal and gamma for discharge and weibull for soil moisture to classify various drought types the original spi classification in combination with thresholds was adjusted world meteorological organization 2012 1 5 1 0 as dry 2 0 1 5 as very dry and 2 0 as extreme dry conditions it was assumed that values of derived precipitation discharge and soil moisture indices below abovementioned thresholds respectively refer to meteorological hydrological and soil moisture droughts of different severity thus the severity class moderate is associated with dry severe with very dry and extreme with extreme dry conditions for the non drought normal conditions 1 0 interval was used it should be noticed that in the context of the presented study the spi concept itself possesses certain drawbacks at first as it normalizes the data based on monthly distribution fittings all conclusions on a possible seasonality dominance of a certain drought type will be speculative due to the arbitrariness of the resulting dominant season for example in the presence of sufficiently long time series frequencies should be uniformly distributed over the months and thus seasons secondly if a seasonality is present in the hydrological cycle of the study area the interpretation of the results can be ambiguous for instance the drought classified with the same spi values for winter and summer refers to different absolute precipitation and thus has different impacts from single and joint type drought in the catchment therefore a second alternative tatistical drought definition was additionally introduced using quantile approach namely threshold level method tallaksen et al 2004 by replacement of spi thresholds with empirical ones calculated as empirical quantiles from the original data with the same aggregation periods 1 3 6 9 12 months backwards but unlike in spi approach without a separation by months one can address the both aforementioned spi shortages among all the methods existing for estimation of the empirical quantiles we choose one which give approximately median unbiased results regardless the distribution hyndman and fan 1996 as all three variables show different best fit distributions to account for the comparability of two approaches the same severity thresholds were applied thus the empirical quantiles of 0 1587 0 0668 and 0 0228 probabilities respectively correspond to the z scores of standard normal distribution represented with spi thresholds 1 1 5 and 2 these quantiles are applied afterwards to non transformed original data to assign drought periods additionally we want to point out that even in a presence of relatively long time series the uncertainty of the drought definition from low quantile subsets can be very high for example according to link et al 2020 if analyzing even 100 year time series the confidence intervals for low quantiles could be so high that spi approach could easily misclassify severely dry 2 1 5 and extremely dry 2 conditions simultaneous occurrence of different single droughts 1d types was named as 2d e g meteorological and hydrological and 3d meteorological hydrological and soil and assigned as following for a drought of a certain severity class with joint types all associated variables should be lower than the associated severity thresholds for example if only one variable out of two exceeds an extreme threshold while the other one remains above light but below the moderate class the drought was still be classified as a light one 3 2 empirical approach the method is based on the counting of the frequency of multiple extremes hao et al 2018b which simultaneously over or undergo of a certain threshold in this study a univariate individual extreme was defined with a specific threshold value which was obtained either as an empirical quantile or as a conventional value of normalized metrics e g spi world meteorological organization 2012 as mentioned in section 3 1 afterwards these thresholds were used to obtain the frequency of joint extreme events based on the co occurrence of individual extremes within a season or a year with a presence of relative small time series length it is possible that the obtained frequencies of joint types of droughts and all possible interconnections between them are random to account for this problem a bootstrapping approach was applied thus each obtained frequency value of a certain drought type was checked if it can be reproduced accidently the single values from the original monthly data were resampled with replacement for each variable and aggregation period separately to destroy all possible correlations between variables afterwards the same frequency analysis was conducted by repeating this procedure 1000 times we obtained a relatively large sample of random frequencies for the respective drought type thus it was assumed that if the original frequency obtained from the real data was higher than 95th quantile obtained from the abovementioned sample the frequency value was significant kew et al 2013 khanal et al 2019 the uncertainty of the drought frequencies was quantified with regard to the choice of the distribution itself for this we tested how the frequencies of 1d droughts of different types aggregation periods and severity levels calculated with different theoretical distribution applied as the same for all aggregation periods functions deviate from each other additionally the obtained frequencies for univariate drought were compared with theoretical frequencies derived from standard normal distribution world meteorological organization 2012 these yield to 11 for moderate 5 3 for severe and 2 0 months decade for extreme drought further a monotonic time trend and its significance were tested using a slope of a linear regression model and a modified for a serial correlation mann kendall test with significance level according to p value 0 05 kendall 1948 mann 1945 yue and wang 2004 the results from the tests were aggregated in the following categories in case the slope and the mann kendall tests both gave significant results the trend was called very significant in case only one of the two statistics is significant the trend was labeled significant and if none of them is significant insignificant the direction of the trend was accounted with the sign of the slope to ensure a sufficient number of points to estimate the trend only those drought combinations type aggregation severity were considered which yield to a total number of at least 15 events as quite often droughts do not appear every year thus frequency for these years is 0 it was decided to base calculations on a 5 year sums window this procedure ensures a time series with almost no zero members which is indeed shorter but more reliable for the trend analysis additionally the agreement between two drought identification approaches was analyzed utilizing binary drought and no drought time series therefore sub division on the severity classes was neglected based on the binary time series hit rates were calculated as the percentage of the cases when both approaches showed the same conditions over the whole data series finally the drought seasonality was addressed with the analysis of the most dominant season per drought type and aggregation period here we restricted the dominance to the value of minimum 30 as the aggregation period as well as the drought duration often exceed season duration e g 3 months in all cases the season was assigned to the last month of the calculated index e g if spi9 for july was classified as drought season was assigned as summer to ensure reliable sample size analysis was conducted for the combinations with at least 15 drought occurrences 3 3 multivariate distribution with copulas an important part of multivariate analysis application is the fitting of both marginal and joint distributions for the marginal we used the list of distributions from section 3 1 we derived distribution parameters by the maximum likelihood estimates the best distribution was chosen based on aic and bic for two random variables x and y with defined marginal distributions m x and m y the joint cumulative distribution function f namely probability p that both x and y will fall below x and y respectively can be expressed as a copula c with some parameters par nelsen 2006 sklar 1959 1 f x y p x x y y c m x m y p a r a variety of theoretical copula families exist which are commonly used for the construction of multivariate distributions showing different properties in dependence modeling i e symmetric or asymmetric lower or upper tail dependence hao et al 2018b one parameter and empirical copulas are the most widespread because of the simplicity of the fitting however two and more parameter copulas also occur in hydro meteorological studies fan et al 2017 the selection of a copula family and the parameter estimation were based on pseudo observations of the dependent variables u which for some random variable x are defined as a simple ranked normalization of each realization 2 u x r n 1 where r denotes the rank of x in x and n is the length of x the copula functions afterwards were chosen based on aic and bic for parameter estimation the canonical maximum likelihood method was used the return period rp of a given event is usually defined as the average time elapsing between its two successive realizations in the univariate case if a random variable x has distribution function m x the return period rp for a particular value x is defined as follows serinaldi 2015 3 r p x 1 1 m x in the bivariate case or multivariate in general two types of exceedance recurrence intervals usually occur salvadori et al 2007 one is based on the or exceedance of one more variables and the other on the and exceedance of both all variables joint probabilities in the context of co occurrence of extremes within this study bivariate and type joint probabilities were used with the corresponding rp 4 rp and x y 1 1 m x x m y y c u x x u y y to implement the method vinecopula schepsmeier et al 2018 and copula yan 2007 r packages were used we applied goodness of fit tests to detect whether an underlying marginal and joint probability distribution differs from a hypothesized one this was necessary since the choice of a distribution influences the estimated return period of an extreme drought and therefore propagates an uncertainty into the estimation process marginal distributions listed in section 3 1 were tested with non parametric kolmogorov smirnov test n smirnov 1948 and copulas list of the 10 best ones according to the aic and bic were tested with cramer von mises statistics genest et al 2009 both tests null hypothesis denote that the sample is drawn from the tested distribution thus with the significance level of 5 we listed all non rejected marginal and joint distribution functions then we construct multiply possible combinations and estimate univariate and joint return periods this yielded to a large sample of possible return period realizations from which we draw 5 and 95 quantile for each extreme drought case and thus giving us a 90 confidence interval for the estimated return period 3 4 markov chain in the study we used the simplest variation of the first order markov chain in that case the markov process is considered as a time and state discrete stochastic one and transition probabilities between different states of a variable x and fulfills the markov property levin and peres 2017 5 p x t 1 x t 1 x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x t x t p x t 1 x x t x t implying that the next state x t 1 of the examined sequence is only dependent on the current state x t from a markov chain a transition probability matrix p of the size m m can be calculated where m is number of unique states in the sequence and which consists of all possible conditional probabilities p x t 1 x x t x t between the different states for a homogeneous stationary markov chain the transition probability matrix is time independent and the empirical probabilities are estimated as following 6 p ij n ij j n ij where nij is the number of events with i th state occurred after j th state with the presence of overall time series shortage approximately 600 monthly values a robust estimation of transition probabilities for all the cross combinations is not possible and thus an additional significance criterion was utilized for this reason only transition persistence probabilities larger than the standard error se p ratio later on were considered significant this assumption allowed narrowing the transition paths and concluding on the most probable behavior of drought propagation in the catchment 4 results and discussion 4 1 empirical frequencies and seasonality of single and joint type droughts fig 2 illustrates the interactions between single and joint type droughts from time series plots for 1 6 and 12 month aggregation periods spi and quantile approaches depicted similar results except a clear difference in 1 and 6 month light droughts despite a chaotic behavior of 1 month drought fig 2a already starting on a 6 month aggregation period fig 2b distinctive droughts clusters are visible it is clear that while for the short aggregation periods negative anomalies of precipitation discharge and soil moisture rarely exceeded 4 6 months per year longer water shortages often last more than half of a year barker et al 2016 all types of droughts tend to group in groups of 2 3 years in a row 1975 1977 1982 1983 1990 1992 2004 2005 2018 2019 which becomes clear especially for a 12 month aggregation period fig 2c although hari et al 2020 point out that the consecutive drought in 2018 2019 was a special event for europe in general local studies show that previous drought years found for wernersbach were also reported in the whole region of saxony moreover almost all of them also formed a group of consecutive years h√§nsel and matschullat 2006 another important outcome is that in most of the cases all joint type droughts for 6 and 12 month aggregation period occurred simultaneously or with a lag of a few months and with similar severity and duration moreover for the joint droughts of 2004 2014 and 2018 a moderate and relatively short precipitation deficit caused much longer and extreme joint discharge and soil moisture shortage especially in 2018 which agree with other studies of european drought of 2018 hari et al 2020 to quantify agreement between the results of two methods to define a drought we calculated hit rates between them for both drought and no drought identification table 1 shows that for all droughts and aggregation periods the differences between spi and empirical quantile approaches are marginal and yield on average to less than 10 disagreement less agreement can be observed for soil and hydrological droughts for 1 and 6 month aggregation periods this might be explained by the skewness of the data and uncertainties of the fitted distribution while the smallest deviations of less than 1 were found for compound 12 month droughts most likely explained by the high proportion of no drought hits in a presence of an ongoing discussions of the different approaches of drought indexes calculations i e raible et al 2017 tijdeman et al 2020 weng et al 2015 our study showed from multiply perspectives that only a minor discrepancy appear between spi and quantile method with regard to drought frequency analysis empirical frequencies and trends of different drought types and their combinations from both spi and quantile approaches are shown in fig 3 here the calculated absolute frequencies were normalized as number of drought months per decade despite differences in the calculation both approaches to define droughts showed a similar frequency estimation the spi approach resulted in more scattered frequencies for the same drought type along the aggregation periods this might be explained by the uncertainty of the fitting or usage of non uniform distributions for different aggregation periods to transform the initial data according to fig a 1 1 the uncertainty due to the choice of the distribution function could be quite high for example in case of the hydrological and meteorological moderate 1 month drought the occurrence may vary from 5 to 15 months decade while for the soil drought deviations are smaller as the absolute frequencies for the extreme drought are not high themselves 1 3 months decade the estimated uncertainties are not high as well 1 2 the quantile method showed minor deviations in the frequencies 5 for all three single type droughts of the same severity fig 3a upper rows for single droughts which is indeed in the nature of the chosen empirical quantile estimator finally the results from both approaches showed consistency with the theoretical frequencies section 3 2 with a deviation of 1 2 months decade in general the number of detected single and joint type monthly droughts within the 1969 2019 period showed a sharp drop from moderate 9 12 and 4 9 months decade respectively to severe 4 8 and 0 6 6 months decade respectively and finally extreme 1 6 and 0 3 months decade respectively droughts the frequency values from both approaches were averaged over all aggregation periods for 1d 2d and 3d droughts respectively to compare to the proportion between the occurrences of single and joint droughts resulting ratio of 100 59 47 shows that 2d and 3d droughts tend to occur with the similar frequencies however if the different severity levels are taken into account it could be seen that extreme compound 2d and 3d droughts are much rarely detected 11 7 6 100 63 53 for moderate 100 59 41 for severe and 100 33 13 for extreme droughts with increasing severity the difference in frequencies between single and joint type droughts tend to increase thus extreme and severe droughts in the catchment tend to occur as multiple ones with the increase of the aggregation period the frequency of joint type droughts except hydro soil drought is generally increasing these results indicate that the study site is exposed in general to a light but long continuing compound water deficit between joint type droughts hydro soil droughts showed higher frequencies for moderate and severe class up to half year aggregation periods additionally it can be stated that all joint occurrences with frequency of more than one per decade were estimates as significant and non random both spi and quantile approach depicted close trend results for all moderate and single type severe droughts however the quantile approach resulted in a higher number of significant trends almost all significant results were found for moderate droughts however a few significant trends were traced also for severe and extreme drought conditions this can be explained by the small number of co occurrences for extreme and severe droughts and thus by shortage of time series length for the calculations significant positive trends were found for single type hydrological and soil droughts and associated joint type drought significant decreasing trends were discovered for more than six month meteorological droughts for moderate and severe conditions fig 3b lowest rows indeed they are so drastic that their influence could be tracked to the corresponding joint type droughts 2d and 3d thought with less significant trends a positive significant trend for extreme soil droughts is backed by long drought periods in 2004 and 2018 2019 fig 2 by removing 2018 2019 from the time series and repeating the analysis it was found that the effect of this severe drought of the trend direction is minor and almost all very significant and significant trends were still detected furthermore a trend balancing effect between severity classes for some droughts can be noticed namely decreasing trends in soil hydrological and joint hydro soil drought for severe class are compensated by the increasing trends due the growth of number of moderate droughts for the corresponding classes obtained results of multidirectional trends in meteorological hydrological and soil drought frequency are consistent with existing european studies for the study region although most of the researchers concentrated on larger scales cammalleri et al 2020 hanel et al 2018 spinoni et al 2015 stagge et al 2017 overall there is a tendency of direct influence of single on joint type drought trends in some cases two approaches show multidirectional trends for the same drought type and aggregation periods 22 however for all of them at least one of the trends was insignificant which makes possible conclusions on the difference between two methods with regard to trend analysis speculative finally the comparison of normalized frequency of the last decade 2010 2019 with the rest period 1969 2009 showed overall an increase of drought occurrence in the last decade fig 3b with an exception of moderate long droughts based on a negative precipitation trend it is visible that for the moderate drought the last decade frequency increases coincident with the trend direction while for the severe class it is the opposite this might be explained by the uncertainty of the estimated trend which arises from a low number of detected droughts due to short time series length in the presence of a pronounced seasonal hydrological cycle in the wernersbach catchment it was reasonable to conduct a drought seasonality analysis as mentioned in section 3 1 only the quantile approach in this context could provide meaningful results in general the catchment gets less precipitation and higher evaporation rates thus lower water fluxes in soil and less runoff in summer and fall season thus it would be obvious to assume that drought behaves in a similar manner indeed as it is shown in fig 4 short term 1 3 month single and joint type droughts mostly appeared during the fall months disregarded by a few exceptions for single soil and meteorological drought and seasonal dominance increased from single 35 50 to 3d drought 55 70 for longer aggregation periods no dominant season could be detected here the winter and summer months appear for all drought types except single soil and hydro soil the percentage of the season dominance decreases to 30 40 moreover these aggregation periods imply the accumulated water shortage of 12 months this means that an actual start of the drought could take place in another season however these results should be treated with caution due to the uncertainties of the short subset length and initial data transformations by distribution fitting 4 2 joint dependency and return periods of antecedent precipitation and soil moisture on annual low flows annual low flow extremes usually occur within the dry phase of the catchment hydrological cycle therefore under the general conditions of low precipitation amounts over some time the constantly depleting soil and groundwater storages become the main water source for the surface runoff in the wernersbach catchment low flow conditions normally appear from july to september exactly in almost the same period maximum monthly sums of precipitation are usually recorded however in many cases they are represented as relatively short events with high intensity convective precipitation which often does not deliver a substantial contribution to recharge due to relatively small infiltration rates thus this fact coupled with the high evapotranspiration rates usual for these months soil moisture and ground water storages possess low levels on a long term perspective in order to find a good correlation between annual monthly minimum flow soil moisture and precipitation for wernersbach the antecedent averaging periods between 1 and 15 months were tested with spearman rank correlation this correlation method was chosen due to skewed distributions of the variables fig 5 a shows a high and persistent correlation between low flow and antecedent soil moisture which starts with 0 75 for 1 month reaches maximum value of 0 84 for 4 month averaging and then constantly decrease with longer aggregation periods 0 56 for 15 months negative precipitation anomalies show a lower agreement with low flow here two peaks at 4 and 12 months with correlation of 0 56 and 0 49 respectively was observed a small bootstrapping experiment with multiply 30 year moving window subsets dotted lines on fig 5a and b confirmed that the general behavior of the whole time series is indeed not a random one but a specific feature of the catchment for a few bootstrapped time series a second weak peak in soil moisture and precipitation correlation for 12 months and third peak in precipitation correlation for 9 months appear these are exactly the subsets where the prolonged effect of the 2018 drought was present and where correlation with precipitation anomalies was even higher for longer aggregation periods highest correlations were found in a good agreement for both covariates at a 4 month aggregation period this period was used in the further analysis we found that lognormal distribution function for minimum discharge and weibull distribution function for soil wetness showed the best fit according to aic and bic further based on the transformed pseudo observations 49 pairs in total a 180 degree rotated gumbel copula was selected as the best based on aic and bic values the obtained multivariate distribution model was used to compute a joint and type non exceedance probability which is the probability of a simultaneous occurrence of both variables as it is depicted in fig 6 b 32 years 65 fell beyond 0 5 joint probability and 7 years 14 beyond 0 1 which is reliable for the tail asymmetric gumbel copula the relative difference between similar univariate pq and psw for discharge and soil wetness respectively and estimated joint pjoint probabilities in the middle part are 16 i e point pq 0 5 psw 0 5 pjoint 0 421 while close to the lower tail or rare probabilities it is already 25 i e point pq 0 01 psw 0 01 pjoint 0 00755 these facts indicate a worse agreement between variables in the lower tail in this case it implies that more severe low flow and soil moisture deficits are less likely to occur as a joint extreme in addition it could be seen that 10 000 random samples drawn from the fitted multivariate distribution grey dots follow quite well the observations over the whole range this confirms indirectly the choice of both univariate and bivariate distribution families fig 6a the peculiar vertical wall formed with random points in the fig 5a with a maximum value for soil moisture values around 110 mm are results of the copula and marginal fit based on the data points the latter were checked and it was revealed that indeed no higher values of antecedent soil moisture were found in modeled time series during low flow periods for the catchment return periods were estimated based on transformation of joint and marginal cumulative distribution functions thus an analysis on the observed and theoretical extremes could be conducted as it is shown in fig 7 a there are only few outstanding extremes presented in the observation among all 2018 had the highest return periods both univariate 216 years 110 years and joint 550 years when the flow fell below 0 5 mm which corresponds to 0 1 l s and soil moisture decreased to 94 mm which corresponds to soil wetness of 67 for the majority of the data points on the other side except for 1976 2000 2003 and 2019 the estimated joint return periods were found below 20 years it can be stated that the higher the exceedance return period is the more joint values are divergent from univariate ones this conclusion was drawn after analyzing the behavior of values above 10 years of joint return period furthermore it can be noticed that for univariate return periods above 50 year random simulations gray dots tend to appear closer to axes rather than on a diagonal 1 1 line thus rare joint extremes are more likely to occur as a combination of soil wetness with lower rp and low flow with higher rp or vice versa rather than with identical rps this conclusion however goes against the situation in extreme drought in 2003 and 2018 when both extreme events occurred simultaneously it might be caused by a lack of high quantile data and thus not distinctive low tail dependence for the robust copula fitting and should be treated with caution the results of the return period s uncertainty estimations for the most severe droughts of 2018 and 2003 are presented in table 2 the number of non rejected marginal and joint distributions combinations for the tested data yielded 150 years thus a sufficient sample size was available for the estimations of 5th and 95th rp quantiles here we see that the uncertainty of the joint rp is quite high and grows exponentially with the event severity especially observed for the upper rp confidence interval the joint uncertainty is likely driven by the uncertainty of the soil moisture marginal distribution fitting since the confidential intervals for the rps are much higher than for the discharge for both 2018 and 2003 events it is also interesting to mention that the estimated rp for soil moisture extremes tend to fall closer to the 5th quantile of uncertainty band while low flow extremes follow 95th quantile 4 3 persistence and transition between normal single and joint type drought conditions a markov chain approach was applied to study persistence and transition between normal and various drought conditions for that precipitation discharge and soil moisture anomalies derived from spi approach of 1 6 and 12 months were used markov chains were estimated for each aggregation period using the following possible eight states normal n one variable drought 1d two variable drought 2d and three variable drought 3d at first we analyses the transitions between drought types fig 8 and neglected severity classes therefore all droughts were assigned to moderate class normal conditions showed the highest frequency and persistence among all states increasing from 0 8 for short up to 0 94 for longer aggregation periods it can be seen that within a 1 month chain lots of possible significant pathways from normal state exist even directly to 3d drought while for a 12 month period possible transitions are quite narrow and seldom jump over drought levels fig 7a the observed pathway down from a normal state to 3d drought starts usually from a meteorological drought this is followed by hydro soil or meteo soil 2d droughts while a backwards transition occurs through hydro soil 2d and hydro 1d drought for 1 month duration an abrupt end of 3d drought and return to normal conditions is possible in 1 out of 10 cases high persistence values for single and joint type droughts of 6 and 12 months were found with the highest values for 3d droughts although for the single type droughts this resulted from typically higher autocorrelation for longer aggregation periods which is nature for the spi approach barker et al 2016 2016 wu and kinter 2009 no studies were found on the joint impact and implications for compound droughts thus we presume that this effect could highlight the self amplified compound character of long term drought conditions which normally occur over large areas and give a feedback to the atmosphere this effect was observed in both 2003 and 2018 when prolonged heat waves and precipitation shortages caused large vapor pressure deficits senf and seidl 2021 this in turn resulted in rapid and severe depletion of soil and groundwater storages and causing serious impact and changes in ecosystems this effect was also observed in forest sites which usually have much higher climatic buffering function in comparison to agricultural or grassland landscapes to withhold a stable hydrological regime and persist drought propagation buras et al 2020 schuldt et al 2020 yet another important aspect of joint type droughts can be studied with markov chains by the analysis of the transitions between severity levels fig 9 in contrast to the first markov chain analysis we classified here different droughts with severity thresholds but neglected the their types by aggregating total number of 1d and 2d droughts respectively in fig 8 one can conclude on transitions between 1d 2d and 3d droughts of different severity for a short monthly drought the transition from a normal state to a light single type drought showed the highest 0 11 probability however a direct change to a light or moderate 2d as well as light is also possible with probability of 0 02 fig 8a however the transition to joint type conditions most likely occurs from a light 1d to a light 2d drought which then either returns most probable to a normal state or increases the level to a 3d light drought the backward transition to a normal condition was found to be equally probable through a light or moderate 2d drought and then directly to a normal state by skipping 1d level or directly from 3d to normal state thus short aggregation periods can be characterized with rapid transitions and jumps between both drought classes and severity levels the half year aggregations showed similar to 1 month drought propagation except if the catchment suffered from a 2d light drought it had the same transition probability to normal and 3d light drought states and high probability of severity increase in 3d level here the backward transition to a normal state is already more likely to happen level by level through light severity rather than by jumps 12 month droughts should have the most and smooth conservative propagation paths among the studied one which is indeed what is observed for the study site interactions between 2d 3d and normal conditions occur almost explicitly through 1d light droughts the relationship and transformations between 2d and 3d droughts as well as the return paths were found in general the same as for 6 month aggregates the comparison of three aggregation periods revealed that with long term drought conditions higher persistence and predictability could be observed moreover the consistency between drought types tended to increase while the chaotic transitions and jumps between levels decreased the highest probability of transition to the most severe 3d drought was found for 6 month aggregates the way forward to 3d drought is most likely to occur through a light single and a 2d drought and then possible increase in severity while the backward paths usually started with a severity decrease at the same drought level and only then jumped to an upper level 5 conclusion in the presence of sufficient data statistical methods can indeed give us valuable quantitative characteristics on the linkage between natural processes in a catchment in this work the most common methods to study single and compound extremes were tested in order to describe 1d 2d and 3d droughts on a catchments scale namely meteorological hydrological and soil droughts and their mixture using well known technique of standardized indices e g spi monthly aggregates of precipitation soil moisture and discharge were transformed and droughts of various severities and lengths were identified with the empirical approach one can analyze the overall frequency seasonality and trends of all drought types further by fitting theoretical multivariate distribution one can study correlation between extremes and their joint probabilities as well as return periods finally a markov chain method examines the sequences of extreme states and allows studying other aspects of relationship of drought severity length and type this set of methods delivers a comprehensively sufficient statistical description of drought behavior in a catchment the case study of the wernersbach catchment in germany showed that according to an empirical approach no clear dominant single type drought could be revealed however among different joint type droughts types the hydro meteo one prevails furthermore it was found that the higher is the severity level the smaller is the difference between single and joint type drought frequencies moreover especially joint type droughts tend to form clusters of 2 3 years in time series for 6 and 12 month aggregation periods predominance of fall droughts was detected for majority of the drought types with short aggregation periods additionally multidirectional behavior of frequency trends for meteorological and other droughts was discovered the analysis of annual monthly low flow showed that it has highest correlation with four month assimilations of precipitation and soil moisture fitted copula showed good agreement with observations with decreasing convergence of joint and univariate probabilities towards extreme events the outstanding drought of 2018 formed by low flow and soil moisture shortage with estimated recurrence period of approximately 100 year and 200 year extremes respectively and had a joint return period of approximately 550 years which is far away from random non correlated processes further analysis showed however a high uncertainty of these estimations the evaluation of transition matrices between normal and various types of drought revealed well established and plausible transition paths from a normal to a 1d and further to a 2d and a 3d drought and then backwards moreover the transition and persistence probabilities increase for longer droughts it was found that the most probable transition to a 3d drought would occur via a light single type and a light 2d drought only after reaching the 3d drought a severity development will occur while returning to a normal state will require at first a reduction of the severity level and then a jump to the upper drought type level while a simple meteorological drought might not cause direct significant implications for the study site a soil and hydrological droughts could prolonged of soil moisture deficits in a shallow soiled catchment such as wernersbach could lead to severe vegetation stress and death especially for green forest understory lack of the water in the stream i e almost interrupted flow in 2018 cause illnesses and death of aquatic biota namely algae and fishery compound effect of abovementioned droughts could lead to drastic consequences since it effects the whole land vegetation atmosphere system and its ecosystem services generally these potential damages due to oppressed dying ecosystem lead to a substantial additional costs for the forest management more frequent monitoring reforestation fish stocking etc a clear outlook on which statistical methods described in the study are better or give more information is not possible since all of them possess different properties in the characterization and modeling of single and compound droughts over different temporal scales while empirical approach can give a general and broad overview on the what and when is happening multivariate distributions help to evaluate the co occurrence of extremes they also allow modeling their dependency beyond the observation range finally the transition matrix from markov chain method possesses a potential to serve as a forecasting instrument for compound droughts which is faster and simpler in comparison to traditional operational physically based models the method could serve as a decision support system for a forestry and land management as an ecosystem risk assessment tool thus we recommend basing a selection of a statistical approach on the aspects of compound drought one wants to deal with furthermore even in a presence of long term observations results from the statistical analysis especially for joint events should be treated with caution due to manifold of different sources of uncertainties 6 data and code initial raw data daily observations of hydrological and meteorological parameters

8557,modelling runoff generation in high elevation alpine catchments requires detailed knowledge on the spatio temporal distribution of snow storage with sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi it is possible to map snow cover with a high temporal and spatial resolution in contrast to the coarse modis data sentinel 2 msi enables the investigation of small scale differences in snow cover duration in complex terrains due to gravitational redistribution slope energy balance and wind driven redistribution aspect in this study we describe the generation of high resolution spatial and temporal snow cover data sets from sentinel 2 images for a high elevation alpine catchment and discuss how the data contribute to our understanding of the spatio temporal snow cover distribution the quality of snow and cloud detection is evaluated against in situ snow observations and against other snow and cloud products the main problem was in the false detection of snow in the presence of clouds and in topographically shaded areas we then seek to explore the potential of the generated high resolution snow cover maps in calibrating the gravitational snow redistribution module of a physically based snow model especially for an area with a very data scarce point snow observation network generally the calibrated snow model is able to simulate both the mean snow cover duration with a high f1 accuracy score of 0 9 and the fractional snow covered area with a correlation coefficient of 0 98 the snow model is also able to reproduce spatio temporal variability in snow cover duration due to surface energy balance dynamics wind and gravitational redistribution keywords snow cover snow redistribution high elevation alpine catchment sentinel 2 physically based snow modelling 1 introduction alpine snow cover and its subsequent melt can dominate local to regional climate and hydrology in both high latitude areas gascoin et al 2019 and the world s mountainous regions dozier and painter 2004 in the european alps snow is the major driver of alpine hydrology storing water during the winter season and releasing it in the spring and summer with impacts on water supply agriculture and hydropower production matiu et al 2021 moreover ongoing climate change in the alps affects the abundance of snow matiu et al 2021 finally snow accumulation and melting processes also depend on topographical parameters such as slope and aspect which are linked to incoming solar radiation gravitational transport and wind redistribution l√≥pez moreno and st√§hli 2008 gr√ºnewald and lehning 2011 l√≥pez moreno et al 2014 gr√ºnewald et al 2014 pedersen et al 2016 gurung et al 2017 mott et al 2018 saydi and ding 2020 vionnet et al 2021 therefore to calibrate and validate models capable of properly capturing snow dynamics in such a complex environment requires accurate observed snow cover maps the standard source of information regarding snow cover is a network of automatic and manual ground based meteorological stations that perform daily or sub daily observations mostly of snow depth romanov et al 2000 however in situ snow observations are generally insufficient for characterizing the high spatial variability of the snow pack in mountainous regions gascoin et al 2019 and are often only suitable for making qualitative comparisons with hydrological model results tuo et al 2018 moreover field measurements are sparse in both space and time and they are subject to several sources of error rasmussen et al 2012 marcolini et al 2019 furthermore only few snow observation stations operate at altitudes above 2000 m which complicates the investigation of altitudinal gradients matiu et al 2019 despite these limitations snow depth ground observations are very valuable when it comes to evaluate snow detection quality using remote sensing products e g foppa et al 2005 gascoin et al 2020 barrou dumont et al 2021 since the launch of the first landsat satellite in the 1970 s remote sensing has become a key tool for mapping snow cover and revealing snow properties at multiple spatial and temporal resolutions romanov et al 2000 dozier and painter 2004 snow can be characterized by many variables such as the snow covered area sca fractional area fsca albedo liquid water content snow depth or snow water equivalent frei et al 2012 in remote sensing applications snow cover is mainly investigated using sca and fsca products on the scale of entire mountain ranges like the alps or pyrenees gascoin et al 2019 remote sensing products supply information about snow covered areas across elevations but they have problems with correct snow detection in cloudy conditions consequently when it comes to improving a snow detection algorithm the main challenge is to reduce misclassification of cloud as snow gascoin et al 2019 another difficulty is in the detection of snow in dense forest areas where the ground is obstructed by the canopy this is particularly the case with evergreen conifer forests in alpine regions di marco et al 2020 besides the influence of forests topographical features such as steep shady slopes can impact the detection of snow by optical remote sensing products gascoin et al 2019 moreover there is a trade off between spatial resolution and swath width i e the acquisition strip of a satellite which influences the observation frequency dozier and painter 2004 despite these limitations spatial snow information derived from satellite data has been used for decades for various purposes including hydrology and water resource management rango et al 1996 hall et al 2012 brown et al 2014 k√§√§b et al 2016 fassnacht et al 2017 the application of modis data to derive snow cover information on a daily or twice daily basis depending on the geographical location is very widespread matiu et al 2019 but their spatial resolution of 500 m is too coarse for hydrological applications in mountain regions where snow cover properties can vary on scales of 10 m to 100 m bl√∂schl 1999 gascoin et al 2019 vionnet et al 2021 in fact although gurung et al 2017 used snow cover maps made with modis to investigate the effect of topography on the sca in very large basins 30 000 km2 bouamri et al 2021 demonstrated that modis is not capable of capturing the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover induced by solar radiation because it does not capture spatial variability below 500 m this limits the usage of modis snow cover maps for calibrating and evaluating spatially distributed snow models bouamri et al 2021 high resolution 30 m snow cover maps can be generated from landsat images but the low temporal revisit time of the landsat mission 16 days is a significant limitation to snow cover monitoring and moreover data availability can be considerably reduced by cloudiness the launch of the second copernicus sentinel 2 satellite in 2017 has made it possible to map the extent of snow cover at a 20 m resolution with a revisit time of 5 days gascoin et al 2019 the high resolution spatial and temporal data collected by sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi are important for enabling detailed investigations of snow cover and snow redistribution processes on the catchment scale foppa et al 2005 sentinel 2 data can therefore not only be used to evaluate the parametrizations of snow melt and redistribution in physically based models but also to actually act or contribute to the objective function used for model calibration mott et al 2010 in general the challenge with physically based snow models even without considering snow redistribution processes is that with increasing catchment size and simultaneous high grid discretization computation times increase significantly when for example multi layer snow models are applied for long periods i e climate change studies the computational effort increases even more when mechanistic snow redistribution approaches in physically based models are applied at the catchment scale thornton et al 2021 hence snow redistribution approaches are mainly based on empirical assumptions in hydrological models and have different levels of complexity a research gap thus exists between the development of process based snow redistribution models i e based on a mechanistic snow redistribution routine freudiger et al 2017 and their experimental validation warscher et al 2013 sch√∂ber et al 2014 frey and holzmann 2015 recently vionnet et al 2021 used the canadian hydrological model chm to simulate small scale variabilities in snow accumulation caused by gravitational redistributions avalanches and blowing snow transport saltation and suspension and among others factors by driving the chm with spatial high resolution 50 m wind fields it was possible to account for the influence of topographical features due to wind speed and direction the simulated snow accumulation was evaluated using high resolution airborne light detection and ranging lidar snow depth data and snow persistence indexes derived from remotely sensed imagery although the chm was able to simulate the small scale variability of snow accumulation there is still the need for optimization snowdrift permitting models for large scale application 1000 km2 in particular the representation of subgrid topographic effects on snow transport vionnet et al 2021 besides the limitation of physically based and fully distributed snow models on the catchment scale due to their heavy computational requirements thornton et al 2021 detailed model input data e g local wind fields are needed when wind driven snow redistribution is simulated with models based on semi empirical parameterizations of the physics of snow transport essery et al 1999 durand et al 2005 liston et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2007 or even with models resolving the 3d turbulent diffusion equation gauer 1998 lehning et al 2008 sauter et al 2013 schneiderbauer and prokop 2011 vionnet et al 2014 for blown snow particles in the atmosphere mott et al 2018 vionnet et al 2021 although sca from satellite products have been used in various studies to calibrate spatially distributed snow models to improve model internal consistency duethmann et al 2014 freudiger et al 2017 thornton et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge satellite data have rarely been used to calibrate snow redistribution routines which are often only calibrated against observed discharge warscher et al 2013 frey and holzmann 2015 in a recent publication thornton et al 2021 also considered parameter optimization of gravitational redistribution in a novel calibration approach for an energy balance based snow model including snow cover maps derived from landsat 8 in this work we aim to develop a high resolution spatial and temporal method of deriving snow cover and further to calibrate and evaluate the wasim water flow and balance simulation model snow module schulla 2021 hence the objective is to perform a process oriented analysis of gravitational snow redistribution and energy balance to accurately estimate the snow cover extent therefore we generated two alternative high resolution snow cover products from sentinel 2 images for a high elevation alpine catchment with a very sparse snow observation network the use of two products allows us to acknowledge the uncertainty affecting also satellite products and to consider it in the calibration of the model to accommodate cloud coverage each of the two snow cover products used a different snow and cloud detection algorithm and we quantified the difference between the resulting snow cover properties cloud detection enables the inclusion of partially clouded sentinel 2 images in the snow cover dataset by setting clouded areas to no data even with cloud cover these images may contain valuable information beyond the cloud extent regarding the snow cover evolution during the melting season and during the onset of snow accumulation finally snow cover maps with high spatial and temporal resolutions allow an accurate analysis of the effect of topographical features elevation slope and aspect on the snow cover duration and provide useful information for assessing simulated snow cover maps from a physically based hydrological model for a period of five years the main novelties of this paper consist in the application of two different i e one unsupervised and one supervised snow and cloud detection algorithms for sentinel 2 images their use for hydrological model calibration in a topographically complex region including an assessment of the differences between the two products and an investigation of the effects of topography elevation slope and aspect on mean snow cover duration 2 data and methods 2 1 research area and in situ snow observation the upper martell valley martelltal val martello is an alpine valley with a sw ne orientation located in the upper adige catchment in south tyrol italy covering an area of 65 km2 to evaluate the satellite products the research area was slightly expanded to the west to include the snow observations collected at the madritsch station located in the neighbouring sulden valley the upper martell valley has an elevation range of 1840 m a s l to 3760 m a s l with a mean altitude of 2814 m a s l sonny 2017 and the dominant land cover classes are bare rock 41 sparse vegetation 34 and glaciers 19 environment european agency clc corine 2018 coniferous forest covers only 6 of the catchment at elevations lower than 2370 m a s l along the ridges extremely steep slopes with inclinations of 60 highlighted in red in the overview map fig 1 can be found throughout the area the main river of the upper martell valley is the plima which flows into the zufritt gioveretto reservoir the runoff regime is dominated by glaciers and snow melt with high flows during the spring and summer and low flows during winter puspitarini et al 2020 there are also 107 lakes of proglacial origin in the catchment previous hydrological studies investigating the mass balance of the langenferner glacier galos et al 2017 galos and klug 2015 and the impact of glacier shrinking on hydropower production puspitarini et al 2020 also focused on this study area in addition the catastrophic flood event from 1987 was the subject of several vulnerability assessment studies totschnig and fuchs 2013 papathoma k√∂hle et al 2015 there is only a sparse observation network of meteorological stations covering the upper martell valley the station at the langenferner la glacier is the only one located inside the upper martell valley at the zufall snow station snow surveys are performed manually at weekly intervals during the winter period continuous snow depth observations are available from the madritsch zufritt and rossbaenke stations from various elevations and valleys the investigation period of this study covers the period with most available station data from october 2014 to september 2020 table 1 gives detailed information of the in situ snow observations and meteorological stations and the latter are used as model forcing in the hydrological model wasim 2 2 methods two snow and cloud detection approaches named tum unsupervised algorithm and eurac supervised algorithm respectively are applied to identify the snow covered area in the catchment over the study period these data sets are compared to the hydrological model wasim results with different parametrizations of snow redistribution i e default and optimized parameters fig 2 gives a comprehensive overview of the individual processing steps used in the observed and simulated snow cover maps 2 2 1 tum approach for sentinel 2 snow cover map covering most of the period june 2015 to october 2020 439 sentinel 2 level 1c images were downloaded with the r toolbox sen2r ranghetti et al 2020 for the area of interest aoi including all seasons of the year the level 1c product type provides top of the atmosphere reflectance in cartographic geometry projected in utm wgs84 european space agency 2021 the spectral bands central wavelength and spatial resolution of the sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi are listed in the supplementary material of hofmeister et al 2022 using eq 1 the normalized difference snow index ndsi was calculated for each image after resampling band 11 from 20 m to 10 m resolution cimpianu 2018 the ndsi uses the distinct reflection signature of snow surfaces with very high reflectance in the visible spectrum and strong absorption in the short wave infrared range gascoin et al 2019 1 ndsi green s w i r green s w i r where green corresponds to sentinel 2 band 3 wavelength 0 560 ¬µm and swir is short wave infrared represented by band 11 wavelength 1 610 ¬µm an ndsi pixel is classified as snow if the ndsi value is 0 4 dozier 1989 larger ndsi values are classified as snow free the ndsi threshold was the same for all images several cloud detection approaches have been developed for sentinel 2 images such as sen2cor idepix fmask maja and sentinel hub s cloud detector menekay 2019 in this study cloud detection was performed using cloud masks created by the identification of pixel properties algorithms idepix from the sentinel application platform snap v7 0 european space agency 2021 at 60 m spatial resolution idepix is a single scene method and therefore suitable for cloud detection over changing terrain conditions such as snow accumulation and melt since it is available as an snap plugin it is very user friendly fast and effective at providing cloud masks idepix combines cloud masks with sun geometry to search regions of maximum probability for cloud shadow pixels in the projected region of potential cloud shadow the cloud mask is shifted along the illumination path towards the surface reflectance minimum idepix can identify different types of pixels such as semi transparent clouds fully opaque clouds cirrus clouds cloud shadows and even mountain shadows this study employs idepix cloud classification which includes cloud pixels identified with full confidence as well as pixels identified with uncertainty as clouds clouded pixels were set to no data the snow and cloud maps were masked to the extent of the area of interest and resampled with the nearest neighbour method to the same spatial resolution as that of the hydrological model 25 m we excluded highly clouded 80 images from further analysis which reduced the total number of images to 366 following an initial assessment of the cloud maps we observed that the cloud maps generated with idepix tended to overestimate cloudiness due to mountain shadows since low illuminated areas with low spectral reflectance are misclassified as clouds therefore only cloud covered areas for which no snow was detected by the ndsi were set to no data this enables the snow detection under clouds thanks to semi transparency in swir which would otherwise be masked by the idepix cloud mask in addition the cloud masks are very conservative since they are calculated with a coarser resolution 60 m compared to the snow maps 20 m which would mask out too many pixels especially in the peripheral areas of the clouds for which the snow detection might be correct serco italia 2017 water bodies were also set to no data since their reflectance is often very similar to that of a snow surface dozier 1989 to test the utility of atmospheric correction over satellite imagery for snow cover detection a set of atmospherically corrected sentinel 2 images september 2018 october 2019 was analysed and compared against the methods used the correction was applied using second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum 6s as developed by vermote et al 1997 which uses radiative transfer models rtms to simulate the passage of solar radiation across the atmosphere the 6s algorithm is adapted to a python py6s interface wilson 2012 and was implemented recently for use with the google earth engine murphy 2018 via a python api and docker container 2 2 2 eurac approach for sentinel 2 snow cover map the eurac snow algorithm also takes the sentinel 2 level 1c data as its input as pre processing step the sentinel 2 images are scaled from digital number dn to reflectance values using the quantification value provided in the sentinel 2 metadata i e equal to 10 000 for all the considered images thus all bands are reprojected and resampled to the final model resolution of 25 m using cubic interpolation the classification algorithm consists of two steps i cloud detection and ii snow detection in both cases a support vector machine svm classifier is trained with an active learning al procedure by dividing the procedure into two steps it is possible to exploit the most representative features of each of the two classification problems the al procedure allows us to speed up the learning curve of the classification by asking the user to specify the label of the most uncertain pixels for cloud detection when a pixel is classified as cloud or no cloud all spectral bands of the sentinel 2 are considered except for those at 60 m resolution i e bands 1 9 and 10 moreover the eurac approach uses additional features such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi calculated as the normalized difference between near the infrared nir and red bands in addition to the ndsi which have been shown to introduce benefits into the classification tarrio et al 2020 for snow detection there are three possible classes snow snow free and hard shadow the difference between shadow and hard shadows is defined in terms of energy recorded by the sensor if the recorded energy is too low to distinguish between snow and snow free areas i e the signal to noise ratio snr of the sensor is too low we call it hard shadow this is generally the case when the sun is low on the horizon which is from approximately mid november to mid february at the latitude of the martell valley and the terrain is particularly steep in order to define a threshold under which the recorded energy by the sensor is too low we selected samples for which the human photo interpreter cannot distinguish whether the pixel is snow or snow free low reflectance situations generally associated with dark areas e g turbid lake shadow by cloud or terrain flooded areas etc are excluded from snow detection from state of the art and operational algorithms applying thresholds on the visible bands e g modis snow cover product version 6 riggs and hall 2015 the shadow detection is performed with a svm classifier together with the snow detection after masking out the clouds in addition to the spectral bands and features also used for cloud detection the classifier includes illumination angle as a further input feature the illumination angle is calculated from the solar zenith and the solar azimuth angle riano et al 2003 and enables better mitigation of the effect of the differences in the solar illumination during the year the svm has been trained in order to emphasize the presence of snow also in mixed conditions this is done by assigning the class snow to those pixels whose spectral characteristics can be attributed to the presence of snow by a careful visual inspection for both svm models snow and cloud we used a radial basis function kernel and performed a model parameters selection according to a grid search strategy to identify the regularization parameter c and the kernel coefficient gamma the grid is initialized with a user defined range the model selection start with a coarse grid and then given the obtained results is refined around the values of c and gamma that perform the best the best values are selected by evaluating the mean and standard deviation of the over accuracy calculated in a cross validation strategy with k folder k 5 for the cloud detection we collected 173 training points 97 cloud free samples and 76 cloud samples the selected parameters are c equal to 9 885 and gamma equal to 0 896 the number of selected support vectors is 98 the accuracy from the cross validation is 0 82 and the standard deviation is 0 1 by considering the 5 folds the low accuracy during the training shows the difficulty in the cloud discrimination during winter condition with the spectral bands provided by sentinel 2 sensor for the snow detection we considered three classes of training samples we collected 177 snow free samples 264 snow samples and 138 shadow samples for a total amount of 579 samples the selected c value is 30 018 and gamma is 0 0003 the number of support vectors was 445 and the accuracy from the cross validation is 0 98 with a standard deviation of 0 1 the samples are collected initially from two scenes and then we adopted an iterative active learning procedure to collect new samples the active learning procedure ask the user the labels of the most uncertain samples i e the ones with computed probabilities for the assigned class are low the probability was calculated according to lin et al 2007 it should be mentioned that at the time of the analyses for this publication the eurac approach is still in the final stage of the development but it was applied already once in a previous study ebner et al 2021 the eurac approach was chosen to verify the tum snow detection results because the supervised algorithm should be more accurate than the unsupervised tum product as in the tum method water bodies were set to no data 2 2 3 snow cover simulation with wasim the snow module of the physically based hydrological model wasim version 10 04 07 schulla 2021 was used as an example for demonstrating the benefits of high resolution snow cover maps in calibrating simulated snow redistribution for snow melt simulation the energy balance approach including gravitational snow redistribution was selected as originally implemented by warscher et al 2013 we also tested the effect of wind driven snow redistribution warscher et al 2013 schulla 2021 canopy snow interception was not considered in this study because of the small proportion of coniferous forest 6 the multi layer snow model was deactivated to keep the computational time reasonable limit the number of calibration parameters and avoid the need to define multiple soil and snow parameters the topography dependent adjustment of radiation and air temperature follows the scheme devised by oke 2002 the parametrization of the snow accumulation and gravitational snow redistribution table 2 originates in part from the wasim user manual schulla 2021 and f√∂rster et al 2018 whereas the correction factor for incoming long wave radiation lwincorr was slightly increased from 1 0 to 1 1 considering the observations available for may and june the equations for energy balance approach psnow lwincorr and lwoutcorr can be found in the wasim user manual which is available in the supplementary material hofmeister et al 2022 to account for solid precipitation undercatch of rain gauges we used a wind dependent snow correction factor snowb of 0 1 s m as also used by f√∂rster et al 2018 and confirmed by kochendorfer et al 2016 gravitational snow redistribution is based on a computationally efficient mass conserving algorithm that parameterizes the gravitational transport and deposition developed by gruber 2007 and later implemented in wasim by warscher et al 2013 four parameter grids that specify the sliding fractions for each of the cardinal directions n e s w were generated using the wasim preprocessing tool tanalys total outflow from the gravitational model mout is determined by eq 2 2 mout ferosion m i n d g r a v i f i i e r o s i o n a n d s w e 0 m i n d g r a v i f i i e r o s i o n a n d s w e

masses will be transported to the next downslope cell s in this work we show how ierosion and ferosion can be calibrated to improve the model s performance using sentinel 2 snow cover data wind driven snow redistribution can also be simulated with wasim however the approach implemented is in fact a kind of snow precipitation correction by which areas sheltered from the main wind direction receive an increased snow fall and areas exposed to the main wind direction receive a reduced snow fall amount which cells are exposed or sheltered is estimated using the directed sky view factor svfdir for this study the main wind direction was set to south west 180 to 270 which corresponds with the main wind direction of the langenferner meteorological station mean wind direction 229 54 for the snow accumulation period october to may the snow precipitation is corrected by equation 5 5 psnow p s n o w c w i n d p s n o w where psnow is the solid precipitation and cwind is the correction factor which is determined by equation 6 6 cwind e d m a x 1 s v f d i r 1 c m i n where e is a linear elevation weighting factor svfdir is the directed sky view factor dmax is the maximum possible deposition and cmin is the minimum correction factor for shifting cwind to a more or less solid precipitation correction the parameter e ranges from 0 at the lowest elevated pixel to 1 at the highest pixel and linearly scales the amount of snow redistribution warscher 2014 the impact on the mean snow cover duration was tested on different spatial scales by performing different model simulations with and without activated wind driven snow redistribution the time series of all meteorological stations illustrated in fig 1 and listed in table 1 are spatially interpolated with an elevation dependent regression i e temperature wind speed and humidity and inverse distance weighting idw for precipitation and solar radiation the simulation period covers six years from 2014 10 01 to 2020 09 30 in hourly time steps however the simulated snow maps were only saved as daily means the selection of the spatial resolution 25 m was a compromise between the level of detail and the computational demand previous hydrological applications of wasim used a 50 m spatial and 1 h temporal resolution for alpine catchments kraller et al 2012 warscher et al 2013 f√∂rster et al 2018 or even 25 m in the most recent application thornton et al 2021 two different exceedance threshold values 0 mm and 5 mm swe for classification as either snow or no snow were tested to ensure consistency in the comparison with the observed snow maps clouded areas from the tum product and water bodies were set to no data in the snow cover maps produced by wasim since the dynamic glacier model of wasim requires a comprehensive calibration which increases the model complexity it was not activated and glaciered areas were set to constantly snow covered in the simulated snow maps although glaciers are a key contributor to runoff generation in this area the focus of this study is to examine the spatio temporal variability of the snowpack glaciered areas were derived for each year from the cloudless snow cover map for august or september taken from the eurac product since the tum product showed an tendency of false snow detection on some very steep 60 north facing slopes which would partly lead to wrong glacier delineation 2 2 4 analysis of observed snow cover maps the quality of snow no snow detection is evaluated against the in situ snow observation by calculating the accuracy score f1 equation 7 based on the confusion matrix in table 3 the f1 score divides the sum of all true positive tp and true negative tn matches by the total population n accuracy was only computed at three snow observation stations with continuous snow depth recordings 2 2 5 analysis of topographical feature on observed and simulated snow cover the influence of topographic characteristics e g elevation slope or aspect on the observed and simulated mean snow cover duration is analysed such that all grid cells with the same topographical characteristics e g elevation slope and exposition are aggregated to mean snow cover duration over the entire period of 6 years following equation 7 the snow cover duration scd d for each pixel of the domain in an hydrological year was computed following dietz et al 2012 7 scd 365 25 n i 1 n s i where n is the number of days with sentinel 2 recorded data beginning with 1 october and ending with 30 september of the next year on average the length of a year is 365 25 days considering leap years si refers to the cloud free daily snow cover data set recorded to values one for snow and zero for snow free area accordingly we calculated the mean and standard deviation of snow cover duration of all pixels of the 366 snow cover maps with respect to the three topographical feature classes i e aggregation of elevation in ten meter classes slope and exposition in three degree classes 2 2 6 comparison of observed and simulated snow cover maps a pixel by pixel spatial analysis was performed to evaluate the simulated snow cover maps against the two different observed snow maps at the catchment scale two additional performance measures are thus introduced the f2 score equation 8 and the f3 score equation 9 which are often used to evaluate binary classifications aronica et al 2002 warscher et al 2013 thornton et al 2021 the range of the f1 and f2 scores is from zero to one while f3 ranges from to one all scores are 1 if the simulated snow cover perfectly matches the observed one the f1 score tends to show the highest performance values since it takes only true positives and true negatives into account and these are usually high during winter and summer f2 and f3 exclude true no snow pixels and are therefore more sensitive to differences in snow cover warscher et al 2013 f3 is even more sensitive to snow extent than f2 due to the subtraction of the false positives in the numerator f1 score 8 f 1 i 1 n t p i 1 n t n n f2 score 9 f 2 i 1 n t p i 1 n t p i 1 n f p i 1 n f n f3 score 10 f 3 i 1 n t p i 1 n f p i 1 n t p i 1 n f p i 1 n f n for a further spatial comparison of observed and simulated snow products the fractional snow covered area fsca is also considered fsca is defined as the ratio between the number of pixels classified as snow covered and the total number of pixels excluding clouds and lakes di marco et al 2020 as shown in equation 10 11 fsca nsnow ntot n c l o u d s where nsnow is the number of snow cover pixels according to the sentinel 2 dataset or wasim ntot is the total number of pixels representing the overall catchment area and nclouds are the pixels classified as cloud and water bodies 3 results 3 1 comparison of cloud detection by tum and eurac in terms of the empirical cumulative cloud detection frequency eurac detects a higher proportion of cloud within the range of 15 to 80 areal coverage than the tum product fig 3 a however both products are able to detect complete cloud cover and clear sky situations equally well besides cirrus high altitude clouds and other clouds the image processing algorithms also include topographic shadows which are of particular interest in complex terrains such as the upper martell valley the ability to detect topographic shadows is especially important in mid latitude areas during the winter period where the solar elevation is very low typically below 20 gascoin et al 2020 differences between the two approaches and their limitations in terms of cloud and shadow detection are illustrated in an example for january 27 2017 when no clouds were present in the aoi fig 3b however the low inclination angle of the sun produces extensive shading in the southern and eastern parts of the aoi cloud detection by tum fig 3c falsely classifies some snow free ridges or snow free steep slopes as clouds on the other hand the eurac method fig 3d detects more shaded areas in the south eastern area however both approaches fail to fully detect the topographic shadows on the forested southern valley bottom which are classified as snow covered regions 3 2 in situ comparisons of snow cover detection by tum and eurac the quality of snow detection was tested against three snow observation stations for various snow depth thresholds that differentiate between snow and no snow the detection accuracy was calculated by the f1 score equation 7 snow detection varies not only according to the chosen detection method tum or eurac but also according to the observation sites fig 4 and supplementary table s 7 in hofmeister et al 2022 the most accurate score f1 0 97 was obtained with both products for snow depth thresholds ranging between 4 cm and 15 cm for the rossbaenke station which is surrounded by grassland both tum and eurac attained a similar detection accuracy at the madritsch station however decreasing with increasing snow depth threshold the highest accuracy of 0 96 tum and 0 97 eurac is reached at a snow depth threshold of 1 cm due to the station s relatively high altitude 2825 m a s l the land cover of the surrounding area is mainly composed of gravel and debris therefore it can be assumed that there is no interference between the spectral characteristics of the snow cover and those of the vegetation the main differences between the snow detection products are observed for the lowest snow observation station of zufritt which is surrounded by forest and grassland whereas the tum product has a detection accuracy 0 91 for snow depth thresholds between one and ten cm the detection accuracy of the eurac product does not exceed 0 83 for the same threshold range the lowest performance is probably due to the presence of permanently mixed pixels such as forest and grassland in fact the spectral characteristics of these pixels do not show a snow presence 50 see 2 2 2 in this case a canopy correction is required to prevent error the optimum snow detection accuracy of 0 95 for tum and 0 92 for eurac based on all stations was found at a 4 cm threshold showing that in general a larger snow quantity i e a closed snow cover with a few centimetres depth 4 cm is needed on the ground to enable better identification of snow from sentinel 2 images we also tested two different exceedance thresholds for simulated swe 0 mm and 5 mm in order to convert swe to binary snow cover maps the commonly used exceedance threshold of 5 mm warscher et al 2013 schulla 2021 thornton et al 2021 attained a slightly higher f1 prediction accuracy of 0 95 compared to 0 92 for 0 mm at the madritsch snow observation station however since only one snow observation station with continuous snow depth recording is located in the research area it is not possible to make any general statements about the robustness of the exceedance threshold 3 3 calibration and analysis of snow redistribution as modelled by wasim topographical analysis not only allows the impact of topographic features such as elevation slope and aspect on the mean snow cover duration to be investigated but also enables a process orientated evaluation of the simulation results and calibration of the gravitational redistribution simulated by wasim with respect to different slope gradients a total of four simulation results were analysed with different snow redistributions table 4 simulations a and c were performed with the default wasim parametrization of ierosion minimum slope for creating slides and ferosion fraction of snow pack that forms a slide while simulations b and c used optimized parameters for this analysis all pixel values of all 366 snow cover maps were aggregated by each topographic feature class elevation slope and exposure and the mean and average standard deviation of the snow cover duration scd was estimated for each class fig 5 as explained in section 2 2 5 although the elevation gradient of the mean snow cover duration and the standard deviation bands quantified for one mean standard deviation are very similar for both observation and simulation in the range 2300 to 3500 m a s l distinct differences can be observed in the lower 2300 m a s l elevation zones the eurac snow maps distinctly show lower mean snow cover duration values than tum and wasim accompanied by broadening of standard deviation band at the valley bottom 2300 m a s l due to the presence of forest and a higher mountain shadow detection supplementary figure s 6 in hofmeister et al 2022 although the tum product also displays higher variance in the low elevation range it shows better agreement with the simulated snow cover duration in the elevation range from 2800 to 3400 m a s l relatively wide standard deviation bands indicate a large spatial heterogeneity in mean scd mean scd varies only slightly for the highest elevation bands 3500 m a s l the impact of ierosion on the mean scd is visible on the slope feature class in fig 5 we can observe that an ierosion value of 45 does not reproduce the turning point in the mean scd as it is present in both the tum and eurac products hence an analysis of the satellite data enables us to determine the value of ierosion by applying a grid search approach to find the minimum distance between the peak of mean scd at slopes between 40 to 50 in observation and model results the optimum ierosion value was found at 50 the ferosion parameter was lowered in 0 001 steps from the default value 0 007 to 0 001 and the best parameter 0 002 determined taking into account the best combination of mean pearson correlation 0 73 and rmse mean scd of 25 7 d with ierosion set to 50 see supplementary figure s 8 in hofmeister et al 2022 wind driven snow redistribution was activated for the simulation runs c and d the small differences in performance of the simulated snow cover duration in the highest elevation zones 3500 m a s l can be explained by the steeper topography in which more snow is redistributed by gravitational slides the greatest simulated gravitational redistribution occurs with the default parametrization of ferosion fig 5a in this elevation zone in contrast the optimized gravitational redistribution fig 5b shows better agreement with the observed mean scd the activation of wind driven redistribution leads to a distinct reduction in the mean snow cover duration in the range from 2800 to 3500 m a s l fig 5b and d the effect of gravitational redistribution is most clearly visible on slope gradients steeper than 30 with the default parametrization of ierosion 45 and ferosion 0 007 wasim relocates snow from steep slopes 45 to flatter areas which results in very low snow cover durations for slopes above 45 accompanied by a sudden change in the standard deviation fig 5a and c the wind driven redistribution has barely any detectable effect on the simulated mean snow cover duration on the slope feature class with the exception of the steepest slopes 60 for which a small increase can be observed fig 5b and d the final topographical characteristic to be evaluated is aspect exposure the mean scd on areas of different exposure depends mainly on the incoming solar radiation topographical shadowing and on wind driven snow redistribution the influence of exposure on the mean scd is clearly visible in fig 5 with the highest values 250 d on north and north east facing slopes and the lowest 200 d on south facing slopes as with the slopes the relatively large standard deviation bands indicate a high variability of scd in areas with similar exposure although the mean scd shape is very similar for the tum and eurac products a systematic offset between both products overall mean of scd by tum 241 d and eurac 226 d is present which is more pronounced with the northern exposure this can be explained by the differences in cloud and mountain shadow detection by the products while the eurac cloud product shows no influence of aspect with a constant overall mean cloud coverage of around 20 the tum product detects more clouds on south facing areas overall mean cloud coverage of 20 than on north facing ones overall mean cloud coverage of 14 supplementary figure s 6 in hofmeister et al 2022 activated wind driven redistribution leads to better agreement between the observed and simulated mean snow cover durations on areas from east to west exposure fig 5d in the following comparison we will refer only to the best wasim setup with the optimized gravitational snow and activated wind redistribution configuration d 3 4 comparison and accuracy of observed and simulated snow cover products the cumulative snow and no snow frequency curves show a strong similarity in the snow detection and simulated values fig 6 a the cumulative no snow frequency curves diverge with no snow coverage 10 in the lower elevation ranges of the aoi although the frequency response with snow detection is quite similar there is a systematic offset between the snow detected by tum and eurac from 10 to 90 areal coverage eurac tends to detect a lower snow cover probability than tum this is because the eurac classification was trained with the majority of mixed pixels being considered as snow free the simulated snow cover frequencies follow the same response as the detections but the model has a slight tendency to overestimate the snow covered area within the 60 to 90 areal coverage range overall accuracy scores for both tum and eurac snow detection are very high f1 0 97 f2 0 91 f3 0 9 only dropping in august to 0 8 for f2 and f3 respectively as can be seen in fig 6b the overall accuracy scores of tum wasim f1 0 93 f2 0 83 f3 0 75 and eurac wasim f1 0 93 f2 0 83 f3 0 71 provide further evidence that the model is able to simulate the spatial snow distribution in the research area well comparison of the mean scores on a monthly scale reveals the part of the season in which the model has a reduced accuracy in the snow cover distribution simulation the critical months are the beginning of the accumulation periods october with an overall mean fsca of 45 eurac 57 tum and 56 wasim and ablation june with an overall mean fsca of 52 eurac 55 tum and 58 wasim although they still have a mean f1 score of above 0 8 the f2 and f3 scores exclude the no snow pixels and accordingly result in lower scores warscher et al 2013 3 5 comparison of snow cover frequencies and fractional snow covered area fsca differences between observed and simulated snow cover days scds at the pixel scale were investigated in more detail for each hydrological year 1 oct 30 sept as illustrated in fig 7 in general the hydrological years 2016 and 2017 had a shorter snow coverage period than the subsequent three years 2018 2019 and 2020 the lower snow coverage in 2016 and 2017 results in better visual agreement between the two snow observation products however the relatively high standard deviations 74 d given in table 5 indicate a greater variance in the snow cover days within the aoi wasim simulates a higher snow cover duration for both years which also results in a slightly lower standard deviation of scds 73 d a distinct tendency towards overestimation of the scds can be observed especially for the hydrological year 2016 for the snow rich years 2018 2019 and 2020 tum shows a higher frequency of mean scds in the range above 250 d than eurac in terms of the observed and simulated scds the wasim results are more similar to those of tum snow detection for the corresponding period than they are to those of eurac with increasing mean scds the standard deviation decreases indicating a lower heterogeneity in the snow cover duration the overall mean gives the mean and standard deviation of each snow product for the whole investigation period 2016 2020 the overall mean scds of 236 d confirms the tendency of eurac to underestimate the snow cover duration as compared with tum 251 d and wasim 258 d and also shows the highest variability in snow cover duration with a mean standard deviation of 64 d the standard deviation shows that the snow cover duration varies greatly from year to year and declines in snowy winters with long snow cover durations such as in 2018 2019 moreover the standard deviation of scds obtained from wasim is systematically lower than the one observed without taking canopy interference into consideration fig 7 shows the comparison among the frequencies of snow cover days and reveals the tendency of wasim to underestimate the snow cover duration in the 360 scds bin and to overestimate it in the following bin 360 scds corresponding to perpetual snow cover moreover wasim simulation results in a longer snow cover duration than the two observation products for the classes 260 d and 270 d in the extreme winter 2018 2019 given that the frequency of snow cover days does not allow any spatial comparison between the two approaches and the simulated maps fig 8 compares case studies for a hydrological year with 2020 and without 2019 good agreement eurac shows differences in snow detection at the valley bottom in forested areas and on steep slopes for both winters 2019 and 2020 these often being set to no data due to the presence of shadows moreover the presence of clouds impacts snow and ice detection on the glaciered areas the tum snow cover product mostly has problems with overestimations of snow cover at the bottom of steep north facing slopes topographical features such as ridges and slopes are highly visible in both products as is interference from vegetation especially with respect to the year 2020 as snow cover duration increases topographical features become less visible as is the case for 2019 however eurac also underestimates the snow cover days on the forested valley bottom in the snow rich year 2019 when compared with tum the hydrological model wasim is well able to simulate the spatial distribution of snow cover days for both seasons but overestimates the snow cover duration at the valley bottom and to some extent at the highest elevations 3000 m a s l for the snow rich year 2019 the main topographical features ridges and slopes are also represented by the model activated wind redistribution leads to a longer snow cover duration on north east facing slopes which are also partially present in the observation products in contrast wasim underestimates the snow cover duration in west facing areas due to wind driven snow erosion as is the case for the madritsch snow station and the surrounding area canopy snow interception was not considered in the model and is therefore not discernible in the valley bottom the fractional snow covered area fsca of the two observation products and the simulation results were evaluated for a more quantitative comparison fig 9 the fsca shows strong seasonality in all products although the simulated snow coverage given by wasim is in line with that observed by eurac there are larger fsca in the ablation period june and july of the years 2016 14 2 2017 3 2 and 2020 8 6 but also for new snow events in august and september of the years 2017 8 5 and to some extent 2018 5 5 this pattern is mainly present when comparing wasim with tum for some dates of the years 2016 and 2017 however these differences are not as pronounced as for the eurac product as an overall mean wasim overestimates the eurac fsca by 5 1 and slightly underestimates the tum fsca by 0 6 during the ablation period june and july the overall pearson correlation of fractional snow covered areas is 0 98 for eurac and wasim and 0 98 for tum and wasim 4 discussion 4 1 cloud detection by tum and eurac in this work we tested the extent to which a simple snow and cloud detection approach tum performs in a complex terrain and determined what limitations might occur previous evaluations have found that idepix overclassifies possible cloud shadow pixels alvera azc√°rate et al 2021 although idepix has been tested for a wide selection of regions it still has limitations and weaknesses in cloud detection that have not been completely resolved the main difficulties are in its ability to distinguish between cloud and snow ice and to detect optically very thin clouds brockmann consult gmbh 2017 in a visual inspection for the years 2015 and 2016 based on idepix cloud products we observed that snow was systematically falsely classified as cloud in clear sky situations during the winter due to the presence of topographical shadows see supplementary figure s 9 in hofmeister et al 2022 which would lead to an underestimation of snow cover if the erroneously detected clouds are set to no data snow detection by ndsi was therefore given a higher confidence rating than cloud detection by idepix and clouded areas were only set to no data when the binary snow detection value was zero this resulted in false snow detection for a few pixels on steep shaded slopes with low illumination this effect is also shown by tum on the slope feature class fig 5 where the variance in the mean snow cover duration increased for very steep slopes 60 when compared to eurac the complementation by the idepix mountain shadow layer might reduce false snow and cloud detection on steep and shaded slopes the eurac algorithm is based on an ml approach that uses multi temporal training samples even if the samples are collected over a large variety of scenes including different illumination conditions a single model is used and the quality of the classification still depends on the conditions of the scene this is mainly due to the limited spectral information provided by sentinel 2 which is insufficient for solving all ambiguities unlike the single scene cloud detection of idepix the eurac product is able to classify mountain shadows on north facing slopes as can be seen in the case study on cloud detection in fig 3d additionally it has the highest snow detection confidence even in steep terrain as can be concluded from the narrow uncertainty band in fig 5 since it uses an active learning approach the cloud and snow detection quality relies on the user selecting the appropriate training pixels it is sometimes difficult to visually assign the correct class to pixels showing mixed characteristics such as shadowed or forested areas in these pixels the classifier usually returns an uncertain probability i e around 50 of the pixel belonging to the snow class in general cloud detection by both idepix and ml requires deeper investigation over forested areas in alpine catchments moreover a comparison with other available remote sensing snow cover products e g gascoin et al 2019 di marco et al 2020 may be beneficial for the future 4 2 validation of snow detection quality through in situ snow observation the individual selection of a snow depth threshold is recommended when comparing remote sensing and ground snow cover information in fact each snow observation site has its own characteristics such as elevation aspect exposure to wind and land cover that influence this comparison due to the additional interference between vegetation and snow cover detection validation by in situ snow observation is more accurate for sites located above the forest line moreover the mixed pixel issue of different spectral signatures can impact the binary snow and no snow information for small snow depth thresholds 4 cm a high snow detection sensitivity can be observed at the rossbaenke site due to interference of grass cover with the snow fig 4 one way of reducing this error would be to filter the snow depth observations to avoid noise caused by the ground i e grass nevertheless a good level of accuracy can be achieved for lower lying sites that are surrounded by coniferous forest and grassland as is the case for the tum snow product barrou dumont et al 2021 found an optimal threshold value even at 1 cm snow depth by analysing a very large data set of 1764 in situ snow observation stations differences in the snow cover detection accuracy by sentinel 2 was also noted to be dependent on the land cover type it was also found that the differences in the accuracy of snow cover detection by sentinel 2 depend on the type of land cover in particular lower accuracies were obtained in closed forests and near water bodies barrou dumont et al 2021 nevertheless systematic false detection such as in topographic shadows can only be detected by comparing with another snow and cloud detection method since most snow observation stations are located in flat terrain and are not shaded comparison between simulated swe and in situ snow observation at madritsch undermined the use of the commonly used swe threshold of 5 mm to distinguish between snow and no snow however this only represents a point comparison at a single station it might well be that the threshold sensitivity varies from site to site in a small case study september 2018 october 2019 we tested the utility and effect of atmospheric correction on snow detection with sentinel 2 from this evaluation atmospherically ac and non atmospherically nac corrected results mostly differ on lower elevated areas using the ac dataset snow detection accuracy increased for the madritsch observation station from 0 85 to 0 94 at a 4 cm threshold but decreased for the lower lying zufritt station from 0 78 to 0 74 at a 4 cm threshold the full figure is available in the supplementary material s 10 in hofmeister et al 2022 major differences can be seen in the topographical analysis where the use of the ac dataset led to underestimation of snow at lower valley locations in this elevation range ac shows a stronger similarity to the eurac product supplementary figure s 11 in hofmeister et al 2022 in contrast ac overestimates the snow cover duration in the 2500 to 3500 m elevation range moreover the performance in southern to north western areas no longer agrees with eurac for this analysis ac is useful for improving snow detection on the point scale as is the case for the madritsch station but leads to underestimation of the snow cover duration at lower elevations 2500 m with weaker illumination and in areas with a southern to western aspect such as the zufritt station comparing the gains and losses in accuracy for both stations we conclude that it is important to critically evaluate the area studied in order to decide whether to use an ac the application of these and other ac algorithms may significantly improve accuracy although in some instances its use does not appear to offer sufficiently significant improvements to justify the larger time requirements and higher computational demand for detecting snow cover 4 3 topographical analysis and optimized wasim setup the topographical analysis revealed differences between the snow cover observations from sentinel 2 and simulation with the standard wasim setup for snow redistribution fig 5 both snow observation products and the snow model are able to reproduce the increase in mean snow cover duration with increasing altitude larger differences can be observed in particular for lower lying areas 2200 m a s l the significant underestimation of snow cover duration by eurac is due to its difficulties in detecting snow in forested areas compared to tum and wasim the large standard deviation of the observation products undermine the large variance in snow detection for the corresponding elevation zone as one elevation zone can include pixels with different slopes aspects and land cover the overestimation of gravitational redistribution can be reduced by optimizing the erosion factor ferosion fig 5a and b for the corresponding elevation zone the simulation of gravitational redistribution is particularly important for avoiding so called snow towers at the peaks and ridges since the ferosion parameter depends on the model time step it must be recalibrated if for instance the model is run with a daily time step in general changes in the erosion factor within the range 0 001 to 0 007 with an hourly model time step significantly affected the model results on slope gradients steeper than 30 besides the erosion factor the ierosion parameter which determines the threshold for commencing gravitational redistribution was adjusted from 45 to 50 fig 5a and b there is no change in the slight overestimation of the simulated mean snow cover duration on slopes from 40 to 50 even after parameter optimization it is therefore assumed that with larger snow accumulations the snowmelt is delayed by the surface energy balance model the activation of wind driven snow redistribution impacts mainly the mean snow cover duration on steep slopes with inclines of over 60 due to the intense snow accumulation in this class fig 5d this shows the limitation of a global erosion factor that is constant in space and time moving to a larger scale the deficits on the slope feature class are levelled out when comparing the mean snow cover duration against aspect several previous studies have determined the effect of aspect on snow cover duration south facing slopes receive more solar radiation which leads to more rapid snow melt and a shorter snow cover duration than on north facing slopes in the northern hemisphere l√≥pez moreno and st√§hli 2008 bouamri et al 2021 the two observation products mainly differ for north and north west exposed areas where tum tends to detect more snow this is partly due to false positives in shaded areas and lower cloud detection in north facing areas supplementary figure s 6 in hofmeister et al 2022 although wasim was able to adjust the radiation and temperature with respect to the topography it was determined that the mean snow cover duration was overestimated for south facing areas fig 5a and b this overestimation can be reduced by taking into consideration the wind driven redistribution with a constant south westerly wind direction fig 5d generally north west to north east located areas indicate the largest spatial variability of mean scd though the simulated mean snow cover duration improved on the catchment scale this simple approach is unable to consider minor or major differences in wind fields and speeds comparing the dispersion of standard deviation of all topographical features it can be seen that the features with the largest spatial variability are slope and aspect 4 4 accuracy and frequencies of observed and simulated snow cover and fsca slight differences in the cumulative frequencies of no snow detection occurred mainly for the lower elevation zones where tum detects more snow areas than eurac it may be that eurac underestimates snow cover in forest areas fig 4b and tum falsely detects snow in areas with low illumination since the canopy snow interception model of wasim was not activated the model tends to overestimate mean snow cover durations when compared to observation products at the same elevations fig 5 besides the systematic offset in cumulative snow detection frequencies between tum and eurac from 10 to 90 areal coverage both approaches agree very well on the presence or absence of full snow coverage fig 6a the simulated snow covered area approaches the eurac product for low snow coverage since the glacier extents originate from this product wasim tends to overestimate snow coverages of between 50 and 95 when compared to the observation products it follows from the distinct decrease in all three accuracy scores in fig 6b that wasim has difficulties in simulating the snow cover recession in the snow melt period from may to july the delayed snow cover recession results in an overestimation of the snow cover for these months which is also evident from an analysis of the fractional snow covered area fig 9 this delay can have different reasons for instance the long wave incoming and outgoing parameters lwincorr and lwoutcorr need a fine tuning based on the snow cover recession during the ablation period may to july consideration of the snow covered area in a multi objective calibration approach would improve the model performance on the catchment scale in addition the use of a multi layer snow model could enhance the simulation of snowmelt by additionally considering heat transfer in the snow pack especially for snow rich winters e g 2018 2019 however the multi layer snow model requires additional calibration parameters to characterize generally unknown soil properties as well as a new calibration as a compact snow pack without a layered snow model reacts quite differently to warming or cooling than a layered snow pack schulla 2021 5 conclusion this study presented the potential and limitations using sentinel 2 images for observing snow cover with a high temporal and spatial resolution in a complex mountainous terrain we also highlighted the additional benefit of using observation data in the process oriented calibration of a physically based snow model to increase the available data sentinel 2 images with up to 80 cloud cover were also considered as they can contain valuable spatial information regarding snow distribution this requires comprehensive cloud detection to avoid false detection of either snow or no snow cloud detection was performed using the idepix pixel classification algorithm in snap for the tum product we tested the snow and cloud detection quality against in situ snow observation on the point scale and also against eurac a second snow and cloud product that is based on a supervised algorithm both observation products generally attained a very high overall f1 accuracy score 0 9 with respect to the in situ station data the advantages of using two different approaches are that it makes it possible both to perform an intercomparison and validation of the respective results and to identify the limitations of the two approaches moreover the use of two products enables us to estimate the range of uncertainty in snow mapping with high resolution optical remote sensing data although both observation products provide consistent estimates of the mean snow cover above the tree line 2300 m a s l distinct differences were observed for the slope feature class the idepix tool in particular tends to make false detections of snow and cloud on steep north facing slopes 60 and to falsely classify snow as cloud in some clear sky situations in winter in contrast the active learning approach of eurac underestimates snow cover in evergreen forest areas unless explicit training pixels are selected the limitation of optical remote sensing products for snow detection under the canopy is a generally well known problem which is why only the snow cover of high altitude regions is usually analysed gascoin et al 2019 future research will be on assessing fractional snow cover in forested areas using optical remote sensing products gascoin et al 2020 unlike the coarse modis data bouamri et al 2021 sentinel 2 enables the investigation of small scale differences in snow cover duration in complex terrains due to gravitational redistribution slope energy balance and wind driven redistribution aspect this makes it possible to calibrate and validate the physically based snow model of wasim in a process oriented manner on different scales point slope and catchment scale with high spatial resolution 25 m depending on the scale and elevation each snow detection approach has its advantages for instance tum performs better at the forested valley bottom while eurac is more reliable at detecting snow on very steep slopes 60 nevertheless the two snow detection approaches should be validated with other observational data e g lidar and compared to other algorithms to further investigate the robustness of these approaches the spatial comparison of observed and simulated snow cover durations revealed limited wasim capabilities on steep slopes 25 with the default parametrization which cloud be partially overcome by calibrating the gravitational redistribution moreover it was shown that the mean snow cover duration computed with wasim at different exposures is not only dependent on the incoming solar radiation but also on the wind driven snow redistribution the optimized wasim model was able to simulate both the mean snow cover duration with a high f1 accuracy score of 0 9 and the fractional snow covered area with a very high correlation coefficient of 0 98 although hydrological analysis would greatly profit from spatially distributed and highly resolved in time information about swe the approach that we propose allows us to constrain two important model parameters for the wasim model by considering only snow cover information our work therefore provides a robust methodology with which it is possible to collect spatio temporal snow cover information to calibrate empirical gravitational snow redistribution models and hence enables multi objective calibration and validation for hydrological model applications in high elevation alpine catchments for further studies we can hypothesis that calibrated wasim model results will also provide more accurate swe estimation and consequently discharge predictions such hypothesis should be tested in a multi objective optimization framework and under the consideration of further observational data such as swe and discharge time series moreover snow cover model results can find application beyond the field of hydrology and are of interest for ecological studies qi et al 2021 wan et al 2014 as well as for the evaluation of the sustainability of winter tourism ebner et al 2021 although we did not include glaciers in this study it is possible to derive further cryospheric products from sentinel 2 e g glacier extents snow line on glacier and glacier albedo to calibrate and validate also glacier modules in hydrological models credit

8557,modelling runoff generation in high elevation alpine catchments requires detailed knowledge on the spatio temporal distribution of snow storage with sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi it is possible to map snow cover with a high temporal and spatial resolution in contrast to the coarse modis data sentinel 2 msi enables the investigation of small scale differences in snow cover duration in complex terrains due to gravitational redistribution slope energy balance and wind driven redistribution aspect in this study we describe the generation of high resolution spatial and temporal snow cover data sets from sentinel 2 images for a high elevation alpine catchment and discuss how the data contribute to our understanding of the spatio temporal snow cover distribution the quality of snow and cloud detection is evaluated against in situ snow observations and against other snow and cloud products the main problem was in the false detection of snow in the presence of clouds and in topographically shaded areas we then seek to explore the potential of the generated high resolution snow cover maps in calibrating the gravitational snow redistribution module of a physically based snow model especially for an area with a very data scarce point snow observation network generally the calibrated snow model is able to simulate both the mean snow cover duration with a high f1 accuracy score of 0 9 and the fractional snow covered area with a correlation coefficient of 0 98 the snow model is also able to reproduce spatio temporal variability in snow cover duration due to surface energy balance dynamics wind and gravitational redistribution keywords snow cover snow redistribution high elevation alpine catchment sentinel 2 physically based snow modelling 1 introduction alpine snow cover and its subsequent melt can dominate local to regional climate and hydrology in both high latitude areas gascoin et al 2019 and the world s mountainous regions dozier and painter 2004 in the european alps snow is the major driver of alpine hydrology storing water during the winter season and releasing it in the spring and summer with impacts on water supply agriculture and hydropower production matiu et al 2021 moreover ongoing climate change in the alps affects the abundance of snow matiu et al 2021 finally snow accumulation and melting processes also depend on topographical parameters such as slope and aspect which are linked to incoming solar radiation gravitational transport and wind redistribution l√≥pez moreno and st√§hli 2008 gr√ºnewald and lehning 2011 l√≥pez moreno et al 2014 gr√ºnewald et al 2014 pedersen et al 2016 gurung et al 2017 mott et al 2018 saydi and ding 2020 vionnet et al 2021 therefore to calibrate and validate models capable of properly capturing snow dynamics in such a complex environment requires accurate observed snow cover maps the standard source of information regarding snow cover is a network of automatic and manual ground based meteorological stations that perform daily or sub daily observations mostly of snow depth romanov et al 2000 however in situ snow observations are generally insufficient for characterizing the high spatial variability of the snow pack in mountainous regions gascoin et al 2019 and are often only suitable for making qualitative comparisons with hydrological model results tuo et al 2018 moreover field measurements are sparse in both space and time and they are subject to several sources of error rasmussen et al 2012 marcolini et al 2019 furthermore only few snow observation stations operate at altitudes above 2000 m which complicates the investigation of altitudinal gradients matiu et al 2019 despite these limitations snow depth ground observations are very valuable when it comes to evaluate snow detection quality using remote sensing products e g foppa et al 2005 gascoin et al 2020 barrou dumont et al 2021 since the launch of the first landsat satellite in the 1970 s remote sensing has become a key tool for mapping snow cover and revealing snow properties at multiple spatial and temporal resolutions romanov et al 2000 dozier and painter 2004 snow can be characterized by many variables such as the snow covered area sca fractional area fsca albedo liquid water content snow depth or snow water equivalent frei et al 2012 in remote sensing applications snow cover is mainly investigated using sca and fsca products on the scale of entire mountain ranges like the alps or pyrenees gascoin et al 2019 remote sensing products supply information about snow covered areas across elevations but they have problems with correct snow detection in cloudy conditions consequently when it comes to improving a snow detection algorithm the main challenge is to reduce misclassification of cloud as snow gascoin et al 2019 another difficulty is in the detection of snow in dense forest areas where the ground is obstructed by the canopy this is particularly the case with evergreen conifer forests in alpine regions di marco et al 2020 besides the influence of forests topographical features such as steep shady slopes can impact the detection of snow by optical remote sensing products gascoin et al 2019 moreover there is a trade off between spatial resolution and swath width i e the acquisition strip of a satellite which influences the observation frequency dozier and painter 2004 despite these limitations spatial snow information derived from satellite data has been used for decades for various purposes including hydrology and water resource management rango et al 1996 hall et al 2012 brown et al 2014 k√§√§b et al 2016 fassnacht et al 2017 the application of modis data to derive snow cover information on a daily or twice daily basis depending on the geographical location is very widespread matiu et al 2019 but their spatial resolution of 500 m is too coarse for hydrological applications in mountain regions where snow cover properties can vary on scales of 10 m to 100 m bl√∂schl 1999 gascoin et al 2019 vionnet et al 2021 in fact although gurung et al 2017 used snow cover maps made with modis to investigate the effect of topography on the sca in very large basins 30 000 km2 bouamri et al 2021 demonstrated that modis is not capable of capturing the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover induced by solar radiation because it does not capture spatial variability below 500 m this limits the usage of modis snow cover maps for calibrating and evaluating spatially distributed snow models bouamri et al 2021 high resolution 30 m snow cover maps can be generated from landsat images but the low temporal revisit time of the landsat mission 16 days is a significant limitation to snow cover monitoring and moreover data availability can be considerably reduced by cloudiness the launch of the second copernicus sentinel 2 satellite in 2017 has made it possible to map the extent of snow cover at a 20 m resolution with a revisit time of 5 days gascoin et al 2019 the high resolution spatial and temporal data collected by sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi are important for enabling detailed investigations of snow cover and snow redistribution processes on the catchment scale foppa et al 2005 sentinel 2 data can therefore not only be used to evaluate the parametrizations of snow melt and redistribution in physically based models but also to actually act or contribute to the objective function used for model calibration mott et al 2010 in general the challenge with physically based snow models even without considering snow redistribution processes is that with increasing catchment size and simultaneous high grid discretization computation times increase significantly when for example multi layer snow models are applied for long periods i e climate change studies the computational effort increases even more when mechanistic snow redistribution approaches in physically based models are applied at the catchment scale thornton et al 2021 hence snow redistribution approaches are mainly based on empirical assumptions in hydrological models and have different levels of complexity a research gap thus exists between the development of process based snow redistribution models i e based on a mechanistic snow redistribution routine freudiger et al 2017 and their experimental validation warscher et al 2013 sch√∂ber et al 2014 frey and holzmann 2015 recently vionnet et al 2021 used the canadian hydrological model chm to simulate small scale variabilities in snow accumulation caused by gravitational redistributions avalanches and blowing snow transport saltation and suspension and among others factors by driving the chm with spatial high resolution 50 m wind fields it was possible to account for the influence of topographical features due to wind speed and direction the simulated snow accumulation was evaluated using high resolution airborne light detection and ranging lidar snow depth data and snow persistence indexes derived from remotely sensed imagery although the chm was able to simulate the small scale variability of snow accumulation there is still the need for optimization snowdrift permitting models for large scale application 1000 km2 in particular the representation of subgrid topographic effects on snow transport vionnet et al 2021 besides the limitation of physically based and fully distributed snow models on the catchment scale due to their heavy computational requirements thornton et al 2021 detailed model input data e g local wind fields are needed when wind driven snow redistribution is simulated with models based on semi empirical parameterizations of the physics of snow transport essery et al 1999 durand et al 2005 liston et al 2007 pomeroy et al 2007 or even with models resolving the 3d turbulent diffusion equation gauer 1998 lehning et al 2008 sauter et al 2013 schneiderbauer and prokop 2011 vionnet et al 2014 for blown snow particles in the atmosphere mott et al 2018 vionnet et al 2021 although sca from satellite products have been used in various studies to calibrate spatially distributed snow models to improve model internal consistency duethmann et al 2014 freudiger et al 2017 thornton et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge satellite data have rarely been used to calibrate snow redistribution routines which are often only calibrated against observed discharge warscher et al 2013 frey and holzmann 2015 in a recent publication thornton et al 2021 also considered parameter optimization of gravitational redistribution in a novel calibration approach for an energy balance based snow model including snow cover maps derived from landsat 8 in this work we aim to develop a high resolution spatial and temporal method of deriving snow cover and further to calibrate and evaluate the wasim water flow and balance simulation model snow module schulla 2021 hence the objective is to perform a process oriented analysis of gravitational snow redistribution and energy balance to accurately estimate the snow cover extent therefore we generated two alternative high resolution snow cover products from sentinel 2 images for a high elevation alpine catchment with a very sparse snow observation network the use of two products allows us to acknowledge the uncertainty affecting also satellite products and to consider it in the calibration of the model to accommodate cloud coverage each of the two snow cover products used a different snow and cloud detection algorithm and we quantified the difference between the resulting snow cover properties cloud detection enables the inclusion of partially clouded sentinel 2 images in the snow cover dataset by setting clouded areas to no data even with cloud cover these images may contain valuable information beyond the cloud extent regarding the snow cover evolution during the melting season and during the onset of snow accumulation finally snow cover maps with high spatial and temporal resolutions allow an accurate analysis of the effect of topographical features elevation slope and aspect on the snow cover duration and provide useful information for assessing simulated snow cover maps from a physically based hydrological model for a period of five years the main novelties of this paper consist in the application of two different i e one unsupervised and one supervised snow and cloud detection algorithms for sentinel 2 images their use for hydrological model calibration in a topographically complex region including an assessment of the differences between the two products and an investigation of the effects of topography elevation slope and aspect on mean snow cover duration 2 data and methods 2 1 research area and in situ snow observation the upper martell valley martelltal val martello is an alpine valley with a sw ne orientation located in the upper adige catchment in south tyrol italy covering an area of 65 km2 to evaluate the satellite products the research area was slightly expanded to the west to include the snow observations collected at the madritsch station located in the neighbouring sulden valley the upper martell valley has an elevation range of 1840 m a s l to 3760 m a s l with a mean altitude of 2814 m a s l sonny 2017 and the dominant land cover classes are bare rock 41 sparse vegetation 34 and glaciers 19 environment european agency clc corine 2018 coniferous forest covers only 6 of the catchment at elevations lower than 2370 m a s l along the ridges extremely steep slopes with inclinations of 60 highlighted in red in the overview map fig 1 can be found throughout the area the main river of the upper martell valley is the plima which flows into the zufritt gioveretto reservoir the runoff regime is dominated by glaciers and snow melt with high flows during the spring and summer and low flows during winter puspitarini et al 2020 there are also 107 lakes of proglacial origin in the catchment previous hydrological studies investigating the mass balance of the langenferner glacier galos et al 2017 galos and klug 2015 and the impact of glacier shrinking on hydropower production puspitarini et al 2020 also focused on this study area in addition the catastrophic flood event from 1987 was the subject of several vulnerability assessment studies totschnig and fuchs 2013 papathoma k√∂hle et al 2015 there is only a sparse observation network of meteorological stations covering the upper martell valley the station at the langenferner la glacier is the only one located inside the upper martell valley at the zufall snow station snow surveys are performed manually at weekly intervals during the winter period continuous snow depth observations are available from the madritsch zufritt and rossbaenke stations from various elevations and valleys the investigation period of this study covers the period with most available station data from october 2014 to september 2020 table 1 gives detailed information of the in situ snow observations and meteorological stations and the latter are used as model forcing in the hydrological model wasim 2 2 methods two snow and cloud detection approaches named tum unsupervised algorithm and eurac supervised algorithm respectively are applied to identify the snow covered area in the catchment over the study period these data sets are compared to the hydrological model wasim results with different parametrizations of snow redistribution i e default and optimized parameters fig 2 gives a comprehensive overview of the individual processing steps used in the observed and simulated snow cover maps 2 2 1 tum approach for sentinel 2 snow cover map covering most of the period june 2015 to october 2020 439 sentinel 2 level 1c images were downloaded with the r toolbox sen2r ranghetti et al 2020 for the area of interest aoi including all seasons of the year the level 1c product type provides top of the atmosphere reflectance in cartographic geometry projected in utm wgs84 european space agency 2021 the spectral bands central wavelength and spatial resolution of the sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi are listed in the supplementary material of hofmeister et al 2022 using eq 1 the normalized difference snow index ndsi was calculated for each image after resampling band 11 from 20 m to 10 m resolution cimpianu 2018 the ndsi uses the distinct reflection signature of snow surfaces with very high reflectance in the visible spectrum and strong absorption in the short wave infrared range gascoin et al 2019 1 ndsi green s w i r green s w i r where green corresponds to sentinel 2 band 3 wavelength 0 560 ¬µm and swir is short wave infrared represented by band 11 wavelength 1 610 ¬µm an ndsi pixel is classified as snow if the ndsi value is 0 4 dozier 1989 larger ndsi values are classified as snow free the ndsi threshold was the same for all images several cloud detection approaches have been developed for sentinel 2 images such as sen2cor idepix fmask maja and sentinel hub s cloud detector menekay 2019 in this study cloud detection was performed using cloud masks created by the identification of pixel properties algorithms idepix from the sentinel application platform snap v7 0 european space agency 2021 at 60 m spatial resolution idepix is a single scene method and therefore suitable for cloud detection over changing terrain conditions such as snow accumulation and melt since it is available as an snap plugin it is very user friendly fast and effective at providing cloud masks idepix combines cloud masks with sun geometry to search regions of maximum probability for cloud shadow pixels in the projected region of potential cloud shadow the cloud mask is shifted along the illumination path towards the surface reflectance minimum idepix can identify different types of pixels such as semi transparent clouds fully opaque clouds cirrus clouds cloud shadows and even mountain shadows this study employs idepix cloud classification which includes cloud pixels identified with full confidence as well as pixels identified with uncertainty as clouds clouded pixels were set to no data the snow and cloud maps were masked to the extent of the area of interest and resampled with the nearest neighbour method to the same spatial resolution as that of the hydrological model 25 m we excluded highly clouded 80 images from further analysis which reduced the total number of images to 366 following an initial assessment of the cloud maps we observed that the cloud maps generated with idepix tended to overestimate cloudiness due to mountain shadows since low illuminated areas with low spectral reflectance are misclassified as clouds therefore only cloud covered areas for which no snow was detected by the ndsi were set to no data this enables the snow detection under clouds thanks to semi transparency in swir which would otherwise be masked by the idepix cloud mask in addition the cloud masks are very conservative since they are calculated with a coarser resolution 60 m compared to the snow maps 20 m which would mask out too many pixels especially in the peripheral areas of the clouds for which the snow detection might be correct serco italia 2017 water bodies were also set to no data since their reflectance is often very similar to that of a snow surface dozier 1989 to test the utility of atmospheric correction over satellite imagery for snow cover detection a set of atmospherically corrected sentinel 2 images september 2018 october 2019 was analysed and compared against the methods used the correction was applied using second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum 6s as developed by vermote et al 1997 which uses radiative transfer models rtms to simulate the passage of solar radiation across the atmosphere the 6s algorithm is adapted to a python py6s interface wilson 2012 and was implemented recently for use with the google earth engine murphy 2018 via a python api and docker container 2 2 2 eurac approach for sentinel 2 snow cover map the eurac snow algorithm also takes the sentinel 2 level 1c data as its input as pre processing step the sentinel 2 images are scaled from digital number dn to reflectance values using the quantification value provided in the sentinel 2 metadata i e equal to 10 000 for all the considered images thus all bands are reprojected and resampled to the final model resolution of 25 m using cubic interpolation the classification algorithm consists of two steps i cloud detection and ii snow detection in both cases a support vector machine svm classifier is trained with an active learning al procedure by dividing the procedure into two steps it is possible to exploit the most representative features of each of the two classification problems the al procedure allows us to speed up the learning curve of the classification by asking the user to specify the label of the most uncertain pixels for cloud detection when a pixel is classified as cloud or no cloud all spectral bands of the sentinel 2 are considered except for those at 60 m resolution i e bands 1 9 and 10 moreover the eurac approach uses additional features such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi calculated as the normalized difference between near the infrared nir and red bands in addition to the ndsi which have been shown to introduce benefits into the classification tarrio et al 2020 for snow detection there are three possible classes snow snow free and hard shadow the difference between shadow and hard shadows is defined in terms of energy recorded by the sensor if the recorded energy is too low to distinguish between snow and snow free areas i e the signal to noise ratio snr of the sensor is too low we call it hard shadow this is generally the case when the sun is low on the horizon which is from approximately mid november to mid february at the latitude of the martell valley and the terrain is particularly steep in order to define a threshold under which the recorded energy by the sensor is too low we selected samples for which the human photo interpreter cannot distinguish whether the pixel is snow or snow free low reflectance situations generally associated with dark areas e g turbid lake shadow by cloud or terrain flooded areas etc are excluded from snow detection from state of the art and operational algorithms applying thresholds on the visible bands e g modis snow cover product version 6 riggs and hall 2015 the shadow detection is performed with a svm classifier together with the snow detection after masking out the clouds in addition to the spectral bands and features also used for cloud detection the classifier includes illumination angle as a further input feature the illumination angle is calculated from the solar zenith and the solar azimuth angle riano et al 2003 and enables better mitigation of the effect of the differences in the solar illumination during the year the svm has been trained in order to emphasize the presence of snow also in mixed conditions this is done by assigning the class snow to those pixels whose spectral characteristics can be attributed to the presence of snow by a careful visual inspection for both svm models snow and cloud we used a radial basis function kernel and performed a model parameters selection according to a grid search strategy to identify the regularization parameter c and the kernel coefficient gamma the grid is initialized with a user defined range the model selection start with a coarse grid and then given the obtained results is refined around the values of c and gamma that perform the best the best values are selected by evaluating the mean and standard deviation of the over accuracy calculated in a cross validation strategy with k folder k 5 for the cloud detection we collected 173 training points 97 cloud free samples and 76 cloud samples the selected parameters are c equal to 9 885 and gamma equal to 0 896 the number of selected support vectors is 98 the accuracy from the cross validation is 0 82 and the standard deviation is 0 1 by considering the 5 folds the low accuracy during the training shows the difficulty in the cloud discrimination during winter condition with the spectral bands provided by sentinel 2 sensor for the snow detection we considered three classes of training samples we collected 177 snow free samples 264 snow samples and 138 shadow samples for a total amount of 579 samples the selected c value is 30 018 and gamma is 0 0003 the number of support vectors was 445 and the accuracy from the cross validation is 0 98 with a standard deviation of 0 1 the samples are collected initially from two scenes and then we adopted an iterative active learning procedure to collect new samples the active learning procedure ask the user the labels of the most uncertain samples i e the ones with computed probabilities for the assigned class are low the probability was calculated according to lin et al 2007 it should be mentioned that at the time of the analyses for this publication the eurac approach is still in the final stage of the development but it was applied already once in a previous study ebner et al 2021 the eurac approach was chosen to verify the tum snow detection results because the supervised algorithm should be more accurate than the unsupervised tum product as in the tum method water bodies were set to no data 2 2 3 snow cover simulation with wasim the snow module of the physically based hydrological model wasim version 10 04 07 schulla 2021 was used as an example for demonstrating the benefits of high resolution snow cover maps in calibrating simulated snow redistribution for snow melt simulation the energy balance approach including gravitational snow redistribution was selected as originally implemented by warscher et al 2013 we also tested the effect of wind driven snow redistribution warscher et al 2013 schulla 2021 canopy snow interception was not considered in this study because of the small proportion of coniferous forest 6 the multi layer snow model was deactivated to keep the computational time reasonable limit the number of calibration parameters and avoid the need to define multiple soil and snow parameters the topography dependent adjustment of radiation and air temperature follows the scheme devised by oke 2002 the parametrization of the snow accumulation and gravitational snow redistribution table 2 originates in part from the wasim user manual schulla 2021 and f√∂rster et al 2018 whereas the correction factor for incoming long wave radiation lwincorr was slightly increased from 1 0 to 1 1 considering the observations available for may and june the equations for energy balance approach psnow lwincorr and lwoutcorr can be found in the wasim user manual which is available in the supplementary material hofmeister et al 2022 to account for solid precipitation undercatch of rain gauges we used a wind dependent snow correction factor snowb of 0 1 s m as also used by f√∂rster et al 2018 and confirmed by kochendorfer et al 2016 gravitational snow redistribution is based on a computationally efficient mass conserving algorithm that parameterizes the gravitational transport and deposition developed by gruber 2007 and later implemented in wasim by warscher et al 2013 four parameter grids that specify the sliding fractions for each of the cardinal directions n e s w were generated using the wasim preprocessing tool tanalys total outflow from the gravitational model mout is determined by eq 2 2 mout ferosion m i n d g r a v i f i i e r o s i o n a n d s w e 0 m i n d g r a v i f i i e r o s i o n a n d s w e

which depends on the time step i is the local slope ierosion is the lower inclination limit for snow erosion depending on the spatial resolution and dgrav is the deposition in the current cell mm the

masses will be transported to the next downslope cell s in this work we show how ierosion and ferosion can be calibrated to improve the model s performance using sentinel 2 snow cover data wind driven snow redistribution can also be simulated with wasim however the approach implemented is in fact a kind of snow precipitation correction by which areas sheltered from the main wind direction receive an increased snow fall and areas exposed to the main wind direction receive a reduced snow fall amount which cells are exposed or sheltered is estimated using the directed sky view factor svfdir for this study the main wind direction was set to south west 180 to 270 which corresponds with the main wind direction of the langenferner meteorological station mean wind direction 229 54 for the snow accumulation period october to may the snow precipitation is corrected by equation 5 5 psnow p s n o w c w i n d p s n o w where psnow is the solid precipitation and cwind is the correction factor which is determined by equation 6 6 cwind e d m a x 1 s v f d i r 1 c m i n where e is a linear elevation weighting factor svfdir is the directed sky view factor dmax is the maximum possible deposition and cmin is the minimum correction factor for shifting cwind to a more or less solid precipitation correction the parameter e ranges from 0 at the lowest elevated pixel to 1 at the highest pixel and linearly scales the amount of snow redistribution warscher 2014 the impact on the mean snow cover duration was tested on different spatial scales by performing different model simulations with and without activated wind driven snow redistribution the time series of all meteorological stations illustrated in fig 1 and listed in table 1 are spatially interpolated with an elevation dependent regression i e temperature wind speed and humidity and inverse distance weighting idw for precipitation and solar radiation the simulation period covers six years from 2014 10 01 to 2020 09 30 in hourly time steps however the simulated snow maps were only saved as daily means the selection of the spatial resolution 25 m was a compromise between the level of detail and the computational demand previous hydrological applications of wasim used a 50 m spatial and 1 h temporal resolution for alpine catchments kraller et al 2012 warscher et al 2013 f√∂rster et al 2018 or even 25 m in the most recent application thornton et al 2021 two different exceedance threshold values 0 mm and 5 mm swe for classification as either snow or no snow were tested to ensure consistency in the comparison with the observed snow maps clouded areas from the tum product and water bodies were set to no data in the snow cover maps produced by wasim since the dynamic glacier model of wasim requires a comprehensive calibration which increases the model complexity it was not activated and glaciered areas were set to constantly snow covered in the simulated snow maps although glaciers are a key contributor to runoff generation in this area the focus of this study is to examine the spatio temporal variability of the snowpack glaciered areas were derived for each year from the cloudless snow cover map for august or september taken from the eurac product since the tum product showed an tendency of false snow detection on some very steep 60 north facing slopes which would partly lead to wrong glacier delineation 2 2 4 analysis of observed snow cover maps the quality of snow no snow detection is evaluated against the in situ snow observation by calculating the accuracy score f1 equation 7 based on the confusion matrix in table 3 the f1 score divides the sum of all true positive tp and true negative tn matches by the total population n accuracy was only computed at three snow observation stations with continuous snow depth recordings 2 2 5 analysis of topographical feature on observed and simulated snow cover the influence of topographic characteristics e g elevation slope or aspect on the observed and simulated mean snow cover duration is analysed such that all grid cells with the same topographical characteristics e g elevation slope and exposition are aggregated to mean snow cover duration over the entire period of 6 years following equation 7 the snow cover duration scd d for each pixel of the domain in an hydrological year was computed following dietz et al 2012 7 scd 365 25 n i 1 n s i where n is the number of days with sentinel 2 recorded data beginning with 1 october and ending with 30 september of the next year on average the length of a year is 365 25 days considering leap years si refers to the cloud free daily snow cover data set recorded to values one for snow and zero for snow free area accordingly we calculated the mean and standard deviation of snow cover duration of all pixels of the 366 snow cover maps with respect to the three topographical feature classes i e aggregation of elevation in ten meter classes slope and exposition in three degree classes 2 2 6 comparison of observed and simulated snow cover maps a pixel by pixel spatial analysis was performed to evaluate the simulated snow cover maps against the two different observed snow maps at the catchment scale two additional performance measures are thus introduced the f2 score equation 8 and the f3 score equation 9 which are often used to evaluate binary classifications aronica et al 2002 warscher et al 2013 thornton et al 2021 the range of the f1 and f2 scores is from zero to one while f3 ranges from to one all scores are 1 if the simulated snow cover perfectly matches the observed one the f1 score tends to show the highest performance values since it takes only true positives and true negatives into account and these are usually high during winter and summer f2 and f3 exclude true no snow pixels and are therefore more sensitive to differences in snow cover warscher et al 2013 f3 is even more sensitive to snow extent than f2 due to the subtraction of the false positives in the numerator f1 score 8 f 1 i 1 n t p i 1 n t n n f2 score 9 f 2 i 1 n t p i 1 n t p i 1 n f p i 1 n f n f3 score 10 f 3 i 1 n t p i 1 n f p i 1 n t p i 1 n f p i 1 n f n for a further spatial comparison of observed and simulated snow products the fractional snow covered area fsca is also considered fsca is defined as the ratio between the number of pixels classified as snow covered and the total number of pixels excluding clouds and lakes di marco et al 2020 as shown in equation 10 11 fsca nsnow ntot n c l o u d s where nsnow is the number of snow cover pixels according to the sentinel 2 dataset or wasim ntot is the total number of pixels representing the overall catchment area and nclouds are the pixels classified as cloud and water bodies 3 results 3 1 comparison of cloud detection by tum and eurac in terms of the empirical cumulative cloud detection frequency eurac detects a higher proportion of cloud within the range of 15 to 80 areal coverage than the tum product fig 3 a however both products are able to detect complete cloud cover and clear sky situations equally well besides cirrus high altitude clouds and other clouds the image processing algorithms also include topographic shadows which are of particular interest in complex terrains such as the upper martell valley the ability to detect topographic shadows is especially important in mid latitude areas during the winter period where the solar elevation is very low typically below 20 gascoin et al 2020 differences between the two approaches and their limitations in terms of cloud and shadow detection are illustrated in an example for january 27 2017 when no clouds were present in the aoi fig 3b however the low inclination angle of the sun produces extensive shading in the southern and eastern parts of the aoi cloud detection by tum fig 3c falsely classifies some snow free ridges or snow free steep slopes as clouds on the other hand the eurac method fig 3d detects more shaded areas in the south eastern area however both approaches fail to fully detect the topographic shadows on the forested southern valley bottom which are classified as snow covered regions 3 2 in situ comparisons of snow cover detection by tum and eurac the quality of snow detection was tested against three snow observation stations for various snow depth thresholds that differentiate between snow and no snow the detection accuracy was calculated by the f1 score equation 7 snow detection varies not only according to the chosen detection method tum or eurac but also according to the observation sites fig 4 and supplementary table s 7 in hofmeister et al 2022 the most accurate score f1 0 97 was obtained with both products for snow depth thresholds ranging between 4 cm and 15 cm for the rossbaenke station which is surrounded by grassland both tum and eurac attained a similar detection accuracy at the madritsch station however decreasing with increasing snow depth threshold the highest accuracy of 0 96 tum and 0 97 eurac is reached at a snow depth threshold of 1 cm due to the station s relatively high altitude 2825 m a s l the land cover of the surrounding area is mainly composed of gravel and debris therefore it can be assumed that there is no interference between the spectral characteristics of the snow cover and those of the vegetation the main differences between the snow detection products are observed for the lowest snow observation station of zufritt which is surrounded by forest and grassland whereas the tum product has a detection accuracy 0 91 for snow depth thresholds between one and ten cm the detection accuracy of the eurac product does not exceed 0 83 for the same threshold range the lowest performance is probably due to the presence of permanently mixed pixels such as forest and grassland in fact the spectral characteristics of these pixels do not show a snow presence 50 see 2 2 2 in this case a canopy correction is required to prevent error the optimum snow detection accuracy of 0 95 for tum and 0 92 for eurac based on all stations was found at a 4 cm threshold showing that in general a larger snow quantity i e a closed snow cover with a few centimetres depth 4 cm is needed on the ground to enable better identification of snow from sentinel 2 images we also tested two different exceedance thresholds for simulated swe 0 mm and 5 mm in order to convert swe to binary snow cover maps the commonly used exceedance threshold of 5 mm warscher et al 2013 schulla 2021 thornton et al 2021 attained a slightly higher f1 prediction accuracy of 0 95 compared to 0 92 for 0 mm at the madritsch snow observation station however since only one snow observation station with continuous snow depth recording is located in the research area it is not possible to make any general statements about the robustness of the exceedance threshold 3 3 calibration and analysis of snow redistribution as modelled by wasim topographical analysis not only allows the impact of topographic features such as elevation slope and aspect on the mean snow cover duration to be investigated but also enables a process orientated evaluation of the simulation results and calibration of the gravitational redistribution simulated by wasim with respect to different slope gradients a total of four simulation results were analysed with different snow redistributions table 4 simulations a and c were performed with the default wasim parametrization of ierosion minimum slope for creating slides and ferosion fraction of snow pack that forms a slide while simulations b and c used optimized parameters for this analysis all pixel values of all 366 snow cover maps were aggregated by each topographic feature class elevation slope and exposure and the mean and average standard deviation of the snow cover duration scd was estimated for each class fig 5 as explained in section 2 2 5 although the elevation gradient of the mean snow cover duration and the standard deviation bands quantified for one mean standard deviation are very similar for both observation and simulation in the range 2300 to 3500 m a s l distinct differences can be observed in the lower 2300 m a s l elevation zones the eurac snow maps distinctly show lower mean snow cover duration values than tum and wasim accompanied by broadening of standard deviation band at the valley bottom 2300 m a s l due to the presence of forest and a higher mountain shadow detection supplementary figure s 6 in hofmeister et al 2022 although the tum product also displays higher variance in the low elevation range it shows better agreement with the simulated snow cover duration in the elevation range from 2800 to 3400 m a s l relatively wide standard deviation bands indicate a large spatial heterogeneity in mean scd mean scd varies only slightly for the highest elevation bands 3500 m a s l the impact of ierosion on the mean scd is visible on the slope feature class in fig 5 we can observe that an ierosion value of 45 does not reproduce the turning point in the mean scd as it is present in both the tum and eurac products hence an analysis of the satellite data enables us to determine the value of ierosion by applying a grid search approach to find the minimum distance between the peak of mean scd at slopes between 40 to 50 in observation and model results the optimum ierosion value was found at 50 the ferosion parameter was lowered in 0 001 steps from the default value 0 007 to 0 001 and the best parameter 0 002 determined taking into account the best combination of mean pearson correlation 0 73 and rmse mean scd of 25 7 d with ierosion set to 50 see supplementary figure s 8 in hofmeister et al 2022 wind driven snow redistribution was activated for the simulation runs c and d the small differences in performance of the simulated snow cover duration in the highest elevation zones 3500 m a s l can be explained by the steeper topography in which more snow is redistributed by gravitational slides the greatest simulated gravitational redistribution occurs with the default parametrization of ferosion fig 5a in this elevation zone in contrast the optimized gravitational redistribution fig 5b shows better agreement with the observed mean scd the activation of wind driven redistribution leads to a distinct reduction in the mean snow cover duration in the range from 2800 to 3500 m a s l fig 5b and d the effect of gravitational redistribution is most clearly visible on slope gradients steeper than 30 with the default parametrization of ierosion 45 and ferosion 0 007 wasim relocates snow from steep slopes 45 to flatter areas which results in very low snow cover durations for slopes above 45 accompanied by a sudden change in the standard deviation fig 5a and c the wind driven redistribution has barely any detectable effect on the simulated mean snow cover duration on the slope feature class with the exception of the steepest slopes 60 for which a small increase can be observed fig 5b and d the final topographical characteristic to be evaluated is aspect exposure the mean scd on areas of different exposure depends mainly on the incoming solar radiation topographical shadowing and on wind driven snow redistribution the influence of exposure on the mean scd is clearly visible in fig 5 with the highest values 250 d on north and north east facing slopes and the lowest 200 d on south facing slopes as with the slopes the relatively large standard deviation bands indicate a high variability of scd in areas with similar exposure although the mean scd shape is very similar for the tum and eurac products a systematic offset between both products overall mean of scd by tum 241 d and eurac 226 d is present which is more pronounced with the northern exposure this can be explained by the differences in cloud and mountain shadow detection by the products while the eurac cloud product shows no influence of aspect with a constant overall mean cloud coverage of around 20 the tum product detects more clouds on south facing areas overall mean cloud coverage of 20 than on north facing ones overall mean cloud coverage of 14 supplementary figure s 6 in hofmeister et al 2022 activated wind driven redistribution leads to better agreement between the observed and simulated mean snow cover durations on areas from east to west exposure fig 5d in the following comparison we will refer only to the best wasim setup with the optimized gravitational snow and activated wind redistribution configuration d 3 4 comparison and accuracy of observed and simulated snow cover products the cumulative snow and no snow frequency curves show a strong similarity in the snow detection and simulated values fig 6 a the cumulative no snow frequency curves diverge with no snow coverage 10 in the lower elevation ranges of the aoi although the frequency response with snow detection is quite similar there is a systematic offset between the snow detected by tum and eurac from 10 to 90 areal coverage eurac tends to detect a lower snow cover probability than tum this is because the eurac classification was trained with the majority of mixed pixels being considered as snow free the simulated snow cover frequencies follow the same response as the detections but the model has a slight tendency to overestimate the snow covered area within the 60 to 90 areal coverage range overall accuracy scores for both tum and eurac snow detection are very high f1 0 97 f2 0 91 f3 0 9 only dropping in august to 0 8 for f2 and f3 respectively as can be seen in fig 6b the overall accuracy scores of tum wasim f1 0 93 f2 0 83 f3 0 75 and eurac wasim f1 0 93 f2 0 83 f3 0 71 provide further evidence that the model is able to simulate the spatial snow distribution in the research area well comparison of the mean scores on a monthly scale reveals the part of the season in which the model has a reduced accuracy in the snow cover distribution simulation the critical months are the beginning of the accumulation periods october with an overall mean fsca of 45 eurac 57 tum and 56 wasim and ablation june with an overall mean fsca of 52 eurac 55 tum and 58 wasim although they still have a mean f1 score of above 0 8 the f2 and f3 scores exclude the no snow pixels and accordingly result in lower scores warscher et al 2013 3 5 comparison of snow cover frequencies and fractional snow covered area fsca differences between observed and simulated snow cover days scds at the pixel scale were investigated in more detail for each hydrological year 1 oct 30 sept as illustrated in fig 7 in general the hydrological years 2016 and 2017 had a shorter snow coverage period than the subsequent three years 2018 2019 and 2020 the lower snow coverage in 2016 and 2017 results in better visual agreement between the two snow observation products however the relatively high standard deviations 74 d given in table 5 indicate a greater variance in the snow cover days within the aoi wasim simulates a higher snow cover duration for both years which also results in a slightly lower standard deviation of scds 73 d a distinct tendency towards overestimation of the scds can be observed especially for the hydrological year 2016 for the snow rich years 2018 2019 and 2020 tum shows a higher frequency of mean scds in the range above 250 d than eurac in terms of the observed and simulated scds the wasim results are more similar to those of tum snow detection for the corresponding period than they are to those of eurac with increasing mean scds the standard deviation decreases indicating a lower heterogeneity in the snow cover duration the overall mean gives the mean and standard deviation of each snow product for the whole investigation period 2016 2020 the overall mean scds of 236 d confirms the tendency of eurac to underestimate the snow cover duration as compared with tum 251 d and wasim 258 d and also shows the highest variability in snow cover duration with a mean standard deviation of 64 d the standard deviation shows that the snow cover duration varies greatly from year to year and declines in snowy winters with long snow cover durations such as in 2018 2019 moreover the standard deviation of scds obtained from wasim is systematically lower than the one observed without taking canopy interference into consideration fig 7 shows the comparison among the frequencies of snow cover days and reveals the tendency of wasim to underestimate the snow cover duration in the 360 scds bin and to overestimate it in the following bin 360 scds corresponding to perpetual snow cover moreover wasim simulation results in a longer snow cover duration than the two observation products for the classes 260 d and 270 d in the extreme winter 2018 2019 given that the frequency of snow cover days does not allow any spatial comparison between the two approaches and the simulated maps fig 8 compares case studies for a hydrological year with 2020 and without 2019 good agreement eurac shows differences in snow detection at the valley bottom in forested areas and on steep slopes for both winters 2019 and 2020 these often being set to no data due to the presence of shadows moreover the presence of clouds impacts snow and ice detection on the glaciered areas the tum snow cover product mostly has problems with overestimations of snow cover at the bottom of steep north facing slopes topographical features such as ridges and slopes are highly visible in both products as is interference from vegetation especially with respect to the year 2020 as snow cover duration increases topographical features become less visible as is the case for 2019 however eurac also underestimates the snow cover days on the forested valley bottom in the snow rich year 2019 when compared with tum the hydrological model wasim is well able to simulate the spatial distribution of snow cover days for both seasons but overestimates the snow cover duration at the valley bottom and to some extent at the highest elevations 3000 m a s l for the snow rich year 2019 the main topographical features ridges and slopes are also represented by the model activated wind redistribution leads to a longer snow cover duration on north east facing slopes which are also partially present in the observation products in contrast wasim underestimates the snow cover duration in west facing areas due to wind driven snow erosion as is the case for the madritsch snow station and the surrounding area canopy snow interception was not considered in the model and is therefore not discernible in the valley bottom the fractional snow covered area fsca of the two observation products and the simulation results were evaluated for a more quantitative comparison fig 9 the fsca shows strong seasonality in all products although the simulated snow coverage given by wasim is in line with that observed by eurac there are larger fsca in the ablation period june and july of the years 2016 14 2 2017 3 2 and 2020 8 6 but also for new snow events in august and september of the years 2017 8 5 and to some extent 2018 5 5 this pattern is mainly present when comparing wasim with tum for some dates of the years 2016 and 2017 however these differences are not as pronounced as for the eurac product as an overall mean wasim overestimates the eurac fsca by 5 1 and slightly underestimates the tum fsca by 0 6 during the ablation period june and july the overall pearson correlation of fractional snow covered areas is 0 98 for eurac and wasim and 0 98 for tum and wasim 4 discussion 4 1 cloud detection by tum and eurac in this work we tested the extent to which a simple snow and cloud detection approach tum performs in a complex terrain and determined what limitations might occur previous evaluations have found that idepix overclassifies possible cloud shadow pixels alvera azc√°rate et al 2021 although idepix has been tested for a wide selection of regions it still has limitations and weaknesses in cloud detection that have not been completely resolved the main difficulties are in its ability to distinguish between cloud and snow ice and to detect optically very thin clouds brockmann consult gmbh 2017 in a visual inspection for the years 2015 and 2016 based on idepix cloud products we observed that snow was systematically falsely classified as cloud in clear sky situations during the winter due to the presence of topographical shadows see supplementary figure s 9 in hofmeister et al 2022 which would lead to an underestimation of snow cover if the erroneously detected clouds are set to no data snow detection by ndsi was therefore given a higher confidence rating than cloud detection by idepix and clouded areas were only set to no data when the binary snow detection value was zero this resulted in false snow detection for a few pixels on steep shaded slopes with low illumination this effect is also shown by tum on the slope feature class fig 5 where the variance in the mean snow cover duration increased for very steep slopes 60 when compared to eurac the complementation by the idepix mountain shadow layer might reduce false snow and cloud detection on steep and shaded slopes the eurac algorithm is based on an ml approach that uses multi temporal training samples even if the samples are collected over a large variety of scenes including different illumination conditions a single model is used and the quality of the classification still depends on the conditions of the scene this is mainly due to the limited spectral information provided by sentinel 2 which is insufficient for solving all ambiguities unlike the single scene cloud detection of idepix the eurac product is able to classify mountain shadows on north facing slopes as can be seen in the case study on cloud detection in fig 3d additionally it has the highest snow detection confidence even in steep terrain as can be concluded from the narrow uncertainty band in fig 5 since it uses an active learning approach the cloud and snow detection quality relies on the user selecting the appropriate training pixels it is sometimes difficult to visually assign the correct class to pixels showing mixed characteristics such as shadowed or forested areas in these pixels the classifier usually returns an uncertain probability i e around 50 of the pixel belonging to the snow class in general cloud detection by both idepix and ml requires deeper investigation over forested areas in alpine catchments moreover a comparison with other available remote sensing snow cover products e g gascoin et al 2019 di marco et al 2020 may be beneficial for the future 4 2 validation of snow detection quality through in situ snow observation the individual selection of a snow depth threshold is recommended when comparing remote sensing and ground snow cover information in fact each snow observation site has its own characteristics such as elevation aspect exposure to wind and land cover that influence this comparison due to the additional interference between vegetation and snow cover detection validation by in situ snow observation is more accurate for sites located above the forest line moreover the mixed pixel issue of different spectral signatures can impact the binary snow and no snow information for small snow depth thresholds 4 cm a high snow detection sensitivity can be observed at the rossbaenke site due to interference of grass cover with the snow fig 4 one way of reducing this error would be to filter the snow depth observations to avoid noise caused by the ground i e grass nevertheless a good level of accuracy can be achieved for lower lying sites that are surrounded by coniferous forest and grassland as is the case for the tum snow product barrou dumont et al 2021 found an optimal threshold value even at 1 cm snow depth by analysing a very large data set of 1764 in situ snow observation stations differences in the snow cover detection accuracy by sentinel 2 was also noted to be dependent on the land cover type it was also found that the differences in the accuracy of snow cover detection by sentinel 2 depend on the type of land cover in particular lower accuracies were obtained in closed forests and near water bodies barrou dumont et al 2021 nevertheless systematic false detection such as in topographic shadows can only be detected by comparing with another snow and cloud detection method since most snow observation stations are located in flat terrain and are not shaded comparison between simulated swe and in situ snow observation at madritsch undermined the use of the commonly used swe threshold of 5 mm to distinguish between snow and no snow however this only represents a point comparison at a single station it might well be that the threshold sensitivity varies from site to site in a small case study september 2018 october 2019 we tested the utility and effect of atmospheric correction on snow detection with sentinel 2 from this evaluation atmospherically ac and non atmospherically nac corrected results mostly differ on lower elevated areas using the ac dataset snow detection accuracy increased for the madritsch observation station from 0 85 to 0 94 at a 4 cm threshold but decreased for the lower lying zufritt station from 0 78 to 0 74 at a 4 cm threshold the full figure is available in the supplementary material s 10 in hofmeister et al 2022 major differences can be seen in the topographical analysis where the use of the ac dataset led to underestimation of snow at lower valley locations in this elevation range ac shows a stronger similarity to the eurac product supplementary figure s 11 in hofmeister et al 2022 in contrast ac overestimates the snow cover duration in the 2500 to 3500 m elevation range moreover the performance in southern to north western areas no longer agrees with eurac for this analysis ac is useful for improving snow detection on the point scale as is the case for the madritsch station but leads to underestimation of the snow cover duration at lower elevations 2500 m with weaker illumination and in areas with a southern to western aspect such as the zufritt station comparing the gains and losses in accuracy for both stations we conclude that it is important to critically evaluate the area studied in order to decide whether to use an ac the application of these and other ac algorithms may significantly improve accuracy although in some instances its use does not appear to offer sufficiently significant improvements to justify the larger time requirements and higher computational demand for detecting snow cover 4 3 topographical analysis and optimized wasim setup the topographical analysis revealed differences between the snow cover observations from sentinel 2 and simulation with the standard wasim setup for snow redistribution fig 5 both snow observation products and the snow model are able to reproduce the increase in mean snow cover duration with increasing altitude larger differences can be observed in particular for lower lying areas 2200 m a s l the significant underestimation of snow cover duration by eurac is due to its difficulties in detecting snow in forested areas compared to tum and wasim the large standard deviation of the observation products undermine the large variance in snow detection for the corresponding elevation zone as one elevation zone can include pixels with different slopes aspects and land cover the overestimation of gravitational redistribution can be reduced by optimizing the erosion factor ferosion fig 5a and b for the corresponding elevation zone the simulation of gravitational redistribution is particularly important for avoiding so called snow towers at the peaks and ridges since the ferosion parameter depends on the model time step it must be recalibrated if for instance the model is run with a daily time step in general changes in the erosion factor within the range 0 001 to 0 007 with an hourly model time step significantly affected the model results on slope gradients steeper than 30 besides the erosion factor the ierosion parameter which determines the threshold for commencing gravitational redistribution was adjusted from 45 to 50 fig 5a and b there is no change in the slight overestimation of the simulated mean snow cover duration on slopes from 40 to 50 even after parameter optimization it is therefore assumed that with larger snow accumulations the snowmelt is delayed by the surface energy balance model the activation of wind driven snow redistribution impacts mainly the mean snow cover duration on steep slopes with inclines of over 60 due to the intense snow accumulation in this class fig 5d this shows the limitation of a global erosion factor that is constant in space and time moving to a larger scale the deficits on the slope feature class are levelled out when comparing the mean snow cover duration against aspect several previous studies have determined the effect of aspect on snow cover duration south facing slopes receive more solar radiation which leads to more rapid snow melt and a shorter snow cover duration than on north facing slopes in the northern hemisphere l√≥pez moreno and st√§hli 2008 bouamri et al 2021 the two observation products mainly differ for north and north west exposed areas where tum tends to detect more snow this is partly due to false positives in shaded areas and lower cloud detection in north facing areas supplementary figure s 6 in hofmeister et al 2022 although wasim was able to adjust the radiation and temperature with respect to the topography it was determined that the mean snow cover duration was overestimated for south facing areas fig 5a and b this overestimation can be reduced by taking into consideration the wind driven redistribution with a constant south westerly wind direction fig 5d generally north west to north east located areas indicate the largest spatial variability of mean scd though the simulated mean snow cover duration improved on the catchment scale this simple approach is unable to consider minor or major differences in wind fields and speeds comparing the dispersion of standard deviation of all topographical features it can be seen that the features with the largest spatial variability are slope and aspect 4 4 accuracy and frequencies of observed and simulated snow cover and fsca slight differences in the cumulative frequencies of no snow detection occurred mainly for the lower elevation zones where tum detects more snow areas than eurac it may be that eurac underestimates snow cover in forest areas fig 4b and tum falsely detects snow in areas with low illumination since the canopy snow interception model of wasim was not activated the model tends to overestimate mean snow cover durations when compared to observation products at the same elevations fig 5 besides the systematic offset in cumulative snow detection frequencies between tum and eurac from 10 to 90 areal coverage both approaches agree very well on the presence or absence of full snow coverage fig 6a the simulated snow covered area approaches the eurac product for low snow coverage since the glacier extents originate from this product wasim tends to overestimate snow coverages of between 50 and 95 when compared to the observation products it follows from the distinct decrease in all three accuracy scores in fig 6b that wasim has difficulties in simulating the snow cover recession in the snow melt period from may to july the delayed snow cover recession results in an overestimation of the snow cover for these months which is also evident from an analysis of the fractional snow covered area fig 9 this delay can have different reasons for instance the long wave incoming and outgoing parameters lwincorr and lwoutcorr need a fine tuning based on the snow cover recession during the ablation period may to july consideration of the snow covered area in a multi objective calibration approach would improve the model performance on the catchment scale in addition the use of a multi layer snow model could enhance the simulation of snowmelt by additionally considering heat transfer in the snow pack especially for snow rich winters e g 2018 2019 however the multi layer snow model requires additional calibration parameters to characterize generally unknown soil properties as well as a new calibration as a compact snow pack without a layered snow model reacts quite differently to warming or cooling than a layered snow pack schulla 2021 5 conclusion this study presented the potential and limitations using sentinel 2 images for observing snow cover with a high temporal and spatial resolution in a complex mountainous terrain we also highlighted the additional benefit of using observation data in the process oriented calibration of a physically based snow model to increase the available data sentinel 2 images with up to 80 cloud cover were also considered as they can contain valuable spatial information regarding snow distribution this requires comprehensive cloud detection to avoid false detection of either snow or no snow cloud detection was performed using the idepix pixel classification algorithm in snap for the tum product we tested the snow and cloud detection quality against in situ snow observation on the point scale and also against eurac a second snow and cloud product that is based on a supervised algorithm both observation products generally attained a very high overall f1 accuracy score 0 9 with respect to the in situ station data the advantages of using two different approaches are that it makes it possible both to perform an intercomparison and validation of the respective results and to identify the limitations of the two approaches moreover the use of two products enables us to estimate the range of uncertainty in snow mapping with high resolution optical remote sensing data although both observation products provide consistent estimates of the mean snow cover above the tree line 2300 m a s l distinct differences were observed for the slope feature class the idepix tool in particular tends to make false detections of snow and cloud on steep north facing slopes 60 and to falsely classify snow as cloud in some clear sky situations in winter in contrast the active learning approach of eurac underestimates snow cover in evergreen forest areas unless explicit training pixels are selected the limitation of optical remote sensing products for snow detection under the canopy is a generally well known problem which is why only the snow cover of high altitude regions is usually analysed gascoin et al 2019 future research will be on assessing fractional snow cover in forested areas using optical remote sensing products gascoin et al 2020 unlike the coarse modis data bouamri et al 2021 sentinel 2 enables the investigation of small scale differences in snow cover duration in complex terrains due to gravitational redistribution slope energy balance and wind driven redistribution aspect this makes it possible to calibrate and validate the physically based snow model of wasim in a process oriented manner on different scales point slope and catchment scale with high spatial resolution 25 m depending on the scale and elevation each snow detection approach has its advantages for instance tum performs better at the forested valley bottom while eurac is more reliable at detecting snow on very steep slopes 60 nevertheless the two snow detection approaches should be validated with other observational data e g lidar and compared to other algorithms to further investigate the robustness of these approaches the spatial comparison of observed and simulated snow cover durations revealed limited wasim capabilities on steep slopes 25 with the default parametrization which cloud be partially overcome by calibrating the gravitational redistribution moreover it was shown that the mean snow cover duration computed with wasim at different exposures is not only dependent on the incoming solar radiation but also on the wind driven snow redistribution the optimized wasim model was able to simulate both the mean snow cover duration with a high f1 accuracy score of 0 9 and the fractional snow covered area with a very high correlation coefficient of 0 98 although hydrological analysis would greatly profit from spatially distributed and highly resolved in time information about swe the approach that we propose allows us to constrain two important model parameters for the wasim model by considering only snow cover information our work therefore provides a robust methodology with which it is possible to collect spatio temporal snow cover information to calibrate empirical gravitational snow redistribution models and hence enables multi objective calibration and validation for hydrological model applications in high elevation alpine catchments for further studies we can hypothesis that calibrated wasim model results will also provide more accurate swe estimation and consequently discharge predictions such hypothesis should be tested in a multi objective optimization framework and under the consideration of further observational data such as swe and discharge time series moreover snow cover model results can find application beyond the field of hydrology and are of interest for ecological studies qi et al 2021 wan et al 2014 as well as for the evaluation of the sustainability of winter tourism ebner et al 2021 although we did not include glaciers in this study it is possible to derive further cryospheric products from sentinel 2 e g glacier extents snow line on glacier and glacier albedo to calibrate and validate also glacier modules in hydrological models credit

8558,flows in urban rivers are increasingly managed to support water supply needs while also protecting and or restoring instream ecological functions goals that are often in opposition to each other effluent dominated rivers i e rivers that consist primarily of discharged treated wastewater pose a particular challenge because changes in effluent discharge may impact river ecology a functional flows approach in which metrics from the annual hydrograph correspond to ecological processes was applied to understand the hydro ecological implications of wastewater reuse in the los angeles river watershed los angeles county california usa the los angeles river like many urban rivers is dominated by effluent particularly during dry weather an hourly hydrologic model was created calibrated and validated in epa swmm for the los angeles river watershed to investigate how increases in wastewater reuse i e decreases in discharge to the river may impact river flows and subsequently ecology and recreation in the river current flows are shown to support freshwater marsh riparian habitat fish migration and wading shorebird habitat in addition to recreational kayaking functional flow metrics were assessed under future management scenarios including reducing discharge to increase recycling at three wastewater treatment plants within the watershed both wet season and dry season baseflows were most sensitive to increasing wastewater reuse with an average decrease of 51 56 0 93 cms from current baseflows sensitivity curves that relate potential changes in wastewater discharge to changes in functional flows show that a 4 decrease in current wastewater discharge may negatively impact habitat for indicator species during the dry season more opportunity exists for wastewater reuse during the wet season when current wastewater discharge may be reduced by 24 with minimal impacts to ecology and recreation the developed approach has the potential to inform similar tradeoff decisions in other urban rivers where flows are dominated by wastewater or stormdrain discharge keywords environmental flows los angeles effluent dominated river water reuse hydrologic model water management 1 introduction management of urban water infrastructure is increasingly complicated as cities plan for drought climate change resiliency and population growth urban water management has historically relied on siloed government entities each responsible for a different component of the urban water cycle e g stormwater wastewater drinking water this traditional approach has been found to be ineffective in managing the complexity of urban water flows escriva bou et al 2016 moreover importing large volumes of water from distant locations is becoming more costly and politically contentious as potentially competing demands increase a one water approach has been proposed for cities to sustainably manage their limited and valuable water supplies mukheibir et al 2014 the one water approach builds on the concept of integrated water resources management iwrm and emphasizes collaboration and coordination amongst water stakeholders and decision makers daigger et al 2019 luthy et al 2019 communities committed to this approach include many in australia hit hard by the millennium drought israel los angeles california and other arid cities in the western united states effluent dominated rivers which are common in arid urban areas are particularly challenging to manage without a holistic approach because wastewater discharge is directly connected to surface waters in these systems wastewater was historically considered a waste stream but is now viewed as a resource for water energy and material i e fertilizer recovery guest et al 2009 united states environmental protection agency 2019 for example wastewater reuse is now a key component of california s water supply with over 9 of the state s urban water demands met by treated wastewater augmenting reservoir groundwater and raw water supplies watereuse california 2019 alternatively managed wastewater discharge can provide an opportunity to support environmental flows or flows required to sustain river ecosystems lawrence et al 2014 wastewater effluent can be used to align flows more closely to the natural flow regime eppehimer et al 2020 or to create and maintain novel ecosystems that would likely not exist under natural conditions luthy et al 2015 white and greer 2006 for example in calera creek in pacifica california flow augmentation from treated wastewater effluent converted a naturally intermittent stream into a perennial one which allowed for the creation of lost habitat for rare and endangered species and support of recreational opportunities halaburka et al 2013 while there are numerous success stories of wastewater recovery and reuse management decisions for water supply and environmental flows are often made independently of one another and there is a critical need for tools and approaches to balance potentially competing goals of reuse and supporting ecological communities the majority of studies on effluent dominated streams focus on water quality and stream temperature issues and very few studies are focused on flow management applications hamdhani et al 2020 existing approaches for managing environmental flows in effluent dominated rivers typically consist of limiting withdrawals to a fixed proportion of the natural flow regime this approach may maximize water for reuse but may not guarantee that ecological objectives can be achieved richter et al 2012 a functional flows approach offers a more holistic method that accounts for the complexity and variability of flow over space and time and aims to protect the ecological integrity of the river but allow for flexibility for water reuse during ideal times in a functional flows approach the annual hydrograph is segmented into discrete components that have ecological significance in a river system yarnell et al 2015 the components are described by flow characteristics that include frequency timing magnitude duration or rate of change poff et al 1997 and support biophysical processes which subsequently provide functions for native biological communities for example dry season baseflow can maintain critical habitat for native aquatic species kupferberg et al 2012 postel and richter 2003 yarnell et al 2016 and peak flows can support fish rearing and spawning in the floodplain jeffres et al 2008 opperman et al 2017 together functional flow metrics provide a quantitative framework for managing environmental flows to support critical ecosystem functions yarnell et al 2020 using the los angeles la river watershed as a case study we assess the relationship between wastewater discharge and functional flow metrics and evaluate the impact of reduced wastewater discharge on aquatic life and recreational uses the main research questions addressed in this study are 1 how sensitive are functional flows in the la river to changes in wastewater discharge 2 what is the impact of wastewater reuse on recreational uses and ecology in the la river 3 how can tradeoffs in environmental flows and wastewater reuse be evaluated to better inform management decisions our developed approach provides a framework for integrated water resources management and can be applied to other urban watersheds that have challenges balancing water supply with environmental flows 2 methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 site description the la river watershed is in los angeles county ca usa and is 2 160 km2 approximately 32 of the watershed is impervious and dominant land uses include residential open space and commercial the upper tributaries of the watershed are in steeply sloped mountains where much of the landscape is forested and unaltered the lower portions of the watershed which drain to the mainstem and other tributaries are highly urbanized slopes within the watershed vary from 20 in the northern national forest to 0 2 in the densely urbanized lower watershed average 8 the regional climate is mediterranean with wet winters and dry summers the average annual precipitation varies spatially in the catchment from about 200 to 460 mm 8 to 18 in the lower portion of the watershed is highly altered for water supply and flood control most of the mainstem of the river is channelized except for two key soft bottom reaches glendale narrows and sepulveda basin there are eight major dams located within the watershed many of the channelized reaches have low flow notches concentrating flows during the dry season several spreading grounds are also operated within the watershed and are designed to capture stormwater treated wastewater or imported water to recharge aquifers three water reclamation plants wrps are located within the watershed glendale burbank and donald c tillman tillman which discharge a combined average of about 2 m3 s 71 cfs 45 9 mgd to the river annually the cities of burbank glendale and los angeles have decreased or plan to gradually decrease discharges of treated wastewater to the river both burbank and glendale have filed water right change petitions under ca water code section 1211 with the state water resources control board to decrease their annual discharge by 30 and 33 respectively california state water resources control board 2017a 2017b tools developed in this study will inform decisions regarding the 1211 change petitions the la river watershed presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the impacts of wastewater reuse on environmental flows given 1 the county of los angeles is water stressed with 57 of municipal water imported from outside of the region los angeles department of water power 2016 2 the city of los angeles has adopted a one water approach to manage water holistically city of los angeles 2018 3 the la river is altered for flood prevention nearly entirely channelized and wastewater makes up the majority of flow during the dry season and 4 several municipalities within the watershed have started or plan to reuse more wastewater to supplement drinking water california state water resources control board 2017b 2017a water management hydrology and water quality in the la river watershed have been studied extensively abdi et al 2021 2020 gallo et al 2020 pincetl et al 2019 2016 porse et al 2017 read et al 2019 wolfand et al 2018 2 1 2 focal reaches twelve locations herein referred to as reporting nodes were selected within the mainstem to represent specific reaches of the river fig 1 detailed results from two of these nodes are reported in this study as they serve as illustrative examples for the river 1 the glendale narrows abbreviated glen and 2 the lower reach of the la river mainstem abbreviated la3 these two locations were chosen because glen is located downstream of all wastewater inputs to the river but upstream of several major tributaries while la3 is located near the outlet close to where the river becomes brackish fig 1 the glendale narrows is one of the last remaining soft bottom portions of the river downstream of the wastewater treatment plants fig 1 historically this 13 km reach was not fully channelized because of groundwater upwelling within the reach fig 1 upper la river area watermaster 2018 because of this the glendale narrows is a unique location within the mainstem of the river that supports both recreational uses and habitat for a variety of riparian dependent and aquatic species beneficial uses within the glendale narrows include warm freshwater habitat and wildlife habitat existing species of concern that are riparian dependent and may be impacted by flow reductions include but are not limited to the yellow warbler least bell s vireo endangered and the willow flycatcher endangered stein et al 2021 opportunities exist to improve habitat for existing species and species that could be reintroduced such as the cold water santa ana sucker abdi et al 2021 stein et al 2021 the lower reach of the la river mainstem la3 is just upstream of the estuary and receives flow from the entire watershed this reach contrasts to the glendale narrows because it is completely channelized with concrete fig 1 the la3 reach supports fish migration warm water fish and wading shorebirds both glendale narrows and the lower la river support a variety of recreational uses such as wading kayaking horseback riding and fishing within the channel as well as activities such as biking birdwatching wildlife viewing walking jogging and community and educational events adjacent to the channel in 2019 the council for watershed health completed a study of the la river quantifying the flows required to maintain the recreational uses within each reach of the river through a series of interviews and analysis of social media they determined that activities that occur within the river channel along with birdwatching wildlife viewing and aesthetic enjoyment are dependent on flows in the river for most activities it was difficult for experts to name precise flow requirements but a depth of 15 to 91 cm 6 36 in in the glendale narrows was estimated for supporting wading boating and fishing activities recreational experts also noted that water depth was important for sustaining aesthetic uses of the river such as painting photography or general scenic enjoyment wildlife viewing is also affected by flows as different species require different habitat conditions stein and sanchez 2019 2 2 overall approach a hydrologic model was created in epa swmm for the la river watershed which includes the mainstem of the la river and two major tributaries compton creek and rio hondo epa swmm is a hydrologic model commonly used to simulate stormwater runoff in urban catchments u s environmental protection agency 2017 model inputs include precipitation evapotranspiration impervious cover slope and infiltration parameters described in more detail in section 2 3 the model was created with an hourly time step from the water year 2011 to 2017 this period was chosen because 1 high resolution hourly data was available for wastewater discharge in stream flows dam operations and spreading grounds and 2 wastewater discharge during this period remained relatively constant so the period is representative of baseline conditions without substantial wastewater reuse the model was calibrated from the water year 2011 to 2013 and validated from the water year 2014 to 2017 at 7 gaged locations throughout the watershed 4 on the mainstem 3 on tributaries potential wastewater discharge scenarios were generated using a monte carlo approach in which historic wastewater discharge time series from the water year 2011 to 2017 were randomly scaled by 0 to 100 for 500 simulations section 2 4 in addition 100 and 50 reduction of dry weather stormdrain discharge scenarios were simulated section 2 5 discharge was evaluated at 12 reporting nodes along the mainstem section 2 1 to evaluate the impact of reduced wastewater discharge on recreation and aquatic life functional flow metrics table 3 such as dry season baseflow magnitude and wet season timing were quantified using the functional flows calculator api client package in r version 0 9 7 2 https github com ceff tech ffc api client which uses hydrologic feature detection algorithms developed by patterson et al 2020 and the python functional flows calculator https github com noellepatterson ffc readme 2 3 hydrologic model setup 2 3 1 spatial data sewersheds were downloaded from the la county watershed management and modeling system tetra tech 2020 these sewersheds were merged into 77 catchments with an average size of 15 8 km2 3900 ac the storm sewer network retrieved from the la county gis data portal county of los angeles 2020 as well as the national hydrography dataset u s geological survey 2019 flowlines were used to confirm the drainage network a digital elevation model dem was retrieved from the united states geological survey usgs 3d elevation program at 1 3 arcsecond resolution and processed to find the average slope for each subcatchment u s geological survey 2016a total imperviousness for each catchment was estimated from the national land cover database u s geological survey 2016b soils data was downloaded from the natural resources conservation service united states department of agriculture soil survey geographic database natural resources conservation service 2019 green ampt infiltration parameters hydraulic conductivity suction head moisture deficit were initially estimated by matching natural resources conservation service hydrologic soil groups to typical values and spatially averaging areas with no hydrologic soil information were assumed to be group d which is characteristic of soils in urban areas with low infiltration capacity national resources conservation service 2007 channel geometry was not included in the hydrologic model a separate hydraulic model was created with the hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras and detailed in a separate study stein et al 2021 2 3 2 time series data potential evapotranspiration pet data was downloaded from the california irrigation management information system cimis which is a collection of autonomous weather stations that make real time observations california department of water resources 2019 the inverse distance square weighing method longley et al 2015 was used to combine the reference pet time series from the nine closest cimis stations into one for the centroid of the la river watershed table s1 and applied to subcatchments throughout the watershed precipitation data was retrieved for 72 of the los angeles county automatic local evaluation in real time alert rain gages precipitation was spatially interpolated for each catchment by kriging using the krige function from the r package gstat with a variogram generated through the function fit variogram from the same package using a spherical variogram for the best fit r core team 2020 flow data at 29 gaging stations was retrieved from the los angeles county department of public works and at 6 gaging stations from the usgs spreading basin data was retrieved from the los angeles county department of public works for 15 facilities these facilities recharge a mix of imported recycled and stormwater because the distribution of these water sources changes annually current conditions at spreading basins were not modeled explicitly effects from spreading basins were captured by adjusting calibration parameters data was retrieved from the city of los angeles for discharges from the tillman and the glendale wrps timeseries discharge for burbank wrp to the la river was retrieved from the state water resources control board inflow and outflow data for five dams within the watershed were retrieved from the los angeles county department of public works eaton wash devil s gate big tujunga pacoima santa anita whittier narrows dam and sepulveda dam data were downloaded from the usgs website most of the dams are in the upper reaches of the lar watershed and capture runoff from primarily open space or undeveloped land because we were interested in the impact of wastewater discharge scenarios that affect flow in the urban parts of the watershed the dams were not explicitly modeled fig 1 rather we represented the dams as model nodes with inflow time series baseflow was separated from event flow using the usgs hydrograph separation program hysep and distributed across each reach based on contributing catchment area sloto and crouse 1996 the exception for this was in the glendale narrows area where baseflow was disaggregated to include groundwater upwelling wrp discharge and channel evaporation groundwater upwelling in the glendale narrows was assumed to be a constant discharge over the year at around 3 000 acre ft yr 0 12 cms upper los angeles river area watermaster 2018 evaporation within the channel was estimated by multiplying monthly pan evaporation data collected at long beach ca by a coefficient of 0 75 2 3 3 calibration and validation the hydrology model was calibrated at 7 gage stations from upstream to downstream using an automated calibration tool to optimize the calibration

percent bias between 19 9 and 17 3 table 1 example calibration and validation plots are shown in fig 2 and an example comparison of observed and simulated time series data is provided in figure s1 2 4 wastewater reuse scenarios a monte carlo approach was used to simulate a wide range of potential wrp reuse scenarios in the watershed including multiple combinations of reuse from each wrp as opposed to a discrete set of reuse scenarios i e all treatment plants reuse 0 25 50 75 or 100 this approach allows for flexibility of potential future management options that can be implemented to achieve objectives historic time series of wrp discharge from the water year 2011 to 2017 were scaled by 0 to 100 for 500 random simulations scenarios were summarized by the average annual seasonal i e wet or dry season wrp discharge over the simulation period equation 1 for example for a scenario with a scaling of 25 discharge 50 discharge and 75 discharge for tillman burbank and glendale respectively the average wrp discharge for the dry season would be 0 74 m3 s 26 0 cfs 16 8 mgd and 0 89 m3 s 31 4 cfs 20 3 mgd for the wet season 1 q wrp s tillman q tillman s burbank q burbank s glendale q glendale

summarized using a suite of 24 functional flow metrics that quantify characteristics of the annual hydrograph that support a broad suite of ecological functions yarnell et al 2020 these metrics aggregate flow data into five flow components fall pulse flow wet season baseflows peak flows spring recession flows and dry season baseflows which represent different features of the annual hydrograph that are specific to california streams ranges of values for the 24 functional flow metrics were used to determine the degree to which each flow component can support characteristic biological communities and to assess the degree of hydrologic alteration in comparison to baseline conditions see supplementary material for additional background on functional flows functional flow metrics were compared longitudinally from upstream to downstream under baseline conditions to evaluate the relative contribution of wrp discharge on functional flows for the 500 reuse scenarios functional flow metrics were calculated at glendale narrows glen and in the lower reach of the mainstem la3 to determine which flow metrics are most sensitive to changes in wastewater discharge 2 7 flow targets for beneficial uses recommended flow ranges for ecological and recreational uses in the la river used in this study were compiled from previous work table 2 stein and sanchez 2019 stein et al 2021 briefly flow conditions necessary to support the life history needs of several focal species were determined and used to create flow ecology curves or models relating key hydrologic and hydraulic variables to the probability of occurrence for each focal species or the probability of being able to complete specific life history requirements focal species for the glendale narrows glen include cattails typha spp indicative of freshwater marsh habitat and black willow salix gooddingii indicative of riparian habitat the glendale narrows also supports recreational kayaking focal species in the lower mainstem of the la river la3 are steelhead trout oncorhynchus mykiss and green algae cladophora spp large populations of wading shorebirds use the lower mainstem of the la river and eat the green algae steelhead trout have historically used the mainstem of the la river as a migratory passage to spawning grounds in the upper tributaries but they are not currently observed in the river the percentage of simulation years that had dry season and wet season baseflows within the recommended flow ranges for each focal species was calculated for glen and la3 over the 500 wastewater reuse scenarios 2 8 sensitivity curves flow based sensitivity curves were developed that relate changes in wrp discharge to functional flow metrics for each scenario the range of flow metric values from the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles were plotted against the average seasonal wrp discharge to account for the variability in flow metric values from each scenario across the period of record curves were developed for the dry season baseflow 50th percentile of mean daily flow during the dry season and wet season baseflow 10th percentile of mean daily flow during the wet season magnitude metrics the wet season metrics baseflows from the start of the storm season to the start of the dry season and dry season metrics baseflows from the start of the dry season to the start of the following wet season were calculated on an annual basis typically the start of the wet season is between november to january and the start of the dry season is between may to july depending on the climatic conditions for a given water year sensitivity curves were used in combination with recommended flow ranges table 2 to determine wastewater discharge needed to support aquatic life and recreational uses 3 results discussion 3 1 current conditions 3 1 1 functional flow metrics the la river generally experiences a long dry season from mid may to mid november and a wet season from approximately mid november to mid march fig 3 dry season baseflow magnitude ranged from 2 to 2 7 cms with a duration of 121 to 237 days wet season baseflows ranged from 2 1 to 3 7 cms with a median duration of 129 days the median flow metric values for glen are shown in table 3 along with the range in values from the 10th to 90th percentiles certain flow components are not well represented in the la river which we expect is similar to other flashy systems in semi arid regions for example the fall pulse flows can be important for the initial flushing of fine sediments and priming of the system for subsequent winter storms however in the la river such pulse flows seldom support these functions because of the lack of natural substrate stochastic nature of early season storms and the fact that the first storms of the season are often captured through stormwater infrastructure for water quality purposes in the la river fall pulse flows rarely occurred but when they did they occurred in october with a magnitude ranging from 7 to 33 cms similarly pronounced spring recession flows are often absent in the la river due to the lack of snowmelt runoff lack of strong groundwater influence and channelized nature of the river which hastens draining of the system following storms the spring recession magnitude is typically a function of the last major storm of the wet season which ranged from 15 to 262 cms and a rate of change median daily percent decrease in flow per day from 0 01 to 0 05 during baseline conditions median dry season baseflow in the mainstem of the la river across all reporting nodes ranged between 0 12 and 3 5 cms river discharge increased downstream of the three wastewater treatment plants illustrating the contributions of discharges from the treatment plants fig 4 on average wrp discharge contributed the greatest proportion of flow during the summer months june through august fig 4 other sources of baseflow included groundwater upwelling and dry weather stormdrain discharge i e residential irrigation and car washing glendale narrows nodes la14 through f57c is a key area for aquatic life and recreation but it is also one of the places where wrp discharge has a particularly large contribution fig 4 therefore a reduction in wrp discharge could affect habitat and biodiversity vital ecosystem function and beneficial uses in this area cardinale et al 2012 mccann 2000 tilman 1999 3 1 2 suitability to support beneficial uses under current wastewater discharge conditions annual average discharge of 1 91 cms median baseflows in the glendale narrows are suitable for willow an indicator of riparian habitat and kayaking which occurs in the summer months across all baseline simulation years in addition flows can support cattail marsh in most years 67 fig 5 current median baseflow conditions in the lower la river are suitable for the migration of steelhead trout and green algae which support wading shorebird foraging in the lower la river mainstem fig 5 it should be noted however that steelhead are not currently observed likely due to other hydraulic physical e g dams and water quality factors e g temperature efforts are currently underway to more thoroughly examine the limiting factors for steelhead restoration in the watershed and develop a plan for channel modifications to improve suitability for steelhead in a 7 7 km reach of the river stillwater sciences 2020 despite the suitability for all species of interest current median baseflows are on the low end of the recommended flow ranges particularly for cattail and kayaking in the glendale narrows fig 5 3 2 wastewater reuse scenarios 3 2 1 sensitivity of functional flow metrics across all wastewater reuse scenarios the duration of the dry season increased by an average of 17 days with a maximum of 22 days the duration of wet season baseflow decreased by an average of 16 days and the spring recession duration increased by an average of 41 days maximum 58 days of the calculated flow metrics wet and dry season baseflow magnitude spring recession rate of change percent decreased in flow per day over spring recession duration and spring recession duration were the most sensitive to changes in wastewater reuse the most resilient metrics included peak flow durations and frequencies fig 6 while the spring recession rate of change was sensitive to changes in wrp discharge on a percentage basis the absolute rate of change values were extremely low maximum absolute change is 5 9 mean is 1 2 further the fall and spring season metrics have minimal relevance for the ecology of the la river as previously discussed section 3 1 1 the most consistent impacts of reduced wrp discharge were to baseflow both during the dry and wet season with decreases on average of 0 93 cms 33 cfs which is an approximately 51 56 decrease from current conditions fig 6 wet season baseflow metrics were slightly greater than dry season metrics due to the contribution of residual stormdrain discharge following storm events there are plans to install both distributed and centralized stormwater management systems throughout the watershed to replenish groundwater aquifers reduce flood risk and improve water quality geosyntec consultants 2015 this may have additional implications for both wet season peak flows and baseflows overall we project that increases in wastewater reuse will result in a longer dry season shorter wet season and reduced baseflow we concentrate on wet and dry season baseflow for the remainder of the analysis because baseflow is one of the most sensitive functional flow metrics to changes in wastewater reuse 3 2 2 suitability to support beneficial uses as wastewater reuse increases the number of simulation years in which baseflows fall within the recommended flow ranges for beneficial uses declines fig 7 for example with an average annual dry season wrp discharge of 0 96 cms 50 of current wrp discharge glendale narrows has flows that are suitable for willow but not for cattail or kayaking fig 7 and the lower la river has flows suitable for green algae and steelhead migration however the suitability for willow green algae and steelhead rapidly decreases when the average annual dry season wrp discharge falls below about 0 6 cms about 30 of current wrp discharge wading shorebird green algae and freshwater marsh cattail habitat are representative of the wildlife habitat beneficial use in the la river which sustains both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems by providing food resources nurseries and habitat for higher trophic level organisms including birds amphibians and invertebrates wading shorebird habitat supports a large number of migratory and resident bird species cooper 2006 some of which are threatened or endangered such species provide local and global benefits such as pest control plant pollination seed dispersal and are a food resource for other species mart√≠nez salinas et al 2016 michel et al 2020 sekercioglu 2006 a reduction in wading shorebird population may lead to reduced pollination of plants and therefore a reduction in plant populations anderson et al 2011 freshwater marsh habitats comprise 25 of freshwater wetlands in the usa burton and uzarski 2009 as well as supporting a vast amount of biodiversity freshwater marsh is known to filter nutrients and pollutants from runoff and surface water and has even been used in some areas to treat domestic and industrial wastewater bayley et al 1985 burton and uzarski 2009 carlisle and mulamoottil 1991 additionally inland freshwater wetlands sequester and store carbon in soil however this ability may be hindered in anthropogenically disturbed areas nahlik and fennessy 2016 such as the la river less than 5 of natural wetlands greater los angeles county 2012 stein et al 2014 remain in los angeles county and nationwide bird populations have declined greatly rosenberg et al 2019 over the past 50 years the fact that these habitats currently exist in the highly urbanized la river produces a unique opportunity for protection and management that should not be ignored 3 3 management implications in addition to understanding the effects of wastewater reuse on beneficial uses one of the key goals of this work was to inform future management decisions in the la river watershed and other similar urban watersheds to do this flow based sensitivity curves were developed for 18 nodes of management interest curves are shown for the glendale narrows glen fig 8 and lower la river la3 fig 9 the curves relate discharge from the water reclamation plants under various dry weather stormdrain reduction scenarios to dry and wet season baseflow which can then be related to beneficial use flow limits the curves provide relationships between effluent discharge and streamflow at the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles based on the seven year simulation record fig 8 and fig 9 the sensitivity curve approach was developed in conjunction with basin stakeholders and a technical advisory group to ensure that the tools developed in this study could be used for decisions regarding the 1211 wastewater change petitions this approach allows a potentially unlimited number of future reuse scenarios to be evaluated and therefore provides more utility than evaluating a finite number of discrete scenarios one potential use of the curves is to quantify the maximum amount of wastewater reuse that does not adversely affect existing beneficial uses based on aquatic habitat and recreation in the river for example during the dry season at glendale narrows cattail is the most sensitive species to changes in wrp discharge to maintain a median dry season baseflow magnitude above the recommended range for cattail wrp discharge should be maintained at 96 of the current discharge 1 84 cms if instead kayaking is prioritized over cattail wrp discharge could potentially be reduced to about 77 of the current discharge 1 48 cms if managers determine that only willow riparian habitat is a management priority then wrp discharge could be reduced to 13 of the current discharge there may also be flexibility in the timing of recycling during the day for example more water could be diverted for reuse at night to allow for sufficient flows for kayaking during the summer days it is also important to note that kayaking is highly dependent on the channel morphology and flow ranges were developed from one representative cross section at glen which may be different than other locations in glendale narrows there is more flexibility for wastewater reuse in the glendale narrows during the wet season when discharge can be reduced to about 76 of the current rate without affecting cattail or willows fig 8 utilities within the basin could therefore prioritize wastewater reuse during wetter months note that these estimates are based on the median baseflow but managers may want to use the 90th percentile band to be more conservative and provide additional opportunities for water reuse fig 8 the lower la river la3 is much less sensitive to changes in wastewater discharge than the glendale narrows glen sensitivity curves suggest that discharge can be reduced to 2 of the current rate in the dry season and 6 in the wet season without impacting suitability for steelhead migration and green algae fig 9 the greater flexibility for reuse in the lower la river suggests that the glendale narrows should be the focus of management efforts where a reduction in baseflow is more likely to impact beneficial uses however streamflow is not the only driver of habitat suitability while current and future managed flows may be suitable for steelhead migration in the lower la river other factors like coarse substrate and pools and riffles that can serve as refugia are not present u s bureau of reclamation 2019 in addition water quality parameters such as temperature may not be suitable abdi et al 2022 results show that reductions in dry weather stormdrain discharge would have a relatively large impact on both the glendale narrows and the lower la river in the glendale narrows with no changes to wrp discharge a 50 reduction in stormdrain discharge could impact the suitability of the habitat for cattail and a 100 reduction of stormdrain discharge may impact the suitability of the habitat for cattail and kayaking fig 8 in the lower la river with current wrp discharge reduction of stormdrain discharge does not negatively affect steelhead migration or green algae growth however reductions in stormdrain discharge do have compounding effects with reductions in wrp discharge thus illustrating the importance of considering the entire urban water cycle when making decisions on instream flows 4 conclusion a functional flows approach was paired with a monte carlo simulation to estimate how wastewater reuse could impact beneficial uses in an effluent dominated urban river in los angeles flow augmentation creates novel conditions that support both ecosystem services and societal benefits e g recreation some future management scenarios can meet wastewater reuse goals and environmental flow patterns primarily during the wet season when baseflows are typically greater and recreational boating activities are limited we recommend that wastewater reuse in the la river watershed be done in conjunction with channel restoration activities baseflows in the river will be altered very quickly which provides an opportunity for revitalization of the mainstem over time the flood control capabilities of the channel may be reevaluated as the region plans for enhanced stormwater capture through distributed stormwater control measures which will provide some flood protection we demonstrated that functional flow metrics can be joined with a suite of potential urban river disturbances or management scenarios to aid in future water planning and decision making for environmental flows in addition to potential changes in wastewater discharge functional flow metrics could be paired with other management decisions such as increases in stormwater capture reduction of dry weather urban baseflows flow disturbances by climate change or wildfire or restoration efforts in future studies we recommend that functional flow metrics be used with other habitat characteristics such as hydraulic conditions e g velocity and shear stress water quality e g temperature and the life history needs for species of management concern these sensitivity curves have advantages to the traditional approach of picking a handful of discrete scenarios to investigate the developed approach can be applied to other urban watersheds where rivers must be managed for competing needs credit

8558,flows in urban rivers are increasingly managed to support water supply needs while also protecting and or restoring instream ecological functions goals that are often in opposition to each other effluent dominated rivers i e rivers that consist primarily of discharged treated wastewater pose a particular challenge because changes in effluent discharge may impact river ecology a functional flows approach in which metrics from the annual hydrograph correspond to ecological processes was applied to understand the hydro ecological implications of wastewater reuse in the los angeles river watershed los angeles county california usa the los angeles river like many urban rivers is dominated by effluent particularly during dry weather an hourly hydrologic model was created calibrated and validated in epa swmm for the los angeles river watershed to investigate how increases in wastewater reuse i e decreases in discharge to the river may impact river flows and subsequently ecology and recreation in the river current flows are shown to support freshwater marsh riparian habitat fish migration and wading shorebird habitat in addition to recreational kayaking functional flow metrics were assessed under future management scenarios including reducing discharge to increase recycling at three wastewater treatment plants within the watershed both wet season and dry season baseflows were most sensitive to increasing wastewater reuse with an average decrease of 51 56 0 93 cms from current baseflows sensitivity curves that relate potential changes in wastewater discharge to changes in functional flows show that a 4 decrease in current wastewater discharge may negatively impact habitat for indicator species during the dry season more opportunity exists for wastewater reuse during the wet season when current wastewater discharge may be reduced by 24 with minimal impacts to ecology and recreation the developed approach has the potential to inform similar tradeoff decisions in other urban rivers where flows are dominated by wastewater or stormdrain discharge keywords environmental flows los angeles effluent dominated river water reuse hydrologic model water management 1 introduction management of urban water infrastructure is increasingly complicated as cities plan for drought climate change resiliency and population growth urban water management has historically relied on siloed government entities each responsible for a different component of the urban water cycle e g stormwater wastewater drinking water this traditional approach has been found to be ineffective in managing the complexity of urban water flows escriva bou et al 2016 moreover importing large volumes of water from distant locations is becoming more costly and politically contentious as potentially competing demands increase a one water approach has been proposed for cities to sustainably manage their limited and valuable water supplies mukheibir et al 2014 the one water approach builds on the concept of integrated water resources management iwrm and emphasizes collaboration and coordination amongst water stakeholders and decision makers daigger et al 2019 luthy et al 2019 communities committed to this approach include many in australia hit hard by the millennium drought israel los angeles california and other arid cities in the western united states effluent dominated rivers which are common in arid urban areas are particularly challenging to manage without a holistic approach because wastewater discharge is directly connected to surface waters in these systems wastewater was historically considered a waste stream but is now viewed as a resource for water energy and material i e fertilizer recovery guest et al 2009 united states environmental protection agency 2019 for example wastewater reuse is now a key component of california s water supply with over 9 of the state s urban water demands met by treated wastewater augmenting reservoir groundwater and raw water supplies watereuse california 2019 alternatively managed wastewater discharge can provide an opportunity to support environmental flows or flows required to sustain river ecosystems lawrence et al 2014 wastewater effluent can be used to align flows more closely to the natural flow regime eppehimer et al 2020 or to create and maintain novel ecosystems that would likely not exist under natural conditions luthy et al 2015 white and greer 2006 for example in calera creek in pacifica california flow augmentation from treated wastewater effluent converted a naturally intermittent stream into a perennial one which allowed for the creation of lost habitat for rare and endangered species and support of recreational opportunities halaburka et al 2013 while there are numerous success stories of wastewater recovery and reuse management decisions for water supply and environmental flows are often made independently of one another and there is a critical need for tools and approaches to balance potentially competing goals of reuse and supporting ecological communities the majority of studies on effluent dominated streams focus on water quality and stream temperature issues and very few studies are focused on flow management applications hamdhani et al 2020 existing approaches for managing environmental flows in effluent dominated rivers typically consist of limiting withdrawals to a fixed proportion of the natural flow regime this approach may maximize water for reuse but may not guarantee that ecological objectives can be achieved richter et al 2012 a functional flows approach offers a more holistic method that accounts for the complexity and variability of flow over space and time and aims to protect the ecological integrity of the river but allow for flexibility for water reuse during ideal times in a functional flows approach the annual hydrograph is segmented into discrete components that have ecological significance in a river system yarnell et al 2015 the components are described by flow characteristics that include frequency timing magnitude duration or rate of change poff et al 1997 and support biophysical processes which subsequently provide functions for native biological communities for example dry season baseflow can maintain critical habitat for native aquatic species kupferberg et al 2012 postel and richter 2003 yarnell et al 2016 and peak flows can support fish rearing and spawning in the floodplain jeffres et al 2008 opperman et al 2017 together functional flow metrics provide a quantitative framework for managing environmental flows to support critical ecosystem functions yarnell et al 2020 using the los angeles la river watershed as a case study we assess the relationship between wastewater discharge and functional flow metrics and evaluate the impact of reduced wastewater discharge on aquatic life and recreational uses the main research questions addressed in this study are 1 how sensitive are functional flows in the la river to changes in wastewater discharge 2 what is the impact of wastewater reuse on recreational uses and ecology in the la river 3 how can tradeoffs in environmental flows and wastewater reuse be evaluated to better inform management decisions our developed approach provides a framework for integrated water resources management and can be applied to other urban watersheds that have challenges balancing water supply with environmental flows 2 methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 site description the la river watershed is in los angeles county ca usa and is 2 160 km2 approximately 32 of the watershed is impervious and dominant land uses include residential open space and commercial the upper tributaries of the watershed are in steeply sloped mountains where much of the landscape is forested and unaltered the lower portions of the watershed which drain to the mainstem and other tributaries are highly urbanized slopes within the watershed vary from 20 in the northern national forest to 0 2 in the densely urbanized lower watershed average 8 the regional climate is mediterranean with wet winters and dry summers the average annual precipitation varies spatially in the catchment from about 200 to 460 mm 8 to 18 in the lower portion of the watershed is highly altered for water supply and flood control most of the mainstem of the river is channelized except for two key soft bottom reaches glendale narrows and sepulveda basin there are eight major dams located within the watershed many of the channelized reaches have low flow notches concentrating flows during the dry season several spreading grounds are also operated within the watershed and are designed to capture stormwater treated wastewater or imported water to recharge aquifers three water reclamation plants wrps are located within the watershed glendale burbank and donald c tillman tillman which discharge a combined average of about 2 m3 s 71 cfs 45 9 mgd to the river annually the cities of burbank glendale and los angeles have decreased or plan to gradually decrease discharges of treated wastewater to the river both burbank and glendale have filed water right change petitions under ca water code section 1211 with the state water resources control board to decrease their annual discharge by 30 and 33 respectively california state water resources control board 2017a 2017b tools developed in this study will inform decisions regarding the 1211 change petitions the la river watershed presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the impacts of wastewater reuse on environmental flows given 1 the county of los angeles is water stressed with 57 of municipal water imported from outside of the region los angeles department of water power 2016 2 the city of los angeles has adopted a one water approach to manage water holistically city of los angeles 2018 3 the la river is altered for flood prevention nearly entirely channelized and wastewater makes up the majority of flow during the dry season and 4 several municipalities within the watershed have started or plan to reuse more wastewater to supplement drinking water california state water resources control board 2017b 2017a water management hydrology and water quality in the la river watershed have been studied extensively abdi et al 2021 2020 gallo et al 2020 pincetl et al 2019 2016 porse et al 2017 read et al 2019 wolfand et al 2018 2 1 2 focal reaches twelve locations herein referred to as reporting nodes were selected within the mainstem to represent specific reaches of the river fig 1 detailed results from two of these nodes are reported in this study as they serve as illustrative examples for the river 1 the glendale narrows abbreviated glen and 2 the lower reach of the la river mainstem abbreviated la3 these two locations were chosen because glen is located downstream of all wastewater inputs to the river but upstream of several major tributaries while la3 is located near the outlet close to where the river becomes brackish fig 1 the glendale narrows is one of the last remaining soft bottom portions of the river downstream of the wastewater treatment plants fig 1 historically this 13 km reach was not fully channelized because of groundwater upwelling within the reach fig 1 upper la river area watermaster 2018 because of this the glendale narrows is a unique location within the mainstem of the river that supports both recreational uses and habitat for a variety of riparian dependent and aquatic species beneficial uses within the glendale narrows include warm freshwater habitat and wildlife habitat existing species of concern that are riparian dependent and may be impacted by flow reductions include but are not limited to the yellow warbler least bell s vireo endangered and the willow flycatcher endangered stein et al 2021 opportunities exist to improve habitat for existing species and species that could be reintroduced such as the cold water santa ana sucker abdi et al 2021 stein et al 2021 the lower reach of the la river mainstem la3 is just upstream of the estuary and receives flow from the entire watershed this reach contrasts to the glendale narrows because it is completely channelized with concrete fig 1 the la3 reach supports fish migration warm water fish and wading shorebirds both glendale narrows and the lower la river support a variety of recreational uses such as wading kayaking horseback riding and fishing within the channel as well as activities such as biking birdwatching wildlife viewing walking jogging and community and educational events adjacent to the channel in 2019 the council for watershed health completed a study of the la river quantifying the flows required to maintain the recreational uses within each reach of the river through a series of interviews and analysis of social media they determined that activities that occur within the river channel along with birdwatching wildlife viewing and aesthetic enjoyment are dependent on flows in the river for most activities it was difficult for experts to name precise flow requirements but a depth of 15 to 91 cm 6 36 in in the glendale narrows was estimated for supporting wading boating and fishing activities recreational experts also noted that water depth was important for sustaining aesthetic uses of the river such as painting photography or general scenic enjoyment wildlife viewing is also affected by flows as different species require different habitat conditions stein and sanchez 2019 2 2 overall approach a hydrologic model was created in epa swmm for the la river watershed which includes the mainstem of the la river and two major tributaries compton creek and rio hondo epa swmm is a hydrologic model commonly used to simulate stormwater runoff in urban catchments u s environmental protection agency 2017 model inputs include precipitation evapotranspiration impervious cover slope and infiltration parameters described in more detail in section 2 3 the model was created with an hourly time step from the water year 2011 to 2017 this period was chosen because 1 high resolution hourly data was available for wastewater discharge in stream flows dam operations and spreading grounds and 2 wastewater discharge during this period remained relatively constant so the period is representative of baseline conditions without substantial wastewater reuse the model was calibrated from the water year 2011 to 2013 and validated from the water year 2014 to 2017 at 7 gaged locations throughout the watershed 4 on the mainstem 3 on tributaries potential wastewater discharge scenarios were generated using a monte carlo approach in which historic wastewater discharge time series from the water year 2011 to 2017 were randomly scaled by 0 to 100 for 500 simulations section 2 4 in addition 100 and 50 reduction of dry weather stormdrain discharge scenarios were simulated section 2 5 discharge was evaluated at 12 reporting nodes along the mainstem section 2 1 to evaluate the impact of reduced wastewater discharge on recreation and aquatic life functional flow metrics table 3 such as dry season baseflow magnitude and wet season timing were quantified using the functional flows calculator api client package in r version 0 9 7 2 https github com ceff tech ffc api client which uses hydrologic feature detection algorithms developed by patterson et al 2020 and the python functional flows calculator https github com noellepatterson ffc readme 2 3 hydrologic model setup 2 3 1 spatial data sewersheds were downloaded from the la county watershed management and modeling system tetra tech 2020 these sewersheds were merged into 77 catchments with an average size of 15 8 km2 3900 ac the storm sewer network retrieved from the la county gis data portal county of los angeles 2020 as well as the national hydrography dataset u s geological survey 2019 flowlines were used to confirm the drainage network a digital elevation model dem was retrieved from the united states geological survey usgs 3d elevation program at 1 3 arcsecond resolution and processed to find the average slope for each subcatchment u s geological survey 2016a total imperviousness for each catchment was estimated from the national land cover database u s geological survey 2016b soils data was downloaded from the natural resources conservation service united states department of agriculture soil survey geographic database natural resources conservation service 2019 green ampt infiltration parameters hydraulic conductivity suction head moisture deficit were initially estimated by matching natural resources conservation service hydrologic soil groups to typical values and spatially averaging areas with no hydrologic soil information were assumed to be group d which is characteristic of soils in urban areas with low infiltration capacity national resources conservation service 2007 channel geometry was not included in the hydrologic model a separate hydraulic model was created with the hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras and detailed in a separate study stein et al 2021 2 3 2 time series data potential evapotranspiration pet data was downloaded from the california irrigation management information system cimis which is a collection of autonomous weather stations that make real time observations california department of water resources 2019 the inverse distance square weighing method longley et al 2015 was used to combine the reference pet time series from the nine closest cimis stations into one for the centroid of the la river watershed table s1 and applied to subcatchments throughout the watershed precipitation data was retrieved for 72 of the los angeles county automatic local evaluation in real time alert rain gages precipitation was spatially interpolated for each catchment by kriging using the krige function from the r package gstat with a variogram generated through the function fit variogram from the same package using a spherical variogram for the best fit r core team 2020 flow data at 29 gaging stations was retrieved from the los angeles county department of public works and at 6 gaging stations from the usgs spreading basin data was retrieved from the los angeles county department of public works for 15 facilities these facilities recharge a mix of imported recycled and stormwater because the distribution of these water sources changes annually current conditions at spreading basins were not modeled explicitly effects from spreading basins were captured by adjusting calibration parameters data was retrieved from the city of los angeles for discharges from the tillman and the glendale wrps timeseries discharge for burbank wrp to the la river was retrieved from the state water resources control board inflow and outflow data for five dams within the watershed were retrieved from the los angeles county department of public works eaton wash devil s gate big tujunga pacoima santa anita whittier narrows dam and sepulveda dam data were downloaded from the usgs website most of the dams are in the upper reaches of the lar watershed and capture runoff from primarily open space or undeveloped land because we were interested in the impact of wastewater discharge scenarios that affect flow in the urban parts of the watershed the dams were not explicitly modeled fig 1 rather we represented the dams as model nodes with inflow time series baseflow was separated from event flow using the usgs hydrograph separation program hysep and distributed across each reach based on contributing catchment area sloto and crouse 1996 the exception for this was in the glendale narrows area where baseflow was disaggregated to include groundwater upwelling wrp discharge and channel evaporation groundwater upwelling in the glendale narrows was assumed to be a constant discharge over the year at around 3 000 acre ft yr 0 12 cms upper los angeles river area watermaster 2018 evaporation within the channel was estimated by multiplying monthly pan evaporation data collected at long beach ca by a coefficient of 0 75 2 3 3 calibration and validation the hydrology model was calibrated at 7 gage stations from upstream to downstream using an automated calibration tool to optimize the calibration

percent bias between 19 9 and 17 3 table 1 example calibration and validation plots are shown in fig 2 and an example comparison of observed and simulated time series data is provided in figure s1 2 4 wastewater reuse scenarios a monte carlo approach was used to simulate a wide range of potential wrp reuse scenarios in the watershed including multiple combinations of reuse from each wrp as opposed to a discrete set of reuse scenarios i e all treatment plants reuse 0 25 50 75 or 100 this approach allows for flexibility of potential future management options that can be implemented to achieve objectives historic time series of wrp discharge from the water year 2011 to 2017 were scaled by 0 to 100 for 500 random simulations scenarios were summarized by the average annual seasonal i e wet or dry season wrp discharge over the simulation period equation 1 for example for a scenario with a scaling of 25 discharge 50 discharge and 75 discharge for tillman burbank and glendale respectively the

shallow groundwater dewatering operations was simulated using a water budget approach eq 2 4 dry weather stormdrain discharge is likely to decrease substantially over the next several years as the city of los angeles plans to install dry weather low flow diversion systems to improve water quality and comply with total maximum daily load requirements tmdls city of los angeles et al 2020 two

summarized using a suite of 24 functional flow metrics that quantify characteristics of the annual hydrograph that support a broad suite of ecological functions yarnell et al 2020 these metrics aggregate flow data into five flow components fall pulse flow wet season baseflows peak flows spring recession flows and dry season baseflows which represent different features of the annual hydrograph that are specific to california streams ranges of values for the 24 functional flow metrics were used to determine the degree to which each flow component can support characteristic biological communities and to assess the degree of hydrologic alteration in comparison to baseline conditions see supplementary material for additional background on functional flows functional flow metrics were compared longitudinally from upstream to downstream under baseline conditions to evaluate the relative contribution of wrp discharge on functional flows for the 500 reuse scenarios functional flow metrics were calculated at glendale narrows glen and in the lower reach of the mainstem la3 to determine which flow metrics are most sensitive to changes in wastewater discharge 2 7 flow targets for beneficial uses recommended flow ranges for ecological and recreational uses in the la river used in this study were compiled from previous work table 2 stein and sanchez 2019 stein et al 2021 briefly flow conditions necessary to support the life history needs of several focal species were determined and used to create flow ecology curves or models relating key hydrologic and hydraulic variables to the probability of occurrence for each focal species or the probability of being able to complete specific life history requirements focal species for the glendale narrows glen include cattails typha spp indicative of freshwater marsh habitat and black willow salix gooddingii indicative of riparian habitat the glendale narrows also supports recreational kayaking focal species in the lower mainstem of the la river la3 are steelhead trout oncorhynchus mykiss and green algae cladophora spp large populations of wading shorebirds use the lower mainstem of the la river and eat the green algae steelhead trout have historically used the mainstem of the la river as a migratory passage to spawning grounds in the upper tributaries but they are not currently observed in the river the percentage of simulation years that had dry season and wet season baseflows within the recommended flow ranges for each focal species was calculated for glen and la3 over the 500 wastewater reuse scenarios 2 8 sensitivity curves flow based sensitivity curves were developed that relate changes in wrp discharge to functional flow metrics for each scenario the range of flow metric values from the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles were plotted against the average seasonal wrp discharge to account for the variability in flow metric values from each scenario across the period of record curves were developed for the dry season baseflow 50th percentile of mean daily flow during the dry season and wet season baseflow 10th percentile of mean daily flow during the wet season magnitude metrics the wet season metrics baseflows from the start of the storm season to the start of the dry season and dry season metrics baseflows from the start of the dry season to the start of the following wet season were calculated on an annual basis typically the start of the wet season is between november to january and the start of the dry season is between may to july depending on the climatic conditions for a given water year sensitivity curves were used in combination with recommended flow ranges table 2 to determine wastewater discharge needed to support aquatic life and recreational uses 3 results discussion 3 1 current conditions 3 1 1 functional flow metrics the la river generally experiences a long dry season from mid may to mid november and a wet season from approximately mid november to mid march fig 3 dry season baseflow magnitude ranged from 2 to 2 7 cms with a duration of 121 to 237 days wet season baseflows ranged from 2 1 to 3 7 cms with a median duration of 129 days the median flow metric values for glen are shown in table 3 along with the range in values from the 10th to 90th percentiles certain flow components are not well represented in the la river which we expect is similar to other flashy systems in semi arid regions for example the fall pulse flows can be important for the initial flushing of fine sediments and priming of the system for subsequent winter storms however in the la river such pulse flows seldom support these functions because of the lack of natural substrate stochastic nature of early season storms and the fact that the first storms of the season are often captured through stormwater infrastructure for water quality purposes in the la river fall pulse flows rarely occurred but when they did they occurred in october with a magnitude ranging from 7 to 33 cms similarly pronounced spring recession flows are often absent in the la river due to the lack of snowmelt runoff lack of strong groundwater influence and channelized nature of the river which hastens draining of the system following storms the spring recession magnitude is typically a function of the last major storm of the wet season which ranged from 15 to 262 cms and a rate of change median daily percent decrease in flow per day from 0 01 to 0 05 during baseline conditions median dry season baseflow in the mainstem of the la river across all reporting nodes ranged between 0 12 and 3 5 cms river discharge increased downstream of the three wastewater treatment plants illustrating the contributions of discharges from the treatment plants fig 4 on average wrp discharge contributed the greatest proportion of flow during the summer months june through august fig 4 other sources of baseflow included groundwater upwelling and dry weather stormdrain discharge i e residential irrigation and car washing glendale narrows nodes la14 through f57c is a key area for aquatic life and recreation but it is also one of the places where wrp discharge has a particularly large contribution fig 4 therefore a reduction in wrp discharge could affect habitat and biodiversity vital ecosystem function and beneficial uses in this area cardinale et al 2012 mccann 2000 tilman 1999 3 1 2 suitability to support beneficial uses under current wastewater discharge conditions annual average discharge of 1 91 cms median baseflows in the glendale narrows are suitable for willow an indicator of riparian habitat and kayaking which occurs in the summer months across all baseline simulation years in addition flows can support cattail marsh in most years 67 fig 5 current median baseflow conditions in the lower la river are suitable for the migration of steelhead trout and green algae which support wading shorebird foraging in the lower la river mainstem fig 5 it should be noted however that steelhead are not currently observed likely due to other hydraulic physical e g dams and water quality factors e g temperature efforts are currently underway to more thoroughly examine the limiting factors for steelhead restoration in the watershed and develop a plan for channel modifications to improve suitability for steelhead in a 7 7 km reach of the river stillwater sciences 2020 despite the suitability for all species of interest current median baseflows are on the low end of the recommended flow ranges particularly for cattail and kayaking in the glendale narrows fig 5 3 2 wastewater reuse scenarios 3 2 1 sensitivity of functional flow metrics across all wastewater reuse scenarios the duration of the dry season increased by an average of 17 days with a maximum of 22 days the duration of wet season baseflow decreased by an average of 16 days and the spring recession duration increased by an average of 41 days maximum 58 days of the calculated flow metrics wet and dry season baseflow magnitude spring recession rate of change percent decreased in flow per day over spring recession duration and spring recession duration were the most sensitive to changes in wastewater reuse the most resilient metrics included peak flow durations and frequencies fig 6 while the spring recession rate of change was sensitive to changes in wrp discharge on a percentage basis the absolute rate of change values were extremely low maximum absolute change is 5 9 mean is 1 2 further the fall and spring season metrics have minimal relevance for the ecology of the la river as previously discussed section 3 1 1 the most consistent impacts of reduced wrp discharge were to baseflow both during the dry and wet season with decreases on average of 0 93 cms 33 cfs which is an approximately 51 56 decrease from current conditions fig 6 wet season baseflow metrics were slightly greater than dry season metrics due to the contribution of residual stormdrain discharge following storm events there are plans to install both distributed and centralized stormwater management systems throughout the watershed to replenish groundwater aquifers reduce flood risk and improve water quality geosyntec consultants 2015 this may have additional implications for both wet season peak flows and baseflows overall we project that increases in wastewater reuse will result in a longer dry season shorter wet season and reduced baseflow we concentrate on wet and dry season baseflow for the remainder of the analysis because baseflow is one of the most sensitive functional flow metrics to changes in wastewater reuse 3 2 2 suitability to support beneficial uses as wastewater reuse increases the number of simulation years in which baseflows fall within the recommended flow ranges for beneficial uses declines fig 7 for example with an average annual dry season wrp discharge of 0 96 cms 50 of current wrp discharge glendale narrows has flows that are suitable for willow but not for cattail or kayaking fig 7 and the lower la river has flows suitable for green algae and steelhead migration however the suitability for willow green algae and steelhead rapidly decreases when the average annual dry season wrp discharge falls below about 0 6 cms about 30 of current wrp discharge wading shorebird green algae and freshwater marsh cattail habitat are representative of the wildlife habitat beneficial use in the la river which sustains both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems by providing food resources nurseries and habitat for higher trophic level organisms including birds amphibians and invertebrates wading shorebird habitat supports a large number of migratory and resident bird species cooper 2006 some of which are threatened or endangered such species provide local and global benefits such as pest control plant pollination seed dispersal and are a food resource for other species mart√≠nez salinas et al 2016 michel et al 2020 sekercioglu 2006 a reduction in wading shorebird population may lead to reduced pollination of plants and therefore a reduction in plant populations anderson et al 2011 freshwater marsh habitats comprise 25 of freshwater wetlands in the usa burton and uzarski 2009 as well as supporting a vast amount of biodiversity freshwater marsh is known to filter nutrients and pollutants from runoff and surface water and has even been used in some areas to treat domestic and industrial wastewater bayley et al 1985 burton and uzarski 2009 carlisle and mulamoottil 1991 additionally inland freshwater wetlands sequester and store carbon in soil however this ability may be hindered in anthropogenically disturbed areas nahlik and fennessy 2016 such as the la river less than 5 of natural wetlands greater los angeles county 2012 stein et al 2014 remain in los angeles county and nationwide bird populations have declined greatly rosenberg et al 2019 over the past 50 years the fact that these habitats currently exist in the highly urbanized la river produces a unique opportunity for protection and management that should not be ignored 3 3 management implications in addition to understanding the effects of wastewater reuse on beneficial uses one of the key goals of this work was to inform future management decisions in the la river watershed and other similar urban watersheds to do this flow based sensitivity curves were developed for 18 nodes of management interest curves are shown for the glendale narrows glen fig 8 and lower la river la3 fig 9 the curves relate discharge from the water reclamation plants under various dry weather stormdrain reduction scenarios to dry and wet season baseflow which can then be related to beneficial use flow limits the curves provide relationships between effluent discharge and streamflow at the 10th 50th and 90th percentiles based on the seven year simulation record fig 8 and fig 9 the sensitivity curve approach was developed in conjunction with basin stakeholders and a technical advisory group to ensure that the tools developed in this study could be used for decisions regarding the 1211 wastewater change petitions this approach allows a potentially unlimited number of future reuse scenarios to be evaluated and therefore provides more utility than evaluating a finite number of discrete scenarios one potential use of the curves is to quantify the maximum amount of wastewater reuse that does not adversely affect existing beneficial uses based on aquatic habitat and recreation in the river for example during the dry season at glendale narrows cattail is the most sensitive species to changes in wrp discharge to maintain a median dry season baseflow magnitude above the recommended range for cattail wrp discharge should be maintained at 96 of the current discharge 1 84 cms if instead kayaking is prioritized over cattail wrp discharge could potentially be reduced to about 77 of the current discharge 1 48 cms if managers determine that only willow riparian habitat is a management priority then wrp discharge could be reduced to 13 of the current discharge there may also be flexibility in the timing of recycling during the day for example more water could be diverted for reuse at night to allow for sufficient flows for kayaking during the summer days it is also important to note that kayaking is highly dependent on the channel morphology and flow ranges were developed from one representative cross section at glen which may be different than other locations in glendale narrows there is more flexibility for wastewater reuse in the glendale narrows during the wet season when discharge can be reduced to about 76 of the current rate without affecting cattail or willows fig 8 utilities within the basin could therefore prioritize wastewater reuse during wetter months note that these estimates are based on the median baseflow but managers may want to use the 90th percentile band to be more conservative and provide additional opportunities for water reuse fig 8 the lower la river la3 is much less sensitive to changes in wastewater discharge than the glendale narrows glen sensitivity curves suggest that discharge can be reduced to 2 of the current rate in the dry season and 6 in the wet season without impacting suitability for steelhead migration and green algae fig 9 the greater flexibility for reuse in the lower la river suggests that the glendale narrows should be the focus of management efforts where a reduction in baseflow is more likely to impact beneficial uses however streamflow is not the only driver of habitat suitability while current and future managed flows may be suitable for steelhead migration in the lower la river other factors like coarse substrate and pools and riffles that can serve as refugia are not present u s bureau of reclamation 2019 in addition water quality parameters such as temperature may not be suitable abdi et al 2022 results show that reductions in dry weather stormdrain discharge would have a relatively large impact on both the glendale narrows and the lower la river in the glendale narrows with no changes to wrp discharge a 50 reduction in stormdrain discharge could impact the suitability of the habitat for cattail and a 100 reduction of stormdrain discharge may impact the suitability of the habitat for cattail and kayaking fig 8 in the lower la river with current wrp discharge reduction of stormdrain discharge does not negatively affect steelhead migration or green algae growth however reductions in stormdrain discharge do have compounding effects with reductions in wrp discharge thus illustrating the importance of considering the entire urban water cycle when making decisions on instream flows 4 conclusion a functional flows approach was paired with a monte carlo simulation to estimate how wastewater reuse could impact beneficial uses in an effluent dominated urban river in los angeles flow augmentation creates novel conditions that support both ecosystem services and societal benefits e g recreation some future management scenarios can meet wastewater reuse goals and environmental flow patterns primarily during the wet season when baseflows are typically greater and recreational boating activities are limited we recommend that wastewater reuse in the la river watershed be done in conjunction with channel restoration activities baseflows in the river will be altered very quickly which provides an opportunity for revitalization of the mainstem over time the flood control capabilities of the channel may be reevaluated as the region plans for enhanced stormwater capture through distributed stormwater control measures which will provide some flood protection we demonstrated that functional flow metrics can be joined with a suite of potential urban river disturbances or management scenarios to aid in future water planning and decision making for environmental flows in addition to potential changes in wastewater discharge functional flow metrics could be paired with other management decisions such as increases in stormwater capture reduction of dry weather urban baseflows flow disturbances by climate change or wildfire or restoration efforts in future studies we recommend that functional flow metrics be used with other habitat characteristics such as hydraulic conditions e g velocity and shear stress water quality e g temperature and the life history needs for species of management concern these sensitivity curves have advantages to the traditional approach of picking a handful of discrete scenarios to investigate the developed approach can be applied to other urban watersheds where rivers must be managed for competing needs credit

estimation procedure results are discussed in section 3 for both the confined aquifer solution and the situation of leakage we close with a summary and conclusion additional information is available in the supporting information 2 methods and data 2 1 conceptual model we consider a horizontal confined aquifer near an open water body such as a river harbour or lake the confined aquifer is separated from the overlaying unconfined aquifer through a confining or leaky aquitard such as a clay or peat layer as displayed in fig 1 we study two settings in details which are often encountered in practice i fully confined aquifer without leakage and ii a leaky confining layer resulting in a hydraulic contact between the confined and the overlaying unconfined aquifer we further test the applicability of our approach on the situation of a low permeable barrier separating the aquifer from the open water such as a quay wall or sheet piling found in harbours or canals major assumptions are i aquifers are isotropic and homogeneous in their hydraulic properties including hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage s s ii aquifers and open water bodies are separated by a sharp vertical interface with small lateral extent compared to the distance of wave propagation iii flow in the confined aquifer is horizontal and free of density driven flow in case of a leaky aquifer we assume vertical flow to be linearly proportional to the head difference between the confined and unconfined aquifer the storage of the leaky confining layer is negligible which is a commonly used assumption in layered coastal aquitards hemker 1999 the water table in the unconfined aquifer is constant and equals the mean sea level this setting is based on the assumption that the wave is either damped quickly given the large storage capacity or not propagating into the unconfined layer at all such as in controlled situations like polders where pumps guarantee a constant water level jiao and tang 1999 2 2 mathematical model 2 2 1 simple wave boundary solution the hydraulic head in a confined aquifer is given by a solution of the following partial differential equation ingersoll et al 1948 1 s s h x t t k 2 h x t x 2 where h x t m is the spatio temporal hydraulic head profile in time t d and distance x m from the open water body s s 1 m is the specific storage and k m d is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity for the case of a confined aquifer with leakage from an unconfined aquifer through a semipermeable layer the equation extends to jiao and tang 1999 2 s h x t t t 2 h x t x 2 1 c l h s h x t with s s s d m being the storativity t k d m2 d the aquifer s transmissivity where d m is the confined aquifer thickness c l d the resistance of the confining layer which is the thickness of the confining layer divided by its hydraulic conductivity h s m is the wave s equilibrium constant which corresponds to the outer boundary condition of the semi infinite aquifer i e h x t h s we assume h s 0 for the sake of simplicity the impact of the open water body is described by a time dependent boundary condition bc at x 0 via 3 h 0 t a cos œâ t œÜ h s where a m is the tidal wave amplitude œâ rad d is the angular frequency and œÜ rad is the phase shift the general solution of the partial differential eqs 1 and 2 for the simple wave bc 3 reads ingersoll et al 1948 jiao and

an accompanying open source python package making use of fft the critical step for identifying the solution of the head h x t is the decomposition of the input wave h 0 t eq 5 via fft and identifying amplitudes frequencies and phase shifts of each wave component technical details are provided in the supporting information 2 3 numerical model the propagation of complex waves into aquifers can also be solved numerically for proof of concept and for generating artificial reference data we setup flow models in modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 through the python package flopy bakker et al 2016 we prepared several model setups a regular confined aquifer and a leaky aquifer setting following the conceptual model outlined in section 2 1 the choice of parameters is given in table 1 we further setup a numerical model for a low permeable barrier between the confined aquifer without leakage and the open water body the resistance to groundwater exchange is approximately the ratio of an effective thickness d b and an effective hydraulic conductivity k b of the barrier its specific storage equals that of the confined aquifer the numerical model results of this scenario are used to identify limits of the applicability of the confined aquifer solution eq 6 for this particular flow situation we run the numerical model for three types of complex wave boundary conditions which are visualized in fig 2 i a tidal wave as typically observed in harbours ii a synthetic square wave and iii an observed fluctuating river level the times series are normalized to an average of h s 0 over the observation interval the aquifer system is discretized through a one dimensional grid of 15 000 cells with exponentially increasing grid spacing the grid spacing is adapted to the strong head fluctuation close to the open water body which decreases with distance it thus allows for a better resolution of the head while limiting the amount of memory needed for the constant head boundary at infinite distance observations of the head in the aquifer are taken at multiple distances x mimicking observation wells simulation time t sim varies between 5 and 480 days depending on the length of the time series of the bcs fig 2 observations times are identical to those given by the time series 2 4 parameter estimation the analytical solution 6 can be used to estimate aquifer specific parameters such as the hydraulic diffusivity s s k under the condition that at least two time series of measurements are available namely that of piezometric heads in the aquifer and water level observations of the open water body we consider the numerical model results as artificial observations and test the efficiency of the analytical solution for inverse parameter estimation through fitting in case of leakage a second unknown parameter is the product of resistance and storativity c l s c l s s d we apply an inverse estimation procedure which focuses on dominant wave components to reduce wave noise effects the workflow has the following steps 1 decompose the particular complex wave boundary condition h 0 t which is assumed to be known with fft to identify amplitudes a k 0 frequencies œâ k 0 and phase shifts œÜ k 0 2 identify the dominant wave component of h 0 t being the one with the largest amplitude a max 0 select all wave components a thres 0 œÜ thres 0 and œâ thres 0 which are at least 20 relative to the dominant amplitude the threshold value of 20 is arbitrary but proofed useful since the quality of the fit goes down when all fft components are used 3 decompose the head time series h x t at a piezometer position x via fft in our case of full data availability from the numerical model we select time series h x t at reasonable distances x 4 identify the fft decomposition components a thres x œÜ thres x and œâ thres x of the decomposed head time series h x t which correspond to the threshold wave components of the input wave fft decomposition this is possible since œâ max does not change with x and t during propagation through the aquifer linking the fft decomposition of h 0 t and h x t 5 reconstruct the wave at x via h x thres t i a thres i x cos œâ thres i x t œÜ thres i x 6 setup the analytical wave solution h thres t s s k for the selected wave components according to eq 6 7 run a minimization routine to identify the optimal s s k by fitting the difference between the observed wave of dominant components h x thres t to the function h thres t s s k the workflow is implemented in the accompanying python package for optimization we use simple least square fitting through the routine curve fit the procedure is similarly applicable to real head observations at x and wave observations in an open water body we evaluate estimated parameters particularly diffusivity s s k by comparison to the input value of the numerical model making use of the relative difference Œµ rel y y ana y num y num where y stands for a particular parameter the quality of the parameter estimation is a function of the fft decomposition and depends on the location x of the observation well the depth of the wave propagation into the aquifer depends on the wave frequency furthermore the wave signal is damped during propagation through the aquifer shown in decreasing wave amplitudes this effect is amplified by leakage we quantify the impact of distance and damping on the estimation quality through a damping coefficient Œ∂ max x which relates the largest amplitudes of the input wave and the observed one 7 Œ∂ max x 1 a max x a max 0 0 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 confined aquifer solution 3 1 1 analytical solution performance the first step of finding a solution for a wave progagation into an aquifer eq 6 is the decomposition of the complex wave itself eq 5 the implementation of the fft decomposition of h 0 t is tested and reported in the supporting information where we show that the decomposed bc reproduces the input time series for all three selected waves very well after decomposition of h 0 t the head distribution in a confined aquifer is computed for the three boundary waves using the analytical solution results are subsequently compared to their numerical counterparts i e the results from modflow simulations fig 3 shows the head distributions in space h x at selected times normalized to the simulation time such that t t t max 0 1 t max corresponds to the end observation time of the wave input bc both the numerical and analytical solutions agree very well for all three wave bcs and times the very good performance of the analytical solution makes it a simple method for computing wave propagation of complex waves in aquifers it further provides an application tool for parameter estimation based on piezometer time series 3 1 2 inverse parameter estimation we test the analytical solution 6 for a confined aquifer and for all three wave bcs fig 2 through fitting it to the numerical data using the procedure outline in section 2 4 we selected the piezometer to be located at x 400 m from the open water body fig 4 shows the results of the fitting of the analytical solution to its numerical counterpart which are of good quality the estimates of the hydraulic diffusivity s s k showed a relative difference Œµ rel of less than 2 for all input waves 3 1 3 impact of observation location the quality of inverse parameter estimation results depends on the location of the piezometer to the boundary fig 5 shows the effect of the location of the piezometer on the diffusivity estimate through the relative differences between the fitted and model input diffusivity as function of the piezometer location x and the damping coefficient eq 7 for all three wave bc note that the damping coefficient can better be interpreted as a re scaling of the distance x with regard to the impact of the dominant wave amplitude in case of the tidal boundary condition the relative error Œµ is low except for piezometers in the vicinity of the open water body x 0 and for locations far from the open water body thus an optimum range exists at intermediate distances the same holds for the river level bc while here the distance x for increasing relative differences is much higher this is due to the different character of the time series being of larger wave length penetrating deeper into the aquifer the behaviour is confirmed by the damping coefficient relation close to x 0 the input wave is hardly damped and shows high amplitudes thus the aquifer had little effect on the groundwater fluctuations at small distances from the boundary and the analytical solution is highly sensitive towards deviations in the estimate of s s k resulting in high relative differences at the other hand at large distances from the boundary the damping coefficient increases causing the propagating wave to be hardly detectable in the field inhibiting an accurate estimate estimates are typically best for relatively short distances x when damping of the signal has not progressed to much but has progressed far enough for the aquifer to have an effect the relative difference of s s k in case of the square wave is low for all damping coefficients we relate that to the regular structure of the square wave and the sufficient input bc time series length the wave quickly propagates through the aquifer and the dominant amplitude can be identified properly at all distances thus the agreement of analytical with numerical solution is high and so is the quality of the diffusivity estimate 3 2 leakage and flow barriers in many field situations the boundary wave propagation in an confined aquifer is impacted by specific conditions such as leakage through the confining layer or vertical flow barriers along the open water bodies both are characterised by a specific resistance c which is linked to the local hydraulic conductivity k of the leaking confining layer subscript l or flow barrier subscript b respectively k l d l c l and k b d b c b where d is the thickness of the specific layer for further analysis of the impact of leakage and barriers we focus on the tidal wave input bc 3 2 1 robustness of confined aquifer solution we first tested robustness of the analytical solution eq 6 for confined aquifers not considering the impact of leakage and barriers explicitly by comparing it to numerical model results taking leakage and flow barriers into account for a wide range of resistance values using the tidal wave bc we estimated diffusivity through the inverse estimation procedure section 2 4 and plotted the relative difference to input diffusivity in fig 6 it is displayed as function of the ratio of conductivity of the leaking semi impermeable layer or barrier respectively and the confined aquifer conductivity results in fig 6 a show that the flow behaviour for leaky aquifers starts to deviate from confined aquifer behaviour when the conductivity of the confining layer k l is less than four orders of magnitude smaller than the confined aquifer conductivity k at this threshold the estimate of diffusivity starts deviating from the input value by more than 10 rendering the estimate unreliable the deviation increases with increasing distance x of the observation location given the damping effect of leakage on the wave traveling through the aquifer for the situation of a flow barrier fig 6b the estimates of diffusivity are reliable for a range of two order of magnitude differences between the flow barrier k b and the aquifer conductivity k when the resistance of the barrier is much higher i e the conductivity goes down then the input wave is highly damped and the observed signal cannot be matched to the confined aquifer solution as expected the comparison in fig 6 shows the range of resistance values for which leakage and flow barriers do not significantly impact how the input wave bc travels through the confined aquifer given the chosen numerical model values of confined aquifer conductivity k and layer thickness d table 1 this refers to resistances of c l 400 d and c b 0 4 d results show that both aspects have very distinct and partially counteracting influence on the wave propagation thus we expect the wave signal for an aquifer exposed to leakage and a flow barrier at the same time as a superposition of both influences for strongly leaking confined layers the use of the analytical solution including the effect of leakage can be used to identify reliable estimates of diffusivity see following section in case of a flow barrier along the open water body we do not consider the use of an adapted solution instead it is more efficient to observe the actual signal behind the flow barrier e g in a piezometer at a few meter distance to the barrier and use that as input bc signal for the confined aquifer solution 3 2 2 inverse parameter estimation for leaking aquifers the analytical solution for leaky aquifers eq 6 also shows good agreement to the numerical results of the modflow model for the same setting results analog to fig 3 are displayed in the supporting information a significant feature of leakage is the damping of the wave propagation into the aquifer due to groundwater exchange through leakage thus locations for inverse parameter estimation need to be adapted and closer to the open water body as shown in the previous section the head distribution is significantly impacted by leakage for confining layer resistances c l smaller than 400days we ran the fitting procedure to numerical simulation results estimating diffusivity s s k and the resistance factor c s simultaneously for various distances of the piezometer from the open water body given the strong impact of leakage on damping the wave signal results are displayed in fig 7 the pattern of inverse estimation quality of diffusivity and resistance factor c s in fig 7 strongly depends on the leakage factor and observation distance generally the reliablity of the inverse estimate of diffusivity decreases with decreasing resistance value c due to the stronger damping effect of leakage while the estimate of the leakage factor c s becomes less reliable for increasing resistances c observation locations at larger distances e g x 200 m are better for estimating diffusivity while the leakage factor is only well estimated for a small range of values closer to the open water body e g at x 50 m the estimate of resistance is particularly better for very small resistances which is linked to the rapid damping of the wave signal for strong leakage 4 summary and conclusions we investigated analytical solutions for the propagation of complex waves in confined and leaky homogeneous aquifers close to open water bodies such as rivers lakes and coastal areas we derived explicit mathematical expressions for the hydraulic head in aquifers as function of time location from the open water body and the input wave signal solutions are implemented in an accompanying open source python package making use of fast fourier transformation the solutions are tested for three application examples a tidal wave a synthetic square wave and river fluctuations they are almost identical to solutions from numerical modflow models under identical settings we then tested the ability of analytical solutions to inversely estimate aquifer properties such as hydraulic diffusivity by comparing to numerical simulation results for a broad range of parameter values reliable estimates of diffusivity can be achieved when choosing appropriate observation locations for the particular aquifer situation the analytical solutions proved to be fast versatile and applicable for all types of boundary conditions provided they are continuous their implementation offers the opportunity to inversely estimate aquifer properties in a fast and efficient manner for confined aquifer diffusivity can be estimated at a level of less than 2 relative difference to numerical input data this particularly holds for piezometer observations at intermediate distances from the open water body where the wave signal is not yet damped to strongly but has travelled through the aquifer sufficiently long to experience aquifer specifics the longer the periodicity of the input wave signal the further is this distance in case of hydraulic barriers the confined aquifer solution can be used when the flow barrier shows conductivity differences to the aquifer of less than 2 orders of magnitude for barriers with higher resistance the analytical solution can be used when the input wave is a damped wave signal from a head observation behind the barriers but close to the open water body leakage significantly impacts the propagation of the input wave signal into the aquifer for conductivity differences of the leaking unconfined layer of less than four orders of magnitude in this case the analytical solution including the confining layer resistance provides a tool to gain reliable estimates of diffusivity and resistance however due to the damping the observation location of the head signal for inverse estimation has to be carefully chosen being closer to the open water body the stronger the leakage i e the lower the confined layer resistance although we consider the simplified configuration of a 1d horizontal homogeneous confined leaky aquifer results can be applied to typical field situations the scheme of deriving analytical solutions can easily be applied to more complex subsurface configurations providing the governing equations

damped quickly given the large storage capacity or not propagating into the unconfined layer at all such as in controlled situations like polders where pumps guarantee a constant water level jiao and

an accompanying open source python package making use of fft the critical step for identifying the solution of the head h x t is the decomposition of the input wave h 0 t eq 5 via fft and identifying amplitudes frequencies and phase shifts of each wave component technical details are provided in the supporting information 2 3 numerical model the propagation of complex waves into aquifers can also be solved numerically for proof of concept and for generating artificial reference data we setup flow models in modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 through the python package flopy bakker et al 2016 we prepared several model setups a regular confined aquifer and a leaky aquifer setting following the conceptual model outlined in section 2 1 the choice of parameters is given in table 1 we further setup a numerical model for a low permeable barrier between the confined aquifer without leakage and the open water body the resistance to groundwater exchange is approximately the ratio of an effective thickness d b and an effective hydraulic conductivity k b of the barrier its specific storage equals that of the confined aquifer the numerical model results of this scenario are used to identify limits of the applicability of the confined aquifer solution eq 6 for this particular flow situation we run the numerical model for three types of complex wave boundary conditions which are visualized in fig 2 i a tidal wave as typically observed in harbours ii a synthetic square wave and iii an observed fluctuating river level the times series are normalized to an average of h s 0 over the observation interval the aquifer system is discretized through a one dimensional grid of 15 000 cells with exponentially increasing grid spacing the grid spacing is adapted to the strong head fluctuation close to the open water body which decreases with distance it thus allows for a better resolution of the head while limiting the amount of memory needed for the constant head boundary at infinite distance observations of the head in the aquifer are taken at multiple distances x mimicking observation wells simulation time t sim varies between 5 and 480 days depending on the length of the time series of the bcs fig 2 observations times are identical to those given by the time series 2 4 parameter estimation the analytical solution 6 can be used to estimate aquifer specific parameters such as the hydraulic diffusivity s s k under the condition that at least two time series of measurements are available namely that of piezometric heads in the aquifer and water level observations of the open water body we consider the numerical model results as artificial observations and test the efficiency of the analytical solution for inverse parameter estimation through fitting in case of leakage a second unknown parameter is the product of resistance and storativity c l s c l s s d we apply an inverse estimation procedure which focuses on dominant wave components to reduce wave noise effects the workflow has the following steps 1 decompose the particular complex wave boundary condition h 0 t which is assumed to be known with fft to identify amplitudes a k 0 frequencies œâ k 0 and phase shifts œÜ k 0 2 identify the dominant wave component of h 0 t being the one with the largest amplitude a max 0 select all wave components a thres 0 œÜ thres 0 and œâ thres 0 which are at least 20 relative to the dominant amplitude the threshold value of 20 is arbitrary but proofed useful since the quality of the fit goes down when all fft components are used 3 decompose the head time series h x t at a piezometer position x via fft in our case of full data availability from the numerical model we select time series h x t at reasonable distances x 4 identify the fft decomposition components a thres x œÜ thres x and œâ thres x of the decomposed head time series h x t which correspond to the threshold wave components of the input wave fft decomposition this is possible since œâ max does not change with x and t during propagation through the aquifer linking the fft decomposition of h 0 t and h x t 5 reconstruct the wave at x via h x thres t i a thres i x cos œâ thres i x t œÜ thres i x 6 setup the analytical wave solution h thres t s s k for the selected wave components according to eq 6 7 run a minimization routine to identify the optimal s s k by fitting the difference between the observed wave of dominant components h x thres t to the function h thres t s s k the workflow is implemented in the accompanying python package for optimization we use simple least square fitting through the routine curve fit the procedure is similarly applicable to real head observations at x and wave observations in an open water body we evaluate estimated parameters particularly diffusivity s s k by comparison to the input value of the numerical model making use of the relative difference Œµ rel y y ana y num y num where y stands for a particular parameter the quality of the parameter estimation is a function of the fft decomposition and depends on the location x of the observation well the depth of the wave propagation into the aquifer depends on the wave frequency furthermore the wave signal is damped during propagation through the aquifer shown in decreasing wave amplitudes this effect is amplified by leakage we quantify the impact of distance and damping on the estimation quality through a damping coefficient Œ∂ max x which relates the largest amplitudes of the input wave and the observed one 7 Œ∂ max x 1 a max x a max 0 0 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 confined aquifer solution 3 1 1 analytical solution performance the first step of finding a solution for a wave progagation into an aquifer eq 6 is the decomposition of the complex wave itself eq 5 the implementation of the fft decomposition of h 0 t is tested and reported in the supporting information where we show that the decomposed bc reproduces the input time series for all three selected waves very well after decomposition of h 0 t the head distribution in a confined aquifer is computed for the three boundary waves using the analytical solution results are subsequently compared to their numerical counterparts i e the results from modflow simulations fig 3 shows the head distributions in space h x at selected times normalized to the simulation time such that t t t max 0 1 t max corresponds to the end observation time of the wave input bc both the numerical and analytical solutions agree very well for all three wave bcs and times the very good performance of the analytical solution makes it a simple method for computing wave propagation of complex waves in aquifers it further provides an application tool for parameter estimation based on piezometer time series 3 1 2 inverse parameter estimation we test the analytical solution 6 for a confined aquifer and for all three wave bcs fig 2 through fitting it to the numerical data using the procedure outline in section 2 4 we selected the piezometer to be located at x 400 m from the open water body fig 4 shows the results of the fitting of the analytical solution to its numerical counterpart which are of good quality the estimates of the hydraulic diffusivity s s k showed a relative difference Œµ rel of less than 2 for all input waves 3 1 3 impact of observation location the quality of inverse parameter estimation results depends on the location of the piezometer to the boundary fig 5 shows the effect of the location of the piezometer on the diffusivity estimate through the relative differences between the fitted and model input diffusivity as function of the piezometer location x and the damping coefficient eq 7 for all three wave bc note that the damping coefficient can better be interpreted as a re scaling of the distance x with regard to the impact of the dominant wave amplitude in case of the tidal boundary condition the relative error Œµ is low except for piezometers in the vicinity of the open water body x 0 and for locations far from the open water body thus an optimum range exists at intermediate distances the same holds for the river level bc while here the distance x for increasing relative differences is much higher this is due to the different character of the time series being of larger wave length penetrating deeper into the aquifer the behaviour is confirmed by the damping coefficient relation close to x 0 the input wave is hardly damped and shows high amplitudes thus the aquifer had little effect on the groundwater fluctuations at small distances from the boundary and the analytical solution is highly sensitive towards deviations in the estimate of s s k resulting in high relative differences at the other hand at large distances from the boundary the damping coefficient increases causing the propagating wave to be hardly detectable in the field inhibiting an accurate estimate estimates are typically best for relatively short distances x when damping of the signal has not progressed to much but has progressed far enough for the aquifer to have an effect the relative difference of s s k in case of the square wave is low for all damping coefficients we relate that to the regular structure of the square wave and the sufficient input bc time series length the wave quickly propagates through the aquifer and the dominant amplitude can be identified properly at all distances thus the agreement of analytical with numerical solution is high and so is the quality of the diffusivity estimate 3 2 leakage and flow barriers in many field situations the boundary wave propagation in an confined aquifer is impacted by specific conditions such as leakage through the confining layer or vertical flow barriers along the open water bodies both are characterised by a specific resistance c which is linked to the local hydraulic conductivity k of the leaking confining layer subscript l or flow barrier subscript b respectively k l d l c l and k b d b c b where d is the thickness of the specific layer for further analysis of the impact of leakage and barriers we focus on the tidal wave input bc 3 2 1 robustness of confined aquifer solution we first tested robustness of the analytical solution eq 6 for confined aquifers not considering the impact of leakage and barriers explicitly by comparing it to numerical model results taking leakage and flow barriers into account for a wide range of resistance values using the tidal wave bc we estimated diffusivity through the inverse estimation procedure section 2 4 and plotted the relative difference to input diffusivity in fig 6 it is displayed as function of the ratio of conductivity of the leaking semi impermeable layer or barrier respectively and the confined aquifer conductivity results in fig 6 a show that the flow behaviour for leaky aquifers starts to deviate from confined aquifer behaviour when the conductivity of the confining layer k l is less than four orders of magnitude smaller than the confined aquifer conductivity k at this threshold the estimate of diffusivity starts deviating from the input value by more than 10 rendering the estimate unreliable the deviation increases with increasing distance x of the observation location given the damping effect of leakage on the wave traveling through the aquifer for the situation of a flow barrier fig 6b the estimates of diffusivity are reliable for a range of two order of magnitude differences between the flow barrier k b and the aquifer conductivity k when the resistance of the barrier is much higher i e the conductivity goes down then the input wave is highly damped and the observed signal cannot be matched to the confined aquifer solution as expected the comparison in fig 6 shows the range of resistance values for which leakage and flow barriers do not significantly impact how the input wave bc travels through the confined aquifer given the chosen numerical model values of confined aquifer conductivity k and layer thickness d table 1 this refers to resistances of c l 400 d and c b 0 4 d results show that both aspects have very distinct and partially counteracting influence on the wave propagation thus we expect the wave signal for an aquifer exposed to leakage and a flow barrier at the same time as a superposition of both influences for strongly leaking confined layers the use of the analytical solution including the effect of leakage can be used to identify reliable estimates of diffusivity see following section in case of a flow barrier along the open water body we do not consider the use of an adapted solution instead it is more efficient to observe the actual signal behind the flow barrier e g in a piezometer at a few meter distance to the barrier and use that as input bc signal for the confined aquifer solution 3 2 2 inverse parameter estimation for leaking aquifers the analytical solution for leaky aquifers eq 6 also shows good agreement to the numerical results of the modflow model for the same setting results analog to fig 3 are displayed in the supporting information a significant feature of leakage is the damping of the wave propagation into the aquifer due to groundwater exchange through leakage thus locations for inverse parameter estimation need to be adapted and closer to the open water body as shown in the previous section the head distribution is significantly impacted by leakage for confining layer resistances c l smaller than 400days we ran the fitting procedure to numerical simulation results estimating diffusivity s s k and the resistance factor c s simultaneously for various distances of the piezometer from the open water body given the strong impact of leakage on damping the wave signal results are displayed in fig 7 the pattern of inverse estimation quality of diffusivity and resistance factor c s in fig 7 strongly depends on the leakage factor and observation distance generally the reliablity of the inverse estimate of diffusivity decreases with decreasing resistance value c due to the stronger damping effect of leakage while the estimate of the leakage factor c s becomes less reliable for increasing resistances c observation locations at larger distances e g x 200 m are better for estimating diffusivity while the leakage factor is only well estimated for a small range of values closer to the open water body e g at x 50 m the estimate of resistance is particularly better for very small resistances which is linked to the rapid damping of the wave signal for strong leakage 4 summary and conclusions we investigated analytical solutions for the propagation of complex waves in confined and leaky homogeneous aquifers close to open water bodies such as rivers lakes and coastal areas we derived explicit mathematical expressions for the hydraulic head in aquifers as function of time location from the open water body and the input wave signal solutions are implemented in an accompanying open source python package making use of fast fourier transformation the solutions are tested for three application examples a tidal wave a synthetic square wave and river fluctuations they are almost identical to solutions from numerical modflow models under identical settings we then tested the ability of analytical solutions to inversely estimate aquifer properties such as hydraulic diffusivity by comparing to numerical simulation results for a broad range of parameter values reliable estimates of diffusivity can be achieved when choosing appropriate observation locations for the particular aquifer situation the analytical solutions proved to be fast versatile and applicable for all types of boundary conditions provided they are continuous their implementation offers the opportunity to inversely estimate aquifer properties in a fast and efficient manner for confined aquifer diffusivity can be estimated at a level of less than 2 relative difference to numerical input data this particularly holds for piezometer observations at intermediate distances from the open water body where the wave signal is not yet damped to strongly but has travelled through the aquifer sufficiently long to experience aquifer specifics the longer the periodicity of the input wave signal the further is this distance in case of hydraulic barriers the confined aquifer solution can be used when the flow barrier shows conductivity differences to the aquifer of less than 2 orders of magnitude for barriers with higher resistance the analytical solution can be used when the input wave is a damped wave signal from a head observation behind the barriers but close to the open water body leakage significantly impacts the propagation of the input wave signal into the aquifer for conductivity differences of the leaking unconfined layer of less than four orders of magnitude in this case the analytical solution including the confining layer resistance provides a tool to gain reliable estimates of diffusivity and resistance however due to the damping the observation location of the head signal for inverse estimation has to be carefully chosen being closer to the open water body the stronger the leakage i e the lower the confined layer resistance although we consider the simplified configuration of a 1d horizontal homogeneous confined leaky aquifer results can be applied to typical field situations the scheme of deriving analytical solutions can easily be applied to more complex subsurface configurations providing the governing equations
