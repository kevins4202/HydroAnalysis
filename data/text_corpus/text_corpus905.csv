4525,accurate simulation of soil water dynamics is a key factor when using agricultural models for guiding management decisions however the determination of soil hydraulic properties especially unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is challenging and measured data are scarce we investigated the use of apsim agricultural production simulation model with swim3 as the water module based on richards equation and a bimodal pore system to determine likely ranges of the hydraulic conductivity at field capacity k 10 assumed at a matric potential of 10 kpa for soils representing different drainage characteristics hydraulic conductivity measurements of soils with contrasting soil drainage characteristics and values for k 10 were extracted from new zealand s national soil database the k 10 values were then varied in a sensitivity analysis from 0 02 to 5 mm d 1 for well drained soils from 0 02 to 1 mm d 1 for moderately well drained soils and from 0 008 to 0 25 mm d 1 for poorly drained soils the value of k 10 had a large effect on the time it took for the soil to drain from saturation to field capacity in contrast the saturated hydraulic conductivity value had little effect simulations were then run over 20 years using two climatic conditions either a general climate station for all seven different soils or site specific climate stations two values for k 10 were used either the apsim default value or the soil specific measured k 10 the monthly average soil saturation level simulated with the latter has a better correspondence with the morphology of the seven soils finally the effect of k 10 on drainage and pasture yield was investigated total annual drainage was only slightly affected by the choice of k 10 but pasture yield varied substantially keywords apsim swim3 soil drainage characteristics sensitivity analysis 1 introduction agricultural models are increasingly being used by scientists land managers and policy makers to evaluate the response of management practices on agricultural systems in an easy fast and low cost way tenreiro et al 2020 however the accuracy of such models can be limited by the uncertainty in representing the system and its functionality the complex interactions between crops soil and the environment and the ability to derive model parameter values vereecken et al 2016 accurate simulation of soil water dynamics in such models is a key factor for guiding management decisions as these govern many processes including water flow and nutrient transport for crop growth leaching of nutrients and contaminants into the groundwater gaseous emissions as well as groundwater recharge simulations of water dynamics are typically based on either simple tipping bucket models or richards equation addiscott and wagenet 1985 tenreiro et al 2020 while the state of the art soil plant atmosphere continuum models implement richards equation pinheiro et al 2019 the approach requires the description of soil hydraulic properties across the entire soil water content range from saturation to dryness experimental determination of soil hydraulic properties across the entire soil water content range is costly time consuming and involves considerable uncertainty ritter et al 2003 alternatives are the use of pedotransfer functions and inverse modelling pedotransfer functions are based on empirical relationships between soil hydraulic properties and more easily measured soil properties such as soil texture soil organic matter content and bulk density mcneill et al 2018 with inverse modelling techniques hydraulic properties are derived from easily measured time series e g water flux or soil water content vereecken et al 2016 graham et al 2018 the inverse method uses a soil water flow model to find the best parameter set that minimises the deviation between model estimates and measurements using appropriate optimisation algorithms ritter et al 2003 in contrast to mechanistic water flow models simple tipping bucket models only require soil water content values at certain points generally at saturation field capacity and permanent wilting point the concept of field capacity fc is very important in tipping bucket type models as this is generally the threshold point between macro and micro porosity or matrix with water flow generally only enabled for macropores the matric potential at which fc is defined varies greatly between 5 and 33 kpa throughout the world nachabe 1998 tóth et al 2015 although 10 kpa has been used as the standard for fc in countries such as australia sweden and new zealand grewal et al 1990 nemes et al 2011 the agricultural production systems simulator apsim www apsim info holzworth et al 2014 is one of the various process based models that are increasingly being used to assess changes in farm practice and their effects on economic and environmental outcomes vibart et al 2015 mcnunn et al 2019 cann et al 2020 as with any such model apsim requires parameters describing soil hydraulic properties besides various other input parameters depending on the soil water module and approach used within apsim simple tipping bucket models or richards equation different soil hydraulic property input parameters are required vogeler and cichota 2018 the basic water balance model named soilwat probert et al 1998 is a tipping bucket type model requiring only simple soil water parameters however apsim can be also coupled with swim2 verburg et al 1996 and its later upgrade swim3 huth et al 2012 which is based on numerical solutions to the richards equation for water flow and the convection dispersion equation for solute transport as such it requires description of the soil water retention θ ψ and hydraulic conductivity k θ functions following the base development by ross 1990 swim enables choosing the type of function that can be used to describe the hydraulic properties verburg et al 1996 in new zealand the smoothed version of the brooks and corey model is generally used for θ ψ e g cichota et al 2013a 2013b vogeler et al 2017 and k θ but with a modification to account for dual porosity ross and smettem 1993 cichota et al 2013a 2013b the recently upgraded swim3 huth et al 2012 still uses the richards equation but the soil hydraulic input parameters are limited to those used for the tipping bucket module volumetric water content at saturation field capacity and permanent wilting point as well as the hydraulic conductivity at saturation these are complemented with the matric potential and hydraulic conductivity at fc with default values set to 10 kpa and 0 1 mm day 1 these values are then used to derive the θ ψ and k θ functions internally huth et al 2012 due to its simplicity to set up swim3 is much more accessible to a wide range of apsim users while still being mechanistic in a previous modelling study we investigated the use of inverse modelling using apsim with swim to determine likely ranges of the hydraulic conductivity at saturation k sat and fc k 10 for a slowly permeable subsurface horizon vogeler et al 2019 the results highlighted the significant influence of k 10 in poorly drained soils on the simulated soil saturation level measurements of hydraulic conductivity are very labour intensive especially at low matric potentials where the flow is very slow poulsen et al 2002 thus measurements are generally limited to k sat and values across the entire soil water content range are inferred from the water retention function plus some parameters related to the pore system i e pore size distribution and pore connectivity some of the most widely used functions are the van genuchten model combined with the mualem condition van genuchten 1980 brooks and corey brooks and corey 1964 kosugi kosugi 1996 and clapp hornberger clapp and hornberger 1978 the objective of the study presented here is to assess the effect of k sat and k 10 in characterizing the soil water dynamics for a range of soils with different drainage characteristics an attempt is then made to assign k 10 ranges for different drainage classes and to see if these ranges are in line with those obtained by fitting the soil hydraulic conductivity curves and estimating k 10 based on the functions described above soils included two well drained soils oruanui and otorohonga two moderately well drained soils waikiwi and hamilton and three poorly drained soils otokia te houka and tokomaru two different sets of simulations were set up with these soils to investigate i the effect of k sat and k 10 on the time it takes for the various soil layers to drain from saturation to fc and ii the effect of using either the default k 10 or the soil specific measured k 10 on the temporal soil saturation level and the amount of drainage from the various soils as well as on pasture yield 2 methods 2 1 apsim model all simulations were conducted using the apsim model version 7 10 www apsim info holzworth et al 2014 the swim3 sub model huth et al 2012 was used for simulating water movement and solute transport through the soil swim3 is based on a two domain model for hydraulic conductivity comprising a macropore and a soil matrix domain with the separation between the two domains at fc the apsim model runs on a daily time step although swim uses a variable internal time step that can be shorter than 1 min the inputs required for soil hydraulic properties are the volumetric water contents at saturation θ s m3 m 3 field capacity θfc m3 m 3 which in apsim is termed drained upper limit dul and permanent wilting point pwp θpwp m3 m 3 referred to in apsim as lower limit ll15 taken at matric potential of 1500 kpa and the hydraulic conductivity at saturation k sat the soil macropore hydraulic conductivity is described by a simple power function the hydraulic conductivity at fc k 10 generally assumed to be at a matric potential of 10 kpa is by default set to 0 1 mm day these two values k 10 and the matric potential at fc can also be set up in the user interface but only as constants for the whole soil profile not depth or layer specific the soil matrix s hydraulic conductivity below fc is related to the water retention curve huth et al 2012 pasture growth is modelled with agpasture based on intercepted global solar radiation potential photosynthetic rate and growth modifiers for temperature plant n content as well as soil water and n supply the growth modifier for water increases linearly from 0 at θpwp to 1 at θfc 2 2 apsim model setup apsim simulations were set up with data from seven different soil profiles and either with a bare surface or with a ryegrass white clover pasture mixture using agpasture the maximum rooting depth for the pasture was set to 750 mm for the well drained and moderately well drained soils while for the poorly drained soils the rooting depth was reduced to 500 mm due to the very dense soil below this depth simulations run for the pastoral system had grazing events every three weeks daily weather data were accessed from the niwa virtual climate station network vcsn which are spatial interpolation on a 5 km2 grid of data observations made at climate stations located around the country tait et al 2006 long term averages for the climate stations and their respective soil type are provided in table 1 simulations were either set up with a single climate lumsden over all soil types or with site specific climates 2 3 soil descriptions the soils used for this study were chosen from previous research that measured hydraulic attributes in different soils and horizons as part of a new zealand wide soil characterisation initiative gradwell 1968 1974 measurements of ksat were done on three to six cores 10 cm diameter and 7 5 cm thickness for each horizon using constant head mariotte devices 1 cm head for a sub set of these soils the k 10 was also measured gradwell 1979 1986 this was done in a darcy like unsaturated experiment using soil cores pressed between two membranes drained to equilibrium with the tension applied through both membranes a small difference between the tensions at both sides of the sample was produced and the rate of water flow through the soil was measured and used to calculate the hydraulic conductivity from this dataset we have selected seven soils that have the full set of soil hydraulic attributes table 2 as well as having contrasting classifications for soil profile drainage characteristics drainage class is widely used to provide an indicative representation of the differences between soils in the rate at which they drain following rainfall and the resultant differences in the frequency and duration of ephemeral internal wetness in this study soils are classified to different drainage classes used in new zealand based on the degree of subsoil redox mottling observed in the soil morphology with a more detailed description in vogeler et al 2019 2 3 1 well drained soils the oruanui soil is a sandy textured soil formed into airfall pumice volcanic material new zealand nz classification podzolic orthic pumice soil usda soil taxonomy classification orthod hewitt 2010 the otorohanga loam is also formed into airfall volcanic material but with finer tephra material compared with the oruanui resulting in silty loam topsoil textures grading to silty clay in the subsoil both soils are characterized by well drained morphology having yellow brown colored subsoils with no redox mottles indicating that the frequency and duration of internal waterlogging is minimal and oxidation processes predominate 2 3 2 moderately well drained soils the waikiwi silt loam is a silt loam textured soil formed in wind deposited loess material nz classification typic firm brown soil taxonomy dystrudepts hewitt 2010 the hamilton soil has silt loam topsoils overlying clayey textured subsoils having formed into strongly weathered volcanic tephra it is classified in new zealand as a typic orthic granular soil and in in soil taxonomy as a haplohumult hewitt 2010 both soils can have some minor redox mottling evident in the subsoil indicating a degree of subsoil drainage impediment that may result in short term waterlogging during wet periods although oxidation processes predominate most of the time 2 3 3 poorly drained soils the otokia te houka and tokomaru are silt loam textured soils formed in wind deposited loess deposits nz classification fragic perch gley pallic soil soil taxonomy fragiaquepts hewitt 2010 these soils have a characteristic fragipan soil layer in the lower subsoil which due to its high density is slowly drained as a result soil drainage water perches on the fragipan causing seasonal saturation in the horizons above the soils are classified as showing poorly drained soil morphology dominated by grey subsoil colours and dense redox mottling indicating that reducing processes dominate for sustained periods in winter and spring in the new zealand soil classification poorly drained soils are estimated to have annual periods of 3 6 months when the soil is wetter than field capacity taylor and pohlen 1979 2 4 soil profile descriptions for apsim setup the soil characterisation for the simulations were based on descriptions and measured laboratory data held in the national soil database repository wilde 2003 the selected soils have measurements of k 10 for the mid to lower subsoil layers three and four in table 2 the profiles were slightly adjusted to standardise the layers of the various soils to the same thicknesses for all soils the profiles were set up with five layers and to a depth of 2500 mm key soil hydraulic and physical properties are provided in table 2 2 5 simulations for drainage duration to assess the effect of the hydraulic conductivity values on the time it takes the various soil profiles to drain from saturation to fc simulations were set up with a range of k 10 and k sat values the range was dependent on the drainage class of the soil and was centred around the measured values the ranges are provided in tables 3 and 4 in a first set of simulations k sat was varied and for k 10 either the default or the soil specific measured value was used for each of the soils in the second set of simulations k 10 values were varied with k sat values as measured the simulations were set up with bare soil and a soil profile initially at fc the soil was then wet to saturation by applying daily irrigation amounts above the specific k sat table 2 when saturation was reached irrigation terminated and the simulated time days for each soil to reach fc was recorded 2 6 long term simulations for soil saturation level simulations were set up for the seven different soil profiles with their site specific climate station data table 1 and under a ryegrass white clover pasture these simulations were done to investigate the long term 20 years wetness status and its effect on pasture growth and yield the pasture was managed as a cut and carry system with biomass removals every three weeks the average monthly soil saturation level calculated from daily simulated θ θ s over the simulated 20 years for each layer of the different soils was compared when using either the apsim default k 10 of 0 1 mm d 1 or the soil specific measured values additionally the relative effect of the different soil characteristics was investigated using the same simulations but set up with the same climatic conditions using the lumsden climate for all soils 2 7 estimation of k 10 based on soil hydraulic conductivity functions the 13 layers a m with k 10 values table 2 were fitted to commonly used θ ψ and k θ function models using their k sat and soil water retention data the following models were tested a van genuchten 1980 with mualem condition b brooks and corey 1964 c kosugi 1996 and d clapp hornberger 1978 the function equations and further details about the fitting procedure are provided in supplementary material s1 the goodness of fitting θ ψ was assessed based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse franz and hogue 2011 the optimised model parameters were then used to calculate k 10 finally these k 10 values were compared to the measured values and those identified in the sensitivity analysis as being appropriate regarding expected saturation levels and durations for different soil drainage classes 3 results 3 1 hydraulic conductivity function dependency on k sat and k 10 the effect of varying k 10 and k sat on the shape of the hydraulic conductivity function used in apsim is shown as an example for layer l4 of the waikiwi soil in fig 1 the value of k 10 affects the rate of water movement above and below fc thus having a large effect on the rate of drainage in contrast the value of k sat only affects the hydraulic conductivity close to saturation a condition that generally only occurs over a short period of time following heavy rainfall events 3 2 desaturation behaviour dependency on k sat and k 10 the results from the apsim simulations set up with different parameters for the soil hydraulic conductivity function showed that the value of k sat has little effect on the time it takes the soil to drain from saturation to fc table 3 varying k sat by nearly an order of magnitude did not substantially change the time to drain for any layers with maximum variation of about 10 this was observed regardless of the value chosen for k 10 the only small effect of ksat on the desaturation is due to the fact that the soil water content level is only at saturation over a very short time period after which the conductivity approaches that one of k 10 this is as an example illustrated by the temporal change in θ in two contrasting soils the poorly drained otokia and the well drained otorohanga fig 2 thus as shown in the results table 3 the effect of the k 10 value is quite large in the freely draining soils the soil specific k 10 results in a much faster desaturation compared with the default value whereas in the poorly drained soils the soil specific value shows slower drainage compared with the default value the sensitivity of k 10 was further investigated by keeping the soil specific k sat value and changing k 10 again the results clearly show the large effect that k 10 has on the drainage dynamics of these soils table 4 using the default value for k 10 of 0 1 mm d 1 always overestimates the duration of the period the soil would remain above fc for well drained soils and underestimates the period for poorly drained soils 3 3 effect of k 10 on long term soil saturation level 3 3 1 lumsden climate for all sites soil saturation levels θ θ s were as expected higher for the deeper layers and over winter especially in the soils with slowly permeable subsoils fig 3 comparing saturation levels between simulations done with the default k 10 and those with soil specific values indicates that using the default value reduces the variation between soils this suggests that the use of soil specific values would be more appropriate as they better capture the differences in drainage characteristics and soil morphology 3 3 2 site specific climate simulations run with site specific climate shows a similar difference in average saturation level across the various soil layers fig 4 when simulations were based on the default k 10 of 0 1 mm day 1 or the soil specific measurement for the free draining soils soil saturation levels were lower throughout the year when soil specific values were used in contrast in poorly drained soils soil saturation levels were also higher when soil specific values for k 10 were used compared with default values fig 4 for the moderately well drained soils waikiwi and hamilton there was little difference between the two different simulation runs this was likely because the higher k 10 measured in these soils compared to the default value was countered by the much higher rainfall in these sites 1121 and 1149 mm resulting in overall high soil saturation level 3 4 effect of k 10 on drainage and pasture yield the choice in the value of k 10 had little effect on the average annual drainage amount with differences ranging from 1 to 11 table 5 differences in annual drainage between default and site specific k 10 were also little affected by the annual rainfall with the highest differences of 33 mm and 20 mm occurring in the oruanui soil data not shown only the tokomaru soil had a much smaller drainage amount when using the soil specific value for k 10 of 0 008 mm d 1 compared with the default value this is due to a large increase in surface runoff which was caused by the low drainage and soil saturation runoff was negligible with the default k 10 value and increased to an average of 53 mm year 1 with the soil specific value the choice of k 10 also affected the average annual pasture yield with both reduced yield up to 13 and increased yield up to 8 effect on different soils 3 5 estimation of k 10 based on θ ψ and k sat data a comparison between the measured k 10 for the 13 layers a m with the corresponding estimated k 10 value from the k θ curves derived from the different hydraulic models shows large deviations table 6 this is despite the very good fit of the models to the corresponding to θ ψ with nse values almost or equal to unity regardless of the soil hydraulic model used none of the different soil hydraulic function models reliably separated the three drainage classes regarding k 10 4 discussion the modelling study here indicated that k 10 has little effect on the total annual drainage simulated by apsim when using richards equation and assuming a bimodal pore system this result can be explained by the fact that annual totals are more related to overall water balance than to the rate of water flow in individual events also the hydraulic conductivity declines very quickly between saturation and fc fig 1 and thus much of the water movement does not occur at high conductivity rates near saturation the choice of the k 10 value seems much more important for the overall desaturation behaviour and ephemeral saturation level of the various soils for well drained soils using the apsim default value for k 10 of 0 1 mm d 1 it would take the layer l3 300 500 mm depth 1 2 months before the layer would drain from saturation to fc such behaviour would not be expected for well drained soils taylor and pohlen 1979 barkle et al 2011 graham et al 2019 for the poorly drained soils which were under a drier climate it would take less than a month for a layer at the same depth to drain below fc which is not in line with the morphology of these soils with strong gleying and redox mottling features in layer l3 taylor and pohlen 1979 watt 1976 1977 for the moderately well drained soils there was little difference between the simulation using default or measured k 10 due to the high rainfall in these sites the simulated high soil saturation level does not reflect the observed morphology with only some minor redox mottling evident in the subsoil taylor and pohlen 1979 the reasons for this lack of mottling in these moderately well drained soils are not clear but might be linked to a higher drainage rate in these soils compared to the poorly drained soils table 3 increases in drainage rate can increase the o2 concentration and thus the redox potential in the soil sharma et al 1989 the relatively fast drainage could also mean that large macropores become quickly aerated so that reducing conditions do not prevail for a sufficient duration for redox dominated soil morphology to develop in contrast the poorly drained soils show a much slower rate of drainage table 3 with longer periods of sustained waterlogging conditions results from the modelling study also indicated that the hydraulic conductivity at fc assumed at 10 kpa matric potential needs to be adjusted for different soil types we suggest that for well drained soils k 10 ranges between 1 and 5 mm d 1 for moderately well drained soils between 0 1 and 0 5 mm d 1 and for poorly drained soils between 0 05 and 0 1 mm d 1 the use of a constant value of k 10 across the entire soil profile as currently implemented in apsim swim3 might not be appropriate for capturing soil drainage dynamics and its effect on crop growth and the fate of nitrogen another approach might be to develop a pedotransfer function to predict k 10 values from soil attributes such as soil texture soil structure or relationships with the water retention function gradwell 1979 mcneill et al 2018 pollacco et al 2020 however deriving estimates of k 10 from the water retention measurements and commonly used θ ψ and k θ function models did not produce good results the discrepancies between the measured and estimated k 10 occur due to the problem of equifinality of the optimised hydraulic parameters with parameter values being non unique and often also non physical pollacco 2008 to overcome this the number of degrees of freedom can be reduced by either combining θ ψ and k θ data in the optimisation scheme or by establishing a set of constraints for the estimated parameters methods to constrain the parameters of the hydraulic functions are currently being developed fernández gálvez et al submitted and will likely lead to more acceptable estimates of k 10 an alternative to adjusting the k 10 would be to keep the default value for k 10 but adjust the matric potential at which fc is defined in the model this would however also change the macroporosity so the effect of this would need to be investigated the matric potential at fc could be based on the commonly used approximations based on textural classes with a matric potential of 33 kpa for fc for fine textured soils and 10 kpa for coarse textured soils however previous research has indicated that fc matric potential can vary significantly in fine textured soils and that 10 kpa is a good rule of thumb approximation for the high silt content soils in new zealand gradwell 1986 grewal et al 1990 a more mechanistic approach for estimating fc might be the flux based definition as suggested by twarakavi et al 2009 using the hydrus 1d model and a large database with soil data from across the world they found that drainage fluxes become negligible at a conductivity of 0 1 mm day 1 and this would be a good approximation for fc this value is identical to the default k 10 value used in swim3 but now the matric potential or water content at which this value corresponds is variable twarakavi et al 2009 also developed an empirical equation from which the matric potential at fc could be estimated from the parameters of the van genuchten mualem model this approach of estimating k 10 from features of the θ ψ function is a similar approach to that proposed in early work to quantify unsaturated conductivity at the matric potential of 10 kpa for a range of new zealand soils gradwell 1979 1986 the effect of soil saturation level on gaseous n losses is well documented dobbie and smith 2001 van der weerden et al 2014 although simulations of this process were beyond the scope of this work we can speculate on the effect of k 10 on nitrous oxide n2o emissions based on the modelled soil saturation level patterns for example bateman and baggs 2005 found in an incubation study with a silt loam soil that nitrous oxide n2o production peaked between a soil saturation level of 60 80 and chamindu deepagoda et al 2020 found that emissions in three grazed pasture sites in new zealand peaked at a soil saturation level between 80 and 95 from this we can infer that models would over estimate denitrification and n2o emissions in the well drained soils if using the default k 10 value of 0 1 mm day 1 especially over the winter period in contrast emissions would be under estimated in poorly drained soils due to the lower soil saturation level values simulated with the default k 10 thresholds at which n2o productions peak have been shown to vary across soil types cardenas et al 2017 therefore direct comparison is limited here various models with different complexity have been developed to estimate how management and environmental factors such as soil type and climatic conditions affect n2o emissions and although these models use different limiting functions they all include the effect of soil water content on denitrification and n2o generation process heinen 2006 del grosso et al 2020 the choice of k 10 also affected the average annual pasture yield with both reduced yield up to 13 and increased yield up to 8 effect on different soils such differences can be important for farm feeding strategies and farm operating profits vibart et al 2015 especially when these differences occur at times of low feed supply with high demand by grazing animals potential impacts on the choice of k 10 on n leaching cannot be inferred from our study while the annual drainage amount was hardly affected by the choice of k 10 n leaching is driven by both the drainage amount and the timing especially the n concentration in the soil solution at times of high drainage thus further studies are needed to better clarify the effects of the choice in k 10 on n leaching losses however as shown for the tokomaru soil water and possible n runoff from soils with low permeability could be under predicted when using a default k 10 value which is substantially higher than the soil specific measured value 5 conclusions the results of this study highlight the importance of accurately describing the soil hydraulic behaviour in process based models here this is demonstrated particularly for the k θ function while the saturated hydraulic conductivity is generally acknowledged as important little attention has been paid to the conductivity at lower matric potentials including the one at fc k 10 our results indicate that the parameterisation of the near saturated component of the k θ function may be more important than the accuracy of saturated conductivity for modelling soil water dynamics in many soils our modelling using the apsim modelling framework with swim3 as the water module which assumes a bimodal pore system showed that the use of a default value for k 10 is not appropriate to describe the expected ephemeral soil saturation status and morphology redox mottling for the range of soils present in new zealand and likely in other places using a default k 10 value and a fixed soil matric potential can also have a considerable effect on pasture growth and n2o emissions we suggest that for well drained soils k 10 ranges from 1 to 5 mm d 1 for moderately well drained soils from 0 1 to 0 5 mm d 1 and for poorly drained soils from 0 05 to 0 1 mm d 1 however further measurements of hydraulic conductivities at k 10 and the dry end of the k θ are required across a range of different soils to support these an alternative to soil specific values for k 10 is to keep it constant but change the soil matric potential for fc further work is needed to test this alternative approach and potential pedotransfer functions credit authorship contribution statement iris vogeler conceptualization methodology formal analysis sam carrick

4525,accurate simulation of soil water dynamics is a key factor when using agricultural models for guiding management decisions however the determination of soil hydraulic properties especially unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is challenging and measured data are scarce we investigated the use of apsim agricultural production simulation model with swim3 as the water module based on richards equation and a bimodal pore system to determine likely ranges of the hydraulic conductivity at field capacity k 10 assumed at a matric potential of 10 kpa for soils representing different drainage characteristics hydraulic conductivity measurements of soils with contrasting soil drainage characteristics and values for k 10 were extracted from new zealand s national soil database the k 10 values were then varied in a sensitivity analysis from 0 02 to 5 mm d 1 for well drained soils from 0 02 to 1 mm d 1 for moderately well drained soils and from 0 008 to 0 25 mm d 1 for poorly drained soils the value of k 10 had a large effect on the time it took for the soil to drain from saturation to field capacity in contrast the saturated hydraulic conductivity value had little effect simulations were then run over 20 years using two climatic conditions either a general climate station for all seven different soils or site specific climate stations two values for k 10 were used either the apsim default value or the soil specific measured k 10 the monthly average soil saturation level simulated with the latter has a better correspondence with the morphology of the seven soils finally the effect of k 10 on drainage and pasture yield was investigated total annual drainage was only slightly affected by the choice of k 10 but pasture yield varied substantially keywords apsim swim3 soil drainage characteristics sensitivity analysis 1 introduction agricultural models are increasingly being used by scientists land managers and policy makers to evaluate the response of management practices on agricultural systems in an easy fast and low cost way tenreiro et al 2020 however the accuracy of such models can be limited by the uncertainty in representing the system and its functionality the complex interactions between crops soil and the environment and the ability to derive model parameter values vereecken et al 2016 accurate simulation of soil water dynamics in such models is a key factor for guiding management decisions as these govern many processes including water flow and nutrient transport for crop growth leaching of nutrients and contaminants into the groundwater gaseous emissions as well as groundwater recharge simulations of water dynamics are typically based on either simple tipping bucket models or richards equation addiscott and wagenet 1985 tenreiro et al 2020 while the state of the art soil plant atmosphere continuum models implement richards equation pinheiro et al 2019 the approach requires the description of soil hydraulic properties across the entire soil water content range from saturation to dryness experimental determination of soil hydraulic properties across the entire soil water content range is costly time consuming and involves considerable uncertainty ritter et al 2003 alternatives are the use of pedotransfer functions and inverse modelling pedotransfer functions are based on empirical relationships between soil hydraulic properties and more easily measured soil properties such as soil texture soil organic matter content and bulk density mcneill et al 2018 with inverse modelling techniques hydraulic properties are derived from easily measured time series e g water flux or soil water content vereecken et al 2016 graham et al 2018 the inverse method uses a soil water flow model to find the best parameter set that minimises the deviation between model estimates and measurements using appropriate optimisation algorithms ritter et al 2003 in contrast to mechanistic water flow models simple tipping bucket models only require soil water content values at certain points generally at saturation field capacity and permanent wilting point the concept of field capacity fc is very important in tipping bucket type models as this is generally the threshold point between macro and micro porosity or matrix with water flow generally only enabled for macropores the matric potential at which fc is defined varies greatly between 5 and 33 kpa throughout the world nachabe 1998 tóth et al 2015 although 10 kpa has been used as the standard for fc in countries such as australia sweden and new zealand grewal et al 1990 nemes et al 2011 the agricultural production systems simulator apsim www apsim info holzworth et al 2014 is one of the various process based models that are increasingly being used to assess changes in farm practice and their effects on economic and environmental outcomes vibart et al 2015 mcnunn et al 2019 cann et al 2020 as with any such model apsim requires parameters describing soil hydraulic properties besides various other input parameters depending on the soil water module and approach used within apsim simple tipping bucket models or richards equation different soil hydraulic property input parameters are required vogeler and cichota 2018 the basic water balance model named soilwat probert et al 1998 is a tipping bucket type model requiring only simple soil water parameters however apsim can be also coupled with swim2 verburg et al 1996 and its later upgrade swim3 huth et al 2012 which is based on numerical solutions to the richards equation for water flow and the convection dispersion equation for solute transport as such it requires description of the soil water retention θ ψ and hydraulic conductivity k θ functions following the base development by ross 1990 swim enables choosing the type of function that can be used to describe the hydraulic properties verburg et al 1996 in new zealand the smoothed version of the brooks and corey model is generally used for θ ψ e g cichota et al 2013a 2013b vogeler et al 2017 and k θ but with a modification to account for dual porosity ross and smettem 1993 cichota et al 2013a 2013b the recently upgraded swim3 huth et al 2012 still uses the richards equation but the soil hydraulic input parameters are limited to those used for the tipping bucket module volumetric water content at saturation field capacity and permanent wilting point as well as the hydraulic conductivity at saturation these are complemented with the matric potential and hydraulic conductivity at fc with default values set to 10 kpa and 0 1 mm day 1 these values are then used to derive the θ ψ and k θ functions internally huth et al 2012 due to its simplicity to set up swim3 is much more accessible to a wide range of apsim users while still being mechanistic in a previous modelling study we investigated the use of inverse modelling using apsim with swim to determine likely ranges of the hydraulic conductivity at saturation k sat and fc k 10 for a slowly permeable subsurface horizon vogeler et al 2019 the results highlighted the significant influence of k 10 in poorly drained soils on the simulated soil saturation level measurements of hydraulic conductivity are very labour intensive especially at low matric potentials where the flow is very slow poulsen et al 2002 thus measurements are generally limited to k sat and values across the entire soil water content range are inferred from the water retention function plus some parameters related to the pore system i e pore size distribution and pore connectivity some of the most widely used functions are the van genuchten model combined with the mualem condition van genuchten 1980 brooks and corey brooks and corey 1964 kosugi kosugi 1996 and clapp hornberger clapp and hornberger 1978 the objective of the study presented here is to assess the effect of k sat and k 10 in characterizing the soil water dynamics for a range of soils with different drainage characteristics an attempt is then made to assign k 10 ranges for different drainage classes and to see if these ranges are in line with those obtained by fitting the soil hydraulic conductivity curves and estimating k 10 based on the functions described above soils included two well drained soils oruanui and otorohonga two moderately well drained soils waikiwi and hamilton and three poorly drained soils otokia te houka and tokomaru two different sets of simulations were set up with these soils to investigate i the effect of k sat and k 10 on the time it takes for the various soil layers to drain from saturation to fc and ii the effect of using either the default k 10 or the soil specific measured k 10 on the temporal soil saturation level and the amount of drainage from the various soils as well as on pasture yield 2 methods 2 1 apsim model all simulations were conducted using the apsim model version 7 10 www apsim info holzworth et al 2014 the swim3 sub model huth et al 2012 was used for simulating water movement and solute transport through the soil swim3 is based on a two domain model for hydraulic conductivity comprising a macropore and a soil matrix domain with the separation between the two domains at fc the apsim model runs on a daily time step although swim uses a variable internal time step that can be shorter than 1 min the inputs required for soil hydraulic properties are the volumetric water contents at saturation θ s m3 m 3 field capacity θfc m3 m 3 which in apsim is termed drained upper limit dul and permanent wilting point pwp θpwp m3 m 3 referred to in apsim as lower limit ll15 taken at matric potential of 1500 kpa and the hydraulic conductivity at saturation k sat the soil macropore hydraulic conductivity is described by a simple power function the hydraulic conductivity at fc k 10 generally assumed to be at a matric potential of 10 kpa is by default set to 0 1 mm day these two values k 10 and the matric potential at fc can also be set up in the user interface but only as constants for the whole soil profile not depth or layer specific the soil matrix s hydraulic conductivity below fc is related to the water retention curve huth et al 2012 pasture growth is modelled with agpasture based on intercepted global solar radiation potential photosynthetic rate and growth modifiers for temperature plant n content as well as soil water and n supply the growth modifier for water increases linearly from 0 at θpwp to 1 at θfc 2 2 apsim model setup apsim simulations were set up with data from seven different soil profiles and either with a bare surface or with a ryegrass white clover pasture mixture using agpasture the maximum rooting depth for the pasture was set to 750 mm for the well drained and moderately well drained soils while for the poorly drained soils the rooting depth was reduced to 500 mm due to the very dense soil below this depth simulations run for the pastoral system had grazing events every three weeks daily weather data were accessed from the niwa virtual climate station network vcsn which are spatial interpolation on a 5 km2 grid of data observations made at climate stations located around the country tait et al 2006 long term averages for the climate stations and their respective soil type are provided in table 1 simulations were either set up with a single climate lumsden over all soil types or with site specific climates 2 3 soil descriptions the soils used for this study were chosen from previous research that measured hydraulic attributes in different soils and horizons as part of a new zealand wide soil characterisation initiative gradwell 1968 1974 measurements of ksat were done on three to six cores 10 cm diameter and 7 5 cm thickness for each horizon using constant head mariotte devices 1 cm head for a sub set of these soils the k 10 was also measured gradwell 1979 1986 this was done in a darcy like unsaturated experiment using soil cores pressed between two membranes drained to equilibrium with the tension applied through both membranes a small difference between the tensions at both sides of the sample was produced and the rate of water flow through the soil was measured and used to calculate the hydraulic conductivity from this dataset we have selected seven soils that have the full set of soil hydraulic attributes table 2 as well as having contrasting classifications for soil profile drainage characteristics drainage class is widely used to provide an indicative representation of the differences between soils in the rate at which they drain following rainfall and the resultant differences in the frequency and duration of ephemeral internal wetness in this study soils are classified to different drainage classes used in new zealand based on the degree of subsoil redox mottling observed in the soil morphology with a more detailed description in vogeler et al 2019 2 3 1 well drained soils the oruanui soil is a sandy textured soil formed into airfall pumice volcanic material new zealand nz classification podzolic orthic pumice soil usda soil taxonomy classification orthod hewitt 2010 the otorohanga loam is also formed into airfall volcanic material but with finer tephra material compared with the oruanui resulting in silty loam topsoil textures grading to silty clay in the subsoil both soils are characterized by well drained morphology having yellow brown colored subsoils with no redox mottles indicating that the frequency and duration of internal waterlogging is minimal and oxidation processes predominate 2 3 2 moderately well drained soils the waikiwi silt loam is a silt loam textured soil formed in wind deposited loess material nz classification typic firm brown soil taxonomy dystrudepts hewitt 2010 the hamilton soil has silt loam topsoils overlying clayey textured subsoils having formed into strongly weathered volcanic tephra it is classified in new zealand as a typic orthic granular soil and in in soil taxonomy as a haplohumult hewitt 2010 both soils can have some minor redox mottling evident in the subsoil indicating a degree of subsoil drainage impediment that may result in short term waterlogging during wet periods although oxidation processes predominate most of the time 2 3 3 poorly drained soils the otokia te houka and tokomaru are silt loam textured soils formed in wind deposited loess deposits nz classification fragic perch gley pallic soil soil taxonomy fragiaquepts hewitt 2010 these soils have a characteristic fragipan soil layer in the lower subsoil which due to its high density is slowly drained as a result soil drainage water perches on the fragipan causing seasonal saturation in the horizons above the soils are classified as showing poorly drained soil morphology dominated by grey subsoil colours and dense redox mottling indicating that reducing processes dominate for sustained periods in winter and spring in the new zealand soil classification poorly drained soils are estimated to have annual periods of 3 6 months when the soil is wetter than field capacity taylor and pohlen 1979 2 4 soil profile descriptions for apsim setup the soil characterisation for the simulations were based on descriptions and measured laboratory data held in the national soil database repository wilde 2003 the selected soils have measurements of k 10 for the mid to lower subsoil layers three and four in table 2 the profiles were slightly adjusted to standardise the layers of the various soils to the same thicknesses for all soils the profiles were set up with five layers and to a depth of 2500 mm key soil hydraulic and physical properties are provided in table 2 2 5 simulations for drainage duration to assess the effect of the hydraulic conductivity values on the time it takes the various soil profiles to drain from saturation to fc simulations were set up with a range of k 10 and k sat values the range was dependent on the drainage class of the soil and was centred around the measured values the ranges are provided in tables 3 and 4 in a first set of simulations k sat was varied and for k 10 either the default or the soil specific measured value was used for each of the soils in the second set of simulations k 10 values were varied with k sat values as measured the simulations were set up with bare soil and a soil profile initially at fc the soil was then wet to saturation by applying daily irrigation amounts above the specific k sat table 2 when saturation was reached irrigation terminated and the simulated time days for each soil to reach fc was recorded 2 6 long term simulations for soil saturation level simulations were set up for the seven different soil profiles with their site specific climate station data table 1 and under a ryegrass white clover pasture these simulations were done to investigate the long term 20 years wetness status and its effect on pasture growth and yield the pasture was managed as a cut and carry system with biomass removals every three weeks the average monthly soil saturation level calculated from daily simulated θ θ s over the simulated 20 years for each layer of the different soils was compared when using either the apsim default k 10 of 0 1 mm d 1 or the soil specific measured values additionally the relative effect of the different soil characteristics was investigated using the same simulations but set up with the same climatic conditions using the lumsden climate for all soils 2 7 estimation of k 10 based on soil hydraulic conductivity functions the 13 layers a m with k 10 values table 2 were fitted to commonly used θ ψ and k θ function models using their k sat and soil water retention data the following models were tested a van genuchten 1980 with mualem condition b brooks and corey 1964 c kosugi 1996 and d clapp hornberger 1978 the function equations and further details about the fitting procedure are provided in supplementary material s1 the goodness of fitting θ ψ was assessed based on the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse franz and hogue 2011 the optimised model parameters were then used to calculate k 10 finally these k 10 values were compared to the measured values and those identified in the sensitivity analysis as being appropriate regarding expected saturation levels and durations for different soil drainage classes 3 results 3 1 hydraulic conductivity function dependency on k sat and k 10 the effect of varying k 10 and k sat on the shape of the hydraulic conductivity function used in apsim is shown as an example for layer l4 of the waikiwi soil in fig 1 the value of k 10 affects the rate of water movement above and below fc thus having a large effect on the rate of drainage in contrast the value of k sat only affects the hydraulic conductivity close to saturation a condition that generally only occurs over a short period of time following heavy rainfall events 3 2 desaturation behaviour dependency on k sat and k 10 the results from the apsim simulations set up with different parameters for the soil hydraulic conductivity function showed that the value of k sat has little effect on the time it takes the soil to drain from saturation to fc table 3 varying k sat by nearly an order of magnitude did not substantially change the time to drain for any layers with maximum variation of about 10 this was observed regardless of the value chosen for k 10 the only small effect of ksat on the desaturation is due to the fact that the soil water content level is only at saturation over a very short time period after which the conductivity approaches that one of k 10 this is as an example illustrated by the temporal change in θ in two contrasting soils the poorly drained otokia and the well drained otorohanga fig 2 thus as shown in the results table 3 the effect of the k 10 value is quite large in the freely draining soils the soil specific k 10 results in a much faster desaturation compared with the default value whereas in the poorly drained soils the soil specific value shows slower drainage compared with the default value the sensitivity of k 10 was further investigated by keeping the soil specific k sat value and changing k 10 again the results clearly show the large effect that k 10 has on the drainage dynamics of these soils table 4 using the default value for k 10 of 0 1 mm d 1 always overestimates the duration of the period the soil would remain above fc for well drained soils and underestimates the period for poorly drained soils 3 3 effect of k 10 on long term soil saturation level 3 3 1 lumsden climate for all sites soil saturation levels θ θ s were as expected higher for the deeper layers and over winter especially in the soils with slowly permeable subsoils fig 3 comparing saturation levels between simulations done with the default k 10 and those with soil specific values indicates that using the default value reduces the variation between soils this suggests that the use of soil specific values would be more appropriate as they better capture the differences in drainage characteristics and soil morphology 3 3 2 site specific climate simulations run with site specific climate shows a similar difference in average saturation level across the various soil layers fig 4 when simulations were based on the default k 10 of 0 1 mm day 1 or the soil specific measurement for the free draining soils soil saturation levels were lower throughout the year when soil specific values were used in contrast in poorly drained soils soil saturation levels were also higher when soil specific values for k 10 were used compared with default values fig 4 for the moderately well drained soils waikiwi and hamilton there was little difference between the two different simulation runs this was likely because the higher k 10 measured in these soils compared to the default value was countered by the much higher rainfall in these sites 1121 and 1149 mm resulting in overall high soil saturation level 3 4 effect of k 10 on drainage and pasture yield the choice in the value of k 10 had little effect on the average annual drainage amount with differences ranging from 1 to 11 table 5 differences in annual drainage between default and site specific k 10 were also little affected by the annual rainfall with the highest differences of 33 mm and 20 mm occurring in the oruanui soil data not shown only the tokomaru soil had a much smaller drainage amount when using the soil specific value for k 10 of 0 008 mm d 1 compared with the default value this is due to a large increase in surface runoff which was caused by the low drainage and soil saturation runoff was negligible with the default k 10 value and increased to an average of 53 mm year 1 with the soil specific value the choice of k 10 also affected the average annual pasture yield with both reduced yield up to 13 and increased yield up to 8 effect on different soils 3 5 estimation of k 10 based on θ ψ and k sat data a comparison between the measured k 10 for the 13 layers a m with the corresponding estimated k 10 value from the k θ curves derived from the different hydraulic models shows large deviations table 6 this is despite the very good fit of the models to the corresponding to θ ψ with nse values almost or equal to unity regardless of the soil hydraulic model used none of the different soil hydraulic function models reliably separated the three drainage classes regarding k 10 4 discussion the modelling study here indicated that k 10 has little effect on the total annual drainage simulated by apsim when using richards equation and assuming a bimodal pore system this result can be explained by the fact that annual totals are more related to overall water balance than to the rate of water flow in individual events also the hydraulic conductivity declines very quickly between saturation and fc fig 1 and thus much of the water movement does not occur at high conductivity rates near saturation the choice of the k 10 value seems much more important for the overall desaturation behaviour and ephemeral saturation level of the various soils for well drained soils using the apsim default value for k 10 of 0 1 mm d 1 it would take the layer l3 300 500 mm depth 1 2 months before the layer would drain from saturation to fc such behaviour would not be expected for well drained soils taylor and pohlen 1979 barkle et al 2011 graham et al 2019 for the poorly drained soils which were under a drier climate it would take less than a month for a layer at the same depth to drain below fc which is not in line with the morphology of these soils with strong gleying and redox mottling features in layer l3 taylor and pohlen 1979 watt 1976 1977 for the moderately well drained soils there was little difference between the simulation using default or measured k 10 due to the high rainfall in these sites the simulated high soil saturation level does not reflect the observed morphology with only some minor redox mottling evident in the subsoil taylor and pohlen 1979 the reasons for this lack of mottling in these moderately well drained soils are not clear but might be linked to a higher drainage rate in these soils compared to the poorly drained soils table 3 increases in drainage rate can increase the o2 concentration and thus the redox potential in the soil sharma et al 1989 the relatively fast drainage could also mean that large macropores become quickly aerated so that reducing conditions do not prevail for a sufficient duration for redox dominated soil morphology to develop in contrast the poorly drained soils show a much slower rate of drainage table 3 with longer periods of sustained waterlogging conditions results from the modelling study also indicated that the hydraulic conductivity at fc assumed at 10 kpa matric potential needs to be adjusted for different soil types we suggest that for well drained soils k 10 ranges between 1 and 5 mm d 1 for moderately well drained soils between 0 1 and 0 5 mm d 1 and for poorly drained soils between 0 05 and 0 1 mm d 1 the use of a constant value of k 10 across the entire soil profile as currently implemented in apsim swim3 might not be appropriate for capturing soil drainage dynamics and its effect on crop growth and the fate of nitrogen another approach might be to develop a pedotransfer function to predict k 10 values from soil attributes such as soil texture soil structure or relationships with the water retention function gradwell 1979 mcneill et al 2018 pollacco et al 2020 however deriving estimates of k 10 from the water retention measurements and commonly used θ ψ and k θ function models did not produce good results the discrepancies between the measured and estimated k 10 occur due to the problem of equifinality of the optimised hydraulic parameters with parameter values being non unique and often also non physical pollacco 2008 to overcome this the number of degrees of freedom can be reduced by either combining θ ψ and k θ data in the optimisation scheme or by establishing a set of constraints for the estimated parameters methods to constrain the parameters of the hydraulic functions are currently being developed fernández gálvez et al submitted and will likely lead to more acceptable estimates of k 10 an alternative to adjusting the k 10 would be to keep the default value for k 10 but adjust the matric potential at which fc is defined in the model this would however also change the macroporosity so the effect of this would need to be investigated the matric potential at fc could be based on the commonly used approximations based on textural classes with a matric potential of 33 kpa for fc for fine textured soils and 10 kpa for coarse textured soils however previous research has indicated that fc matric potential can vary significantly in fine textured soils and that 10 kpa is a good rule of thumb approximation for the high silt content soils in new zealand gradwell 1986 grewal et al 1990 a more mechanistic approach for estimating fc might be the flux based definition as suggested by twarakavi et al 2009 using the hydrus 1d model and a large database with soil data from across the world they found that drainage fluxes become negligible at a conductivity of 0 1 mm day 1 and this would be a good approximation for fc this value is identical to the default k 10 value used in swim3 but now the matric potential or water content at which this value corresponds is variable twarakavi et al 2009 also developed an empirical equation from which the matric potential at fc could be estimated from the parameters of the van genuchten mualem model this approach of estimating k 10 from features of the θ ψ function is a similar approach to that proposed in early work to quantify unsaturated conductivity at the matric potential of 10 kpa for a range of new zealand soils gradwell 1979 1986 the effect of soil saturation level on gaseous n losses is well documented dobbie and smith 2001 van der weerden et al 2014 although simulations of this process were beyond the scope of this work we can speculate on the effect of k 10 on nitrous oxide n2o emissions based on the modelled soil saturation level patterns for example bateman and baggs 2005 found in an incubation study with a silt loam soil that nitrous oxide n2o production peaked between a soil saturation level of 60 80 and chamindu deepagoda et al 2020 found that emissions in three grazed pasture sites in new zealand peaked at a soil saturation level between 80 and 95 from this we can infer that models would over estimate denitrification and n2o emissions in the well drained soils if using the default k 10 value of 0 1 mm day 1 especially over the winter period in contrast emissions would be under estimated in poorly drained soils due to the lower soil saturation level values simulated with the default k 10 thresholds at which n2o productions peak have been shown to vary across soil types cardenas et al 2017 therefore direct comparison is limited here various models with different complexity have been developed to estimate how management and environmental factors such as soil type and climatic conditions affect n2o emissions and although these models use different limiting functions they all include the effect of soil water content on denitrification and n2o generation process heinen 2006 del grosso et al 2020 the choice of k 10 also affected the average annual pasture yield with both reduced yield up to 13 and increased yield up to 8 effect on different soils such differences can be important for farm feeding strategies and farm operating profits vibart et al 2015 especially when these differences occur at times of low feed supply with high demand by grazing animals potential impacts on the choice of k 10 on n leaching cannot be inferred from our study while the annual drainage amount was hardly affected by the choice of k 10 n leaching is driven by both the drainage amount and the timing especially the n concentration in the soil solution at times of high drainage thus further studies are needed to better clarify the effects of the choice in k 10 on n leaching losses however as shown for the tokomaru soil water and possible n runoff from soils with low permeability could be under predicted when using a default k 10 value which is substantially higher than the soil specific measured value 5 conclusions the results of this study highlight the importance of accurately describing the soil hydraulic behaviour in process based models here this is demonstrated particularly for the k θ function while the saturated hydraulic conductivity is generally acknowledged as important little attention has been paid to the conductivity at lower matric potentials including the one at fc k 10 our results indicate that the parameterisation of the near saturated component of the k θ function may be more important than the accuracy of saturated conductivity for modelling soil water dynamics in many soils our modelling using the apsim modelling framework with swim3 as the water module which assumes a bimodal pore system showed that the use of a default value for k 10 is not appropriate to describe the expected ephemeral soil saturation status and morphology redox mottling for the range of soils present in new zealand and likely in other places using a default k 10 value and a fixed soil matric potential can also have a considerable effect on pasture growth and n2o emissions we suggest that for well drained soils k 10 ranges from 1 to 5 mm d 1 for moderately well drained soils from 0 1 to 0 5 mm d 1 and for poorly drained soils from 0 05 to 0 1 mm d 1 however further measurements of hydraulic conductivities at k 10 and the dry end of the k θ are required across a range of different soils to support these an alternative to soil specific values for k 10 is to keep it constant but change the soil matric potential for fc further

4526,the present study deals with the optimal extraction of groundwater resources this approach has been developed for optimal integrated operation in an aquifer in iran the results of simulation optimization models have been used to develop a predictive model based on machine learning in the first stage adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis was used to predict the optimal groundwater exploitation oge amount in each month having the amounts of several inputs including the drop and amount of surface water at the end of the previous month and two months earlier and the water demand of the current month the results showed that the model s performance in predicting the test data was undesirable therefore to improve the prediction results in the second stage several evolutionary optimization algorithms i e particle swarm optimization pso gray wolf optimization gwo and harris hawk optimization hho were used to train anfis model the results indicated the appropriate performance of hho in anfis training which significantly improved the prediction accuracy of this model the best scenario for the anfis hho model included all the input parameters which resulted in rmse 1 45 mae 1 15 and r 2 0 99 respectively for the test data in addition the taylor diagram rmsd 1 40 std 15 5 and cc 0 99 showed anfis hho accuracy in estimating the oge value anfis hho was also able to improve the accuracy of anfis by rmse 4 and mae 2 mcm in general anfis pos anfis gwo and anfis hho had good predictive accuracy compared to anfis the results assure the authors to suggest the developed

where there is a combined exploitation of aquifers and rivers aquifers are considered a suitable option for water exploitation when the river water is limited however improper and excessive aquifer water exploitation in the last two decades has resulted in a sharp drop in water levels and reduced water quality of aquifers in most parts of iran to prevent this catastrophe the proper management of exploitation and protection of groundwater is necessary chang et al 2017 panahi et al 2020 since surface water and groundwater resources interact in the hydrological cycle and the reduction of one of them adversely affects the other these two water sources should be managed together todd and mays 2004 therefore in the last few decades various models have been developed in the combined exploitation of water resources the first study on the combined exploitation of surface water and groundwater resources was carried out by buras 1963 several factors have caused the combined exploitation of surface water and groundwater resources in the last few decades some of these factors are population growth and consequently the growth of the area under agriculture developments in the industry drought periods and climate change for this purpose experts have always proposed the optimal combined exploitation approach buras 1963 ejaz and peralta 1995 peralta 2001 vedula et al 2005 karamouz et al 2007 montazar et al 2010 chen et al 2013 rafipour langeroudi et al 2014 safavi and enteshari 2016 chen et al 2018 milan et al 2018 yousefi et al 2018 areas located in arid and semi arid regions suffer more from the lack of sufficient water resources than other parts of the world researchers use the combined exploitation of surface water and groundwater to meet the maximum water needs a review of studies conducted from 2000 to 2019 shows that most research in this area is performed in central asia and parts of the united states mainly most of the research is performed in iran fig 1 this country due to the decrease in rainfall the precipitation imbalance in different areas and the lack of a proper management system always suffers from the water supply therefore many researchers have always emphasized optimal combined exploitation in iran karamouz et al 2007 studies on the plains of iran show that consumers still suffer from the lack of management and shortage of water resources which shows the lack of cooperation between managers and researchers countries such as china and india due to the large population agricultural development and trade in recent years have always proposed the optimal combined exploitation approach to compensate for the shortage of water needs the objectives of optimal combined exploitation can include aquifer balancing preventing reservoir deficits and reducing groundwater level gwl drop in the form of multi objective problems safavi and alijanian 2011 rezaei et al 2017a 2017b roy et al 2016 luo et al 2020 singh 2014a 2014b an example of such problems is to meet the maximum needs and to increase groundwater quality along with preventing reservoir deficits and reducing losses or other goals such as the use of purified wastewater yousefi et al 2018 in flood prone areas this can be used to control groundwater elevation and the optimized usage of water resources potential to minimize water shortage milan et al 2018 the combined optimization model specifies the amount of water allocated to surface water and groundwater considering the constraints on both water resources however to determine this amount of allocation especially for groundwater resources it is necessary to simulate groundwater extract a regression model and finally determine the allocation amount by an optimization model safavi and enteshari 2016 parsapour moghaddam et al 2015 if this approach is used for other areas it requires a large amount of information including aquifer physical properties and all of the above steps should be repeated despite the proper results this is very time consuming and costly therefore developing a model for replacing the simulation and optimization models that do not require repeating the same steps for similar problems is valuable machine learning models are suitable models to replace these optimization and simulation models in this situation the optimization model is used to extract multiple outputs for groundwater allocation which can then be trained by machine learning approaches for prediction since machine learning models train the optimal values the results of them are also appropriate and close to optimal results several studies have been conducted on intelligent models for optimal combined exploitation which is an augmented technique of simulation optimization in this approach the results of an optimization model are trained by an intelligent model and the trained model can be used instead of the simulation optimization models milan et al 2018 the advantage of this approach is its applicability in various time periods and climatic conditions and being timely and simple compared to simulation optimization models rafipour langeroudi et al 2014 used the bayesian network to formulate real time combined use of surface and groundwater resources their research objectives included reducing the pumping costs improving the groundwater quality water supply with acceptable quality and controlling the groundwater table fluctuations the optimization model results were used to train the bayesian network and develop operation rules in long term planning anfis is one of the machine learning models widely used in time series predictions talei et al 2010 tabari et al 2012 to be able to improve the performance of the model especially on test data evolutionary algorithms such as particle swarm optimization pso genetic algorithm ga teaching learning based optimization tlb biogeography based optimization bbo firefly algorithm ffa ant colony optimization aco as well as recently developed algorithms such as gray wolf optimization gwo have been used to improve the prediction performance roy et al 2020 yaseen et al 2017 dehghani et al 2019 azad et al 2019 adnan et al 2019 chen et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 tikhamarine et al 2020 chen et al 2019 used evolutionary algorithms bbo and tlbo to train the structure of anfis to predict groundwater potential the desired parameter was estimated with high accuracy by using hybrid algorithms in this study they expressed that the anfis tlbo and anfis bbo models can be used in groundwater management in another study yaseen et al 2017 used the ffa optimization algorithm for the anfis model to predict river flow the results of this study showed that the ffa algorithm trains anfis well and increases its accuracy in prediction it was also found that the anfis ffa model performs modeling with fewer input variables and higher performance accuracy dehghani et al 2019 used anfis and gray wolf optimization algorithm gwo to predict the immediate long term and short term effective flow error evaluation criteria evaluated the performance of anfis gwo model better than anfis the results of this study show that the gray wolf algorithm with better training anfis increases its accuracy for estimating the parameter proposed by heidari et al 2019 the harris hawks optimization hho is one of the most recently algorithms available for optimization problems in this research hho is used to improve the training capability of anfis to be able to predict the optimal exploitation amount the present study aimed to select the best model among anfis anfis pso anfis gwo and anfis hho to predict the desired amount of groundwater exploitation in astaneh kouchesfahan aquifer this approach is implemented with numerical modeling of the groundwater simulator and the optimal combined model several scenarios based on variables affecting the amount of output i e oge are considered and finally the appropriate model and scenario for oge are introduced the use of the hybrid models especially anfis hho obtained from the proposed algorithms in the present research has been rarely used in the field of hydrology each proposed algorithm has its own characteristics highly capable of improving the performance of anfis training so performance evaluation of several hybrid models of anfis and proposing the superior hybrid model with a selected input scenario are the innovations of this research on the other hand this research improves the results of optimal prediction of groundwater withdrawal provided by milan et al 2018 the rest of the article is structured as follows in section 2 the study area and data used are described section 3 provides the flowchart of research and methodology which is divided into three sections section 3 1 describes the basic concepts of anfis the development of the hybrid anfis models is brought in section 3 2 this section also contains the basic concepts of the proposed algorithms which can be seen in sections 3 2 1 to 3 2 3 section 3 3 is dedicated to error evaluation criteria in section 4 the research results are presented in two separate sub sections section 4 1 focuses on the results of each model under different input scenarios while the comparison of the results of the selected scenarios by each model is brought in section 4 2 finally the conclusion is presented in section 5 2 study area and used data this research is a continuation of the research done by milan et al 2018 in astaneh kouchesfahan aquifer located in gilan province iran due to the fact that the purpose of this study is to achieve a suitable model to predict the optimal abstraction of groundwater resources with the help of the anfis model so the results of integrated optimization and information prepared by milan et al 2018 were extracted and used after implementing the optimization model and analyzing its results the oge was predicted using machine learning models several variables i e gwl drop at the end of the previous month a gwl drop at the end of the two months earlier b water need at the current month e surface water at the beginning of the current month c and surface water at the beginning of the previous month d were considered as the input variables of the scenarios table 1 shows a summary of the statistical characteristics of the input and output variables since the variables a and b are of the same type their minimum and maximum values are equal their minimum value is 0 42 m the negative sign of which indicates a rise in the gwl their average value was a drop varying between 0 54 and 58 m the average amount of available water c d is about 148 mcm while its minimum and maximum amounts are zero and 147 8 mcm respectively the minimum amount is for months when surface water is not available or months when water demand is deficient and groundwater resources are exploited to meet water needs the amount of water need varies from 122 mcm to 301 mcm per month with a standard deviation of about 16 mcm at the beginning of agricultural irrigation april and may and the harvest time august water need reaches its minimum amount in contrast in the months when agriculture is at its peak june and july it reaches its maximum the amount of optimal exploitation target variable also varies from zero to 39 mcm zero values are for the months when the water need is fully met by surface water or in other words surface water is available in significant quantities such as june and july when the surface water cannot meet the amount of water need groundwater resources are used the maximum amount of which is determined by the optimization model and is about 39 mcm by the combination of various input variables nine scenarios were developed according to table 2 the performance of each scenario was evaluated separately by the machine learning approaches 3 methodology the purpose of this study is to develop a predictive model for optimal abstraction of groundwater resources from the results of the optimized integrated operation optimization model of milan et al 2018 and having information on the amount of available surface water monthly water requirement and groundwater level drop values at the end of each month different input scenarios from the combination of parameters were developed each of the scenarios was then implemented by anfis anfis pso anfis gwo and anfis hho machine learning models the performance of the models and scenarios was investigated using error evaluation criteria in the form of statistical and graphical relationships i e rmse mape nse taylor diagram and scatterplots finally the most appropriate predictive model with its appropriate scenario was proposed fig 2 the following models used in this study are described comprehensively 3 1 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis jang 1993 introduced the anfis model by combining ann and fis anfis does not have the limitations of ann and fis such as overfitting and sensitivity to the definition of membership functions to perform better in prediction problems the most common method for the training of anfis is the sugeno type fis which uses a robust learning algorithm to determine the parameters of the model asefpour vakilian and massah 2018 anfis architecture generally includes five layers in layer 1 the inputs and y are subjected to generalized gaussian membership function µ to produce a new output out1 i which can be expressed using eq 1 ou t 1 i μ a i x i 1 2 1 ou t 1 i μ b i 2 y i 3 4 where 2 μ x e x p i σ i 2 and ai and bi denote the membership values of the µ pi and σi are the set of hypothesis parameters in the second layer the output of each node is calculated using eq 3 3 out 2 i μ a i x μ b i 2 y then the output of the second layer is normalized in layer 3 using eq 4 4 out 3 i w i ω i i 1 2 ω i the output of layer 3 is then passed through the adaptive nodes of layer 4 as follows 5 out 4 i w i f i w i p i x q i y r i where p q and r denote the consequent parameters of the i th node finally the overall output of the model is calculated using eq 6 6 out 4 i i w i f i 3 2 development of the anfis using evolutionary algorithms anfis suffers from several drawbacks such as trapping in local minima and slow convergence of training especially for wide search spaces therefore there is a need to use hybrid methods that use optimization techniques to optimize the parameters of the anfis in this study along with the anfis model several evolutionary algorithms were used to improve the anfis model according to the literature each of these algorithms has its unique features that can significantly improve the traditional anfis model the relationships of hybrid anfis ea used in this study to predict the oge is depicted in fig 5 first scenarios with different variables were given to the model as input and then the type of the fuzzy function and the anfis structure is determined the anfis is improved with evolutionary algorithms to achieve better results in this structure the objective function is to minimize the error of the predicted values finally the amount of oge is predicted by the optimized model 3 2 1 particle swarm optimization pso pso is one of the well known nature inspired optimization methods first introduced by kennedy and eberhart 1995 the pso algorithm starts with creating a random population each component in nature is a different set of decision variables whose optimal values should be provided each component represents a vector in the problem solving space the algorithm includes a velocity vector in addition to the position vector which forces the population to change their positions in the search space the velocity consists of two vectors called p and pg p is the best position that a particle has ever reached and pg is the best position that another particle in its neighborhood has ever reached in this algorithm each particle provides a solution in each iteration in the search for a d dimensional space the position of the particle i is represented by a d dimensional vector called xi xi 1 xi 2 xi d the velocity of each particle is shown by a d dimensional velocity vector called vi vi 1 vi 2 vi d finally the population moves to the optimum point using eqs 7 and 8 7 v id n 1 x ω v id n c 1 r 1 n p id n x id n c 2 r id n p pg n x id n 8 x id n 1 x id n v id n 1 where ω is the shrinkage factor used for convergence rate determination r 1 and r 2 are random numbers between 0 and 1 with uniform distribution n is the number of iterations c 1 is the best solution obtained by a particle and c 2 is the best solution identified by the whole population 3 2 2 gray wolf optimization gwo introduced by mirjalili et al 2014 gwo is a nature inspired meta heuristic algorithm based on the hierarchical structure and social behavior of wolves during hunting this algorithm is population based and has a simple process to achieve the optimal solution in implementing this algorithm four types of gray wolves i e alpha beta delta and omega are used to simulate the leadership hierarchy searching for prey besieging the prey and attacking the prey are the three main steps of hunting alpha wolves are the leaders who can be male or female these wolves dominate the herd and manage things like rest or hunting beta wolves help the alpha group in the decision making process and are also prone to be chosen as an alpha wolf delta wolves include older wolves hunters and baby care wolves omega wolves are located at the lowest position in the hierarchy have the least rights over the rest of the wolves and are not involved in the decision making process optimization is performed using alpha beta and delta wolves an alpha wolf is assumed to be the main leader of the algorithm and two wolves beta and delta are involved in the leading while the rest of the wolves follow them the mathematical model of the position of prey and wolves is expressed by eqs 9 and 10 9 d c x p t x t 10 x t 1 x p t a d where a and c are the coefficient vectors xp is the location vector of the prey and x is the location vector of each wolf and t is the iteration number the two vectors a and c are calculated using eqs 11 and 12 11 a 2 a r 1 a 12 c 2 r 2 where the a components decrease linearly from 2 to 0 during successive iterations and r 1 and r 2 are random vectors in the range of 0 1 alpha beta and delta wolves estimate the prey position while the rest of the wolves randomly update their position around the prey when the prey is besieged by wolves and stops moving the attack led by the alpha wolf begins the suitability of all solutions is calculated and the top three solutions are selected as alpha beta and delta wolves until the end of the algorithm this iterative procedure continues and in each iteration the superior position of each wolf and then the positions of the other wolves are updated after the iterations the position of the alpha wolf is introduced as the optimal solution 3 2 3 harris hawks optimization hho like many other evolutionary algorithms hho is a nature inspired and population based algorithm which is based on rabbit hunting by harris hawks heidari et al 2019 it includes the following steps 3 2 3 1 exploration phase in the hho method the harris hawks are the candidate solutions they perch randomly on some locations and wait to detect prey based on two strategies their position is mathematically expressed as eq 13 13 x t 1 x rand t r 1 x rand t 2 r 2 x t q 0 5 x rabbit t x m t r 3 l b r 4 u b l b q 0 5 where x t 1 is the position vector of hawks in the next iteration of t xrabbit t is the position of rabbit x t is the current position vector of hawks r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 and q are random numbers between 0 and 1 which are updated in each iteration lb and ub are the upper and lower bounds of variables xrand t is a randomly selected hawk from the current population and xm is the average position of the current population of hawks the average position of hawks is obtained using eq 14 14 x m t 1 n i 1 n x i t where xi t indicates the location of each hawk in iteration t and n denotes the total number of hawks 3 2 3 2 the transition from exploration to exploitation the energy of prey decreases considerably during the escape the energy of prey is modeled using eq 15 15 e 2 e 0 1 t t where e indicates the escaping energy of the prey t is the maximum number of iterations and e 0 is the initial energy e 0 randomly changes inside the interval 1 1 at each iteration 3 2 3 3 exploitation phase the hawks intensify the besiege process to catch the exhausted prey effortlessly the e parameter is utilized to model this strategy and enable the hho to switch between soft and hard besiege processes in this regard when e 0 5 the soft besiege happens and when e 0 5 the hard besiege occurs 3 2 3 4 soft besiege if r 0 5 and e 0 5 the rabbit still has enough energy and tries to escape by some random misleading jumps but finally it cannot during these attempts the harris hawks encircle it softly to make the rabbit more exhausted and then perform the surprise pounce this behavior is modeled by eqs 16 and 17 16 x t 1 δ x t e j x rabbit t x t 17 δ x t x rabbit t x t where δx t is the difference between the position vector of the rabbit and the current location in iteration t r 5 is a random number between 0 and 1 and jrabbit represents the random jump strength of the rabbit throughout the escaping procedure 3 2 3 5 hard besiege if r 0 5 and e 0 5 the prey is exhausted and it has low escaping energy besides harris hawks hardly encircle the prey to perform the surprise pounce finally fig 3a in this situation the current positions are updated using eq 18 18 x t 1 x rabbit t e δ x t 3 2 3 6 soft besiege with progressive rapid dives to perform a soft besiege we supposed that the hawks could evaluate decide their next move based on the following rule 19 y x rabbit t e j x rabbit t x t we supposed that they would dive based on the levy flight lf based patterns using the following rule 20 z y s l f d where d is the dimension of the problem s is a random vector and lf is calculated using eq 21 21 lf x 0 01 u σ v 1 β σ γ 1 β s i n π β 2 γ 1 β 2 β 2 β 1 2 1 β where u and v are random values between 0 and 1 and β is a default constant set to 1 5 hence eq 22 shows the final strategy for updating the positions of hawks in the soft besiege phase 22 x t 1 y iff y f x t z iff z f x t where y and z are obtained using eqs 19 and 20 respectively 3 2 3 7 hard besiege with progressive rapid dives if r 0 5 and e 0 5 the rabbit does not enough energy to escape and a hard besiege is constructed before the surprise pounce to catch the prey fig 3b therefore the following rule is performed in hard besiege condition 23 x t 1 y iff y f x t z iff z f x t where y and z are obtained using eqs 24 and 25 24 y x rabbit t e j x rabbit t x m t 25 z y s l f d where x m t is obtained using eq 14 3 3 evaluation criteria ec the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used to evaluate the performance of scenarios and machine learning methods 26 r 2 1 i 1 n x p x o 2 i 1 n x o x o 2 27 rmse 1 n i 1 n x o x p 2 28 mae 1 n i 1 n x p x o 2 where xo is the observed value xp is the predicted value and n is the number of samples the lower rmse and mae and higher r 2 the better performance of the model is 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of the anfis model and hybrid anfis models the appropriate structure of the models and the optimal values for its parameters are brought in table 3 according to the table in anfis the gaussian membership function was selected as the most appropriate fuzzy membership function since the anfis uses the sugeno type method the linear function was selected as the best output function of the model the optimal structure and architecture of the anfis pso model are shown in table 3 the algorithm s initial population was considered 30 since the higher number of populations did not improve the model s performance furthermore after 2500 iterations no changes were observed in the objective function s value and therefore the maximum iteration was considered 3000 the optimal structure and architecture of the anfis gwo model are shown in table 3 according to the table the initial population and the maximum number of iterations were considered 25 and 3000 respectively the optimal structure and parameter values of the hho algorithm can be seen in table 3 achieving the appropriate values for each parameter requires implementing the model with a wide range of values which ends with determining the appropriate values of the parameter the population for hho was 30 while the maximum number of iterations was obtained to be 2000 the scenarios were first implemented by the anfis model and the results of the two sections of training and test were obtained by evaluation criteria table 4 according to the table there is a relatively large error in test data for example in scenario b which included two input variables of gwl drop at the end of the previous month and two months earlier rmse mae and r2 were 4 85 mcm 23 3 mcm and 0 95 respectively for training data however the values of these evaluation criteria were 98 8 977 and 0 23 respectively for the test data these differences are observed in other scenarios more or less indicating that the anfis network is trapped in local minima during the training in this situation the prediction error on training data is significantly lower than that on test data in pso anfis the performance of the scenarios a to d was poor the number of input variables in these scenarios is one or two therefore the prediction of oge requires more information and only having one or two from the five variables cannot predict the optimal exploitation values according to table 4 in scenarios with three or more variables the performance of the model has increased so that scenario g which included the input variables of gwl drop at the end of the previous month and two months earlier available surface water in the current month and water need at the current month had the highest performance in predicting the optimal exploitation for this scenario rmse mae and r2 on test data were 2 55 mcm 1 23 mcm and 0 98 respectively thus having the values of the drop the amount of surface water and water needs the amount of optimal exploitation can be estimated by the hybrid model all the scenarios from e to j had remarkable prediction performance for example in scenario f by having the values of three variables i e drop at the end of the previous month available surface water and the water need at the current month the amount of oge for test data was predicted with rmse mae and r2 of 2 11 mcm 2 74 mcm and 0 97 respectively the only difference between this pattern and the pattern g is the drop at the end of two months earlier which indicates that despite having a weak correlation between the input and output variables a strong combination might be created between the input variables by adding an input variable overall the results showed that pso significantly improved the performance of the anfis model this indicates that the anfis model improved by the pso algorithm is not trapped in local optimal points and reaches global optimal points during model training in gwo anfis having four input variables scenarios f g h and j exerted acceptable accuracy in predicting the gwl among these scenarios scenario g having the input variables of drop at the end of the previous month dropped at the end of two months earlier and surface water and water need in the current month resulted in the highest performance with rmse mae and r2 of 1 8 1 23 and 0 98 respectively for the test data what is clear is the inadequate accuracy of gwl estimation in scenarios containing one or two input variables similar results were observed for the anfis and anfis pso models which shows that models with two input variables or less cannot correctly understand the complex relationships between the inputs and optimal exploitation amounts the results also indicate that besides improving the accuracy of anfis prediction the accuracy of predicting the training and test data is also within an acceptable level by using the gwo algorithm in other words irrational predictions are not made in any step of the test data which shows that the anfis model improved by the gwo algorithm is not trapped in local optimal points and reaches global optimal points in hho anfis the results showed that scenario j with the participation of all input variables had the highest performance in the optimal prediction of oge table 4 for this scenario rmse mae and r2 were 1 45 m 1 15 m and 0 99 respectively for test data having the drop at the end of the previous month and two months earlier and surface water at the current month scenario e was the closest scenario to scenario j in terms of evaluation criteria rmse 1 58 mae 1 30 r2 0 99 thus oge can be predicted accurately using only these three variables similar to previous sections the participation of one or two variables as input could not predict the oge properly the method of selecting the input variables in a scenario is also crucial in oge predictions for example although scenario b contains the drop parameters at the end of the previous month and two months earlier and scenario c includes the drop at the end of the previous month and the amount of water need both scenarios had relatively similar performance in predicting oge however with the addition of the available surface water at the current month to both models the prediction accuracy changed significantly by adding this variable to scenario b scenario e was formed which had excellent accuracy however scenario f which was developed from scenario c did not exert a good prediction accuracy compared to scenario e of course these comparisons can also be made for other combinations of other input variables therefore it can be argued that the combination of variables to create a scenario is very effective in the accuracy of time series prediction nevertheless in general it is concluded that the hho algorithm is a robust optimization method to improve the structure of the anfis model 4 2 a comparison among the results of selected models the time series of the optimized values by the optimization model for the selected scenario and their predicted values are depicted in fig 4 the figure shows the changes in the predicted and optimized values in each time step the anfis model results show that in several steps such as 14 8 and 9 the prediction value was accompanied by a significant error although the prediction has been performed with acceptable accuracy in many steps these errors in some steps remarkably lower the performance of the model in other diagrams where evolutionary algorithms have been used to optimize the parameters of the anfis structure this weakness is not observed and the prediction is performed with an insignificant error in all steps accordingly the scatter plots fig 5 show the incorrect predictions in some steps using anfis which has reduced its r 2 to 0 57 however in the improved models with evolutionary algorithms especially the anfis hho model there is an acceptable density around the y x line taylor diagram was also used to examine the predictions fig 6 in this diagram the horizontal and vertical axes represent the standard deviation and the arc represents the correlation coefficient arcs drawn inside the quadrant indicate the rmsd values the lower the rmsd and the higher the correlation coefficient of a model in taylor diagram the more appropriate the model predicts the output the figure shows that hho anfis had better performance than the other two methods the correlation coefficient and rmsd between the observed values and the results of the anfis hho model is greater than 0 99 and lower than 1 respectively the standard deviation of the anfis hho model is 16 which is much closer to the standard deviation of the observed data the converging trend of a model to the minimum rmse is essential for model training according to fig 7 this trend was different for the studied models the gwo and hho algorithms had an initial rmse of 40 m and then converged rapidly to the optimum point after a small number of iterations however in the pso algorithm the initial error was small and converged to a certain optimal point with a gentle slope finally after 2000 to 2300 iterations all the algorithms have reached a particular error and maximum convergence has been obtained it is observed that after convergence the rmse values for the hho pso and gwo algorithms were 0 95 1 2 and 1 8 m respectively which indicates that lower rmse of the anfis hho model after convergence finally fig 8 depicts the optimized time series and the predicted data of the studied period by the selected model and scenario the figure shows that in all steps the groundwater exploitation is predicted by anfis hho properly the predicted error in the total steps varies around 2 mcm which means that the predicted value might be 2 mcm lower or higher than the optimal value the figure also shows that the prediction errors follow a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1 2 mcm as a result the oge amounts can be predicted by having the drop at the end of the previous month and the two months earlier and the amount of surface water allocated to the current month using the fuzzy inference system fis in predicting the oge conducted by milan et al 2018 showed that the prediction error is approximately 3 mcm they reported that the most appropriate models were f and e models each of which had three input variables however lower errors were obtained in the present study using the proposed models the selected scenarios in this study had four or five input variables all three hybrid models of the present study had better prediction performance than fis and anfis 5 conclusion it is necessary to predict the optimal amount of groundwater withdrawal in the current situation in some parts of the world however since the desired amount of groundwater always requires observing the allowable groundwater level and at the same time meeting the maximum water demand determining its amount without using optimization tools followed by prediction models using machine learning is a challenging and complicated task therefore this study aimed to develop a suitable machine learning model to predict the optimal exploitation of groundwater resources the results of the simulation and optimization model were used to achieve the optimal exploitation according to the optimal allocation of surface water and groundwater resources having the monthly water need and using groundwater simulation in extracting the drop and exploitation relationships for the aquifer several input scenarios were defined these scenarios were implemented by anfis to predict the oge since the results of anfis especially on the test data showed its poor performance evolutionary algorithms such as pso gwo and hho were used to train the network and improve its results anfis hho was selected rmse mae and r2 of 1 8 1 23 and 0 98 as the most suitable model for oge prediction using scenario g a scenario including all input variables the results of taylor diagram also showed the acceptable performance of anfis hho compared to anfis and other hybrid models besides in general the proposed algorithms were able to increase the accuracy of the prediction model compared to anfis which shows that the use of evolutionary algorithms during the training of anfis can significantly increase the prediction performance this study shows that the prediction error of oge has decreased by 3 mcm compared to the results of the study of milan et al 2018 which is interesting therefore this study encourages evolutionary algorithms introduced in this study to train the anfis model in groundwater management problems as a result the use of evolutionary optimization algorithms for anfis training is suggested credit authorship contribution statement sami ghordoyee milan investigation methodology software

4526,the present study deals with the optimal extraction of groundwater resources this approach has been developed for optimal integrated operation in an aquifer in iran the results of simulation optimization models have been used to develop a predictive model based on machine learning in the first stage adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis was used to predict the optimal groundwater exploitation oge amount in each month having the amounts of several inputs including the drop and amount of surface water at the end of the previous month and two months earlier and the water demand of the current month the results showed that the model s performance in predicting the test data was undesirable therefore to improve the prediction results in the second stage several evolutionary optimization algorithms i e particle swarm optimization pso gray wolf optimization gwo and harris hawk optimization hho were used to train anfis model the results indicated the appropriate performance of hho in anfis training which significantly improved the prediction accuracy of this model the best scenario for the anfis hho model included all the input parameters which resulted in rmse 1 45 mae 1 15 and r 2 0 99 respectively for the test data in addition the taylor diagram rmsd 1 40 std 15 5 and cc 0 99 showed anfis hho accuracy in estimating the oge value anfis hho was also able to improve the accuracy of anfis by rmse 4 and mae 2 mcm in general anfis pos anfis gwo and anfis hho had good predictive accuracy compared to anfis the results assure the authors to suggest the developed approach to experts for timely and cost effective prediction of oge in similar study areas keywords groundwater management conjunctive use anfis anfis pso anfis gwo anfis hho 1 introduction in areas where there is a combined exploitation of aquifers and rivers aquifers are considered a suitable option for water exploitation when the river water is limited however improper and excessive aquifer water exploitation in the last two decades has resulted in a sharp drop in water levels and reduced water quality of aquifers in most parts of iran to prevent this catastrophe the proper management of exploitation and protection of groundwater is necessary chang et al 2017 panahi et al 2020 since surface water and groundwater resources interact in the hydrological cycle and the reduction of one of them adversely affects the other these two water sources should be managed together todd and mays 2004 therefore in the last few decades various models have been developed in the combined exploitation of water resources the first study on the combined exploitation of surface water and groundwater resources was carried out by buras 1963 several factors have caused the combined exploitation of surface water and groundwater resources in the last few decades some of these factors are population growth and consequently the growth of the area under agriculture developments in the industry drought periods and climate change for this purpose experts have always proposed the optimal combined exploitation approach buras 1963 ejaz and peralta 1995 peralta 2001 vedula et al 2005 karamouz et al 2007 montazar et al 2010 chen et al 2013 rafipour langeroudi et al 2014 safavi and enteshari 2016 chen et al 2018 milan et al 2018 yousefi et al 2018 areas located in arid and semi arid regions suffer more from the lack of sufficient water resources than other parts of the world researchers use the combined exploitation of surface water and groundwater to meet the maximum water needs a review of studies conducted from 2000 to 2019 shows that most research in this area is performed in central asia and parts of the united states mainly most of the research is performed in iran fig 1 this country due to the decrease in rainfall the precipitation imbalance in different areas and the lack of a proper management system always suffers from the water supply therefore many researchers have always emphasized optimal combined exploitation in iran karamouz et al 2007 studies on the plains of iran show that consumers still suffer from the lack of management and shortage of water resources which shows the lack of cooperation between managers and researchers countries such as china and india due to the large population agricultural development and trade in recent years have always proposed the optimal combined exploitation approach to compensate for the shortage of water needs the objectives of optimal combined exploitation can include aquifer balancing preventing reservoir deficits and reducing groundwater level gwl drop in the form of multi objective problems safavi and alijanian 2011 rezaei et al 2017a 2017b roy et al 2016 luo et al 2020 singh 2014a 2014b an example of such problems is to meet the maximum needs and to increase groundwater quality along with preventing reservoir deficits and reducing losses or other goals such as the use of purified wastewater yousefi et al 2018 in flood prone areas this can be used to control groundwater elevation and the optimized usage of water resources potential to minimize water shortage milan et al 2018 the combined optimization model specifies the amount of water allocated to surface water and groundwater considering the constraints on both water resources however to determine this amount of allocation especially for groundwater resources it is necessary to simulate groundwater extract a regression model and finally determine the allocation amount by an optimization model safavi and enteshari 2016 parsapour moghaddam et al 2015 if this approach is used for other areas it requires a large amount of information including aquifer physical properties and all of the above steps should be repeated despite the proper results this is very time consuming and costly therefore developing a model for replacing the simulation and optimization models that do not require repeating the same steps for similar problems is valuable machine learning models are suitable models to replace these optimization and simulation models in this situation the optimization model is used to extract multiple outputs for groundwater allocation which can then be trained by machine learning approaches for prediction since machine learning models train the optimal values the results of them are also appropriate and close to optimal results several studies have been conducted on intelligent models for optimal combined exploitation which is an augmented technique of simulation optimization in this approach the results of an optimization model are trained by an intelligent model and the trained model can be used instead of the simulation optimization models milan et al 2018 the advantage of this approach is its applicability in various time periods and climatic conditions and being timely and simple compared to simulation optimization models rafipour langeroudi et al 2014 used the bayesian network to formulate real time combined use of surface and groundwater resources their research objectives included reducing the pumping costs improving the groundwater quality water supply with acceptable quality and controlling the groundwater table fluctuations the optimization model results were used to train the bayesian network and develop operation rules in long term planning anfis is one of the machine learning models widely used in time series predictions talei et al 2010 tabari et al 2012 to be able to improve the performance of the model especially on test data evolutionary algorithms such as particle swarm optimization pso genetic algorithm ga teaching learning based optimization tlb biogeography based optimization bbo firefly algorithm ffa ant colony optimization aco as well as recently developed algorithms such as gray wolf optimization gwo have been used to improve the prediction performance roy et al 2020 yaseen et al 2017 dehghani et al 2019 azad et al 2019 adnan et al 2019 chen et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 tikhamarine et al 2020 chen et al 2019 used evolutionary algorithms bbo and tlbo to train the structure of anfis to predict groundwater potential the desired parameter was estimated with high accuracy by using hybrid algorithms in this study they expressed that the anfis tlbo and anfis bbo models can be used in groundwater management in another study yaseen et al 2017 used the ffa optimization algorithm for the anfis model to predict river flow the results of this study showed that the ffa algorithm trains anfis well and increases its accuracy in prediction it was also found that the anfis ffa model performs modeling with fewer input variables and higher performance accuracy dehghani et al 2019 used anfis and gray wolf optimization algorithm gwo to predict the immediate long term and short term effective flow error evaluation criteria evaluated the performance of anfis gwo model better than anfis the results of this study show that the gray wolf algorithm with better training anfis increases its accuracy for estimating the parameter proposed by heidari et al 2019 the harris hawks optimization hho is one of the most recently algorithms available for optimization problems in this research hho is used to improve the training capability of anfis to be able to predict the optimal exploitation amount the present study aimed to select the best model among anfis anfis pso anfis gwo and anfis hho to predict the desired amount of groundwater exploitation in astaneh kouchesfahan aquifer this approach is implemented with numerical modeling of the groundwater simulator and the optimal combined model several scenarios based on variables affecting the amount of output i e oge are considered and finally the appropriate model and scenario for oge are introduced the use of the hybrid models especially anfis hho obtained from the proposed algorithms in the present research has been rarely used in the field of hydrology each proposed algorithm has its own characteristics highly capable of improving the performance of anfis training so performance evaluation of several hybrid models of anfis and proposing the superior hybrid model with a selected input scenario are the innovations of this research on the other hand this research improves the results of optimal prediction of groundwater withdrawal provided by milan et al 2018 the rest of the article is structured as follows in section 2 the study area and data used are described section 3 provides the flowchart of research and methodology which is divided into three sections section 3 1 describes the basic concepts of anfis the development of the hybrid anfis models is brought in section 3 2 this section also contains the basic concepts of the proposed algorithms which can be seen in sections 3 2 1 to 3 2 3 section 3 3 is dedicated to error evaluation criteria in section 4 the research results are presented in two separate sub sections section 4 1 focuses on the results of each model under different input scenarios while the comparison of the results of the selected scenarios by each model is brought in section 4 2 finally the conclusion is presented in section 5 2 study area and used data this research is a continuation of the research done by milan et al 2018 in astaneh kouchesfahan aquifer located in gilan province iran due to the fact that the purpose of this study is to achieve a suitable model to predict the optimal abstraction of groundwater resources with the help of the anfis model so the results of integrated optimization and information prepared by milan et al 2018 were extracted and used after implementing the optimization model and analyzing its results the oge was predicted using machine learning models several variables i e gwl drop at the end of the previous month a gwl drop at the end of the two months earlier b water need at the current month e surface water at the beginning of the current month c and surface water at the beginning of the previous month d were considered as the input variables of the scenarios table 1 shows a summary of the statistical characteristics of the input and output variables since the variables a and b are of the same type their minimum and maximum values are equal their minimum value is 0 42 m the negative sign of which indicates a rise in the gwl their average value was a drop varying between 0 54 and 58 m the average amount of available water c d is about 148 mcm while its minimum and maximum amounts are zero and 147 8 mcm respectively the minimum amount is for months when surface water is not available or months when water demand is deficient and groundwater resources are exploited to meet water needs the amount of water need varies from 122 mcm to 301 mcm per month with a standard deviation of about 16 mcm at the beginning of agricultural irrigation april and may and the harvest time august water need reaches its minimum amount in contrast in the months when agriculture is at its peak june and july it reaches its maximum the amount of optimal exploitation target variable also varies from zero to 39 mcm zero values are for the months when the water need is fully met by surface water or in other words surface water is available in significant quantities such as june and july when the surface water cannot meet the amount of water need groundwater resources are used the maximum amount of which is determined by the optimization model and is about 39 mcm by the combination of various input variables nine scenarios were developed according to table 2 the performance of each scenario was evaluated separately by the machine learning approaches 3 methodology the purpose of this study is to develop a predictive model for optimal abstraction of groundwater resources from the results of the optimized integrated operation optimization model of milan et al 2018 and having information on the amount of available surface water monthly water requirement and groundwater level drop values at the end of each month different input scenarios from the combination of parameters were developed each of the scenarios was then implemented by anfis anfis pso anfis gwo and anfis hho machine learning models the performance of the models and scenarios was investigated using error evaluation criteria in the form of statistical and graphical relationships i e rmse mape nse taylor diagram and scatterplots finally the most appropriate predictive model with its appropriate scenario was proposed fig 2 the following models used in this study are described comprehensively 3 1 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis jang 1993 introduced the anfis model by combining ann and fis anfis does not have the limitations of ann and fis such as overfitting and sensitivity to the definition of membership functions to perform better in prediction problems the most common method for the training of anfis is the sugeno type fis which uses a robust learning algorithm to determine the parameters of the model asefpour vakilian and massah 2018 anfis architecture generally includes five layers in layer 1 the inputs and y are subjected to generalized gaussian membership function µ to produce a new output out1 i which can be expressed using eq 1 ou t 1 i μ a i x i 1 2 1 ou t 1 i μ b i 2 y i 3 4 where 2 μ x e x p i σ i 2 and ai and bi denote the membership values of the µ pi and σi are the set of hypothesis parameters in the second layer the output of each node is calculated using eq 3 3 out 2 i μ a i x μ b i 2 y then the output of the second layer is normalized in layer 3 using eq 4 4 out 3 i w i ω i i 1 2 ω i the output of layer 3 is then passed through the adaptive nodes of layer 4 as follows 5 out 4 i w i f i w i p i x q i y r i where p q and r denote the consequent parameters of the i th node finally the overall output of the model is calculated using eq 6 6 out 4 i i w i f i 3 2 development of the anfis using evolutionary algorithms anfis suffers from several drawbacks such as trapping in local minima and slow convergence of training especially for wide search spaces therefore there is a need to use hybrid methods that use optimization techniques to optimize the parameters of the anfis in this study along with the anfis model several evolutionary algorithms were used to improve the anfis model according to the literature each of these algorithms has its unique features that can significantly improve the traditional anfis model the relationships of hybrid anfis ea used in this study to predict the oge is depicted in fig 5 first scenarios with different variables were given to the model as input and then the type of the fuzzy function and the anfis structure is determined the anfis is improved with evolutionary algorithms to achieve better results in this structure the objective function is to minimize the error of the predicted values finally the amount of oge is predicted by the optimized model 3 2 1 particle swarm optimization pso pso is one of the well known nature inspired optimization methods first introduced by kennedy and eberhart 1995 the pso algorithm starts with creating a random population each component in nature is a different set of decision variables whose optimal values should be provided each component represents a vector in the problem solving space the algorithm includes a velocity vector in addition to the position vector which forces the population to change their positions in the search space the velocity consists of two vectors called p and pg p is the best position that a particle has ever reached and pg is the best position that another particle in its neighborhood has ever reached in this algorithm each particle provides a solution in each iteration in the search for a d dimensional space the position of the particle i is represented by a d dimensional vector called xi xi 1 xi 2 xi d the velocity of each particle is shown by a d dimensional velocity vector called vi vi 1 vi 2 vi d finally the population moves to the optimum point using eqs 7 and 8 7 v id n 1 x ω v id n c 1 r 1 n p id n x id n c 2 r id n p pg n x id n 8 x id n 1 x id n v id n 1 where ω is the shrinkage factor used for convergence rate determination r 1 and r 2 are random numbers between 0 and 1 with uniform distribution n is the number of iterations c 1 is the best solution obtained by a particle and c 2 is the best solution identified by the whole population 3 2 2 gray wolf optimization gwo introduced by mirjalili et al 2014 gwo is a nature inspired meta heuristic algorithm based on the hierarchical structure and social behavior of wolves during hunting this algorithm is population based and has a simple process to achieve the optimal solution in implementing this algorithm four types of gray wolves i e alpha beta delta and omega are used to simulate the leadership hierarchy searching for prey besieging the prey and attacking the prey are the three main steps of hunting alpha wolves are the leaders who can be male or female these wolves dominate the herd and manage things like rest or hunting beta wolves help the alpha group in the decision making process and are also prone to be chosen as an alpha wolf delta wolves include older wolves hunters and baby care wolves omega wolves are located at the lowest position in the hierarchy have the least rights over the rest of the wolves and are not involved in the decision making process optimization is performed using alpha beta and delta wolves an alpha wolf is assumed to be the main leader of the algorithm and two wolves beta and delta are involved in the leading while the rest of the wolves follow them the mathematical model of the position of prey and wolves is expressed by eqs 9 and 10 9 d c x p t x t 10 x t 1 x p t a d where a and c are the coefficient vectors xp is the location vector of the prey and x is the location vector of each wolf and t is the iteration number the two vectors a and c are calculated using eqs 11 and 12 11 a 2 a r 1 a 12 c 2 r 2 where the a components decrease linearly from 2 to 0 during successive iterations and r 1 and r 2 are random vectors in the range of 0 1 alpha beta and delta wolves estimate the prey position while the rest of the wolves randomly update their position around the prey when the prey is besieged by wolves and stops moving the attack led by the alpha wolf begins the suitability of all solutions is calculated and the top three solutions are selected as alpha beta and delta wolves until the end of the algorithm this iterative procedure continues and in each iteration the superior position of each wolf and then the positions of the other wolves are updated after the iterations the position of the alpha wolf is introduced as the optimal solution 3 2 3 harris hawks optimization hho like many other evolutionary algorithms hho is a nature inspired and population based algorithm which is based on rabbit hunting by harris hawks heidari et al 2019 it includes the following steps 3 2 3 1 exploration phase in the hho method the harris hawks are the candidate solutions they perch randomly on some locations and wait to detect prey based on two strategies their position is mathematically expressed as eq 13 13 x t 1 x rand t r 1 x rand t 2 r 2 x t q 0 5 x rabbit t x m t r 3 l b r 4 u b l b q 0 5 where x t 1 is the position vector of hawks in the next iteration of t xrabbit t is the position of rabbit x t is the current position vector of hawks r 1 r 2 r 3 r 4 and q are random numbers between 0 and 1 which are updated in each iteration lb and ub are the upper and lower bounds of variables xrand t is a randomly selected hawk from the current population and xm is the average position of the current population of hawks the average position of hawks is obtained using eq 14 14 x m t 1 n i 1 n x i t where xi t indicates the location of each hawk in iteration t and n denotes the total number of hawks 3 2 3 2 the transition from exploration to exploitation the energy of prey decreases considerably during the escape the energy of prey is modeled using eq 15 15 e 2 e 0 1 t t where e indicates the escaping energy of the prey t is the maximum number of iterations and e 0 is the initial energy e 0 randomly changes inside the interval 1 1 at each iteration 3 2 3 3 exploitation phase the hawks intensify the besiege process to catch the exhausted prey effortlessly the e parameter is utilized to model this strategy and enable the hho to switch between soft and hard besiege processes in this regard when e 0 5 the soft besiege happens and when e 0 5 the hard besiege occurs 3 2 3 4 soft besiege if r 0 5 and e 0 5 the rabbit still has enough energy and tries to escape by some random misleading jumps but finally it cannot during these attempts the harris hawks encircle it softly to make the rabbit more exhausted and then perform the surprise pounce this behavior is modeled by eqs 16 and 17 16 x t 1 δ x t e j x rabbit t x t 17 δ x t x rabbit t x t where δx t is the difference between the position vector of the rabbit and the current location in iteration t r 5 is a random number between 0 and 1 and jrabbit represents the random jump strength of the rabbit throughout the escaping procedure 3 2 3 5 hard besiege if r 0 5 and e 0 5 the prey is exhausted and it has low escaping energy besides harris hawks hardly encircle the prey to perform the surprise pounce finally fig 3a in this situation the current positions are updated using eq 18 18 x t 1 x rabbit t e δ x t 3 2 3 6 soft besiege with progressive rapid dives to perform a soft besiege we supposed that the hawks could evaluate decide their next move based on the following rule 19 y x rabbit t e j x rabbit t x t we supposed that they would dive based on the levy flight lf based patterns using the following rule 20 z y s l f d where d is the dimension of the problem s is a random vector and lf is calculated using eq 21 21 lf x 0 01 u σ v 1 β σ γ 1 β s i n π β 2 γ 1 β 2 β 2 β 1 2 1 β where u and v are random values between 0 and 1 and β is a default constant set to 1 5 hence eq 22 shows the final strategy for updating the positions of hawks in the soft besiege phase 22 x t 1 y iff y f x t z iff z f x t where y and z are obtained using eqs 19 and 20 respectively 3 2 3 7 hard besiege with progressive rapid dives if r 0 5 and e 0 5 the rabbit does not enough energy to escape and a hard besiege is constructed before the surprise pounce to catch the prey fig 3b therefore the following rule is performed in hard besiege condition 23 x t 1 y iff y f x t z iff z f x t where y and z are obtained using eqs 24 and 25 24 y x rabbit t e j x rabbit t x m t 25 z y s l f d where x m t is obtained using eq 14 3 3 evaluation criteria ec the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were used to evaluate the performance of scenarios and machine learning methods 26 r 2 1 i 1 n x p x o 2 i 1 n x o x o 2 27 rmse 1 n i 1 n x o x p 2 28 mae 1 n i 1 n x p x o 2 where xo is the observed value xp is the predicted value and n is the number of samples the lower rmse and mae and higher r 2 the better performance of the model is 4 results and discussion 4 1 results of the anfis model and hybrid anfis models the appropriate structure of the models and the optimal values for its parameters are brought in table 3 according to the table in anfis the gaussian membership function was selected as the most appropriate fuzzy membership function since the anfis uses the sugeno type method the linear function was selected as the best output function of the model the optimal structure and architecture of the anfis pso model are shown in table 3 the algorithm s initial population was considered 30 since the higher number of populations did not improve the model s performance furthermore after 2500 iterations no changes were observed in the objective function s value and therefore the maximum iteration was considered 3000 the optimal structure and architecture of the anfis gwo model are shown in table 3 according to the table the initial population and the maximum number of iterations were considered 25 and 3000 respectively the optimal structure and parameter values of the hho algorithm can be seen in table 3 achieving the appropriate values for each parameter requires implementing the model with a wide range of values which ends with determining the appropriate values of the parameter the population for hho was 30 while the maximum number of iterations was obtained to be 2000 the scenarios were first implemented by the anfis model and the results of the two sections of training and test were obtained by evaluation criteria table 4 according to the table there is a relatively large error in test data for example in scenario b which included two input variables of gwl drop at the end of the previous month and two months earlier rmse mae and r2 were 4 85 mcm 23 3 mcm and 0 95 respectively for training data however the values of these evaluation criteria were 98 8 977 and 0 23 respectively for the test data these differences are observed in other scenarios more or less indicating that the anfis network is trapped in local minima during the training in this situation the prediction error on training data is significantly lower than that on test data in pso anfis the performance of the scenarios a to d was poor the number of input variables in these scenarios is one or two therefore the prediction of oge requires more information and only having one or two from the five variables cannot predict the optimal exploitation values according to table 4 in scenarios with three or more variables the performance of the model has increased so that scenario g which included the input variables of gwl drop at the end of the previous month and two months earlier available surface water in the current month and water need at the current month had the highest performance in predicting the optimal exploitation for this scenario rmse mae and r2 on test data were 2 55 mcm 1 23 mcm and 0 98 respectively thus having the values of the drop the amount of surface water and water needs the amount of optimal exploitation can be estimated by the hybrid model all the scenarios from e to j had remarkable prediction performance for example in scenario f by having the values of three variables i e drop at the end of the previous month available surface water and the water need at the current month the amount of oge for test data was predicted with rmse mae and r2 of 2 11 mcm 2 74 mcm and 0 97 respectively the only difference between this pattern and the pattern g is the drop at the end of two months earlier which indicates that despite having a weak correlation between the input and output variables a strong combination might be created between the input variables by adding an input variable overall the results showed that pso significantly improved the performance of the anfis model this indicates that the anfis model improved by the pso algorithm is not trapped in local optimal points and reaches global optimal points during model training in gwo anfis having four input variables scenarios f g h and j exerted acceptable accuracy in predicting the gwl among these scenarios scenario g having the input variables of drop at the end of the previous month dropped at the end of two months earlier and surface water and water need in the current month resulted in the highest performance with rmse mae and r2 of 1 8 1 23 and 0 98 respectively for the test data what is clear is the inadequate accuracy of gwl estimation in scenarios containing one or two input variables similar results were observed for the anfis and anfis pso models which shows that models with two input variables or less cannot correctly understand the complex relationships between the inputs and optimal exploitation amounts the results also indicate that besides improving the accuracy of anfis prediction the accuracy of predicting the training and test data is also within an acceptable level by using the gwo algorithm in other words irrational predictions are not made in any step of the test data which shows that the anfis model improved by the gwo algorithm is not trapped in local optimal points and reaches global optimal points in hho anfis the results showed that scenario j with the participation of all input variables had the highest performance in the optimal prediction of oge table 4 for this scenario rmse mae and r2 were 1 45 m 1 15 m and 0 99 respectively for test data having the drop at the end of the previous month and two months earlier and surface water at the current month scenario e was the closest scenario to scenario j in terms of evaluation criteria rmse 1 58 mae 1 30 r2 0 99 thus oge can be predicted accurately using only these three variables similar to previous sections the participation of one or two variables as input could not predict the oge properly the method of selecting the input variables in a scenario is also crucial in oge predictions for example although scenario b contains the drop parameters at the end of the previous month and two months earlier and scenario c includes the drop at the end of the previous month and the amount of water need both scenarios had relatively similar performance in predicting oge however with the addition of the available surface water at the current month to both models the prediction accuracy changed significantly by adding this variable to scenario b scenario e was formed which had excellent accuracy however scenario f which was developed from scenario c did not exert a good prediction accuracy compared to scenario e of course these comparisons can also be made for other combinations of other input variables therefore it can be argued that the combination of variables to create a scenario is very effective in the accuracy of time series prediction nevertheless in general it is concluded that the hho algorithm is a robust optimization method to improve the structure of the anfis model 4 2 a comparison among the results of selected models the time series of the optimized values by the optimization model for the selected scenario and their predicted values are depicted in fig 4 the figure shows the changes in the predicted and optimized values in each time step the anfis model results show that in several steps such as 14 8 and 9 the prediction value was accompanied by a significant error although the prediction has been performed with acceptable accuracy in many steps these errors in some steps remarkably lower the performance of the model in other diagrams where evolutionary algorithms have been used to optimize the parameters of the anfis structure this weakness is not observed and the prediction is performed with an insignificant error in all steps accordingly the scatter plots fig 5 show the incorrect predictions in some steps using anfis which has reduced its r 2 to 0 57 however in the improved models with evolutionary algorithms especially the anfis hho model there is an acceptable density around the y x line taylor diagram was also used to examine the predictions fig 6 in this diagram the horizontal and vertical axes represent the standard deviation and the arc represents the correlation coefficient arcs drawn inside the quadrant indicate the rmsd values the lower the rmsd and the higher the correlation coefficient of a model in taylor diagram the more appropriate the model predicts the output the figure shows that hho anfis had better performance than the other two methods the correlation coefficient and rmsd between the observed values and the results of the anfis hho model is greater than 0 99 and lower than 1 respectively the standard deviation of the anfis hho model is 16 which is much closer to the standard deviation of the observed data the converging trend of a model to the minimum rmse is essential for model training according to fig 7 this trend was different for the studied models the gwo and hho algorithms had an initial rmse of 40 m and then converged rapidly to the optimum point after a small number of iterations however in the pso algorithm the initial error was small and converged to a certain optimal point with a gentle slope finally after 2000 to 2300 iterations all the algorithms have reached a particular error and maximum convergence has been obtained it is observed that after convergence the rmse values for the hho pso and gwo algorithms were 0 95 1 2 and 1 8 m respectively which indicates that lower rmse of the anfis hho model after convergence finally fig 8 depicts the optimized time series and the predicted data of the studied period by the selected model and scenario the figure shows that in all steps the groundwater exploitation is predicted by anfis hho properly the predicted error in the total steps varies around 2 mcm which means that the predicted value might be 2 mcm lower or higher than the optimal value the figure also shows that the prediction errors follow a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1 2 mcm as a result the oge amounts can be predicted by having the drop at the end of the previous month and the two months earlier and the amount of surface water allocated to the current month using the fuzzy inference system fis in predicting the oge conducted by milan et al 2018 showed that the prediction error is approximately 3 mcm they reported that the most appropriate models were f and e models each of which had three input variables however lower errors were obtained in the present study using the proposed models the selected scenarios in this study had four or five input variables all three hybrid models of the present study had better prediction performance than fis and anfis 5 conclusion it is necessary to predict the optimal amount of groundwater withdrawal in the current situation in some parts of the world however since the desired amount of groundwater always requires observing the allowable groundwater level and at the same time meeting the maximum water demand determining its amount without using optimization tools followed by prediction models using machine learning is a challenging and complicated task therefore this study aimed to develop a suitable machine learning model to predict the optimal exploitation of groundwater resources the results of the simulation and optimization model were used to achieve the optimal exploitation according to the optimal allocation of surface water and groundwater resources having the monthly water need and using groundwater simulation in extracting the drop and exploitation relationships for the aquifer several input scenarios were defined these scenarios were implemented by anfis to predict the oge since the results of anfis especially on the test data showed its poor performance evolutionary algorithms such as pso gwo and hho were used to train the network and improve its results anfis hho was selected rmse mae and r2 of 1 8 1 23 and 0 98 as the most suitable model for oge prediction using scenario g a scenario including all input variables the results of taylor diagram also showed the acceptable performance of anfis hho compared to anfis and other hybrid models besides in general the proposed algorithms were able to increase the accuracy of the prediction model compared to anfis which shows that the use of evolutionary algorithms during the training of anfis can significantly increase the prediction performance this study shows that the prediction error of oge has decreased by 3 mcm compared to the results of the study of milan et al 2018 which is interesting therefore this study encourages evolutionary algorithms introduced in this study to train the anfis model in groundwater management problems as a result the use of evolutionary optimization algorithms for anfis training is suggested credit authorship contribution statement sami ghordoyee milan investigation methodology software

4527,soil salinity in the coastal areas of mazandaran province in the north of iran is a big problem that threats the cultivation of rice which is the major crop in this region in this study the latest version of drainmod s and aquacrop models were used to simulate the salt concentration in the soil profile of paddy field with shallow and saline groundwater this research was carried out in a physical model located at the meteorological research center of agricultural and natural resources campus of university of tehran in 2018 the physical model was divided into two boxes each with dimension of 1 1 1 9 m by an isolated sheet one box was conditioned with shallow and saline groundwater as ssg treatment and another box with shallow and nonsaline groundwater as a control treatment nsg the concentration of saline groundwater was considered to be 20 ds m 1 equal to the salinity of groundwater in agricultural lands of the coastal zone of the caspian sea both boxes were irrigated with tap water with a salinity of 0 94 ds m 1 after evaluating the models for simulation of salinity in the soil profile of nsg treatment the best values of mbe rmse nrmse d and r2 were 0 02 ds m 1 0 07 ds m 1 2 85 0 91 and 0 89 for drainmod s model and zero 0 05 ds m 1 2 11 0 93 and 0 84 for aquacrop models the results indicate a fairly good correlation between the observed and simulated data also the parameters of mbe rmse nrmse d and r2 were calculated to evaluate the performance of the model in estimating salt concentration changes in three depths of soil the best values for these parameters in the ssg treatment were 0 04 ds m 1 0 10 ds m 1 1 95 0 95 and 0 96 for drainmod s and 0 01 ds m 1 0 09 ds m 1 1 82 0 96 and 0 93 for aquacrop respectively in general comparing the measured and simulated soil salinity illustrated that drainmod s and aquacrop could be used as a useful tools to predict and simulate the soil salinity changes trend also the accuracy and performance of drainmod s in higher salinity levels was more than the ones of aquacrop because drainmod s model is a more specific model for salinity issues keywords paddy fields drainmod s saline and shallow aquacrop groundwater salinity profile 1 introduction food security as a global concern is impossible without water and agriculture willer and lernoud 2019 fadul et al 2020 yin et al 2021 increasing population and the need for more food have pushed water resources to produce crops rice is one of the most popular plants grown in the world that accounts for about 80 of food consumption for half of the world s population carracelas et al 2019 which is planted in almost 113 countries because of its flexibility in different natural conditions faostat 2018 second to wheat rice production has the largest cultivated area over the world gill et al 2014 murumkar et al 2014 pourgholam amiji et al 2020 however rice production is being affected by climate change and subsequently water scarcity pan et al 2017 accordingly more research is needed for this key plant especially in areas prone to saline soil and water in different parts of the world in coastal areas underground water is considered the most dominant source of water supply for agriculture industry and even drinking in these sections nonsaline water resources are susceptible to be affected by saline waters and this issue has always caused various concerns in these areas lampayan et al 2015 jiao et al 2017 typically interaction and penetration of saline water to coastal aquifers occur due to the drop in groundwater level the prospect of lateral or vertical transfer of saline water plays a significant role in the reduction of underground water quality chen and jiao 2014 rice cultivation has been common in the northern regions of iran for many years especially in coastal areas the economy and income of the people in this region depend on rice cultivation and this strategic product plays a key role in people s lives adequate water and heavy and fertile soil are abundant in these areas it has been reported that out of 892 213 ha of the paddy lands in iran 68 4 are located in three northern provinces of mazandaran guilan and golestan which are adjacent to the caspian coastal areas ahmadi et al 2021 due to the proximity of these areas to the sea they have shallow and saline groundwater which is a threat to rice cultivation also due to the high salinity of the caspian sea about 25 ds m 1 the adjacent lands near the sea are not cultivated and it is necessary to investigate the feasibility of rice cultivation in these areas soil salinity and subsequent reduction of crop yields require different management practices this study aims to narrow down the knowledge gap on the potential effects of changes in salt concentration due to the interaction of nonsaline and saline water in coastal paddy lands therefore this research was conducted to investigate the salt profile in the soil under saline and shallow groundwater and pond irrigation with nonsaline water conditions proper management of water soil and vegetation systems cause novel achievements in sustainable agriculture using non conventional soil and water resources xu et al 2019 willer and lernoud 2019 pourgholam amiji et al 2020 yin et al 2021 effectively performing various field tests support in making the right decision since field measurements are highly cost and time consuming the capabilities of different models can be employed to solve the existing problems and different management scenarios however the cultivation and production in the presence of salinity require a variety of measurements calculations such as the prediction of salinity changes in the soil which is possible by using models in addition to aforementioned objectives the purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of drainmod s and aquacrop models to simulate the salt concentration in the soil profile the reason for using both models at the same time is that the drainmod s model has been developed for areas with shallow and saline groundwater conditions and uses the water balance for water movement in the soil however aquacrop model uses the richards equation for water movement in the soil these models are more user friendly compared with the other models of water and solute movement in the soil compared to hydrus saltmed swap etc drainmod s model which was developed for areas with shallow and saline water levels has been rarely used in arid and semi arid regions and research on salt movement using aquacrop is very limited also such a study that uses these two models to simulate the movement of water and salt in rice cultivation conditions has not been performed yet in recent years various models have been used to study irrigation management and stress effects at the farm level abdul ganiyu et al 2018 singh 2019 masasi et al 2020 lisenbee et al 2020 the new version of aquacrop is among the models that simulate the product yield under different moisture stresses and soil profile salinity fao 2017 paredes and torres 2017 zabihi et al 2017 evaluated the effect of drought stress on the yield water use efficiency and salinity of the rice root zone using aquacrop they confirmed the optimal result of this model hassanli et al 2016 have also applied aquacrop to estimate corn yield the results indicated that the relative error of aquacrop varied from 2 9 to 30 8 for estimation of yield product and confirmed the reasonable performance of this model in evaluating soil salinity araya et al 2016 estimated the effect of different climates planting dates and soil types on yield using aquacrop and concluded that this model has a high ability in the estimation of water productivity and the optimal amount of irrigation also under different scenarios this model is capable of simulating the product yield plant water requirement and water use efficiency under a variety of conditions including deficit irrigation pirmoradian and davatgar 2019 the consequences of various studies for wheat barley rice corn and sugar beet proved that aquacrop simulation model can be used to determine the effect of deficit irrigation for different conditions on yield as an effective mean for improving water management in the field and increase water productivity heng et al 2009 tavakoli et al 2015 farahani et al 2009 abdul ganiyu et al 2018 however due to the novelty of the soil salinity simulation in the new version of the aquacrop model few researches have been done using this model to study soil salinity changes in the world altough similar studies are for other crops but for specific rice cultivation conditions limited number of studies and results are available the drainmod model has been developed by skaggs 1978 for simulation of the soil profile salinity salt and water movement in the soil water table fluctuations in areas with drains in this model the infiltration rate into the soil is based on the green ampt equation zareabyaneh et al 2011 lisenbee et al 2020 drainmod s and aquacrop models have also been used for a wide range of plants paredes and torres 2017 zabihi et al 2017 abdul ganiyu et al 2018 pirmoradian and davatgar 2019 davoodi et al 2019 xu et al 2019 lisenbee et al 2020 guo et al 2020 but has been less used in shallow and saline water table specifically for rice also the ultimate goal of this study is to suggest one of these two models due to the high accuracy of the simulation and fewer inputs data that such a study has not been done so far therefore the first goal is to investigate the ability to simulate soil salinity fluctuations in conditions with saline and shallow water table with rice cultivation and the second goal is to select a superior model with respect to simpler and fewer inputs drainmod has been tested and evaluated for a wide range of soils plants and climatic conditions compared to richards s one dimensional equation the results generally showed that drainmod can be used to predict the water table level fluctuations skaggs et al 2012 sinai and jain 2006 darzi et al 2007 used drainmod to evaluate the performance of a drainage system for a long time and to predict the depth of water table drainage outflow surface runoff evapotranspiration water losses infiltration rate and the number of wet and dry days in a paddy field similar studies have been reported by yang 2008 youssef et al 2018 davoodi et al 2019 singh 2019 and lisenbee et al 2020 the results of these studies indicated the high capability of drainmod model in simulating the movement of water and salts in the soil wahba 2017 has evaluated the drainmod s water management model for simulating a different strategy for drainage water for irrigation for 20 years and recommended the model for long term simulation of various water management strategies consist of saline water nonsaline water and mixed case drainmod s can be used to study the long term effect of the drainage system on groundwater depth drainage outflow and soil salinity for various soil types and different climates youssef et al 2006 kale 2011 applied the drainmod s model to simulate the impact of water management and drainage system design criteria on the high yielding winter wheat and maize crop in turkey during three years of cultivation and examined the validity of the model the comparison between the observed and simulated values showed acceptable agreement so that the magnitude of the standard deviation for the water table and soil salinity parameters were calculated to be 49 9 56 9 cm and 0 51 0 96 d s m 1 respectively moreover feng et al 2018 examined drainmod s for laizhou bay in china during the two growing seasons the results showed a good match between simulated and measured water table fluctuations and soil salinity with a coefficient of determination r 2 higher than 0 75 and mean bias error mse less than 10 ebrahimian and laiaghat 2008 evaluated drainmod in the rice lands of behshahr reported the performance of drainmod acceptable in this study the root means square error rmse coefficient of determination r 2 and coefficient of residual mass crm for the water table were obtained 16 7 0 86 and 0 1 respectively they also evaluated the performance of drainmod s and the root mean square error rmse and r 2 for soil profile salinity was estimated to be 14 6 and 0 91 ds m 1 respectively in general the results showed that drainmod s is an appropriate tool for long term simulation water table prediction and soil profile salinity management this study aims to evaluate these claims by conducting laboratory research on a large lysimeter it is assumed due to the continous flood irrigation of paddy fields 3 7 cm depth of water on the soil surface the occurrence of a downward flow prevents upward flow from the saline groundwater to the soil surface it seems that this can partly control the salinity of groundwater also an impermeable sublayer is formed at 30 cm depth due to puddling practices in the paddy fields preventing upward movement of saline groundwater for this porpuse long term soil salinity was examined using drainmod s and aquacrop models to evaluate such hypothesis the novelty of this work is that the drainmod s and aquacrop models have been rarely used for specific conditions of paddy lands also studies related to the soil salinity variations using aquacrop model are limited 2 materials and methods 2 1 site characteristics the experiment was conducted at the climate research center of agricultural and natural resources campus of the university of tehran 35 55 n 50 54 e with elevation of 1293 m above the sea level in alborz province karaj iran from 1 july to 23 october 2018 according to the long term statistics and data 1988 2018 the region has a mediterranean climate with a maximum and minimum monthly mean air temperature of 26 c and 1 c respectively the mean air temperature is 15 9 c with the minimum and maximum absolute values 17 c and 42 c respectively furthermore the mean annual precipitation in karaj is 247 8 mm pourgholam amiji et al 2019b table 1 shows the summary of meteorological data in the period of rice cultivation at the studied site official statistics by ministry of agriculture jihad 2014 show that the coastal areas in mazandran provice north of iran suffer from soil salinity the salt affected zones with an area of 30000 ha include 14 of the total land areas of this province groundwater in these coastal lands is salty and shallow 30 to 150 cm no crop has been cultivated on these land so far due to upward movement and salt accumulation in the root zone pourgholam amiji et al 2020 reported that the cultivation of rice in the salt affected soils is possible because of continuous flooding and downward flow movement and also due to the presence of a hardpan layer in depth of 30 cm from the soil surface preventing the upward flow and salt movement hardpan layer is created during tillage and puddling practices which is common in paddy fields pourgholam amiji et al 2019a 2 2 experimental data the chemical properties of the irrigation water were measured in water quality laboratory see table 2 the lysimeter l e n g t h w i d t h d e p t h 3 8 m 1 m 1 m was made of metal and plexiglas sheets the actual length of the lysimeter was 4 m but a 10 cm space at each side was left for controlling the water table and supplying saline groundwater fig 1 some ceramic cups were installed on the body of the lysimeter to get required soil solution samples the lysimeter was diveided by an insulation sheet into two plots salted and non salted plots fig 1 illustrates the details of the physical model the soil in the lysimeter was brought from a paddy fields in north of iran three lyers are distinguishable in the paddy fields top or puddling layer 0 30 cm in depth mid or hardpan layer 30 40 cm in depth and sublayer 40 70 cm in depth similarly these three layers were made in the lysimeter table 3 shows the physical properties of paddy soil including the percentage of clay silt and sand in different described layers the measurements and analyses for the soil texture class followed the standard method gee and or 2002 the soil was classified as mostly heavy in different layers which is appropriate for rice cultivation and water retention the field capacity and bulk density were measured using the pressure plate and the cylindrical steel ring method the soil profile characteristics were inputted into the soil component of drainmod for the simulation other requirements were calculated using retention curve retc version 1 1 table 4 shows the calculated parameters in the lysimeter two different treatments were considered for irrigation non saline water nsg 1 1 nonsaline shallow groundwater nsg and saline water ssg 2 2 saline shallow groundwater ssg both in the presence of shallow groundwater table in ssg the saline groundwater was applied in the sublayer through free space at the end of lysimeter the ec of saline water was equale to the ec of groundwater in agricultural lands of the coastal zone of the caspian sea 20 ds m 1 the salt concentration of the irrigation water was 0 94 ds m 1 d s m 1 then in the rice cultivating period which lasted about 90 days the mid season and the end season drainage was applied to the paddies 2 3 drainmod s model drainmod skaggs 1980 is based on the hydrological model of a field and watershed scale which can be used for predicting surface runoff soil water content and groundwater table as well as subsurface drainage discharge drainmod s kandil 1992 is the extended model of drainmod which its inputs is provided from water balance data obtained by drainmod using for the simulation of drainage water salinity movement and distribution in the soil profile in this study drainmod s version 6 1 was used to simulate the effects of both subsurface and conventional drainage on the groundwater table and soil salinity the model determines the average daily soil water fluctuation at the boundary among thin soil layers and calculating the water balance for each soil layer the soil water was regarded as a one dimension vertical movement in the unsaturated zone and two dimensions including vertical and lateral movements in the saturated zone the key input parameters of the drainmod s model are soil drainage irrigation and vegetation data and climatic daily precipitation maximum and minimum daily temperature or evapotranspiration potential latitude and thermal profile the precipitation and temperature values are required in the entire simulation period since the model uses hourly precipitation values the daily precipitation data should be converted to it using the weather forecast data model reference and daily evapotranspiration can be computed using the thornthwaite radiation based method by the model the most important soil properties using in the model are the moisture characteristic curve and water absorption coefficients for different layers of the soil furthermore the model requires some inputs for drainage system parameters including drainage depth drainage distance maximum surface storage depth drainage coefficient effective drainage radius and impermeable layer depth the key parameters for irrigation management are irrigation depth day and month of the first irrigation irrigation interval and probable depth of precipitation during the period of cultivation plant inputs include root depth planting and harvesting dates and information on drought stress and land management skaggs 1978 darzi et al 2007 skaggs et al 2012 sinai and jain 2006 singh et al 2006 zareabyaneh et al 2011 regarding the capillary rise and upward flow in the drainmod s model gardner 1958 analyzed the factors controlling steady evaporation from soils with shallow water tables by solving the governing equations for unsaturated upward water movement for soils with a given functional relationship between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and pressure head k k h gardner presented simplified expressions for the maximum evaporation rate in terms of water table depth and the conductivity function parameters for steady unsaturated flow the upward flux is constant everywhere and capillary rise occurs from the water table to the upper soil layers the intensity of this transfer depends on the depth of water table and soil texture therefore upward flux depends on unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which is usually estimated from the saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water characteristics it is the most uncertain of the soil property inputs and is often adjusted during calibration skaggs et al 2012 also in previous studies it has been mentioned that the drainmod s model has been able to have a good simulation of capillary rise skaggs 1985 drainmod s is generally used in wet areas where the water table is located at a small depth of the ground surface this model operates based on the calculation of the water balance equation water balance in this model is classified as two categories in the surface balance the model can be applied to compute the permeability runoff and surface storage using the following equation eq 1 1 p f δ s r 0 where p is precipitation cm f is the infiltration rate cm δ s is the change in volume of water stored on the surface cm and r 0 is the surface runoff cm in the subsurface balance as the second class drainmod s calculates the water balance for a thin section of the soil in the middle of two drains according to the following equation eq 2 2 δ v a d e t d s f where δ v a is the change in the water free pore space or air volume cm d is the drainage depth cm and d is depth of provided water by underground irrigation cm et is evapotranspiration cm d s is deep seepage cm and f is cumulative infiltration cm soil tillage and preparation of the upper layer of soil were carried out in a depth of 20 cm and the seeds of rice early tarom type were planted the transplanted seedlings transferred to the lysimeter the amount of rice fertilized for growth proportional to the conventional method in rice fields was applied with an n p k 3 3 nitrogen phosphorus potassium ratio of 15 10 10 m 2 other input information is presented in table 5 2 4 aquacrop model aquacrop is a water driven crop model developing by the fao in this study a revised version of this organization s publication no 33 version 6 0 2017 was used to simulate the plant growth process and to estimate yield and salinity for simulating the yield of products the model separates the actual value of the evapotranspiration of the plant et a into the soil surface evaporation e a and transpiration t a this issue causes that the model considers the inefficient part of water denied as water losses in the crop production cycle doorenbos and kassam 1979 this separation is especially important when vegetation has not been completed yet zabihi et al 2017 the following equation was used based on the relative evapotranspiration and equation of water balance eq 3 3 y x y a y x k y et x et a et x where y x and y a are the maximum and actual product yields et x and et a are the maximum and actual value of evapotranspiration of plant respectively and k y is the relative coefficient of product reduction related to the amount of evaporation and transpiration reduction aquacrop simulates water flow in the soil based on the water balance equation which includes runoff infiltration re distribution or drainage processes deep infiltration capillary rise and evapotranspiration the salt movement in the soil is carried out both vertically and horizontally in vertical movement the model simulates the downward movement of the salt into the soil using drainage relations as well as upward movement due to the capillary for the horizontal movement of the salt in the soil the model uses water distribution relations steduto et al 2009 in manual of aquacrop model reported which water drains from the system to the subsoil and the groundwater table through the lower boundary if the groundwater table is shallow water can move upward to the upper soil layers by capillary rise thus the capillary rise will be smaller if the soil water content in the root zone is at or above field capacity no driving force or close to the wilting point hydraulic conductivity too small to move water upwards but when the water content in the root zone or the water table is high water and salts move through the soil pores as a capillary rise to the upper soil layers overall the aquacrop model is based on the convection diffusion equation cde for upward flux raes and steduto 2018 one of the advantages of drainmod s and aquacrop models is that they took these assumptions into account and recorded simulations of the vertical and horizontal movement of water and salts very well in both irrigation and non irrigation mid and end season drainage periods for each simulation period aquacrop requires four groups of data as the key inputs including climatic vegetation soil and field management data the climate data includes daily evapotranspiration of reference plant minimum and maximum daily temperature related to maximum and minimum daily humidity daily precipitation wind speed sunny hours and the annual mean of c o 2 concentration as mentioned before the required statistical data were colledted from the meteorological station of karaj from 1 july 2018 to 23 october 2018 by connecting the et 0 calculator software to aquacrop the reference evapotranspiration et 0 during the rice growth using the penman monteith method was calculated allen et al 1998 aquacrop uses as default the data obtained from mauna loa observatory hawaii for required annual c o 2 concentration furthermore daily precipitation values during the rice growing season were inputted to the model moreover the soil data including saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat volumetric moisture content at the saturation point θ sat field capacity θ fc permanent wilting point θ pwp and electrical conductivity ec should be inputted to the model the inputs related to the vegetation data have two different types some of them are constant and the others are variable and non stable there are default and fixed plant parameter values for most of the crops in the model these parameters are either constant over time or dependence geographical positions on the model calibrates them to optimal and unconstrained conditions using plant growth data moreover all parameters related to the location and specific parameters of the plant such as maximum root depth plant density planting time and irrigation management are classified in the group of user specific parameters non stable which should be correctly entered into the model hassanli et al 2016 in this research the soil salinity was simulated during the growing season of rice finally farm management data are divided into two main sections farm management and its fertility and irrigation management data the fertility of the farm was considered without any restriction irrigation management data includes irrigation methods and irrigation water quantity and quality during the growing season in this study the basin or flooding system was used as irrigation method 2 5 model evaluation the performance evaluation of both models was based on the accuracy of both models in simulating observed data there is no single statistic to robust a model yang et al 2014 as a result a combination of several statistics was used to evaluate model performance in this study coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse mean bias error mbe and willmott index of agreement d willmott 1981 were used for evaluating performance of the drainmod s and aquacrop models values of r 2 and d close to unity larger than 0 5 and 0 65 respectively indicate an acceptable model performance tan et al 2018 rmse and mbe values near zero demonstrate a good match between simulated and measured data furthermore based on categorized ranges for nrmse if the value is less than 30 then the model performance is fair and acceptable such that the best value is zero these ranges have been confirmed in the studies of bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 and masasi et al 2020 accordingly these indices are calculated by the following formula eqs 4 8 4 r 2 1 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 5 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 1 2 6 nrmse rmse o 100 7 mbe i 1 n p i o i n 8 d 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 consider that o i and p i are the measured and the predicted amounts o and p are the average of measured and predicted values at total n number of observations and predicted data respectively 2 6 calibration to obtain the optimal agreement between the predicted and observed system variables the input parameters of both models were calibrated 2 6 1 drainmod s calibration the crop parameters used for the calibration include salt concentration variation in the soil profile the test site location related data water and soil resources drainage system and plant parameters see table 5 as shown in table 5 there are two different calibrated coefficients the thickness of the vertical layer and the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the soil interpreted as a fraction 0 1 of hydraulic conductivity in the upper layer of soil since these coefficients were not calculated in the research they calibrated according to the soil type and lysimeter condition calibrated parameters and their ranges were manually adjusted to minimize the differences between the predicted and observed values by comparing them visually and statistically based on sensitivity and analyses previously conducted for the drainmod s model and values reported in the literature consequently the calibration parameters were in a certain range and the simulation was acceptable 2 6 2 aquacrop calibration the measured parameters required for the calibration using aquacrop includes collected climatic crop and soil data when full sets of measured daily weather data used the accuracy of model calibration improves because of the aquacrop model flexibility the user can tune the calibrated coefficients to improve the results notice that the calibrated coefficients consisting in the form factor water stress function water depletion factor for controlling the closure of the stomata and the beginning of the vegetation aging planting time to the maximum growth of canopy penciling and start aging vegetation should be highly accurate abdul ganiyu et al 2018 after changing the constant coefficients until obtaining the desired results the coefficients recorded as calibrated values see table 6 2 7 sensitivity analysis of drainmod s and aquacrop model in this section the sensitivity analysis of parameters involved in the simulations to help other researchers make better decisions when using the drainmod s model and better understanding the accuracy of each input parameter and its impact on the model output was proceed in this regard kale 2011 performed the field evaluation of drainmod s for predicting soil and drainage water salinity under semi arid conditions and reviewed sensitivity analysis of the model performance on the dispersivity parameter of salinity input dispersivities were tested between 3 cm and 20 cm and the results showed that this parameter had very little effect on the model outputs also shuang en et al 2015 studied the global sensitivity analysis of parameters in drainmod s in order to efficiently select the optimized parameters and figure out how the parametric variation influences the simulation results the morris global qualitative sensitivity analysis was adopted to detect the sensitivity of the parameters simulated in drainmod s of soil salinity in the profile against six parameters namely lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d maximum depth of surface water sm the actual distance from the surface to impermeable layer im drainage coefficient dr and initial groundwater depth w the results showed that ksat has a remarkable influence on simulation followed by d sm dr while w and im have little influence nonlinear interactions among the parameters are different and ksat is the most sensitive parameter to guarantee the quality of the model simulation accuracies of on site measurement should be improved for the sensitive parameters and more emphasis should be put on the sensitive parameters during the modeling these results are shown in table 7 to analyze the aquacrop model sensitivity the degree of sensitivity classifies into three high medium and low levels so that if the model behavior responds to changes in parameter values is less than 0 3 ranges from 0 3 to 1 5 or is more than 1 5 then the parameter has low medium or high sensitivity respectively geerts et al 2009 table 8 presents the calculated sensitivity for several input parameters of the aquacrop model it indicates the aquacrop model is sensitive to normalized water productivity changes the time from the plant to vegetation aging the time to reach the maximum vegetation and the soil moisture content which is higher than the other parameters guo et al 2020 therefore these data should be measured more carefully otherwise a significant error occurs in the outcomes of the model simulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of the salt changes in the soil profiles during the growth period the amount of soil salinity in different depths of the soil for both nsg and ssg treatments simulated using drainmod s and aquacrop models as already mentioned the soil profile in the lysimeter was divided into three layers the root zone 0 to 30 cm the middle 30 to 40 cm and the sub layer 40 to 70 cm in each layer the changes of the salt concentration was simulated separately measured and estimated soil salinity values and the comparison among them in various depths for the nsg control treatment are presented in fig 2 in general the salinity simulated using both models are generally in agreement with the measured data due to the low salinity in the nsg control treatment the soil salinity did not change and was almost the same as initial concentration and only evapotranspiration changes make some fluctuations in their values the numerical values of the salt concentration in the root zone varied from 1 5 to about 2 ds m 1 m 1 and during the drainage period some fluctuations were occured the salinity in the depth of 30 to 40 cm and 40 to 70 cm reaches to its maximum amount 2 5 and 2 7 ds m 1 respectively in the middle zone after the mid season drainage both models underestimate the amount of salinity instead at the end of the period two models overestimate the salinity although drainmod s simulates the salt concentration better than aquacrop besides the same trend was observed for the bottom zone consequently there are significant differences among measured and estimated soil salinity values before and after the mid seasons drainage therefore both models cannot properly simulate soil salinity however both models successfully simulated the trend of soil salinity variations in three depths of the soil profile the measured and estimated soil salinity values and the comparison among them in various depths for the ssg treatment are presented in fig 3 due to the groundwater salinity in ssg treatment the values are significantly higher than the presented values in fig 2 at the beginning of the experiment the soil salinity in both nsg and ssg treatments was slightly difference however during the growth period the difference was extremely increased as shown in fig 3 after 40 days of the growth period and mid season drainage soil salinity rises significantly due to the lack of irrigation and water uptake by roots solutes dispersion mass flow and capillary rise play a key role in increasing the salinity finally at the end growth period the soil salinity noticeably decreases notice that it takes 45 days that intake salinity into the soil reaches a state of equilibrium with the soil matrix because of this one can see the marked changes in salinity in the middle and bottom zones there are many initial changes in this situation and two models are not able to simulate the days reaching the salt balance as shown in fig 3 different layers illustrated various salinity fluctuations in the root zone during the growth period except for the mid season the measured and simulated salinity values by both models have natural and smooth fluctuations fig 3 a in the middle layer after the mid season drainage particularly in the last ten days both models especially aquacrop performed a good simulation of soil salinity fluctuations fig 3b finally in the sub layer the salinity fluctuations were low and the values were near the initial concentration 20 ds m 1 in this layer both models overestimate the amount of salinity and it was slightly higher than the actual value after drainage and shortage of soil moisture aquacrop did not simulate salinity well while drainmod s resolved somewhat this defect 3 2 efficiency and accuracy of the models the results of statistical evaluation of two models for simulating soil concentration in soil profile for three different layers in nsg and ssg treatments are presented in table 9 and table 10 respectively the accuracy of both models is reliable for simulating salinity of the soil profile however there are some small quantitative errors that can be ignored due to the existence of different layers in the physical model and the variety of salinity concentrations in each layer the drainmod s and aquacrop models had high accuracy in simulating the salinity of soil and root zone profiles table 9 summarized the results of drainmod s and aquacrop evaluations for three different layers of nsg treatment using the five proposed statistics to evaluate model performance for the drainmod s and aquacrop models the maximum value of r 2 obtained in the root zone is 0 89 and 0 84 respectively indicating that both models particularly drainmod s perform good fit in simulating salinity in the root zone it should be noted that the flooded irrigation causes the uniformity and stability of the soil salinity in this layer in the middle layer the value of r 2 for drainmod s and aquacrop models decreased to 0 67 and 0 73 respectively indicating that aquacrop performs better than drainmod s in predicting the soil salinity in the middle layer the little error in this layer occured due to different salinity levels in the root zone and the sub layer comparing values of r 2 for aquacrop shows the ability of model for predicting salinity in the sub layer better than the one in the middle layer however the performance of drainmod s was not good for predicting the salinity of the sub layer drainmod s and aquacrop shows d 0 91 and d 0 93 respectively in the root zone accordingly the minimum value of d is 0 78 occurs in the bottom area using drainmod s the ranges show the consistency between d and r 2 the values of nrmse index were less than 10 in different layers for both models which indicate both models with relatively small error perform excellent in simulating salinity concentration additionally the rmse and mbe values proved this claim overall the calibrtion of drainmod s and aquacrop for simulating the salt concentration for all layers resulted in d with average values of 0 8 and 0 9 and in r 2 with average values of 0 7 and 0 8 respectively these calibrtion performance statistics are comparable to the findings of kale 2011 davoodi et al 2019 xu et al 2019 masasi et al 2020 with the same average values for d and r 2 and compatible values for rmse and nrmse on the other hand the calibrtion of drainmod for simulating the salt concentration for all layers resulted in mbe with average value of 0 02 ds m 1 which is better than wahba et al 2002 findings who achieved the value of 0 22 ds m 1 moreover drainmod s for simulating the salt concentration for all layers resulted in mbe with average value of 0 2 ds m 1 which is better than hassanli et al 2016 findings who achieved the value of 0 12 ds m 1 this shows the high ability of drainmod s and aquacrop model to simulate the shallow groundwater and saline conditions for rice cultivation in the presence of hardpan table 10 summarized the results of the statistical evaluations of both models for simulating salt concentration in ssg soil profile in three different layers because in ssg treatment 20 ds m 1 saline water was injected in the sub layer and the sub layer was completely saturated with it the salinity fluctuation in this layer was very low and the best simulation fitness was occurred the values of r 2 d and nrmse showed an acceptable simulation by drainmod s model however as a general remark in each layer where the rate of salinity changes both models simulate salinity with less accuracy based on the r 2 and d index the best simulation by drainmod s model in the sub layer was 0 96 and 0 95 respectively a very good simulation of the model is quite evident based on the nrmse index since its values in all three layers were less than 5 the outcomes are consistent with other studies darzi et al 2007 yang 2008 feng et al 2018 davoodi et al 2019 singh 2019 ebrahimian and laiaghat 2008 compared to the drainmod s model the process of changing evaluation parameters and its value using the aquacrop model provides similar results the only difference occured in the index d where the best simulation was in the root zone it indicates that the aquacrop model in showing high salinity is weak the best values of nrmse and rmse were obtained with 1 82 and 0 09 ds m 1 respectively in the middle and root zone regions respectively it shows that the aquacrop model can establish a good link between the two considered treatments the results presented in table 10 for the aquacrop model are consistent with the results of vanuytrecht et al 2014 xu et al 2019 kumar et al 2014 zabihi et al 2017 adeboye et al 2017 3 3 summarize the results in this research the accurate data over three months of cultivation in a physical model lysimeter were obtained then the aquacrop and drainmod s models were calibrated and evaluated for the arid and semi arid climate of iran the results of evaluation criteria showed that both models were calibrated well which are able to simulate the movement of water and salt in the root zone and soil profile it should be noted that more data are needed to validate the models our main attempt was to investigate the ability of these two models for simulation of salt concentration in the soil profiles for such a specific area according to several statistical indicators both models showed a good performance for the project purposes however in areas where less input data is available the aquacrop model is recommended because it produces high and accurate outputs with less input the purpose of physical model was to find better understanding of the subject and also to evaluate the ability of these two models by collecting accurate measured data which this study was successful in this goal according to the results both drainmod s and aquacrop models are proper for the long term simulation and planning water table and soil management in paddy fields with similar conditions of this research it is necessary to say that it is the first test in a pilot fashion and then generalized to the rice field 4 conclusion the models that can simulate soil salinity in different irrigation management and various conditions in the presence of crop will be very beneficial in terms of time and cost in this study the latest version of drainmod s and aquacrop were used to simulate the soil salinity the goal of this study was to provide utilities to assist farmers and managers in choosing the optimal irrigation management in various worldwide agricultural systems in the case of accurate calibration and high accuracy data entry these models can be easily applied in similar climates to simulate the salinity of soil profile and rice yield in different irrigation management the results of the physical model showed that in the presence of shallow and saline groundwater such as the region in the north of iran there is a possibility for rice cultivation and the drainmod s and aquacrop models confirmed this by checking the level fluctuations and salinity profiles in the soil therefore the results of this study can be useful for researchers around the world because both laboratory work and accurate data collection have been done and two very important models have been compared and evaluated as a conclusion of this research it can be said that these calibrated models can be used for climatic conditions and paddy fields of iran since no such study has been done so far based on the results of this study field management strategies can be presented for the future therefore with the help of drainmod s and calibrated aquacrop models various management scenarios such as primary land leaching water table control and alternative irrigation can be applied to save water consumption in the agricultural sector and the use of unconventional soil and water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
4527,soil salinity in the coastal areas of mazandaran province in the north of iran is a big problem that threats the cultivation of rice which is the major crop in this region in this study the latest version of drainmod s and aquacrop models were used to simulate the salt concentration in the soil profile of paddy field with shallow and saline groundwater this research was carried out in a physical model located at the meteorological research center of agricultural and natural resources campus of university of tehran in 2018 the physical model was divided into two boxes each with dimension of 1 1 1 9 m by an isolated sheet one box was conditioned with shallow and saline groundwater as ssg treatment and another box with shallow and nonsaline groundwater as a control treatment nsg the concentration of saline groundwater was considered to be 20 ds m 1 equal to the salinity of groundwater in agricultural lands of the coastal zone of the caspian sea both boxes were irrigated with tap water with a salinity of 0 94 ds m 1 after evaluating the models for simulation of salinity in the soil profile of nsg treatment the best values of mbe rmse nrmse d and r2 were 0 02 ds m 1 0 07 ds m 1 2 85 0 91 and 0 89 for drainmod s model and zero 0 05 ds m 1 2 11 0 93 and 0 84 for aquacrop models the results indicate a fairly good correlation between the observed and simulated data also the parameters of mbe rmse nrmse d and r2 were calculated to evaluate the performance of the model in estimating salt concentration changes in three depths of soil the best values for these parameters in the ssg treatment were 0 04 ds m 1 0 10 ds m 1 1 95 0 95 and 0 96 for drainmod s and 0 01 ds m 1 0 09 ds m 1 1 82 0 96 and 0 93 for aquacrop respectively in general comparing the measured and simulated soil salinity illustrated that drainmod s and aquacrop could be used as a useful tools to predict and simulate the soil salinity changes trend also the accuracy and performance of drainmod s in higher salinity levels was more than the ones of aquacrop because drainmod s model is a more specific model for salinity issues keywords paddy fields drainmod s saline and shallow aquacrop groundwater salinity profile 1 introduction food security as a global concern is impossible without water and agriculture willer and lernoud 2019 fadul et al 2020 yin et al 2021 increasing population and the need for more food have pushed water resources to produce crops rice is one of the most popular plants grown in the world that accounts for about 80 of food consumption for half of the world s population carracelas et al 2019 which is planted in almost 113 countries because of its flexibility in different natural conditions faostat 2018 second to wheat rice production has the largest cultivated area over the world gill et al 2014 murumkar et al 2014 pourgholam amiji et al 2020 however rice production is being affected by climate change and subsequently water scarcity pan et al 2017 accordingly more research is needed for this key plant especially in areas prone to saline soil and water in different parts of the world in coastal areas underground water is considered the most dominant source of water supply for agriculture industry and even drinking in these sections nonsaline water resources are susceptible to be affected by saline waters and this issue has always caused various concerns in these areas lampayan et al 2015 jiao et al 2017 typically interaction and penetration of saline water to coastal aquifers occur due to the drop in groundwater level the prospect of lateral or vertical transfer of saline water plays a significant role in the reduction of underground water quality chen and jiao 2014 rice cultivation has been common in the northern regions of iran for many years especially in coastal areas the economy and income of the people in this region depend on rice cultivation and this strategic product plays a key role in people s lives adequate water and heavy and fertile soil are abundant in these areas it has been reported that out of 892 213 ha of the paddy lands in iran 68 4 are located in three northern provinces of mazandaran guilan and golestan which are adjacent to the caspian coastal areas ahmadi et al 2021 due to the proximity of these areas to the sea they have shallow and saline groundwater which is a threat to rice cultivation also due to the high salinity of the caspian sea about 25 ds m 1 the adjacent lands near the sea are not cultivated and it is necessary to investigate the feasibility of rice cultivation in these areas soil salinity and subsequent reduction of crop yields require different management practices this study aims to narrow down the knowledge gap on the potential effects of changes in salt concentration due to the interaction of nonsaline and saline water in coastal paddy lands therefore this research was conducted to investigate the salt profile in the soil under saline and shallow groundwater and pond irrigation with nonsaline water conditions proper management of water soil and vegetation systems cause novel achievements in sustainable agriculture using non conventional soil and water resources xu et al 2019 willer and lernoud 2019 pourgholam amiji et al 2020 yin et al 2021 effectively performing various field tests support in making the right decision since field measurements are highly cost and time consuming the capabilities of different models can be employed to solve the existing problems and different management scenarios however the cultivation and production in the presence of salinity require a variety of measurements calculations such as the prediction of salinity changes in the soil which is possible by using models in addition to aforementioned objectives the purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of drainmod s and aquacrop models to simulate the salt concentration in the soil profile the reason for using both models at the same time is that the drainmod s model has been developed for areas with shallow and saline groundwater conditions and uses the water balance for water movement in the soil however aquacrop model uses the richards equation for water movement in the soil these models are more user friendly compared with the other models of water and solute movement in the soil compared to hydrus saltmed swap etc drainmod s model which was developed for areas with shallow and saline water levels has been rarely used in arid and semi arid regions and research on salt movement using aquacrop is very limited also such a study that uses these two models to simulate the movement of water and salt in rice cultivation conditions has not been performed yet in recent years various models have been used to study irrigation management and stress effects at the farm level abdul ganiyu et al 2018 singh 2019 masasi et al 2020 lisenbee et al 2020 the new version of aquacrop is among the models that simulate the product yield under different moisture stresses and soil profile salinity fao 2017 paredes and torres 2017 zabihi et al 2017 evaluated the effect of drought stress on the yield water use efficiency and salinity of the rice root zone using aquacrop they confirmed the optimal result of this model hassanli et al 2016 have also applied aquacrop to estimate corn yield the results indicated that the relative error of aquacrop varied from 2 9 to 30 8 for estimation of yield product and confirmed the reasonable performance of this model in evaluating soil salinity araya et al 2016 estimated the effect of different climates planting dates and soil types on yield using aquacrop and concluded that this model has a high ability in the estimation of water productivity and the optimal amount of irrigation also under different scenarios this model is capable of simulating the product yield plant water requirement and water use efficiency under a variety of conditions including deficit irrigation pirmoradian and davatgar 2019 the consequences of various studies for wheat barley rice corn and sugar beet proved that aquacrop simulation model can be used to determine the effect of deficit irrigation for different conditions on yield as an effective mean for improving water management in the field and increase water productivity heng et al 2009 tavakoli et al 2015 farahani et al 2009 abdul ganiyu et al 2018 however due to the novelty of the soil salinity simulation in the new version of the aquacrop model few researches have been done using this model to study soil salinity changes in the world altough similar studies are for other crops but for specific rice cultivation conditions limited number of studies and results are available the drainmod model has been developed by skaggs 1978 for simulation of the soil profile salinity salt and water movement in the soil water table fluctuations in areas with drains in this model the infiltration rate into the soil is based on the green ampt equation zareabyaneh et al 2011 lisenbee et al 2020 drainmod s and aquacrop models have also been used for a wide range of plants paredes and torres 2017 zabihi et al 2017 abdul ganiyu et al 2018 pirmoradian and davatgar 2019 davoodi et al 2019 xu et al 2019 lisenbee et al 2020 guo et al 2020 but has been less used in shallow and saline water table specifically for rice also the ultimate goal of this study is to suggest one of these two models due to the high accuracy of the simulation and fewer inputs data that such a study has not been done so far therefore the first goal is to investigate the ability to simulate soil salinity fluctuations in conditions with saline and shallow water table with rice cultivation and the second goal is to select a superior model with respect to simpler and fewer inputs drainmod has been tested and evaluated for a wide range of soils plants and climatic conditions compared to richards s one dimensional equation the results generally showed that drainmod can be used to predict the water table level fluctuations skaggs et al 2012 sinai and jain 2006 darzi et al 2007 used drainmod to evaluate the performance of a drainage system for a long time and to predict the depth of water table drainage outflow surface runoff evapotranspiration water losses infiltration rate and the number of wet and dry days in a paddy field similar studies have been reported by yang 2008 youssef et al 2018 davoodi et al 2019 singh 2019 and lisenbee et al 2020 the results of these studies indicated the high capability of drainmod model in simulating the movement of water and salts in the soil wahba 2017 has evaluated the drainmod s water management model for simulating a different strategy for drainage water for irrigation for 20 years and recommended the model for long term simulation of various water management strategies consist of saline water nonsaline water and mixed case drainmod s can be used to study the long term effect of the drainage system on groundwater depth drainage outflow and soil salinity for various soil types and different climates youssef et al 2006 kale 2011 applied the drainmod s model to simulate the impact of water management and drainage system design criteria on the high yielding winter wheat and maize crop in turkey during three years of cultivation and examined the validity of the model the comparison between the observed and simulated values showed acceptable agreement so that the magnitude of the standard deviation for the water table and soil salinity parameters were calculated to be 49 9 56 9 cm and 0 51 0 96 d s m 1 respectively moreover feng et al 2018 examined drainmod s for laizhou bay in china during the two growing seasons the results showed a good match between simulated and measured water table fluctuations and soil salinity with a coefficient of determination r 2 higher than 0 75 and mean bias error mse less than 10 ebrahimian and laiaghat 2008 evaluated drainmod in the rice lands of behshahr reported the performance of drainmod acceptable in this study the root means square error rmse coefficient of determination r 2 and coefficient of residual mass crm for the water table were obtained 16 7 0 86 and 0 1 respectively they also evaluated the performance of drainmod s and the root mean square error rmse and r 2 for soil profile salinity was estimated to be 14 6 and 0 91 ds m 1 respectively in general the results showed that drainmod s is an appropriate tool for long term simulation water table prediction and soil profile salinity management this study aims to evaluate these claims by conducting laboratory research on a large lysimeter it is assumed due to the continous flood irrigation of paddy fields 3 7 cm depth of water on the soil surface the occurrence of a downward flow prevents upward flow from the saline groundwater to the soil surface it seems that this can partly control the salinity of groundwater also an impermeable sublayer is formed at 30 cm depth due to puddling practices in the paddy fields preventing upward movement of saline groundwater for this porpuse long term soil salinity was examined using drainmod s and aquacrop models to evaluate such hypothesis the novelty of this work is that the drainmod s and aquacrop models have been rarely used for specific conditions of paddy lands also studies related to the soil salinity variations using aquacrop model are limited 2 materials and methods 2 1 site characteristics the experiment was conducted at the climate research center of agricultural and natural resources campus of the university of tehran 35 55 n 50 54 e with elevation of 1293 m above the sea level in alborz province karaj iran from 1 july to 23 october 2018 according to the long term statistics and data 1988 2018 the region has a mediterranean climate with a maximum and minimum monthly mean air temperature of 26 c and 1 c respectively the mean air temperature is 15 9 c with the minimum and maximum absolute values 17 c and 42 c respectively furthermore the mean annual precipitation in karaj is 247 8 mm pourgholam amiji et al 2019b table 1 shows the summary of meteorological data in the period of rice cultivation at the studied site official statistics by ministry of agriculture jihad 2014 show that the coastal areas in mazandran provice north of iran suffer from soil salinity the salt affected zones with an area of 30000 ha include 14 of the total land areas of this province groundwater in these coastal lands is salty and shallow 30 to 150 cm no crop has been cultivated on these land so far due to upward movement and salt accumulation in the root zone pourgholam amiji et al 2020 reported that the cultivation of rice in the salt affected soils is possible because of continuous flooding and downward flow movement and also due to the presence of a hardpan layer in depth of 30 cm from the soil surface preventing the upward flow and salt movement hardpan layer is created during tillage and puddling practices which is common in paddy fields pourgholam amiji et al 2019a 2 2 experimental data the chemical properties of the irrigation water were measured in water quality laboratory see table 2 the lysimeter l e n g t h w i d t h d e p t h 3 8 m 1 m 1 m was made of metal and plexiglas sheets the actual length of the lysimeter was 4 m but a 10 cm space at each side was left for controlling the water table and supplying saline groundwater fig 1 some ceramic cups were installed on the body of the lysimeter to get required soil solution samples the lysimeter was diveided by an insulation sheet into two plots salted and non salted plots fig 1 illustrates the details of the physical model the soil in the lysimeter was brought from a paddy fields in north of iran three lyers are distinguishable in the paddy fields top or puddling layer 0 30 cm in depth mid or hardpan layer 30 40 cm in depth and sublayer 40 70 cm in depth similarly these three layers were made in the lysimeter table 3 shows the physical properties of paddy soil including the percentage of clay silt and sand in different described layers the measurements and analyses for the soil texture class followed the standard method gee and or 2002 the soil was classified as mostly heavy in different layers which is appropriate for rice cultivation and water retention the field capacity and bulk density were measured using the pressure plate and the cylindrical steel ring method the soil profile characteristics were inputted into the soil component of drainmod for the simulation other requirements were calculated using retention curve retc version 1 1 table 4 shows the calculated parameters in the lysimeter two different treatments were considered for irrigation non saline water nsg 1 1 nonsaline shallow groundwater nsg and saline water ssg 2 2 saline shallow groundwater ssg both in the presence of shallow groundwater table in ssg the saline groundwater was applied in the sublayer through free space at the end of lysimeter the ec of saline water was equale to the ec of groundwater in agricultural lands of the coastal zone of the caspian sea 20 ds m 1 the salt concentration of the irrigation water was 0 94 ds m 1 d s m 1 then in the rice cultivating period which lasted about 90 days the mid season and the end season drainage was applied to the paddies 2 3 drainmod s model drainmod skaggs 1980 is based on the hydrological model of a field and watershed scale which can be used for predicting surface runoff soil water content and groundwater table as well as subsurface drainage discharge drainmod s kandil 1992 is the extended model of drainmod which its inputs is provided from water balance data obtained by drainmod using for the simulation of drainage water salinity movement and distribution in the soil profile in this study drainmod s version 6 1 was used to simulate the effects of both subsurface and conventional drainage on the groundwater table and soil salinity the model determines the average daily soil water fluctuation at the boundary among thin soil layers and calculating the water balance for each soil layer the soil water was regarded as a one dimension vertical movement in the unsaturated zone and two dimensions including vertical and lateral movements in the saturated zone the key input parameters of the drainmod s model are soil drainage irrigation and vegetation data and climatic daily precipitation maximum and minimum daily temperature or evapotranspiration potential latitude and thermal profile the precipitation and temperature values are required in the entire simulation period since the model uses hourly precipitation values the daily precipitation data should be converted to it using the weather forecast data model reference and daily evapotranspiration can be computed using the thornthwaite radiation based method by the model the most important soil properties using in the model are the moisture characteristic curve and water absorption coefficients for different layers of the soil furthermore the model requires some inputs for drainage system parameters including drainage depth drainage distance maximum surface storage depth drainage coefficient effective drainage radius and impermeable layer depth the key parameters for irrigation management are irrigation depth day and month of the first irrigation irrigation interval and probable depth of precipitation during the period of cultivation plant inputs include root depth planting and harvesting dates and information on drought stress and land management skaggs 1978 darzi et al 2007 skaggs et al 2012 sinai and jain 2006 singh et al 2006 zareabyaneh et al 2011 regarding the capillary rise and upward flow in the drainmod s model gardner 1958 analyzed the factors controlling steady evaporation from soils with shallow water tables by solving the governing equations for unsaturated upward water movement for soils with a given functional relationship between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and pressure head k k h gardner presented simplified expressions for the maximum evaporation rate in terms of water table depth and the conductivity function parameters for steady unsaturated flow the upward flux is constant everywhere and capillary rise occurs from the water table to the upper soil layers the intensity of this transfer depends on the depth of water table and soil texture therefore upward flux depends on unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which is usually estimated from the saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water characteristics it is the most uncertain of the soil property inputs and is often adjusted during calibration skaggs et al 2012 also in previous studies it has been mentioned that the drainmod s model has been able to have a good simulation of capillary rise skaggs 1985 drainmod s is generally used in wet areas where the water table is located at a small depth of the ground surface this model operates based on the calculation of the water balance equation water balance in this model is classified as two categories in the surface balance the model can be applied to compute the permeability runoff and surface storage using the following equation eq 1 1 p f δ s r 0 where p is precipitation cm f is the infiltration rate cm δ s is the change in volume of water stored on the surface cm and r 0 is the surface runoff cm in the subsurface balance as the second class drainmod s calculates the water balance for a thin section of the soil in the middle of two drains according to the following equation eq 2 2 δ v a d e t d s f where δ v a is the change in the water free pore space or air volume cm d is the drainage depth cm and d is depth of provided water by underground irrigation cm et is evapotranspiration cm d s is deep seepage cm and f is cumulative infiltration cm soil tillage and preparation of the upper layer of soil were carried out in a depth of 20 cm and the seeds of rice early tarom type were planted the transplanted seedlings transferred to the lysimeter the amount of rice fertilized for growth proportional to the conventional method in rice fields was applied with an n p k 3 3 nitrogen phosphorus potassium ratio of 15 10 10 m 2 other input information is presented in table 5 2 4 aquacrop model aquacrop is a water driven crop model developing by the fao in this study a revised version of this organization s publication no 33 version 6 0 2017 was used to simulate the plant growth process and to estimate yield and salinity for simulating the yield of products the model separates the actual value of the evapotranspiration of the plant et a into the soil surface evaporation e a and transpiration t a this issue causes that the model considers the inefficient part of water denied as water losses in the crop production cycle doorenbos and kassam 1979 this separation is especially important when vegetation has not been completed yet zabihi et al 2017 the following equation was used based on the relative evapotranspiration and equation of water balance eq 3 3 y x y a y x k y et x et a et x where y x and y a are the maximum and actual product yields et x and et a are the maximum and actual value of evapotranspiration of plant respectively and k y is the relative coefficient of product reduction related to the amount of evaporation and transpiration reduction aquacrop simulates water flow in the soil based on the water balance equation which includes runoff infiltration re distribution or drainage processes deep infiltration capillary rise and evapotranspiration the salt movement in the soil is carried out both vertically and horizontally in vertical movement the model simulates the downward movement of the salt into the soil using drainage relations as well as upward movement due to the capillary for the horizontal movement of the salt in the soil the model uses water distribution relations steduto et al 2009 in manual of aquacrop model reported which water drains from the system to the subsoil and the groundwater table through the lower boundary if the groundwater table is shallow water can move upward to the upper soil layers by capillary rise thus the capillary rise will be smaller if the soil water content in the root zone is at or above field capacity no driving force or close to the wilting point hydraulic conductivity too small to move water upwards but when the water content in the root zone or the water table is high water and salts move through the soil pores as a capillary rise to the upper soil layers overall the aquacrop model is based on the convection diffusion equation cde for upward flux raes and steduto 2018 one of the advantages of drainmod s and aquacrop models is that they took these assumptions into account and recorded simulations of the vertical and horizontal movement of water and salts very well in both irrigation and non irrigation mid and end season drainage periods for each simulation period aquacrop requires four groups of data as the key inputs including climatic vegetation soil and field management data the climate data includes daily evapotranspiration of reference plant minimum and maximum daily temperature related to maximum and minimum daily humidity daily precipitation wind speed sunny hours and the annual mean of c o 2 concentration as mentioned before the required statistical data were colledted from the meteorological station of karaj from 1 july 2018 to 23 october 2018 by connecting the et 0 calculator software to aquacrop the reference evapotranspiration et 0 during the rice growth using the penman monteith method was calculated allen et al 1998 aquacrop uses as default the data obtained from mauna loa observatory hawaii for required annual c o 2 concentration furthermore daily precipitation values during the rice growing season were inputted to the model moreover the soil data including saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat volumetric moisture content at the saturation point θ sat field capacity θ fc permanent wilting point θ pwp and electrical conductivity ec should be inputted to the model the inputs related to the vegetation data have two different types some of them are constant and the others are variable and non stable there are default and fixed plant parameter values for most of the crops in the model these parameters are either constant over time or dependence geographical positions on the model calibrates them to optimal and unconstrained conditions using plant growth data moreover all parameters related to the location and specific parameters of the plant such as maximum root depth plant density planting time and irrigation management are classified in the group of user specific parameters non stable which should be correctly entered into the model hassanli et al 2016 in this research the soil salinity was simulated during the growing season of rice finally farm management data are divided into two main sections farm management and its fertility and irrigation management data the fertility of the farm was considered without any restriction irrigation management data includes irrigation methods and irrigation water quantity and quality during the growing season in this study the basin or flooding system was used as irrigation method 2 5 model evaluation the performance evaluation of both models was based on the accuracy of both models in simulating observed data there is no single statistic to robust a model yang et al 2014 as a result a combination of several statistics was used to evaluate model performance in this study coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse mean bias error mbe and willmott index of agreement d willmott 1981 were used for evaluating performance of the drainmod s and aquacrop models values of r 2 and d close to unity larger than 0 5 and 0 65 respectively indicate an acceptable model performance tan et al 2018 rmse and mbe values near zero demonstrate a good match between simulated and measured data furthermore based on categorized ranges for nrmse if the value is less than 30 then the model performance is fair and acceptable such that the best value is zero these ranges have been confirmed in the studies of bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 and masasi et al 2020 accordingly these indices are calculated by the following formula eqs 4 8 4 r 2 1 i 1 n o i o p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 5 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 1 2 6 nrmse rmse o 100 7 mbe i 1 n p i o i n 8 d 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 consider that o i and p i are the measured and the predicted amounts o and p are the average of measured and predicted values at total n number of observations and predicted data respectively 2 6 calibration to obtain the optimal agreement between the predicted and observed system variables the input parameters of both models were calibrated 2 6 1 drainmod s calibration the crop parameters used for the calibration include salt concentration variation in the soil profile the test site location related data water and soil resources drainage system and plant parameters see table 5 as shown in table 5 there are two different calibrated coefficients the thickness of the vertical layer and the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the soil interpreted as a fraction 0 1 of hydraulic conductivity in the upper layer of soil since these coefficients were not calculated in the research they calibrated according to the soil type and lysimeter condition calibrated parameters and their ranges were manually adjusted to minimize the differences between the predicted and observed values by comparing them visually and statistically based on sensitivity and analyses previously conducted for the drainmod s model and values reported in the literature consequently the calibration parameters were in a certain range and the simulation was acceptable 2 6 2 aquacrop calibration the measured parameters required for the calibration using aquacrop includes collected climatic crop and soil data when full sets of measured daily weather data used the accuracy of model calibration improves because of the aquacrop model flexibility the user can tune the calibrated coefficients to improve the results notice that the calibrated coefficients consisting in the form factor water stress function water depletion factor for controlling the closure of the stomata and the beginning of the vegetation aging planting time to the maximum growth of canopy penciling and start aging vegetation should be highly accurate abdul ganiyu et al 2018 after changing the constant coefficients until obtaining the desired results the coefficients recorded as calibrated values see table 6 2 7 sensitivity analysis of drainmod s and aquacrop model in this section the sensitivity analysis of parameters involved in the simulations to help other researchers make better decisions when using the drainmod s model and better understanding the accuracy of each input parameter and its impact on the model output was proceed in this regard kale 2011 performed the field evaluation of drainmod s for predicting soil and drainage water salinity under semi arid conditions and reviewed sensitivity analysis of the model performance on the dispersivity parameter of salinity input dispersivities were tested between 3 cm and 20 cm and the results showed that this parameter had very little effect on the model outputs also shuang en et al 2015 studied the global sensitivity analysis of parameters in drainmod s in order to efficiently select the optimized parameters and figure out how the parametric variation influences the simulation results the morris global qualitative sensitivity analysis was adopted to detect the sensitivity of the parameters simulated in drainmod s of soil salinity in the profile against six parameters namely lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient d maximum depth of surface water sm the actual distance from the surface to impermeable layer im drainage coefficient dr and initial groundwater depth w the results showed that ksat has a remarkable influence on simulation followed by d sm dr while w and im have little influence nonlinear interactions among the parameters are different and ksat is the most sensitive parameter to guarantee the quality of the model simulation accuracies of on site measurement should be improved for the sensitive parameters and more emphasis should be put on the sensitive parameters during the modeling these results are shown in table 7 to analyze the aquacrop model sensitivity the degree of sensitivity classifies into three high medium and low levels so that if the model behavior responds to changes in parameter values is less than 0 3 ranges from 0 3 to 1 5 or is more than 1 5 then the parameter has low medium or high sensitivity respectively geerts et al 2009 table 8 presents the calculated sensitivity for several input parameters of the aquacrop model it indicates the aquacrop model is sensitive to normalized water productivity changes the time from the plant to vegetation aging the time to reach the maximum vegetation and the soil moisture content which is higher than the other parameters guo et al 2020 therefore these data should be measured more carefully otherwise a significant error occurs in the outcomes of the model simulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of the salt changes in the soil profiles during the growth period the amount of soil salinity in different depths of the soil for both nsg and ssg treatments simulated using drainmod s and aquacrop models as already mentioned the soil profile in the lysimeter was divided into three layers the root zone 0 to 30 cm the middle 30 to 40 cm and the sub layer 40 to 70 cm in each layer the changes of the salt concentration was simulated separately measured and estimated soil salinity values and the comparison among them in various depths for the nsg control treatment are presented in fig 2 in general the salinity simulated using both models are generally in agreement with the measured data due to the low salinity in the nsg control treatment the soil salinity did not change and was almost the same as initial concentration and only evapotranspiration changes make some fluctuations in their values the numerical values of the salt concentration in the root zone varied from 1 5 to about 2 ds m 1 m 1 and during the drainage period some fluctuations were occured the salinity in the depth of 30 to 40 cm and 40 to 70 cm reaches to its maximum amount 2 5 and 2 7 ds m 1 respectively in the middle zone after the mid season drainage both models underestimate the amount of salinity instead at the end of the period two models overestimate the salinity although drainmod s simulates the salt concentration better than aquacrop besides the same trend was observed for the bottom zone consequently there are significant differences among measured and estimated soil salinity values before and after the mid seasons drainage therefore both models cannot properly simulate soil salinity however both models successfully simulated the trend of soil salinity variations in three depths of the soil profile the measured and estimated soil salinity values and the comparison among them in various depths for the ssg treatment are presented in fig 3 due to the groundwater salinity in ssg treatment the values are significantly higher than the presented values in fig 2 at the beginning of the experiment the soil salinity in both nsg and ssg treatments was slightly difference however during the growth period the difference was extremely increased as shown in fig 3 after 40 days of the growth period and mid season drainage soil salinity rises significantly due to the lack of irrigation and water uptake by roots solutes dispersion mass flow and capillary rise play a key role in increasing the salinity finally at the end growth period the soil salinity noticeably decreases notice that it takes 45 days that intake salinity into the soil reaches a state of equilibrium with the soil matrix because of this one can see the marked changes in salinity in the middle and bottom zones there are many initial changes in this situation and two models are not able to simulate the days reaching the salt balance as shown in fig 3 different layers illustrated various salinity fluctuations in the root zone during the growth period except for the mid season the measured and simulated salinity values by both models have natural and smooth fluctuations fig 3 a in the middle layer after the mid season drainage particularly in the last ten days both models especially aquacrop performed a good simulation of soil salinity fluctuations fig 3b finally in the sub layer the salinity fluctuations were low and the values were near the initial concentration 20 ds m 1 in this layer both models overestimate the amount of salinity and it was slightly higher than the actual value after drainage and shortage of soil moisture aquacrop did not simulate salinity well while drainmod s resolved somewhat this defect 3 2 efficiency and accuracy of the models the results of statistical evaluation of two models for simulating soil concentration in soil profile for three different layers in nsg and ssg treatments are presented in table 9 and table 10 respectively the accuracy of both models is reliable for simulating salinity of the soil profile however there are some small quantitative errors that can be ignored due to the existence of different layers in the physical model and the variety of salinity concentrations in each layer the drainmod s and aquacrop models had high accuracy in simulating the salinity of soil and root zone profiles table 9 summarized the results of drainmod s and aquacrop evaluations for three different layers of nsg treatment using the five proposed statistics to evaluate model performance for the drainmod s and aquacrop models the maximum value of r 2 obtained in the root zone is 0 89 and 0 84 respectively indicating that both models particularly drainmod s perform good fit in simulating salinity in the root zone it should be noted that the flooded irrigation causes the uniformity and stability of the soil salinity in this layer in the middle layer the value of r 2 for drainmod s and aquacrop models decreased to 0 67 and 0 73 respectively indicating that aquacrop performs better than drainmod s in predicting the soil salinity in the middle layer the little error in this layer occured due to different salinity levels in the root zone and the sub layer comparing values of r 2 for aquacrop shows the ability of model for predicting salinity in the sub layer better than the one in the middle layer however the performance of drainmod s was not good for predicting the salinity of the sub layer drainmod s and aquacrop shows d 0 91 and d 0 93 respectively in the root zone accordingly the minimum value of d is 0 78 occurs in the bottom area using drainmod s the ranges show the consistency between d and r 2 the values of nrmse index were less than 10 in different layers for both models which indicate both models with relatively small error perform excellent in simulating salinity concentration additionally the rmse and mbe values proved this claim overall the calibrtion of drainmod s and aquacrop for simulating the salt concentration for all layers resulted in d with average values of 0 8 and 0 9 and in r 2 with average values of 0 7 and 0 8 respectively these calibrtion performance statistics are comparable to the findings of kale 2011 davoodi et al 2019 xu et al 2019 masasi et al 2020 with the same average values for d and r 2 and compatible values for rmse and nrmse on the other hand the calibrtion of drainmod for simulating the salt concentration for all layers resulted in mbe with average value of 0 02 ds m 1 which is better than wahba et al 2002 findings who achieved the value of 0 22 ds m 1 moreover drainmod s for simulating the salt concentration for all layers resulted in mbe with average value of 0 2 ds m 1 which is better than hassanli et al 2016 findings who achieved the value of 0 12 ds m 1 this shows the high ability of drainmod s and aquacrop model to simulate the shallow groundwater and saline conditions for rice cultivation in the presence of hardpan table 10 summarized the results of the statistical evaluations of both models for simulating salt concentration in ssg soil profile in three different layers because in ssg treatment 20 ds m 1 saline water was injected in the sub layer and the sub layer was completely saturated with it the salinity fluctuation in this layer was very low and the best simulation fitness was occurred the values of r 2 d and nrmse showed an acceptable simulation by drainmod s model however as a general remark in each layer where the rate of salinity changes both models simulate salinity with less accuracy based on the r 2 and d index the best simulation by drainmod s model in the sub layer was 0 96 and 0 95 respectively a very good simulation of the model is quite evident based on the nrmse index since its values in all three layers were less than 5 the outcomes are consistent with other studies darzi et al 2007 yang 2008 feng et al 2018 davoodi et al 2019 singh 2019 ebrahimian and laiaghat 2008 compared to the drainmod s model the process of changing evaluation parameters and its value using the aquacrop model provides similar results the only difference occured in the index d where the best simulation was in the root zone it indicates that the aquacrop model in showing high salinity is weak the best values of nrmse and rmse were obtained with 1 82 and 0 09 ds m 1 respectively in the middle and root zone regions respectively it shows that the aquacrop model can establish a good link between the two considered treatments the results presented in table 10 for the aquacrop model are consistent with the results of vanuytrecht et al 2014 xu et al 2019 kumar et al 2014 zabihi et al 2017 adeboye et al 2017 3 3 summarize the results in this research the accurate data over three months of cultivation in a physical model lysimeter were obtained then the aquacrop and drainmod s models were calibrated and evaluated for the arid and semi arid climate of iran the results of evaluation criteria showed that both models were calibrated well which are able to simulate the movement of water and salt in the root zone and soil profile it should be noted that more data are needed to validate the models our main attempt was to investigate the ability of these two models for simulation of salt concentration in the soil profiles for such a specific area according to several statistical indicators both models showed a good performance for the project purposes however in areas where less input data is available the aquacrop model is recommended because it produces high and accurate outputs with less input the purpose of physical model was to find better understanding of the subject and also to evaluate the ability of these two models by collecting accurate measured data which this study was successful in this goal according to the results both drainmod s and aquacrop models are proper for the long term simulation and planning water table and soil management in paddy fields with similar conditions of this research it is necessary to say that it is the first test in a pilot fashion and then generalized to the rice field 4 conclusion the models that can simulate soil salinity in different irrigation management and various conditions in the presence of crop will be very beneficial in terms of time and cost in this study the latest version of drainmod s and aquacrop were used to simulate the soil salinity the goal of this study was to provide utilities to assist farmers and managers in choosing the optimal irrigation management in various worldwide agricultural systems in the case of accurate calibration and high accuracy data entry these models can be easily applied in similar climates to simulate the salinity of soil profile and rice yield in different irrigation management the results of the physical model showed that in the presence of shallow and saline groundwater such as the region in the north of iran there is a possibility for rice cultivation and the drainmod s and aquacrop models confirmed this by checking the level fluctuations and salinity profiles in the soil therefore the results of this study can be useful for researchers around the world because both laboratory work and accurate data collection have been done and two very important models have been compared and evaluated as a conclusion of this research it can be said that these calibrated models can be used for climatic conditions and paddy fields of iran since no such study has been done so far based on the results of this study field management strategies can be presented for the future therefore with the help of drainmod s and calibrated aquacrop models various management scenarios such as primary land leaching water table control and alternative irrigation can be applied to save water consumption in the agricultural sector and the use of unconventional soil and water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
4528,river systems are major sources of greenhouse gases ghg however simultaneous co2 and ch4 emissions from arid semiarid rivers remain poorly studied here we investigated co2 and ch4 emissions diffusion ebullition and their potential sources and drivers in an arid semiarid catchment on the chinese loess plateau the river water co2 partial pressure pco2 averaged 885 415 µatm and did not show a significant change along the stream network due to strong carbonate buffering groundwater inputs played a dominant role in controlling pco2 which exhibited a pronounced seasonal variation in stream decomposition of organic matter mobilized by soil erosion was also an important contributor the streams were consistently oversaturated in ch4 ranging between 0 06 and 0 77 µmol l 1 both gas emissions exhibited significant seasonal variations which were collectively controlled by gas concentration gradient across the water air interface and flow dynamics the mean co2 and ch4 efflux were 55 mmol m 2 d 1 and 346 µmol m 2 d 1 respectively with the highest efflux in august high flow conditions for both gases river impoundment resulted in greatly reduced pco2 due to enhanced primary production but elevated ch4 concentrations because of anaerobic degradation of organic rich sediments reservoirs acted as a smaller co2 source but a stronger ch4 source than flowing rivers ebullition was an important pathway of ch4 emissions in both lotic and lentic ecosystems contributing 36 23 and 55 19 to the total ch4 emissions from rivers and reservoirs respectively urban wastewater discharges modified riverine carbon cycling and created local hotspots of ghg production and emissions which will be globally significant given the increasing human impacts worldwide our results reinforce the urgency to account for arid semiarid rivers in future ghg emission estimates future work to better understand the impacts of groundwater inflows and aquatic ecosystem processes in controlling ghg dynamics is also needed keywords greenhouse gas emissions carbon cycle arid semiarid rivers human impacts chinese loess plateau 1 introduction the role and importance of greenhouse gases ghg evasion from inland waters have now been well recognized in the global carbon c cycle amaral et al 2020 borges et al 2015 crawford et al 2016 raymond et al 2013 approximately 5 1 pg of terrestrial c is annually transported into inland waters drake et al 2018 where c is subject to burial in sediments or degassing into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 according to recent global estimates fluvial networks are outgassing co2 and ch4 at the rates of 1 8 pg c yr 1 raymond et al 2013 and 20 1 tg c yr 1 stanley et al 2016 respectively compared with downstream c export that has been well constrained however these vertical ghg flux estimates are likely to increase with more spatially resolved measurements and the relative importance of c emissions within landscape c budgets will also increase drake et al 2018 hence assessing global or regional c balance that neglects surface water c evasion may overestimate the significance of c uptake by terrestrial ecosystems borges et al 2019 butman et al 2016 ran et al 2018 the magnitude of riverine ghg degassing exhibits great spatial variability due to differences in hydraulic geometry hydrological connectivity and biological processes crawford et al 2014 duvert et al 2019 natchimuthu et al 2017 current emission fluxes are underestimated due to measurement paucity in arid semiarid river systems butman and raymond 2011 gómez gener et al 2015 previous research has mainly focused on temperate and boreal rivers where extensive flooded forests and wetlands within hydrologically connected landscapes fueled strong emissions amaral et al 2020 borges et al 2019 natchimuthu et al 2017 whereas until recently arid semiarid rivers were nearly uncharted with a few exceptions gómez gener et al 2015 ran et al 2017 consequently while temperate and boreal rivers have been widely recognized to be intense co2 and ch4 sources for the atmosphere there is still a lack of understanding of ghg emissions from arid semiarid rivers and their primary drivers it remains largely unclear to what extent co2 and ch4 emissions from these rivers are sustained by in stream production and or by lateral inputs from terrestrial ecosystems and groundwater a greater understanding of their ghg dynamics will be important to provide more accurate estimates of global c budgets river systems worldwide are being affected by human activity such as damming farming and urban wastewater discharge in contrast to running waters dammed rivers thus reservoirs have greatly reduced hydrodynamics and span long residence times which create a favourable condition for aquatic productivity potentially higher co2 fixation rates and lower emission rates crawford et al 2016 león palmero et al 2020 one might surmise that such lentic systems make only minor contributions to the overall c balance nevertheless several lines of evidence indicate that lentic systems are of paramount importance in contributing to the overall c efflux if the global warming potential of ch4 is considered stanley et al 2016 teodoru et al 2015 furthermore agriculture and urban wastewater are known to have substantial impacts on biogeochemical cycling jin et al 2018 marescaux et al 2018 yet it remains to be determined how these perturbations will change riverine ghg emissions the arid semiarid chinese loess plateau clp covering the middle yellow river fig 1 is well known for its high erosion intensity because of the erodible loess deposits ran et al 2017 large amounts of sediment derived c are exported into fluvial networks qu et al 2020 meanwhile numerous dams have been constructed as an effective soil conservation practice to control erosion and sustain agricultural production and urban development here we present the first integrated study to quantify the magnitude of co2 and ch4 emissions including diffusion and ebullition from a representative catchment on the clp and explore their potential drivers using spatially resolved measurements in the jing river catchment the objectives were to 1 explore the spatial and seasonal patterns of co2 and ch4 emissions at the catchment scale 2 examine environmental controls and human impacts on dissolved co2 and ch4 concentrations and emissions at the water air interface and 3 derive biogeochemical implications for inland water c balance 2 methods 2 1 study area the perennial jing river is located on the southern clp and flows nw se into the wei river the largest tributary of the yellow river fig 1 the river main channel is 455 km long with a drainage area of 45 420 km2 with an arid semiarid climate precipitation in the jing river catchment is low 450 mm yr 1 and presents distinct seasonal variations with 75 of the annual precipitation falling during the wet season from july to october xu et al 2015 owing to high permeability of loess stream flow is primarily derived from groundwater while episodic overland runoff generated by heavy storms might be predominant in the wet season mean annual flow for the jing river was 68 m3 s 1 during 1950 2010 while due to severe soil erosion across the catchment huang et al 2012 and a mean erosion rate of 8000 t km 2 yr 1 supplementary figure s1 the average sediment concentration was 141 000 mg l 1 during the same period the soil erosion rate has recently declined because of effective soil conservation such as damming and vegetation restoration the stream network shows a typical dendritic pattern and can be represented by five strahler orders fig 1 which were verified by ground truthing except the headwater region at the southwestern edge of the catchment that is characteristic of greycinnamonicsoils and covered with forest the remaining catchment is predominantly composed of steep hillslopes mantled by 50 80 m deep loess deposits zhang et al 2020 highly incised channels are extensively developed between the hillslopes human activities have a long history in this catchment that supports a population of 9 5 million cropland and degraded grassland account for 47 and 45 of the catchment respectively xu et al 2015 water pollution caused by agriculture and urban wastewater has become an increasingly important environmental concern 2 2 field measurements and laboratory analyses field sampling and in situ measurements were conducted at 39 stream sites and 5 reservoir sites in the jing river catchment fig 1 in august and october 2018 wet season and under high flow conditions and march and june 2019 dry season and under low flow conditions the august campaign had the highest flow rates while the march campaign showed the lowest supplementary figure s2 streams drain catchment areas ranging from 0 6 km2 to more than 40 000 km2 sampling locations were selected to account for the spatial variability of soil erosion intensity and major land cover types and to represent the full spectrum of the five strahler orders three of the 39 stream sites are situated immediately downstream of urban wastewater discharge in addition a groundwater spring was sampled to characterize the groundwater end member of co2 and ch4 concentrations fig 1 and supplementary figure s3 co2 emissions were determined using a 10 77 l floating chamber connected in a closed loop to a non dispersive infrared li 850 co2 analyzer licor lincoln ne usa although this technique has been criticized for its artificial turbulence recent comparative studies with other methods suggest that it is reliable under low wind conditions crawford et al 2013 rawitch et al 2020 all chamber deployments were made in replicate as 10 15 min measurements from a freely drifting boat campeau et al 2014 crawford et al 2013 further details of the chamber design and deployment are given in ran et al 2017 for ch4 emissions gas samples were collected by syringe through a butyl rubber stopper on the top of the chamber right after deploying it on the water surface gas sampling was conducted at 5 min intervals for 15 mins 4 samples in total for each chamber deployment and stored in pre evacuated 12 ml exetainer vials labco uk surface water pco2 was determined using the headspace equilibrium method borges et al 2019 ran et al 2017 briefly 400 ml of water was collected in a 630 ml conical flask with the remaining space filled with ambient air the flask was immediately closed with a lid and vigorously shaken for 2 mins to equilibrate the gases in water and air then pco2 of the equilibrated gas was measured with the calibrated li 850 gas analyzer repeatability on triplicates was better than 5 and the average was used to represent the instantaneous pco2 the original river water pco2 was calculated using the solubility constants for co2 and the headspace ratio and further corrected using the ph and alkalinity before and after equilibrium koschorreck et al 2020 müller et al 2015 similarly the equilibrated gas in a replicate experiment was injected into 12 ml exetainer vials to determine the dissolved ch4 at each sampling location 500 ml water was filtered through a 0 45 µm pre weighed whatman gf f filter paper by using a peristaltic pump to determine the total suspended solids tss tss was calculated by using the dry weight of the suspended solids that were dried for 24 h at 105 c in laboratory alkalinity was determined in the field by end point titration using 0 01 m hcl with an analytical precision of 3 dissolved inorganic carbon dic was calculated from the determined alkalinity ph and water temperature using the co2calc program robbins et al 2010 water samples were also collected and stored atrefrigeratortemperature 4 c for laboratory analysis within one week after sampling dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured using an elementar vario toc analyzer elementar germany triple doc injections indicated that the analytical error was 3 the water for chlorophyll a chl a was preserved with 1 ml of mgco3 solution 10 g l 1 and determined using a hitachi u 2550 uv vis spectrophotometer duplicate analysis suggested a precision of within 10 gas samples collected from the floating chamber and the headspace for ch4 were analyzed with a shimadzu gc 2030 gas chromatography gc fid ecd and the precision based on duplicate samples was 4 the gc system was calibrated using a standard gas 20 7 ppm basic water quality information such as ph temperature salinity dissolved oxygen do and total dissolved solids tds was collected using a portable multiparameter probe multi 3420 wtw gmbh germany both the ph and do probes were calibrated once every day during the field campaigns do probe was calibrated by using the saturated air technique and the ph probe by three ph buffers 4 01 7 00 and 10 01 manufacturer specifications show the accuracy of the ph do and tds probes as 0 01 units 0 01 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 respectively flow velocity and wind speed were determined with a global water flow probe fp111 precision 0 1 m s 1 and a kestrel 1000 handheld anemometer respectively 2 3 calculation of ghg effluxes the areal ghg efflux f at the water air interface i e f c o 2 mmol m 2 d 1 and f c h 4 µmol m 2 d 1 was determined from the slope of the linear regression of ghg concentrations against time r2 0 95 ran et al 2017 teodoru et al 2015 1 f d p g h g d t v r t s where d p g h g d t is the slope of co2 or ch4 change within the chamber v is the chamber volume l r is the gas constant t is chamber temperature k and s is the area of the chamber covering the water surface 0 099 m2 in this study the computed f c o 2 is assumed to be exclusively diffusive and the gas transfer velocity k cm h 1 for co2 k c o 2 can be readily calculated using the pco2 difference across the water air interface raymond et al 2012 for ch4 we used the approach of campeau et al 2014 to quantify the ebullitive component of the total fch4 measured in the floating chambers we first calculated the diffusive ch4 efflux f d c h 4 based on the measured gas transfer velocity for ch4 k c h 4 that can be calculated from k c o 2 as follows campeau et al 2014 2 k c h 4 k c o 2 s c c h 4 s c c o 2 n where sc is the schmidt number and n is assigned a value of 2 3 for wind speeds of 3 6 m s 1 or 1 2 for wind speeds of 3 6 m s 1 the diffusive ch4 flux was calculated according to paranaíba et al 2018 3 f d c h 4 k c h 4 c h 4 w c h 4 e q where c h 4 w is the ch4 concentration in water and c h 4 e q is the ch4 concentration in water in equilibrium with the local atmosphere the difference between f c h 4 and f d c h 4 was attributed to ebullition in addition to facilitate comparison of k c o 2 and k c h 4 across the catchment and with results from other studies here the k c o 2 and k c h 4 values were normalized to a schmidt number of 600 k 600 c o 2 and k 600 c h 4 cm h 1 jähne et al 1987 2 4 deviation of co2 dic and o2 from atmospheric saturation to explore the importance of carbonate buffering in controlling surface water pco2 we calculated the theoretical co2 dic and o2 concentrations at atmospheric equilibrium using water temperature henry s constants and atmospheric concentrations of gases and in the case of dic salinity and alkalinity crawford et al 2014 stets et al 2017 the molar deviations of the three gases between their in situ aqueous concentrations cw and the theoretical concentrations at atmospheric equilibrium ca were referred to as δco2 δdic and δo2 respectively saturated o2 concentration at atmospheric equilibrium o2a was calculated from temperature and barometric pressure by using the constants in garcia and gordon 1992 and δo2 was calculated as 4 δ o 2 o 2w o 2a where o2w is the measured molar concentration of dissolved o2 in surface waters the theoretical equilibrium co2 concentration co2a was calculated from atmospheric pco2 and the temperature dependence henry s constant kh stets et al 2017 5 co 2a k h pco 2 thus δco2 was then calculated 6 δ co 2 co 2w co 2a similarly δdic was calculated by determining the dic concentration at atmospheric equilibrium dica at a given temperature pressure and alkalinity as follows stets et al 2017 7 δ dic dic w dic a where dicw was calculated from measured ph alkalinity and water temperature both dicw and dica were calculated using the co2calc program robbins et al 2010 notably δdic and δco2 are nearly equivalent in low ph low alkalinity rivers whereas they diverge at higher alkalinity because of the dominance of hco3 and co3 2 in high alkalinity waters 2 5 statistical tests we performed all the statistical analysis including one way analysis of variance anova and mann whitneytests using spss v25 normality of the data was first examined using the kolmogorov smirnov test in addition a regression analysis was carried out to investigate the relationship between dissolved co2 and ch4 concentrations and environmental factors in all statistical tests a significance level of α 0 05 was considered to reject the null hypothesis 3 results 3 1 physical and biogeochemical characteristics the jing river catchment exhibited pronounced spatiotemporal variations in water quality table 1 and supplementary table s1 water temperature was highest in august 26 8 4 5 c and it was only 10 9 2 7 c in october and 11 5 3 7 c in march first order streams typically had the lowest temperature flow discharge in august 99 m3 s 1 and october 53 m3 s 1 was significantly higher than in march and june 19 and 25 m3 s 1 respectively supplementary figure s2 flow velocity varied from 0 05 to 1 77 m s 1 with higher velocities observed in high order streams and in august and october the mean flow velocity in august october march and june was 0 7 0 6 0 6 and 0 4 m s 1 respectively wind speed was generally low ranging from 0 1 to 3 2 m s 1 with 92 of the measurements below 2 m s 1 both streams and reservoirs showed high ph and alkalinity table 1 the ph in streams ranged from 7 87 to 9 32 and displayed a decreasing trend towards the mainstream the mean river water ph was 8 69 in comparison the ph in reservoirs was slightly higher and averaged at 8 77 the highest ph of 9 51 was observed in a reservoir in june 2019 likewise the alkalinity in streams and reservoirs varied from 1020 to 11 200 µmol l 1 over the four campaigns with only 3 measurements in august below 2000 µmol l 1 the mean alkalinity in streams and reservoirs averaged 4607 1499 and 4326 1733 µmol l 1 respectively the tds ranged from 219 to 15 500 mg l 1 with 55 of the values larger than 1000 mg l 1 and the tss composed primarily of sediment varied from 1 6 to 8600 mg l 1 table 1 while there were no discernable seasonal variations in tds the tss concentration in august was substantially higher than in the other sampling seasons as an important indicator in describing metabolism river water was saturated with do for 73 of all sampling sites across the stream network and over all four seasons n 154 the mean do in august october march and june was 243 334 313 and 255 µmol l 1 respectively in comparison reservoirs generally exhibited higher do concentrations this is particularly true in august in which do in reservoirs 286 µmol l 1 was on average 15 higher than that in streams chl a in streams was not measured in august and it varied from 0 5 to 19 6 μg l 1 with an average of 6 7 4 0 6 9 3 3 and 6 0 3 2 μg l 1 in october march and june respectively the chl a presented an increasing trend with increasing strahler order and the averaged chl a in the fifth order mainstream was 23 58 higher than that in the headwater streams compared with streams the reservoir water displayed significantly higher chl a mann whitney test p 0 005 table 1 in october and march when streamflow was more turbulent the chl a in reservoirs was 58 67 higher than that in streams 3 2 co2 and ch4 dynamics in rivers river water pco2 averaged 885 415 µatm and varied over the four campaigns table 2 and supplementary table s1 streams were supersaturated in co2 with respect to the overlying atmosphere for 92 of all measurements n 154 higher pco2 values were generally observed in the dry season when groundwater dominated river flow the averaged pco2 in march and june was 15 44 higher than that in august and october table 2 the highest pco2 3354 µatm was measured in june at a stream site 500 m downstream of a dam and pco2 at a site r2 in supplementary table s1 ph range 8 75 8 92 was below the atmospheric equilibrium over all four seasons 110 323 µatm when binned by strahler order pco2 in the first order streams was on average 14 higher than that in the downstream streams where pco2 remained largely stable at 890 µatm fig 2 a the co2 efflux was highest in august mean 102 116 mmol m 2 d 1 and it was significantly 1 3 times higher than in the other three seasons anova test p 0 05 table 2 and supplementary figure s4 the yearly average co2 efflux was 55 mmol m 2 d 1 the magnitude of co2 emissions varied considerably across the stream network fig 2a the mean co2 efflux decreased rapidly from 80 mmol m 2 d 1 in the first order streams to around 50 mmol m 2 d 1 in the second to fourth order streams but it increased to 61 mmol m 2 d 1 in the fifth order mainstream streams were consistently supersaturated in ch4 with the concentrations ranging from 0 06 to 0 77 µmol l 1 while the average ch4 concentration was comparable among the four seasons table 2 and supplementary figure s4 great spatial variations were observed in august and june as implied by the high standard deviations 0 14 and 0 10 µmol l 1 respectively the yearly averaged ch4 concentration 0 13 0 09 µmol l 1 was 43 times the atmospheric equilibrium in the study catchment 0 003 µmol l 1 although the ch4 concentration remained largely stable across strahler orders the first order streams typically showed the lowest on average fig 2b exceptionally high values i e 0 3 µmol l 1 were all observed at the 3 sites downstream of urban areas the diffusive ch4 effluxes spanned over three orders of magnitude ranging between 6 and 4749 µmol m 2 d 1 and presented a significant seasonal variation mann whitney test p 0 05 table 2 the seasonal average ch4 diffusion efflux was highest in august roughly 3 times higher than that in march ebullition of ch4 occurred at all sampling sites and the ebullitive ch4 effluxes range 2 1549 µmol m 2 d 1 also exhibited a significant seasonal variation mann whitney test p 0 05 table 2 ebullition contributed to 36 23 of the total ch4 efflux diffusion ebullition across all sites range 12 5186 µmol m 2 d 1 the total ch4 efflux showed an increasing trend across strahler orders fig 2b with the mean efflux from the first to fifth order streams at 245 218 318 527 340 379 262 196 and 313 174 µmol m 2 d 1 respectively river water doc varied from 14 1 to 644 µmol l 1 and displayed a significant seasonal variation mann whitney test p 0 05 table 2 it was highest in august 424 348 µmol l 1 and lowest in march 131 46 µmol l 1 consistent with temperature changes however the doc showed no detectable spatial variation along the stream network although it was slightly higher in the third and forth order streams for all sites across all four seasons linear regression analyses detected a weak positive relationship between doc and pco2 r2 0 03 p 0 05 n 154 and between doc and dissolved ch4 r2 0 07 p 0 005 n 149 dic ranged from 1029 to 11 215 µmol l 1 and it was typically 10 20 times higher than the concomitant doc table 2 the yearly average dic was 4361 1498 µmol l 1 in addition dic was up to 44 higher in the dry season than in the wet season like doc the dic concentration was spatially uniform across the stream network with 10 spatial variations among the 5 strahler orders and presented a weak positive correlation with pco2 r2 0 03 p 0 05 n 154 the river water pco2 was also positively related to tss export fig 3 pco2 responded rapidly to increasing tss concentration due to severe surface soil erosion it increased from the initial 400 500 µatm when tss was below 20 mg l 1 to 1200 µatm when tss reached 2000 mg l 1 fig 3a b and c however river water pco2 declined substantially to around 400 µatm when tss concentration exceeded 2000 mg l 1 which typically indicates the occurrence of deeper erosion processes e g gully erosion and mudslides as a result of heavy storms and high discharge yield fig 3d there was no statistic relationship between ch4 concentration and tss in all four seasons furthermore δo2 was significantly correlated with δco2 and δdic fig 4 both regression curves diverged greatly from the 1 1 line that represents in stream metabolism with an equal change in the co2 and o2 concentrations and the intercepts were considerably higher than 0 fig 4 3 3 co2 and ch4 dynamics in reservoirs reservoirs exhibited different co2 and ch4 dynamics table 3 and supplementary table s2 reservoir pco2 varied from 201 to 2732 µatm with 35 of the measurements below the atmospheric equilibrium n 20 the pco2 in the wet season 546 204 µatm was 67 lower than that in the dry season 911 817 µatm there were four high pco2 values 1000 µatm all of which were observed in march during the ice melting period or in june when reservoirs were at the lowest water level co2 efflux ranged from 43 2 to 244 3 mmol m 2 d 1 and averaged 21 58 mmol m 2 d 1 owing to the lower pco2 than the atmospheric equilibrium 35 of the co2 effluxes were negative the co2 efflux was typically higher in the dry season consistent with the pco2 changes table 3 dissolved ch4 varied from 0 07 to 0 81 µmol l 1 and the yearly average was 0 27 0 18 µmol l 1 twice as high as that in rivers the ch4 concentration was highest in june 0 46 0 23 µmol l 1 and lowest in march 0 14 0 06 µmol l 1 all reservoirs acted as methane sources with the efflux varying from 10 to 1336 µmol m 2 d 1 both the diffusive and ebullitive ch4 effluxes showed a pronounced seasonal pattern with the lowest rates in march anova test p 0 05 table 3 ebullition dominated ch4 emissions from reservoirs and played a greater role in june and august accounting for 72 15 and 59 14 of the total ch4 efflux respectively supplementary table s2 the ebullitive efflux on average accounted for 55 19 of the total ch4 efflux across all reservoir sites seasonal variability of reservoir doc and dic were comparable to that in rivers tables 2 and 3 the highest doc concentration 392 183 µmol l 1 occurred in august 32 higher than the yearly average in contrast dic concentration in august 2552 765 µmol l 1 was the lowest and it was on average 36 higher in the dry season 5302 1497 µmol l 1 than in the wet season 3389 1395 µmol l 1 neither doc nor dic were related to pco2 and dissolved ch4 p 0 05 although no statistical relationship between river water pco2 and chl a was detected pco2 in reservoir water did show a significant relationship with chl a with an exponential decrease in pco2 with increasing chl a fig 5 in comparison dissolved ch4 in reservoirs was positively related to chl a for all the 5 reservoirs across the four seasons fig 5 to better understand the differences between co2 and ch4 dynamics fig 6 presents the seasonal variability of co2 and ch4 emissions from a small forest reservoir elevation 1870 m a s l situated in the southwestern edge of the river catchment surface water in this reservoir is fully frozen from december and ice starts to melt in early march its pco2 was 288 493 µatm in august october and june but increased to 1395 µatm in march co2 efflux was highest in march 244 3 mmol m 2 d 1 while it was only 0 6 4 7 mmol m 2 d 1 in the other three seasons in contrast methane exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern with high concentrations in august october and june 0 15 0 21 µmol l 1 but the lowest in march 0 07 µmol l 1 fig 6 accordingly the lowest ch4 efflux 10 µmol m 2 d 1 occurred in march while the highest in august 602 µmol m 2 d 1 to investigate the impact of dams on ghg dynamics we compared co2 and ch4 concentrations and effluxes in the tumengou reservoir fig 1 with those in the upstream downstream rivers fig 7 the reservoir showed considerably lower pco2 and co2 emissions than the upstream downstream rivers conversely ch4 concentrations and emissions were highest in the reservoir and lowest in the rivers upstream and downstream of the reservoir fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 controls on dissolved co2 and ch4 riverine co2 originates primarily from lateral inputs of terrestrially derived co2 while in stream metabolism can produce additional co2 hotchkiss et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 the magnitude of riverine pco2 reflects the impacts of land water connectivity and variations in hydrologic flowpaths amaral et al 2020 crawford et al 2013 headwater streams tend to exhibit higher pco2 because of their stronger connectivity to surrounding catchments via shallow flowpaths whereas high order streams progressively receive larger proportions of water from upstream catchments where most of the co2 has been exhausted by emission and thus have a lower pco2 in our study catchment the higher pco2 measured in first order streams is consistent with higher terrestrial co2 inputs fig 2a however although decomposition of doc is an important source of riverine co2 butman et al 2016 müller et al 2015 the weak positive correlation between doc and pco2 suggests that in stream processing played a minor role in sustaining pco2 the low doc export can be related to sparse vegetation and low terrestrial productivity in the catchment furthermore photochemical oxidation of doc may have also been limited because of the high tss concentration that reduces light penetration soil erosion plays a critical role in mobilizing organic carbon in the clp our earlier studies indicate that particulate organic carbon poc in sediments accounts for 90 of the total organic carbon export ran et al 2013 2018 when the tss concentration was low e g 2000 mg l 1 indicating that sediment originated from surface soils qu et al 2020 the positive relationship between pco2 and tss fig 3 likely suggests that rapid decomposition of the degradable poc fraction contributes to the increasing pco2 however when subsurface soils with a substantially lower organic carbon content i e 0 2 0 5 in dry weight ran et al 2018 are mobilized by gully erosion and mudslides during heavy storms the river water pco2 declined quickly to 400 µatm this is likely because of the highly refractory nature of the organic carbon in deeper soils which consists of highly weathered loess particles and ancient kerogen wang et al 2012 qu et al 2020 discovered the sediment poc in the clp was mainly composed of petrogenic and extremely old biospheric poc 1300 11 100 years consequently the pco2 showed a binary response to tss export with the tss concentration at 2000 mg l 1 as the breakpoint yet due to the limited sampling under high tss conditions our finding of greatly reduced pco2 levels when tss exceeded 2000 mg l 1 is associated with great uncertainty and warrants further investigations to validate the binary response compared with doc the 10 fold higher dic tables 1 and 2 across the stream network illustrates its potential impact on river water pco2 the strength of carbonate buffering in influencing pco2 is dependent on ph and alkalinity for high ph 7 5 and higher and high alkalinity rivers prior studies indicate that carbonate buffering is the primary control on river water pco2 duvert et al 2019 stets et al 2017 the dic pool in these systems is primarily composed of ionized species i e hco3 and co3 2 with dissolved co2 accounting for a small fraction conversions of the ionized species to dissolved co2 can support a relatively high pco2 in downstream high order streams due to the strong carbonate buffering despite that dissolved co2 is constantly degassed along the river course contrary to low alkalinity rivers 1000 µmol l 1 where pco2 declined rapidly with increasing strahler order butman and raymond 2011 crawford et al 2013 hutchins et al 2020 as a result of progressive co2 emission the pco2 in this catchment did not show a significant change from second order streams to higher order streams p 0 05 fig 2a the high alkalinity coupled with decreasing ph from headwater streams towards the mainstream table 1 illustrates that carbonate buffering plays a major role in controlling the magnitude of riverine pco2 during the study period considering the differences between doc and dic concentrations the carbonate buffering effect has probably overshadowed the control of doc decomposition on pco2 meanwhile the predominance of hco3 and co3 2 in the dic pool and the resulting strong carbonate buffering capacity can partially explain the comparatively low river water pco2 as expected the dic oversaturation was larger in magnitude than the co2 oversaturation fig 4 the significant correlations between δo2 and δco2 or δdic indicated the metabolic linkage between o2 consumption production and co2 production consumption however if groundwater with high dic and low do is the primary source of river flow it will also produce an o2 co2 dic pattern analogous to the metabolic linkage duvert et al 2019 the groundwater in this catchment showed a δo2 and δco2 of 25 1 2 2 and 65 7 4 3 µmol l l respectively therefore in stream metabolic processes can only explain at most 34 of the pco2 variations fig 4a moreover the large deviations from the 1 1 line fig 4 further validated our expectation of additional inputs of co2 from terrestrial sources and also the buffering effect of carbonate crawford et al 2014 in organic rich river environments anaerobic organic carbon mineralization is an important source of methane delsontro et al 2016 natchimuthu et al 2017 however the weak correlation between dissolved ch4 and doc in the study catchment indicated that doc was not a strong predictor of ch4 concentrations likely due to the absence of wetland contributions and the high do table 1 and fig 4 spatial variations in the ch4 concentration appear to be controlled by changes in hydrological pathways fig 2b the downstream increase despite not statistically significant p 0 05 across strahler orders revealed areas of consistent ch4 saturated groundwater inflows which are governed by subsurface flowpaths the sampled groundwater was constantly supersaturated in ch4 0 09 0 01 µmol l 1 because groundwater discharge predominates river flow except for the heavy storm periods we infer that groundwater is an important contributor to methane although the result from a single site may not be spatially representative of the whole watershed in addition agriculture is closely related to intense erosion of fine sediments and enhanced organic matter loading to streams which can also promote ch4 production and emissions comer warner et al 2019 stanley et al 2016 the intensive agriculture coupled with severe soil erosion in the study catchment are probably the principal source of dissolved ch4 while high ch4 concentrations have been reported to be related to the extent of and connectivity with wetlands in tropical and temperate river systems marescaux et al 2018 teodoru et al 2015 there is no wetland development in this arid semiarid intensively cropped catchment noticeably the downstream pattern of dissolved ch4 across strahler orders was different from pco2 fig 2 probably due to localized differences in water chemistry and or in stream oxidation rates crawford et al 2013 hutchins et al 2020 relatively higher do levels in low order streams over all four seasons table 1 provided favourable conditions for aerobic methane oxidation leading to lowered ch4 concentrations high order streams are more likely to be impacted by agriculture and urban wastewater which are typically ch4 rich marescaux et al 2018 the high order streams are all located in the lower part of the watershed with extensive agriculture and receive largely untreated urban effluents together with ch4 laden groundwater inflows these biogeochemical processes likely led to elevated ch4 levels the observed seasonal variations in stream pco2 and ch4 concentration suggest that the two gases responded differently to changing hydrological conditions butman et al 2016 horgby et al 2019 numerous studies have showed that input of low co2 laden surface flow can dilute dic concentration and cause a pronounced seasonal pattern of riverine pco2 borges et al 2019 panneer selvam et al 2014 the substantially lower pco2 in august and october was most probably related to dilution by increased surface runoff as also testified by the lowered alkalinity and tds in the wet season which were 20 34 lower than in the dry season table 1 in contrast the high river water pco2 in march and june suggested consistent groundwater inflows moreover melting of snow and ice and the resulting mobilization of organic matter can contribute additional co2 to streams as widely observed in high latitude environments crawford et al 2013 the much narrower seasonal variation in dissolved ch4 indicated that it was not greatly affected by the dilution effect table 2 this is most likely because of the stronger impact from agriculture and urban wastewater in the wet season which has fully counteracted the dilution effect similar to the results reported for the human impacted seine watershed in france marescaux et al 2018 in comparison oxidation of ch4 during the snow and ice melting period has probably resulted in the lowest averaged ch4 concentration in march 4 2 controls on water air co2 and ch4 emissions 92 of the surveyed streams were consistent sources of co2 to the atmosphere whereas all streams were ch4 sources over the four sampling seasons regardless of location headwater first order streams were the most dynamic systems with respect to co2 emissions showing the highest mean co2 efflux among the five strahler orders and the largest spatial variation fig 2a in comparison first order streams exhibited low ch4 effluxes and a small spatial variation fig 2b the distribution of co2 effluxes across the five strahler orders is consistent with previous studies which show headwater streams tend to have the highest co2 effluxes in a stream network butman and raymond 2011 campeau et al 2014 schelker et al 2016 the largely unchanged co2 efflux from second to fourth order streams is probably due to the combination of continuous groundwater inflows and a strong carbonate buffering capacity which sustained a comparable pco2 along the three stream orders horgby et al 2019 stets et al 2017 on the contrary the elevated co2 efflux in the fifth order stream mainstream was more likely caused by the higher gas transfer velocity as an important contributor to gas transfer velocity for running waters the mainstream flow velocity in the wet season was 24 higher than the second to fourth order streams table 1 this resulted in higher co2 effluxes in the mainstream despite similar pco2 fig 2a this is one of the first studies to incorporate catchment scale ch4 emissions in arid semiarid regions as predicted diffusive ch4 effluxes were two orders of magnitude lower than co2 effluxes consistent with earlier studies in other climates such as the tropics borges et al 2019 panneer selvam et al 2014 and boreal permafrost crawford et al 2013 natchimuthu et al 2017 spatial and seasonal variations of ch4 effluxes consistently followed the dissolved ch4 concentration changes fig 2b and table 2 we infer that the ch4 emissions were primarily controlled by the ch4 concentration gradient between stream water and the overlying atmosphere continuous addition of ch4 from agriculture and to a lesser extent from urban effluents along the river course sustained ch4 effluxes at the higher order stream sites where the riverine ch4 would have otherwise been exhausted due to progressive evasion from upstream water surface this is particularly true for the growing season august in the study catchment which is coupled with strengthened subsurface and groundwater flowpaths although the ch4 concentration was constantly higher than the atmospheric equilibrium the high ch4 efflux in the mainstream 313 174 µmol m 2 d 1 was also partially driven by the stronger near surface turbulence resulting from higher flow velocities and discharge butman and raymond 2011 kokic et al 2018 raymond et al 2012 similar to the co2 efflux dynamics it is important to note that ebullition remains a significant pathway of ch4 release in these fluvial networks although previous studies have rarely accounted for ebullitive fluxes due to limited sampling regimes baulch et al 2011 stanley et al 2016 excluding the ebullitive fluxes may therefore cause great underestimations of the total ch4 evasion flux from flowing waters ghg emissions from rivers are highly dependent on the k value which has been shown to decrease with increasing strahler order borges et al 2019 crawford et al 2013 ulseth et al 2019 headwater streams tend to have larger k values because of their steeper stream channels and more turbulent flow for flowing rivers and streams near surface turbulence is originated from water column and the streambed mcdowell and johnson 2018 ulseth et al 2019 recent studies show that stream energy dissipation ed in m2 s 3 defined as the product of gravitational acceleration stream channel slope and flow velocity is a good predictor of k with a high explanatory power kokic et al 2018 raymond et al 2012 ulseth et al 2019 the k600 co2 from this study showed a statistically significant correlation with ed fig 8 the linear regression indicates that ed can explain 71 of the variability in k600 co2 across all the streams and over the four seasons nevertheless while the observed k600 co2 was consistent with the model fit results of ulseth et al 2019 when the ed is 0 02 m2 s 3 the breakpoint model for high ed i e 0 02 m2 s 3 overestimated the actual k600 co2 by 80 150 supplementary figure s5 the low k600 co2 was probably related to the distinct landscape of the clp most of the low order streams exhibit deeply incised v shaped channels as a result of progressive erosion into the highly erodible loess deposits zhang et al 2020 consequently these streams are characterized by substantially low channel slope commonly 0 008 m m 1 and weak turbulence the unexplained variability in k600 co2 suggests the importance of accounting for other factors such as water depth and discharge raymond et al 2012 in more accurately predicting k600 co2 for spatial upscaling of co2 and ch4 emissions for reservoirs the k600 co2 with an overall mean of 5 7 cm h 1 was consistent with our earlier reservoir based results 2 23 cm h 1 in the central clp ran et al 2017 while slightly higher than those reported for tropical and temperate reservoirs e g 2 4 cm h 1 amaral et al 2020 read et al 2012 this was likely caused by the landscape characteristics of the clp reservoirs in this region are absent of sheltering trees and are fully exposed to wind effects compared with sheltered systems wind driven shear in such settings can generate stronger near surface turbulence and promote faster gas emission because of higher k600 co2 values amaral et al 2020 macintyre et al 2019 in contrast tropical and temperate reservoirs are generally located in densely forested areas where the effect of wind may have been dampened by surrounding trees and tall shrubs amaral et al 2020 campeau et al 2014 the k600 co2 values from these previous studies were substantially lower than those of exposed water surfaces 4 3 impacts of dam impoundment and urban wastewater river impoundment will alter the physical and biogeochemical characteristics of pristine rivers and change riverine dynamics of gas evasion paranaíba et al 2018 teodoru et al 2015 owing to the greatly reduced flow turbulence lentic environments create favorable conditions for primary production engel et al 2019 jin et al 2018 the jing river network has been fragmented by numerous dams for soil conservation and irrigation compared to the flowing streams which were significant carbon sources at most sites reservoir waters had substantially lower co2 effluxes in magnitude and even acted as co2 sinks this was most likely caused by the enhanced photosynthesis of aquatic plants crawford et al 2016 ran et al 2017 as evidenced by the elevated chl a concentration a valuable indicator of primary production relative to the flowing streams table 1 as a result of extensive inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus from agriculture reservoirs in the clp are characteristic of highly eutrophic waters with widespread phytoplankton growth liu et al 2013 the negative relationship between chl a and pco2 further suggests that aquatic photosynthesis played a critical role in controlling pco2 and co2 evasion fig 5 in agreement with recent reports from lentic water bodies liu et al 2016 teodoru et al 2015 with a higher chl a concentration in the wet season indicating stronger autochthonous production both reservoir water pco2 and co2 efflux were substantially lower than those in the dry season table 3 this can also be testified by the seasonal variability in reservoir doc which peaked in august when the aquatic photosynthesis rate was highest as suggested by the highest temperature tables 1 and 3 despite being small co2 sources or even sinks all reservoirs were hotspots of ch4 evasion anaerobic degradation of phytoplankton biomass in reservoir sediments would produce substantial methane through methanogenesis borges et al 2019 engel et al 2019 further the shallow water column usually 10 m deep may have also limited the oxidation of ch4 jin et al 2018 lei et al 2019 a large fraction of the produced ch4 by anerobic metabolism near the reservoir bottom was readily transported to the surface for emission hence a shorter retention time of the sediment derived ch4 in the overlying aerobic water column reduces ch4 oxidation and leads to a higher ch4 concentration in the surface water this can partially explain the highest seasonal mean ch4 concentration 0 46 0 23 µmol l 1 in june when the water level was lowest due to water withdrawal for irrigation while the do was also lowest among the four seasons table 1 in contrast although the ch4 concentration was positively correlated to chl a fig 5 as observed in other studies león palmero et al 2020 paranaíba et al 2018 it seems that phytoplankton biomass itself is not a major control on ch4 production because the mean chl a concentration in june was indeed lowest among the four seasons table 1 this suggests that other physical factors such as sediment characteristics and oxygen concentration are also critical in regulating ch4 production baulch et al 2011 delsontro et al 2016 the dominance of ebullition in the total ch4 evasion from reservoirs is in line with recent observations in lentic ecosystems delsontro et al 2016 paranaíba et al 2018 the increased dominance of ebullition in june and august was likely caused by the lowered solubility of ch4 due to the higher water temperatures as shown in table 1 this demonstrates that there will be a greater potential for ch4 ebullition from such systems under a warming climate thus leading to higher ch4 emissions as bubbles in comparison ch4 diffusion from lentic waters is controlled by wind driven turbulence paranaíba et al 2018 the variability in the diffusive ch4 efflux in october march and june reflected the dissolved ch4 dynamics table 3 because the wind was generally 1 m s 1 table 1 and the k600 ch4 values were largely equivalent 2 4 1 6 cm h 1 range 0 5 5 3 cm h 1 the k600 ch4 in august 4 4 2 1 cm h 1 was substantially higher due to the stronger winds that were 40 to 6 fold higher in august 0 3 2 2 m s 1 than in the other three seasons table 1 consequently the highest seasonal ch4 diffusion efflux was observed in august although the concurrent ch4 concentration was at a relatively low level table 3 compared with rivers which were large co2 sources the magnitude of co2 emissions from the tumengou reservoir was also greatly reduced fig 7 and the reservoir acted as a local co2 sink due to enhanced aquatic primary production in all seasons except august the small co2 efflux in august was likely due to high terrestrial soil co2 and organic carbon inputs triggered by heavy storms supplementary figure s2 which may have outweighed the concurrently strong aquatic production in maintaining the co2 dynamics it is worth noting that the released water site 3 displayed stronger emissions than the upstream river site 1 fig 7 except in june indicative of strong co2 production within the reservoir the released co2 rich water from the reservoir sustained the high pco2 and efflux which agreed well with recent studies on co2 emissions from reservoirs crawford et al 2016 teodoru et al 2015 although the tumengou reservoir is 40 years old with limited terrestrial biomass inputs the longitudinal changes suggest that it remains a hotspot of ch4 emission and the high efflux will likely continue in future fig 7 when co2 and ch4 are taken together the reduced co2 emissions have largely been offset by the enhanced ch4 emissions therefore not accounting for either of the gases may lead to significant biases in estimating the ghg emission budget of reservoirs in addition to extensive agriculture and damming riverine c cycling in this catchment has been affected by urban wastewater an example is site 4 fig 7a which is 11 km downstream of a city with 32 000 residents who discharge largely untreated domestic wastewater into the river aquatic metabolism of labile organic matter in such a polluted urban river can support the high pco2 and ch4 concentration jin et al 2018 smith et al 2017 this is particularly true for the dry season march and june when the dilution by flood runoff was weak fig 7b and d to illustrate urban wastewater impact we further compared ghg emissions from natural urban rivers and reservoirs fig 9 for the three stream sites downstream of sewage inflows that account for roughly 35 80 of the stream runoff both ghg concentration and efflux were substantially higher than that in natural rivers and reservoirs especially for ch4 the ch4 concentration was negatively correlated to the do level ch4 0 083 do 1 024 r2 0 49 p 0 001 n 12 which corroborated the importance of in stream anaerobic decomposition of organic matter rich urban wastewater in sustaining the high ch4 production and emissions marescaux et al 2018 4 4 implications for inland water c budgets both riverine pco2 and co2 effluxes in this study fell within the range of previous studies in tropical temperate boreal and arid semiarid systems table 4 the averaged seasonal effluxes of co2 55 mmol m 2 d 1 and ch4 346 µmol m 2 d 1 were comparable to those reported from temperate and boreal river systems while lower than those from tropical rivers however in contrast to tropical temperate and boreal rivers where co2 is mainly derived from in stream processing of recent organic matter and or soil respiration borges et al 2019 crawford et al 2016 here the co2 is originated from groundwater inflows and the pco2 is modulated by carbonate buffering our earlier work in the clp indicated that the degassed co2 was 810 1890 years old ran et al 2018 considerably older than the recently fixed organic carbon e g 50 years as such co2 evasion from these arid semiarid rivers represents a net carbon source for the atmosphere over the millennium timescale in addition both pco2 and co2 efflux are largely equivalent among arid semiarid rivers where groundwater with high dic content predominates river flow table 1 this indicates the strong modulation of pco2 by carbonate buffering caused by intense chemical weathering duvert et al 2019 stets et al 2017 noticeably the averaged pco2 885 415 µatm for streams of the jing river catchment were similar to values measured in the wuding river catchment 881µatm in the central clp this suggests that the spatially homogeneous soil property of the clp played a critical role in governing its river water pco2 although the two basins display different geomorphological structures this makes it possible for upscaling of co2 emissions from the entire clp fluvial network by discrete sampling in representative rivers while the ch4 concentration does not significantly differ among arid semiarid and temperate rivers it is generally higher in boreal and tropical rivers where it varies by three orders of magnitude table 4 this distinct spatial pattern is probably related to the extent of wetlands and backwater several recent studies discovered that organic matter from wetlands and backwater in tropical systems were the primary factor in sustaining the high ch4 concentrations amaral et al 2020 borges et al 2019 similarly the reducing conditions of expanding wetlands in boreal rivers were of paramount importance in leading to the elevated ch4 levels crawford et al 2013 natchimuthu et al 2017 in contrast arid semiarid catchments are generally absent of wetlands and backwater due to low precipitation the observed low ch4 concentrations likely reflect groundwater derived ch4 and the contribution of ch4 production from human activities e g farming damming and urban wastewater nevertheless the total ch4 effluxes diffusion ebullition from the arid semiarid jing river catchment are comparable to those observed in other climate regions table 4 due largely to the higher k values our study suggests that arid semiarid rivers are important ghg emitters however existing studies on ghg evasion are mostly conducted in tropical temperate and boreal regions which have long been thought to contribute disproportionately to global ghg emissions from inland waters borges et al 2015 campeau et al 2014 the significance of arid semiarid rivers has not yet been fully recognized their contribution to total inland water ghg emissions has been systematically underestimated due to the spatially fragmented data and lack of catchment scale studies addressing both gas emissions in view of the abundance of arid semiarid rivers in the global fluvial networks allen and pavelsky 2018 future estimates of ghg evasion will be significantly biased if they are not properly accounted for moreover arid semiarid rivers are likely to dry out intermittently with the progression of climate change the ghg emissions from exposed sediments following the desiccation of rivers can be considerable keller et al 2020 and must thus be included in future carbon budgets 4 5 limitations and future research although four intensive campaigns were performed to investigate the seasonal variations in ghg dynamics co2 and ch4 emissions at ice thaw were not measured in this study recent studies have suggested that hydrological inputs of co2 and ch4 at ice thaw represent an important pathway of ghg emissions denfeld et al 2018 vachon et al 2017 hence future work to measure ghg emissions during ice thaw is needed to better determine ghg fluxes on the annual scale furthermore the significance of groundwater in modulating aquatic co2 and ch4 emissions in this study is likely associated with great uncertainty because of the limited groundwater sampling our findings on the controls of riverine ghg dynamics may have also been influenced by the incomplete chl a measurement in august table 1 thus future research to examine the impacts of basin wide groundwater inflows and biological processes in the aquatic ecosystems in affecting ghg dynamics is needed 5 conclusions our spatially highly resolved sampling over four seasons in the jing river catchment enabled us to capture the magnitude of co2 and ch4 emissions and identify the primary driving factors because of the strong carbonate buffering effect the river water pco2 changes along the stream network differed from the commonly observed pattern while riverine co2 was primarily derived from groundwater inflows in stream processing of organic matter mobilized by soil erosion was also an important source as demonstrated by the undersaturated do the seasonal variability of pco2 indicated hydrological controls which showed a pronounced dilution effect in the wet season the stream network was consistently oversaturated in ch4 that varied between 0 06 and 0 77 µmol l 1 this reflects the combined impacts of groundwater discharges and agriculture and local contributions from urban wastewater both co2 and ch4 emissions were characterized by distinct spatial and seasonal variability which was controlled by flow regime the highest co2 efflux was observed in headwater streams mean 80 mmol m 2 d 1 due to the highest k values and in august mean 102 mmol m 2 d 1 when flows were most turbulent the increasing ch4 efflux along the stream network 8 µmol m 2 d 1 per strahler order although not significant were sustained by continuous ch4 inputs from agriculture and partially from urban effluents while the significance of ebullition in lentic ecosystems has been widely recognized we found that ebullition was also an important mode of ch4 evasion from flowing waters reservoirs showed considerably lower co2 effluxes while higher ch4 effluxes than the upstream flowing streams the stagnant waters after damming created favorable conditions for enhanced aquatic productivity which reduced reservoir water pco2 and the magnitude of co2 evasion anaerobic degradation of organic rich sediments produced large quantities of methane within the water column that resulted in elevated ch4 levels relative to pristine streams in addition urban effluent discharges have substantially increased riverine ch4 concentration although the impact is typically local and might have disappeared downstream both reservoirs and urban wastewater fed rivers presented considerably higher ch4 effluxes constituting important ch4 emission hotspots considering the unprecedented dam construction and urbanization worldwide these highly localized emission hotspots will be of global importance in estimating ghg emissions from inland waters our study contributes to the understanding of ghg dynamics in arid semiarid river systems which show comparable co2 and ch4 effluxes to those observed in other climate zones these findings illustrate that future efforts attempting to refine global or regional ghg emissions from inland waters need to pay equal attention to arid semiarid rivers failure to account for these river systems would produce large uncertainties in determining total ghg emissions and describing their significance in the global c cycle credit authorship contribution statement lishan ran conceptualization methodology writing

4528,river systems are major sources of greenhouse gases ghg however simultaneous co2 and ch4 emissions from arid semiarid rivers remain poorly studied here we investigated co2 and ch4 emissions diffusion ebullition and their potential sources and drivers in an arid semiarid catchment on the chinese loess plateau the river water co2 partial pressure pco2 averaged 885 415 µatm and did not show a significant change along the stream network due to strong carbonate buffering groundwater inputs played a dominant role in controlling pco2 which exhibited a pronounced seasonal variation in stream decomposition of organic matter mobilized by soil erosion was also an important contributor the streams were consistently oversaturated in ch4 ranging between 0 06 and 0 77 µmol l 1 both gas emissions exhibited significant seasonal variations which were collectively controlled by gas concentration gradient across the water air interface and flow dynamics the mean co2 and ch4 efflux were 55 mmol m 2 d 1 and 346 µmol m 2 d 1 respectively with the highest efflux in august high flow conditions for both gases river impoundment resulted in greatly reduced pco2 due to enhanced primary production but elevated ch4 concentrations because of anaerobic degradation of organic rich sediments reservoirs acted as a smaller co2 source but a stronger ch4 source than flowing rivers ebullition was an important pathway of ch4 emissions in both lotic and lentic ecosystems contributing 36 23 and 55 19 to the total ch4 emissions from rivers and reservoirs respectively urban wastewater discharges modified riverine carbon cycling and created local hotspots of ghg production and emissions which will be globally significant given the increasing human impacts worldwide our results reinforce the urgency to account for arid semiarid rivers in future ghg emission estimates future work to better understand the impacts of groundwater inflows and aquatic ecosystem processes in controlling ghg dynamics is also needed keywords greenhouse gas emissions carbon cycle arid semiarid rivers human impacts chinese loess plateau 1 introduction the role and importance of greenhouse gases ghg evasion from inland waters have now been well recognized in the global carbon c cycle amaral et al 2020 borges et al 2015 crawford et al 2016 raymond et al 2013 approximately 5 1 pg of terrestrial c is annually transported into inland waters drake et al 2018 where c is subject to burial in sediments or degassing into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 according to recent global estimates fluvial networks are outgassing co2 and ch4 at the rates of 1 8 pg c yr 1 raymond et al 2013 and 20 1 tg c yr 1 stanley et al 2016 respectively compared with downstream c export that has been well constrained however these vertical ghg flux estimates are likely to increase with more spatially resolved measurements and the relative importance of c emissions within landscape c budgets will also increase drake et al 2018 hence assessing global or regional c balance that neglects surface water c evasion may overestimate the significance of c uptake by terrestrial ecosystems borges et al 2019 butman et al 2016 ran et al 2018 the magnitude of riverine ghg degassing exhibits great spatial variability due to differences in hydraulic geometry hydrological connectivity and biological processes crawford et al 2014 duvert et al 2019 natchimuthu et al 2017 current emission fluxes are underestimated due to measurement paucity in arid semiarid river systems butman and raymond 2011 gómez gener et al 2015 previous research has mainly focused on temperate and boreal rivers where extensive flooded forests and wetlands within hydrologically connected landscapes fueled strong emissions amaral et al 2020 borges et al 2019 natchimuthu et al 2017 whereas until recently arid semiarid rivers were nearly uncharted with a few exceptions gómez gener et al 2015 ran et al 2017 consequently while temperate and boreal rivers have been widely recognized to be intense co2 and ch4 sources for the atmosphere there is still a lack of understanding of ghg emissions from arid semiarid rivers and their primary drivers it remains largely unclear to what extent co2 and ch4 emissions from these rivers are sustained by in stream production and or by lateral inputs from terrestrial ecosystems and groundwater a greater understanding of their ghg dynamics will be important to provide more accurate estimates of global c budgets river systems worldwide are being affected by human activity such as damming farming and urban wastewater discharge in contrast to running waters dammed rivers thus reservoirs have greatly reduced hydrodynamics and span long residence times which create a favourable condition for aquatic productivity potentially higher co2 fixation rates and lower emission rates crawford et al 2016 león palmero et al 2020 one might surmise that such lentic systems make only minor contributions to the overall c balance nevertheless several lines of evidence indicate that lentic systems are of paramount importance in contributing to the overall c efflux if the global warming potential of ch4 is considered stanley et al 2016 teodoru et al 2015 furthermore agriculture and urban wastewater are known to have substantial impacts on biogeochemical cycling jin et al 2018 marescaux et al 2018 yet it remains to be determined how these perturbations will change riverine ghg emissions the arid semiarid chinese loess plateau clp covering the middle yellow river fig 1 is well known for its high erosion intensity because of the erodible loess deposits ran et al 2017 large amounts of sediment derived c are exported into fluvial networks qu et al 2020 meanwhile numerous dams have been constructed as an effective soil conservation practice to control erosion and sustain agricultural production and urban development here we present the first integrated study to quantify the magnitude of co2 and ch4 emissions including diffusion and ebullition from a representative catchment on the clp and explore their potential drivers using spatially resolved measurements in the jing river catchment the objectives were to 1 explore the spatial and seasonal patterns of co2 and ch4 emissions at the catchment scale 2 examine environmental controls and human impacts on dissolved co2 and ch4 concentrations and emissions at the water air interface and 3 derive biogeochemical implications for inland water c balance 2 methods 2 1 study area the perennial jing river is located on the southern clp and flows nw se into the wei river the largest tributary of the yellow river fig 1 the river main channel is 455 km long with a drainage area of 45 420 km2 with an arid semiarid climate precipitation in the jing river catchment is low 450 mm yr 1 and presents distinct seasonal variations with 75 of the annual precipitation falling during the wet season from july to october xu et al 2015 owing to high permeability of loess stream flow is primarily derived from groundwater while episodic overland runoff generated by heavy storms might be predominant in the wet season mean annual flow for the jing river was 68 m3 s 1 during 1950 2010 while due to severe soil erosion across the catchment huang et al 2012 and a mean erosion rate of 8000 t km 2 yr 1 supplementary figure s1 the average sediment concentration was 141 000 mg l 1 during the same period the soil erosion rate has recently declined because of effective soil conservation such as damming and vegetation restoration the stream network shows a typical dendritic pattern and can be represented by five strahler orders fig 1 which were verified by ground truthing except the headwater region at the southwestern edge of the catchment that is characteristic of greycinnamonicsoils and covered with forest the remaining catchment is predominantly composed of steep hillslopes mantled by 50 80 m deep loess deposits zhang et al 2020 highly incised channels are extensively developed between the hillslopes human activities have a long history in this catchment that supports a population of 9 5 million cropland and degraded grassland account for 47 and 45 of the catchment respectively xu et al 2015 water pollution caused by agriculture and urban wastewater has become an increasingly important environmental concern 2 2 field measurements and laboratory analyses field sampling and in situ measurements were conducted at 39 stream sites and 5 reservoir sites in the jing river catchment fig 1 in august and october 2018 wet season and under high flow conditions and march and june 2019 dry season and under low flow conditions the august campaign had the highest flow rates while the march campaign showed the lowest supplementary figure s2 streams drain catchment areas ranging from 0 6 km2 to more than 40 000 km2 sampling locations were selected to account for the spatial variability of soil erosion intensity and major land cover types and to represent the full spectrum of the five strahler orders three of the 39 stream sites are situated immediately downstream of urban wastewater discharge in addition a groundwater spring was sampled to characterize the groundwater end member of co2 and ch4 concentrations fig 1 and supplementary figure s3 co2 emissions were determined using a 10 77 l floating chamber connected in a closed loop to a non dispersive infrared li 850 co2 analyzer licor lincoln ne usa although this technique has been criticized for its artificial turbulence recent comparative studies with other methods suggest that it is reliable under low wind conditions crawford et al 2013 rawitch et al 2020 all chamber deployments were made in replicate as 10 15 min measurements from a freely drifting boat campeau et al 2014 crawford et al 2013 further details of the chamber design and deployment are given in ran et al 2017 for ch4 emissions gas samples were collected by syringe through a butyl rubber stopper on the top of the chamber right after deploying it on the water surface gas sampling was conducted at 5 min intervals for 15 mins 4 samples in total for each chamber deployment and stored in pre evacuated 12 ml exetainer vials labco uk surface water pco2 was determined using the headspace equilibrium method borges et al 2019 ran et al 2017 briefly 400 ml of water was collected in a 630 ml conical flask with the remaining space filled with ambient air the flask was immediately closed with a lid and vigorously shaken for 2 mins to equilibrate the gases in water and air then pco2 of the equilibrated gas was measured with the calibrated li 850 gas analyzer repeatability on triplicates was better than 5 and the average was used to represent the instantaneous pco2 the original river water pco2 was calculated using the solubility constants for co2 and the headspace ratio and further corrected using the ph and alkalinity before and after equilibrium koschorreck et al 2020 müller et al 2015 similarly the equilibrated gas in a replicate experiment was injected into 12 ml exetainer vials to determine the dissolved ch4 at each sampling location 500 ml water was filtered through a 0 45 µm pre weighed whatman gf f filter paper by using a peristaltic pump to determine the total suspended solids tss tss was calculated by using the dry weight of the suspended solids that were dried for 24 h at 105 c in laboratory alkalinity was determined in the field by end point titration using 0 01 m hcl with an analytical precision of 3 dissolved inorganic carbon dic was calculated from the determined alkalinity ph and water temperature using the co2calc program robbins et al 2010 water samples were also collected and stored atrefrigeratortemperature 4 c for laboratory analysis within one week after sampling dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was measured using an elementar vario toc analyzer elementar germany triple doc injections indicated that the analytical error was 3 the water for chlorophyll a chl a was preserved with 1 ml of mgco3 solution 10 g l 1 and determined using a hitachi u 2550 uv vis spectrophotometer duplicate analysis suggested a precision of within 10 gas samples collected from the floating chamber and the headspace for ch4 were analyzed with a shimadzu gc 2030 gas chromatography gc fid ecd and the precision based on duplicate samples was 4 the gc system was calibrated using a standard gas 20 7 ppm basic water quality information such as ph temperature salinity dissolved oxygen do and total dissolved solids tds was collected using a portable multiparameter probe multi 3420 wtw gmbh germany both the ph and do probes were calibrated once every day during the field campaigns do probe was calibrated by using the saturated air technique and the ph probe by three ph buffers 4 01 7 00 and 10 01 manufacturer specifications show the accuracy of the ph do and tds probes as 0 01 units 0 01 mg l 1 and 5 mg l 1 respectively flow velocity and wind speed were determined with a global water flow probe fp111 precision 0 1 m s 1 and a kestrel 1000 handheld anemometer respectively 2 3 calculation of ghg effluxes the areal ghg efflux f at the water air interface i e f c o 2 mmol m 2 d 1 and f c h 4 µmol m 2 d 1 was determined from the slope of the linear regression of ghg concentrations against time r2 0 95 ran et al 2017 teodoru et al 2015 1 f d p g h g d t v r t s where d p g h g d t is the slope of co2 or ch4 change within the chamber v is the chamber volume l r is the gas constant t is chamber temperature k and s is the area of the chamber covering the water surface 0 099 m2 in this study the computed f c o 2 is assumed to be exclusively diffusive and the gas transfer velocity k cm h 1 for co2 k c o 2 can be readily calculated using the pco2 difference across the water air interface raymond et al 2012 for ch4 we used the approach of campeau et al 2014 to quantify the ebullitive component of the total fch4 measured in the floating chambers we first calculated the diffusive ch4 efflux f d c h 4 based on the measured gas transfer velocity for ch4 k c h 4 that can be calculated from k c o 2 as follows campeau et al 2014 2 k c h 4 k c o 2 s c c h 4 s c c o 2 n where sc is the schmidt number and n is assigned a value of 2 3 for wind speeds of 3 6 m s 1 or 1 2 for wind speeds of 3 6 m s 1 the diffusive ch4 flux was calculated according to paranaíba et al 2018 3 f d c h 4 k c h 4 c h 4 w c h 4 e q where c h 4 w is the ch4 concentration in water and c h 4 e q is the ch4 concentration in water in equilibrium with the local atmosphere the difference between f c h 4 and f d c h 4 was attributed to ebullition in addition to facilitate comparison of k c o 2 and k c h 4 across the catchment and with results from other studies here the k c o 2 and k c h 4 values were normalized to a schmidt number of 600 k 600 c o 2 and k 600 c h 4 cm h 1 jähne et al 1987 2 4 deviation of co2 dic and o2 from atmospheric saturation to explore the importance of carbonate buffering in controlling surface water pco2 we calculated the theoretical co2 dic and o2 concentrations at atmospheric equilibrium using water temperature henry s constants and atmospheric concentrations of gases and in the case of dic salinity and alkalinity crawford et al 2014 stets et al 2017 the molar deviations of the three gases between their in situ aqueous concentrations cw and the theoretical concentrations at atmospheric equilibrium ca were referred to as δco2 δdic and δo2 respectively saturated o2 concentration at atmospheric equilibrium o2a was calculated from temperature and barometric pressure by using the constants in garcia and gordon 1992 and δo2 was calculated as 4 δ o 2 o 2w o 2a where o2w is the measured molar concentration of dissolved o2 in surface waters the theoretical equilibrium co2 concentration co2a was calculated from atmospheric pco2 and the temperature dependence henry s constant kh stets et al 2017 5 co 2a k h pco 2 thus δco2 was then calculated 6 δ co 2 co 2w co 2a similarly δdic was calculated by determining the dic concentration at atmospheric equilibrium dica at a given temperature pressure and alkalinity as follows stets et al 2017 7 δ dic dic w dic a where dicw was calculated from measured ph alkalinity and water temperature both dicw and dica were calculated using the co2calc program robbins et al 2010 notably δdic and δco2 are nearly equivalent in low ph low alkalinity rivers whereas they diverge at higher alkalinity because of the dominance of hco3 and co3 2 in high alkalinity waters 2 5 statistical tests we performed all the statistical analysis including one way analysis of variance anova and mann whitneytests using spss v25 normality of the data was first examined using the kolmogorov smirnov test in addition a regression analysis was carried out to investigate the relationship between dissolved co2 and ch4 concentrations and environmental factors in all statistical tests a significance level of α 0 05 was considered to reject the null hypothesis 3 results 3 1 physical and biogeochemical characteristics the jing river catchment exhibited pronounced spatiotemporal variations in water quality table 1 and supplementary table s1 water temperature was highest in august 26 8 4 5 c and it was only 10 9 2 7 c in october and 11 5 3 7 c in march first order streams typically had the lowest temperature flow discharge in august 99 m3 s 1 and october 53 m3 s 1 was significantly higher than in march and june 19 and 25 m3 s 1 respectively supplementary figure s2 flow velocity varied from 0 05 to 1 77 m s 1 with higher velocities observed in high order streams and in august and october the mean flow velocity in august october march and june was 0 7 0 6 0 6 and 0 4 m s 1 respectively wind speed was generally low ranging from 0 1 to 3 2 m s 1 with 92 of the measurements below 2 m s 1 both streams and reservoirs showed high ph and alkalinity table 1 the ph in streams ranged from 7 87 to 9 32 and displayed a decreasing trend towards the mainstream the mean river water ph was 8 69 in comparison the ph in reservoirs was slightly higher and averaged at 8 77 the highest ph of 9 51 was observed in a reservoir in june 2019 likewise the alkalinity in streams and reservoirs varied from 1020 to 11 200 µmol l 1 over the four campaigns with only 3 measurements in august below 2000 µmol l 1 the mean alkalinity in streams and reservoirs averaged 4607 1499 and 4326 1733 µmol l 1 respectively the tds ranged from 219 to 15 500 mg l 1 with 55 of the values larger than 1000 mg l 1 and the tss composed primarily of sediment varied from 1 6 to 8600 mg l 1 table 1 while there were no discernable seasonal variations in tds the tss concentration in august was substantially higher than in the other sampling seasons as an important indicator in describing metabolism river water was saturated with do for 73 of all sampling sites across the stream network and over all four seasons n 154 the mean do in august october march and june was 243 334 313 and 255 µmol l 1 respectively in comparison reservoirs generally exhibited higher do concentrations this is particularly true in august in which do in reservoirs 286 µmol l 1 was on average 15 higher than that in streams chl a in streams was not measured in august and it varied from 0 5 to 19 6 μg l 1 with an average of 6 7 4 0 6 9 3 3 and 6 0 3 2 μg l 1 in october march and june respectively the chl a presented an increasing trend with increasing strahler order and the averaged chl a in the fifth order mainstream was 23 58 higher than that in the headwater streams compared with streams the reservoir water displayed significantly higher chl a mann whitney test p 0 005 table 1 in october and march when streamflow was more turbulent the chl a in reservoirs was 58 67 higher than that in streams 3 2 co2 and ch4 dynamics in rivers river water pco2 averaged 885 415 µatm and varied over the four campaigns table 2 and supplementary table s1 streams were supersaturated in co2 with respect to the overlying atmosphere for 92 of all measurements n 154 higher pco2 values were generally observed in the dry season when groundwater dominated river flow the averaged pco2 in march and june was 15 44 higher than that in august and october table 2 the highest pco2 3354 µatm was measured in june at a stream site 500 m downstream of a dam and pco2 at a site r2 in supplementary table s1 ph range 8 75 8 92 was below the atmospheric equilibrium over all four seasons 110 323 µatm when binned by strahler order pco2 in the first order streams was on average 14 higher than that in the downstream streams where pco2 remained largely stable at 890 µatm fig 2 a the co2 efflux was highest in august mean 102 116 mmol m 2 d 1 and it was significantly 1 3 times higher than in the other three seasons anova test p 0 05 table 2 and supplementary figure s4 the yearly average co2 efflux was 55 mmol m 2 d 1 the magnitude of co2 emissions varied considerably across the stream network fig 2a the mean co2 efflux decreased rapidly from 80 mmol m 2 d 1 in the first order streams to around 50 mmol m 2 d 1 in the second to fourth order streams but it increased to 61 mmol m 2 d 1 in the fifth order mainstream streams were consistently supersaturated in ch4 with the concentrations ranging from 0 06 to 0 77 µmol l 1 while the average ch4 concentration was comparable among the four seasons table 2 and supplementary figure s4 great spatial variations were observed in august and june as implied by the high standard deviations 0 14 and 0 10 µmol l 1 respectively the yearly averaged ch4 concentration 0 13 0 09 µmol l 1 was 43 times the atmospheric equilibrium in the study catchment 0 003 µmol l 1 although the ch4 concentration remained largely stable across strahler orders the first order streams typically showed the lowest on average fig 2b exceptionally high values i e 0 3 µmol l 1 were all observed at the 3 sites downstream of urban areas the diffusive ch4 effluxes spanned over three orders of magnitude ranging between 6 and 4749 µmol m 2 d 1 and presented a significant seasonal variation mann whitney test p 0 05 table 2 the seasonal average ch4 diffusion efflux was highest in august roughly 3 times higher than that in march ebullition of ch4 occurred at all sampling sites and the ebullitive ch4 effluxes range 2 1549 µmol m 2 d 1 also exhibited a significant seasonal variation mann whitney test p 0 05 table 2 ebullition contributed to 36 23 of the total ch4 efflux diffusion ebullition across all sites range 12 5186 µmol m 2 d 1 the total ch4 efflux showed an increasing trend across strahler orders fig 2b with the mean efflux from the first to fifth order streams at 245 218 318 527 340 379 262 196 and 313 174 µmol m 2 d 1 respectively river water doc varied from 14 1 to 644 µmol l 1 and displayed a significant seasonal variation mann whitney test p 0 05 table 2 it was highest in august 424 348 µmol l 1 and lowest in march 131 46 µmol l 1 consistent with temperature changes however the doc showed no detectable spatial variation along the stream network although it was slightly higher in the third and forth order streams for all sites across all four seasons linear regression analyses detected a weak positive relationship between doc and pco2 r2 0 03 p 0 05 n 154 and between doc and dissolved ch4 r2 0 07 p 0 005 n 149 dic ranged from 1029 to 11 215 µmol l 1 and it was typically 10 20 times higher than the concomitant doc table 2 the yearly average dic was 4361 1498 µmol l 1 in addition dic was up to 44 higher in the dry season than in the wet season like doc the dic concentration was spatially uniform across the stream network with 10 spatial variations among the 5 strahler orders and presented a weak positive correlation with pco2 r2 0 03 p 0 05 n 154 the river water pco2 was also positively related to tss export fig 3 pco2 responded rapidly to increasing tss concentration due to severe surface soil erosion it increased from the initial 400 500 µatm when tss was below 20 mg l 1 to 1200 µatm when tss reached 2000 mg l 1 fig 3a b and c however river water pco2 declined substantially to around 400 µatm when tss concentration exceeded 2000 mg l 1 which typically indicates the occurrence of deeper erosion processes e g gully erosion and mudslides as a result of heavy storms and high discharge yield fig 3d there was no statistic relationship between ch4 concentration and tss in all four seasons furthermore δo2 was significantly correlated with δco2 and δdic fig 4 both regression curves diverged greatly from the 1 1 line that represents in stream metabolism with an equal change in the co2 and o2 concentrations and the intercepts were considerably higher than 0 fig 4 3 3 co2 and ch4 dynamics in reservoirs reservoirs exhibited different co2 and ch4 dynamics table 3 and supplementary table s2 reservoir pco2 varied from 201 to 2732 µatm with 35 of the measurements below the atmospheric equilibrium n 20 the pco2 in the wet season 546 204 µatm was 67 lower than that in the dry season 911 817 µatm there were four high pco2 values 1000 µatm all of which were observed in march during the ice melting period or in june when reservoirs were at the lowest water level co2 efflux ranged from 43 2 to 244 3 mmol m 2 d 1 and averaged 21 58 mmol m 2 d 1 owing to the lower pco2 than the atmospheric equilibrium 35 of the co2 effluxes were negative the co2 efflux was typically higher in the dry season consistent with the pco2 changes table 3 dissolved ch4 varied from 0 07 to 0 81 µmol l 1 and the yearly average was 0 27 0 18 µmol l 1 twice as high as that in rivers the ch4 concentration was highest in june 0 46 0 23 µmol l 1 and lowest in march 0 14 0 06 µmol l 1 all reservoirs acted as methane sources with the efflux varying from 10 to 1336 µmol m 2 d 1 both the diffusive and ebullitive ch4 effluxes showed a pronounced seasonal pattern with the lowest rates in march anova test p 0 05 table 3 ebullition dominated ch4 emissions from reservoirs and played a greater role in june and august accounting for 72 15 and 59 14 of the total ch4 efflux respectively supplementary table s2 the ebullitive efflux on average accounted for 55 19 of the total ch4 efflux across all reservoir sites seasonal variability of reservoir doc and dic were comparable to that in rivers tables 2 and 3 the highest doc concentration 392 183 µmol l 1 occurred in august 32 higher than the yearly average in contrast dic concentration in august 2552 765 µmol l 1 was the lowest and it was on average 36 higher in the dry season 5302 1497 µmol l 1 than in the wet season 3389 1395 µmol l 1 neither doc nor dic were related to pco2 and dissolved ch4 p 0 05 although no statistical relationship between river water pco2 and chl a was detected pco2 in reservoir water did show a significant relationship with chl a with an exponential decrease in pco2 with increasing chl a fig 5 in comparison dissolved ch4 in reservoirs was positively related to chl a for all the 5 reservoirs across the four seasons fig 5 to better understand the differences between co2 and ch4 dynamics fig 6 presents the seasonal variability of co2 and ch4 emissions from a small forest reservoir elevation 1870 m a s l situated in the southwestern edge of the river catchment surface water in this reservoir is fully frozen from december and ice starts to melt in early march its pco2 was 288 493 µatm in august october and june but increased to 1395 µatm in march co2 efflux was highest in march 244 3 mmol m 2 d 1 while it was only 0 6 4 7 mmol m 2 d 1 in the other three seasons in contrast methane exhibited a distinct seasonal pattern with high concentrations in august october and june 0 15 0 21 µmol l 1 but the lowest in march 0 07 µmol l 1 fig 6 accordingly the lowest ch4 efflux 10 µmol m 2 d 1 occurred in march while the highest in august 602 µmol m 2 d 1 to investigate the impact of dams on ghg dynamics we compared co2 and ch4 concentrations and effluxes in the tumengou reservoir fig 1 with those in the upstream downstream rivers fig 7 the reservoir showed considerably lower pco2 and co2 emissions than the upstream downstream rivers conversely ch4 concentrations and emissions were highest in the reservoir and lowest in the rivers upstream and downstream of the reservoir fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 controls on dissolved co2 and ch4 riverine co2 originates primarily from lateral inputs of terrestrially derived co2 while in stream metabolism can produce additional co2 hotchkiss et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 the magnitude of riverine pco2 reflects the impacts of land water connectivity and variations in hydrologic flowpaths amaral et al 2020 crawford et al 2013 headwater streams tend to exhibit higher pco2 because of their stronger connectivity to surrounding catchments via shallow flowpaths whereas high order streams progressively receive larger proportions of water from upstream catchments where most of the co2 has been exhausted by emission and thus have a lower pco2 in our study catchment the higher pco2 measured in first order streams is consistent with higher terrestrial co2 inputs fig 2a however although decomposition of doc is an important source of riverine co2 butman et al 2016 müller et al 2015 the weak positive correlation between doc and pco2 suggests that in stream processing played a minor role in sustaining pco2 the low doc export can be related to sparse vegetation and low terrestrial productivity in the catchment furthermore photochemical oxidation of doc may have also been limited because of the high tss concentration that reduces light penetration soil erosion plays a critical role in mobilizing organic carbon in the clp our earlier studies indicate that particulate organic carbon poc in sediments accounts for 90 of the total organic carbon export ran et al 2013 2018 when the tss concentration was low e g 2000 mg l 1 indicating that sediment originated from surface soils qu et al 2020 the positive relationship between pco2 and tss fig 3 likely suggests that rapid decomposition of the degradable poc fraction contributes to the increasing pco2 however when subsurface soils with a substantially lower organic carbon content i e 0 2 0 5 in dry weight ran et al 2018 are mobilized by gully erosion and mudslides during heavy storms the river water pco2 declined quickly to 400 µatm this is likely because of the highly refractory nature of the organic carbon in deeper soils which consists of highly weathered loess particles and ancient kerogen wang et al 2012 qu et al 2020 discovered the sediment poc in the clp was mainly composed of petrogenic and extremely old biospheric poc 1300 11 100 years consequently the pco2 showed a binary response to tss export with the tss concentration at 2000 mg l 1 as the breakpoint yet due to the limited sampling under high tss conditions our finding of greatly reduced pco2 levels when tss exceeded 2000 mg l 1 is associated with great uncertainty and warrants further investigations to validate the binary response compared with doc the 10 fold higher dic tables 1 and 2 across the stream network illustrates its potential impact on river water pco2 the strength of carbonate buffering in influencing pco2 is dependent on ph and alkalinity for high ph 7 5 and higher and high alkalinity rivers prior studies indicate that carbonate buffering is the primary control on river water pco2 duvert et al 2019 stets et al 2017 the dic pool in these systems is primarily composed of ionized species i e hco3 and co3 2 with dissolved co2 accounting for a small fraction conversions of the ionized species to dissolved co2 can support a relatively high pco2 in downstream high order streams due to the strong carbonate buffering despite that dissolved co2 is constantly degassed along the river course contrary to low alkalinity rivers 1000 µmol l 1 where pco2 declined rapidly with increasing strahler order butman and raymond 2011 crawford et al 2013 hutchins et al 2020 as a result of progressive co2 emission the pco2 in this catchment did not show a significant change from second order streams to higher order streams p 0 05 fig 2a the high alkalinity coupled with decreasing ph from headwater streams towards the mainstream table 1 illustrates that carbonate buffering plays a major role in controlling the magnitude of riverine pco2 during the study period considering the differences between doc and dic concentrations the carbonate buffering effect has probably overshadowed the control of doc decomposition on pco2 meanwhile the predominance of hco3 and co3 2 in the dic pool and the resulting strong carbonate buffering capacity can partially explain the comparatively low river water pco2 as expected the dic oversaturation was larger in magnitude than the co2 oversaturation fig 4 the significant correlations between δo2 and δco2 or δdic indicated the metabolic linkage between o2 consumption production and co2 production consumption however if groundwater with high dic and low do is the primary source of river flow it will also produce an o2 co2 dic pattern analogous to the metabolic linkage duvert et al 2019 the groundwater in this catchment showed a δo2 and δco2 of 25 1 2 2 and 65 7 4 3 µmol l l respectively therefore in stream metabolic processes can only explain at most 34 of the pco2 variations fig 4a moreover the large deviations from the 1 1 line fig 4 further validated our expectation of additional inputs of co2 from terrestrial sources and also the buffering effect of carbonate crawford et al 2014 in organic rich river environments anaerobic organic carbon mineralization is an important source of methane delsontro et al 2016 natchimuthu et al 2017 however the weak correlation between dissolved ch4 and doc in the study catchment indicated that doc was not a strong predictor of ch4 concentrations likely due to the absence of wetland contributions and the high do table 1 and fig 4 spatial variations in the ch4 concentration appear to be controlled by changes in hydrological pathways fig 2b the downstream increase despite not statistically significant p 0 05 across strahler orders revealed areas of consistent ch4 saturated groundwater inflows which are governed by subsurface flowpaths the sampled groundwater was constantly supersaturated in ch4 0 09 0 01 µmol l 1 because groundwater discharge predominates river flow except for the heavy storm periods we infer that groundwater is an important contributor to methane although the result from a single site may not be spatially representative of the whole watershed in addition agriculture is closely related to intense erosion of fine sediments and enhanced organic matter loading to streams which can also promote ch4 production and emissions comer warner et al 2019 stanley et al 2016 the intensive agriculture coupled with severe soil erosion in the study catchment are probably the principal source of dissolved ch4 while high ch4 concentrations have been reported to be related to the extent of and connectivity with wetlands in tropical and temperate river systems marescaux et al 2018 teodoru et al 2015 there is no wetland development in this arid semiarid intensively cropped catchment noticeably the downstream pattern of dissolved ch4 across strahler orders was different from pco2 fig 2 probably due to localized differences in water chemistry and or in stream oxidation rates crawford et al 2013 hutchins et al 2020 relatively higher do levels in low order streams over all four seasons table 1 provided favourable conditions for aerobic methane oxidation leading to lowered ch4 concentrations high order streams are more likely to be impacted by agriculture and urban wastewater which are typically ch4 rich marescaux et al 2018 the high order streams are all located in the lower part of the watershed with extensive agriculture and receive largely untreated urban effluents together with ch4 laden groundwater inflows these biogeochemical processes likely led to elevated ch4 levels the observed seasonal variations in stream pco2 and ch4 concentration suggest that the two gases responded differently to changing hydrological conditions butman et al 2016 horgby et al 2019 numerous studies have showed that input of low co2 laden surface flow can dilute dic concentration and cause a pronounced seasonal pattern of riverine pco2 borges et al 2019 panneer selvam et al 2014 the substantially lower pco2 in august and october was most probably related to dilution by increased surface runoff as also testified by the lowered alkalinity and tds in the wet season which were 20 34 lower than in the dry season table 1 in contrast the high river water pco2 in march and june suggested consistent groundwater inflows moreover melting of snow and ice and the resulting mobilization of organic matter can contribute additional co2 to streams as widely observed in high latitude environments crawford et al 2013 the much narrower seasonal variation in dissolved ch4 indicated that it was not greatly affected by the dilution effect table 2 this is most likely because of the stronger impact from agriculture and urban wastewater in the wet season which has fully counteracted the dilution effect similar to the results reported for the human impacted seine watershed in france marescaux et al 2018 in comparison oxidation of ch4 during the snow and ice melting period has probably resulted in the lowest averaged ch4 concentration in march 4 2 controls on water air co2 and ch4 emissions 92 of the surveyed streams were consistent sources of co2 to the atmosphere whereas all streams were ch4 sources over the four sampling seasons regardless of location headwater first order streams were the most dynamic systems with respect to co2 emissions showing the highest mean co2 efflux among the five strahler orders and the largest spatial variation fig 2a in comparison first order streams exhibited low ch4 effluxes and a small spatial variation fig 2b the distribution of co2 effluxes across the five strahler orders is consistent with previous studies which show headwater streams tend to have the highest co2 effluxes in a stream network butman and raymond 2011 campeau et al 2014 schelker et al 2016 the largely unchanged co2 efflux from second to fourth order streams is probably due to the combination of continuous groundwater inflows and a strong carbonate buffering capacity which sustained a comparable pco2 along the three stream orders horgby et al 2019 stets et al 2017 on the contrary the elevated co2 efflux in the fifth order stream mainstream was more likely caused by the higher gas transfer velocity as an important contributor to gas transfer velocity for running waters the mainstream flow velocity in the wet season was 24 higher than the second to fourth order streams table 1 this resulted in higher co2 effluxes in the mainstream despite similar pco2 fig 2a this is one of the first studies to incorporate catchment scale ch4 emissions in arid semiarid regions as predicted diffusive ch4 effluxes were two orders of magnitude lower than co2 effluxes consistent with earlier studies in other climates such as the tropics borges et al 2019 panneer selvam et al 2014 and boreal permafrost crawford et al 2013 natchimuthu et al 2017 spatial and seasonal variations of ch4 effluxes consistently followed the dissolved ch4 concentration changes fig 2b and table 2 we infer that the ch4 emissions were primarily controlled by the ch4 concentration gradient between stream water and the overlying atmosphere continuous addition of ch4 from agriculture and to a lesser extent from urban effluents along the river course sustained ch4 effluxes at the higher order stream sites where the riverine ch4 would have otherwise been exhausted due to progressive evasion from upstream water surface this is particularly true for the growing season august in the study catchment which is coupled with strengthened subsurface and groundwater flowpaths although the ch4 concentration was constantly higher than the atmospheric equilibrium the high ch4 efflux in the mainstream 313 174 µmol m 2 d 1 was also partially driven by the stronger near surface turbulence resulting from higher flow velocities and discharge butman and raymond 2011 kokic et al 2018 raymond et al 2012 similar to the co2 efflux dynamics it is important to note that ebullition remains a significant pathway of ch4 release in these fluvial networks although previous studies have rarely accounted for ebullitive fluxes due to limited sampling regimes baulch et al 2011 stanley et al 2016 excluding the ebullitive fluxes may therefore cause great underestimations of the total ch4 evasion flux from flowing waters ghg emissions from rivers are highly dependent on the k value which has been shown to decrease with increasing strahler order borges et al 2019 crawford et al 2013 ulseth et al 2019 headwater streams tend to have larger k values because of their steeper stream channels and more turbulent flow for flowing rivers and streams near surface turbulence is originated from water column and the streambed mcdowell and johnson 2018 ulseth et al 2019 recent studies show that stream energy dissipation ed in m2 s 3 defined as the product of gravitational acceleration stream channel slope and flow velocity is a good predictor of k with a high explanatory power kokic et al 2018 raymond et al 2012 ulseth et al 2019 the k600 co2 from this study showed a statistically significant correlation with ed fig 8 the linear regression indicates that ed can explain 71 of the variability in k600 co2 across all the streams and over the four seasons nevertheless while the observed k600 co2 was consistent with the model fit results of ulseth et al 2019 when the ed is 0 02 m2 s 3 the breakpoint model for high ed i e 0 02 m2 s 3 overestimated the actual k600 co2 by 80 150 supplementary figure s5 the low k600 co2 was probably related to the distinct landscape of the clp most of the low order streams exhibit deeply incised v shaped channels as a result of progressive erosion into the highly erodible loess deposits zhang et al 2020 consequently these streams are characterized by substantially low channel slope commonly 0 008 m m 1 and weak turbulence the unexplained variability in k600 co2 suggests the importance of accounting for other factors such as water depth and discharge raymond et al 2012 in more accurately predicting k600 co2 for spatial upscaling of co2 and ch4 emissions for reservoirs the k600 co2 with an overall mean of 5 7 cm h 1 was consistent with our earlier reservoir based results 2 23 cm h 1 in the central clp ran et al 2017 while slightly higher than those reported for tropical and temperate reservoirs e g 2 4 cm h 1 amaral et al 2020 read et al 2012 this was likely caused by the landscape characteristics of the clp reservoirs in this region are absent of sheltering trees and are fully exposed to wind effects compared with sheltered systems wind driven shear in such settings can generate stronger near surface turbulence and promote faster gas emission because of higher k600 co2 values amaral et al 2020 macintyre et al 2019 in contrast tropical and temperate reservoirs are generally located in densely forested areas where the effect of wind may have been dampened by surrounding trees and tall shrubs amaral et al 2020 campeau et al 2014 the k600 co2 values from these previous studies were substantially lower than those of exposed water surfaces 4 3 impacts of dam impoundment and urban wastewater river impoundment will alter the physical and biogeochemical characteristics of pristine rivers and change riverine dynamics of gas evasion paranaíba et al 2018 teodoru et al 2015 owing to the greatly reduced flow turbulence lentic environments create favorable conditions for primary production engel et al 2019 jin et al 2018 the jing river network has been fragmented by numerous dams for soil conservation and irrigation compared to the flowing streams which were significant carbon sources at most sites reservoir waters had substantially lower co2 effluxes in magnitude and even acted as co2 sinks this was most likely caused by the enhanced photosynthesis of aquatic plants crawford et al 2016 ran et al 2017 as evidenced by the elevated chl a concentration a valuable indicator of primary production relative to the flowing streams table 1 as a result of extensive inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus from agriculture reservoirs in the clp are characteristic of highly eutrophic waters with widespread phytoplankton growth liu et al 2013 the negative relationship between chl a and pco2 further suggests that aquatic photosynthesis played a critical role in controlling pco2 and co2 evasion fig 5 in agreement with recent reports from lentic water bodies liu et al 2016 teodoru et al 2015 with a higher chl a concentration in the wet season indicating stronger autochthonous production both reservoir water pco2 and co2 efflux were substantially lower than those in the dry season table 3 this can also be testified by the seasonal variability in reservoir doc which peaked in august when the aquatic photosynthesis rate was highest as suggested by the highest temperature tables 1 and 3 despite being small co2 sources or even sinks all reservoirs were hotspots of ch4 evasion anaerobic degradation of phytoplankton biomass in reservoir sediments would produce substantial methane through methanogenesis borges et al 2019 engel et al 2019 further the shallow water column usually 10 m deep may have also limited the oxidation of ch4 jin et al 2018 lei et al 2019 a large fraction of the produced ch4 by anerobic metabolism near the reservoir bottom was readily transported to the surface for emission hence a shorter retention time of the sediment derived ch4 in the overlying aerobic water column reduces ch4 oxidation and leads to a higher ch4 concentration in the surface water this can partially explain the highest seasonal mean ch4 concentration 0 46 0 23 µmol l 1 in june when the water level was lowest due to water withdrawal for irrigation while the do was also lowest among the four seasons table 1 in contrast although the ch4 concentration was positively correlated to chl a fig 5 as observed in other studies león palmero et al 2020 paranaíba et al 2018 it seems that phytoplankton biomass itself is not a major control on ch4 production because the mean chl a concentration in june was indeed lowest among the four seasons table 1 this suggests that other physical factors such as sediment characteristics and oxygen concentration are also critical in regulating ch4 production baulch et al 2011 delsontro et al 2016 the dominance of ebullition in the total ch4 evasion from reservoirs is in line with recent observations in lentic ecosystems delsontro et al 2016 paranaíba et al 2018 the increased dominance of ebullition in june and august was likely caused by the lowered solubility of ch4 due to the higher water temperatures as shown in table 1 this demonstrates that there will be a greater potential for ch4 ebullition from such systems under a warming climate thus leading to higher ch4 emissions as bubbles in comparison ch4 diffusion from lentic waters is controlled by wind driven turbulence paranaíba et al 2018 the variability in the diffusive ch4 efflux in october march and june reflected the dissolved ch4 dynamics table 3 because the wind was generally 1 m s 1 table 1 and the k600 ch4 values were largely equivalent 2 4 1 6 cm h 1 range 0 5 5 3 cm h 1 the k600 ch4 in august 4 4 2 1 cm h 1 was substantially higher due to the stronger winds that were 40 to 6 fold higher in august 0 3 2 2 m s 1 than in the other three seasons table 1 consequently the highest seasonal ch4 diffusion efflux was observed in august although the concurrent ch4 concentration was at a relatively low level table 3 compared with rivers which were large co2 sources the magnitude of co2 emissions from the tumengou reservoir was also greatly reduced fig 7 and the reservoir acted as a local co2 sink due to enhanced aquatic primary production in all seasons except august the small co2 efflux in august was likely due to high terrestrial soil co2 and organic carbon inputs triggered by heavy storms supplementary figure s2 which may have outweighed the concurrently strong aquatic production in maintaining the co2 dynamics it is worth noting that the released water site 3 displayed stronger emissions than the upstream river site 1 fig 7 except in june indicative of strong co2 production within the reservoir the released co2 rich water from the reservoir sustained the high pco2 and efflux which agreed well with recent studies on co2 emissions from reservoirs crawford et al 2016 teodoru et al 2015 although the tumengou reservoir is 40 years old with limited terrestrial biomass inputs the longitudinal changes suggest that it remains a hotspot of ch4 emission and the high efflux will likely continue in future fig 7 when co2 and ch4 are taken together the reduced co2 emissions have largely been offset by the enhanced ch4 emissions therefore not accounting for either of the gases may lead to significant biases in estimating the ghg emission budget of reservoirs in addition to extensive agriculture and damming riverine c cycling in this catchment has been affected by urban wastewater an example is site 4 fig 7a which is 11 km downstream of a city with 32 000 residents who discharge largely untreated domestic wastewater into the river aquatic metabolism of labile organic matter in such a polluted urban river can support the high pco2 and ch4 concentration jin et al 2018 smith et al 2017 this is particularly true for the dry season march and june when the dilution by flood runoff was weak fig 7b and d to illustrate urban wastewater impact we further compared ghg emissions from natural urban rivers and reservoirs fig 9 for the three stream sites downstream of sewage inflows that account for roughly 35 80 of the stream runoff both ghg concentration and efflux were substantially higher than that in natural rivers and reservoirs especially for ch4 the ch4 concentration was negatively correlated to the do level ch4 0 083 do 1 024 r2 0 49 p 0 001 n 12 which corroborated the importance of in stream anaerobic decomposition of organic matter rich urban wastewater in sustaining the high ch4 production and emissions marescaux et al 2018 4 4 implications for inland water c budgets both riverine pco2 and co2 effluxes in this study fell within the range of previous studies in tropical temperate boreal and arid semiarid systems table 4 the averaged seasonal effluxes of co2 55 mmol m 2 d 1 and ch4 346 µmol m 2 d 1 were comparable to those reported from temperate and boreal river systems while lower than those from tropical rivers however in contrast to tropical temperate and boreal rivers where co2 is mainly derived from in stream processing of recent organic matter and or soil respiration borges et al 2019 crawford et al 2016 here the co2 is originated from groundwater inflows and the pco2 is modulated by carbonate buffering our earlier work in the clp indicated that the degassed co2 was 810 1890 years old ran et al 2018 considerably older than the recently fixed organic carbon e g 50 years as such co2 evasion from these arid semiarid rivers represents a net carbon source for the atmosphere over the millennium timescale in addition both pco2 and co2 efflux are largely equivalent among arid semiarid rivers where groundwater with high dic content predominates river flow table 1 this indicates the strong modulation of pco2 by carbonate buffering caused by intense chemical weathering duvert et al 2019 stets et al 2017 noticeably the averaged pco2 885 415 µatm for streams of the jing river catchment were similar to values measured in the wuding river catchment 881µatm in the central clp this suggests that the spatially homogeneous soil property of the clp played a critical role in governing its river water pco2 although the two basins display different geomorphological structures this makes it possible for upscaling of co2 emissions from the entire clp fluvial network by discrete sampling in representative rivers while the ch4 concentration does not significantly differ among arid semiarid and temperate rivers it is generally higher in boreal and tropical rivers where it varies by three orders of magnitude table 4 this distinct spatial pattern is probably related to the extent of wetlands and backwater several recent studies discovered that organic matter from wetlands and backwater in tropical systems were the primary factor in sustaining the high ch4 concentrations amaral et al 2020 borges et al 2019 similarly the reducing conditions of expanding wetlands in boreal rivers were of paramount importance in leading to the elevated ch4 levels crawford et al 2013 natchimuthu et al 2017 in contrast arid semiarid catchments are generally absent of wetlands and backwater due to low precipitation the observed low ch4 concentrations likely reflect groundwater derived ch4 and the contribution of ch4 production from human activities e g farming damming and urban wastewater nevertheless the total ch4 effluxes diffusion ebullition from the arid semiarid jing river catchment are comparable to those observed in other climate regions table 4 due largely to the higher k values our study suggests that arid semiarid rivers are important ghg emitters however existing studies on ghg evasion are mostly conducted in tropical temperate and boreal regions which have long been thought to contribute disproportionately to global ghg emissions from inland waters borges et al 2015 campeau et al 2014 the significance of arid semiarid rivers has not yet been fully recognized their contribution to total inland water ghg emissions has been systematically underestimated due to the spatially fragmented data and lack of catchment scale studies addressing both gas emissions in view of the abundance of arid semiarid rivers in the global fluvial networks allen and pavelsky 2018 future estimates of ghg evasion will be significantly biased if they are not properly accounted for moreover arid semiarid rivers are likely to dry out intermittently with the progression of climate change the ghg emissions from exposed sediments following the desiccation of rivers can be considerable keller et al 2020 and must thus be included in future carbon budgets 4 5 limitations and future research although four intensive campaigns were performed to investigate the seasonal variations in ghg dynamics co2 and ch4 emissions at ice thaw were not measured in this study recent studies have suggested that hydrological inputs of co2 and ch4 at ice thaw represent an important pathway of ghg emissions denfeld et al 2018 vachon et al 2017 hence future work to measure ghg emissions during ice thaw is needed to better determine ghg fluxes on the annual scale furthermore the significance of groundwater in modulating aquatic co2 and ch4 emissions in this study is likely associated with great uncertainty because of the limited groundwater sampling our findings on the controls of riverine ghg dynamics may have also been influenced by the incomplete chl a measurement in august table 1 thus future research to examine the impacts of basin wide groundwater inflows and biological processes in the aquatic ecosystems in affecting ghg dynamics is needed 5 conclusions our spatially highly resolved sampling over four seasons in the jing river catchment enabled us to capture the magnitude of co2 and ch4 emissions and identify the primary driving factors because of the strong carbonate buffering effect the river water pco2 changes along the stream network differed from the commonly observed pattern while riverine co2 was primarily derived from groundwater inflows in stream processing of organic matter mobilized by soil erosion was also an important source as demonstrated by the undersaturated do the seasonal variability of pco2 indicated hydrological controls which showed a pronounced dilution effect in the wet season the stream network was consistently oversaturated in ch4 that varied between 0 06 and 0 77 µmol l 1 this reflects the combined impacts of groundwater discharges and agriculture and local contributions from urban wastewater both co2 and ch4 emissions were characterized by distinct spatial and seasonal variability which was controlled by flow regime the highest co2 efflux was observed in headwater streams mean 80 mmol m 2 d 1 due to the highest k values and in august mean 102 mmol m 2 d 1 when flows were most turbulent the increasing ch4 efflux along the stream network 8 µmol m 2 d 1 per strahler order although not significant were sustained by continuous ch4 inputs from agriculture and partially from urban effluents while the significance of ebullition in lentic ecosystems has been widely recognized we found that ebullition was also an important mode of ch4 evasion from flowing waters reservoirs showed considerably lower co2 effluxes while higher ch4 effluxes than the upstream flowing streams the stagnant waters after damming created favorable conditions for enhanced aquatic productivity which reduced reservoir water pco2 and the magnitude of co2 evasion anaerobic degradation of organic rich sediments produced large quantities of methane within the water column that resulted in elevated ch4 levels relative to pristine streams in addition urban effluent discharges have substantially increased riverine ch4 concentration although the impact is typically local and might have disappeared downstream both reservoirs and urban wastewater fed rivers presented considerably higher ch4 effluxes constituting important ch4 emission hotspots considering the unprecedented dam construction and urbanization worldwide these highly localized emission hotspots will be of global importance in estimating ghg emissions from inland waters our study contributes to the understanding of ghg dynamics in arid semiarid river systems which show comparable co2 and ch4 effluxes to those observed in other climate zones these findings illustrate that future efforts attempting to refine global or regional ghg emissions from inland waters need to pay equal attention to arid semiarid rivers failure to account for these river systems would produce large uncertainties in determining total ghg emissions and describing their significance in the global c cycle credit authorship contribution statement lishan ran conceptualization methodology writing

4529,while it is widely accepted that the magnitude of river water quality degradation depends upon the proportion of human interventions the overall changes are ultimately the consequence of interconnected biogeochemical processes with poorly understood role of ecosystem feedbacks here we conducted in situ and incubation experiments considering a 620 km ganga river main stem two tributaries and two point source downstream locations for trajectory studies to analyze the human driven changes in ecosystem feedback associated changes in ecosystem functioning of the ganga river and its tributaries the main stem coupled trajectory analyses show that benthic hypoxia anoxia resulting from intensive human releases generates positive feedbacks sediment p and metal release to exacerbate the degradation of ecosystem functioning in the ganga river and tributaries we found 1 9 to 4 6 times higher rates of sediment p release and about 1 1 to 3 7 times higher rates of sediment metal releases at sites with dosw 2 0 mg l excess release of phosphorus from sediment enhanced the eutrophy whereas sediment metal release and bioavailability led to a sharp decline in microbial biomass and fdaase activity the carlson s index ecological response index dodds s trophic state classification and risk index support these results because the sites with benthic hypoxic anoxic condition did show trophic state in eutrophic to hypereutrophic range and metal pollution in very high to extremely polluted and high risk category indicating significant effect of these drivers the study for the first time showed that positive feedbacks exacerbate the degradation of ecosystem functioning in human impacted large rivers we suggest the need for increased efforts considering the magnitude and connectivity of positive feedbacks and associated repercussions for improving mechanistic understanding of their contributions to overall structural and functional shifts in the large rivers keywords benthic hypoxia anoxia dissolved oxygen ecosystem feedbacks ganga river sediment metal release sediment p release 1 introduction widespread distribution of excessive c n and p in inland and coastal waters has caused degradation of water quality and an increase in hypoxic anoxic areas rabalais et al 2010 excess n and p enhance algal blooms and coupled with allochthonous c rapidly enlarge the consumption of dissolved oxygen required for inland fisheries and healthy aquatic habitats bottom water oxygen is also strongly influenced by other oxygen demanding substances ods including fe and mn flushed to the water systems from natural and anthropogenic sources oxygen deficiency in bottom waters can damage habitats for living resources and influence biogeochemical processes that control nutrient and heavy metal release from bed sediment to overlying waters hu et al 2001 villnäs et al 2012 which in turn accelerate the rates of eutrophy and metal pollution positive feedbacks arising either by natural or anthropogenic drivers are intrinsic to virtually all ecosystems aquatic ecosystems provide striking examples to understand how positive feedbacks are integral to the dynamics of ecosystem functioning stone and weisburd 1992 van nes and scheffer 2005 in contrast to general notions which address positive feedback effects as desirable for instance microorganisms portray multitude of positive feedbacks to recycle resources a careful reassessment shows that positive feedback effects can often be disadvantageous particularly for human impacted ecosystems neubert and caswell 1997 scheffer et al 2001 2019a positive feedbacks despite being inherent to ecosystem functioning are often destabilizing because they delay the time required by the system to recover from perturbations deangelis 1980 van nes and scheffer 2007 for example if eutrophy persist for longer time period or if the concentrations of sediment based oxygen demanding substances remains high it will trigger benthic hypoxia anoxia leading the ecosystem to behave chaotically even if the external forcing is removed may 1977 the latter may trigger positive feedback for instance sediment p and metal release jaiswal and pandey 2019a 2020 the self fertilizing effects associated with sediment p release can exacerbate eutrophy whereas those associated with sediment metal release will enhance toxic effects on aquatic organisms and human consumers when an ecosystem become degraded by pollution it becomes useful to distinguish immediate effects from those which become apparent after a long time period the immediate effects are generally in proportion to inputs demonstrating a direct causal connection in terms of source concentration dependence on a long time scale or if the disturbances continued we may expect that a progressive loss of ecosystem functioning will arise that may be more destabilizing than what is being predicted for human impacted aquatic ecosystems these changes may occur simultaneously or sequentially and often more detrimental or reach the level where the ecosystem alterations are irreversible understanding these unanticipated and likely irreversible shifts should be an important criteria for policy decisions in surface water management also this invites concern for cautious assessment of anthropogenically impacted water bodies specially the large rivers where the complexities arising from hydrologic control make the prediction uncertain harris and heathwaite 2012 despite the fact that the ganga river is lifeline of 43 of indian population no study so far is available assessing the anthropogenically induced shifts in ecosystem feedback associated changes in the river the studies conducted so far on the ganga river generally consider direct causal connections addressing the magnitude of carbon nutrient and heavy metal loading and associated risk analysis with respect to physico chemical changes fisheries and human consumers pandey et al 2014 jaiswal and pandey 2018 kumar et al 2020 siddiqui et al 2020 there is a lack of studies on major world rivers in general and on the river ganga in particular focusing on how and to what extent anthropogenic inputs are driving positive feedback associated changes in the ecosystem functioning our recent field trials have signaled mosaic of benthic habitat fragmentation in the ganga river jaiswal and pandey 2019a pandey et al 2019 to move a step ahead to our previous field and laboratory trials here we hypothesized that human driven changes in sediment water interaction may increase the degradation of ecosystem functioning in the ganga river the objective was to assess if the human driven positive feedbacks sediment p and bioavailable metal release exacerbate eutrophy and toxicological implications in the ganga river to achieve our goal we consider two trophic state indices and dodds s trophic state classification to test trophic state shifts and two toxicity indices entwined with microbial biomass and activity changes to pin point toxicological implications we found that the sites such as jajmau and those situated close to point sources with highest rates of sediment p and bioavailable metal releases are hypereutrophic and have high risk to metal pollution a synergism between such multiple and consequential effects will magnify the overall adverse effects beyond the level expected for individual factors considered in isolation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we conducted in situ and incubation studies along a 620 km long middle segment of the river ganga between kannauj city 27 10 n lat 79 75 e long and varanasi 25 32 n lat 83 03 e long this river basin covers 26 2 area of india and includes two major river systems the ganga and the brahmputra the ganga river traverses 2525 km through the widely spread gangetic plains and forms world s largest mangrove delta the ganga river receives pollutants from cities situated along the bank in the form of urban sewage industrial release and atmospheric deposition agricultural runoff also flushes large input of pollutants to the river the climate in the ganges basin ranges between tropical to sub tropical with three different seasons in a year a humid rainy from july to september a cold winter from november to february and a dry and hot summer from april to june season a major part of the rainfall 70 80 occurs during monsoon period july september the temperature in the basin varies between 4 c and 46 c the soil is mainly alluvial fluvisol with high natural fertility and represents various combinations of sandy loamy and clayey soils 2 2 experimental protocol 2 2 1 in situ studies we conducted the study in three sets during may june for four consecutive years 2016 2019 first set represents the main stem of the ganga river and includes sites such as kannauj knuj jajmau jjmu sangam sngm and rajghat rjht the second set with four sampling sites each in the main stem of the ramganga and varuna river represents 2 0 8 0 km upstream to their confluences with the ganga in the third set we consider trajectories downstream wazidpur drain at kanpur wpdr and assi drain at varanasi asdr with 11 equidistant locations 100 m apart which covered 1 0 km distance in main stem of the river fig 1 to identify the mechanistic links we divided each site into 3 sub sites triplicate samples were collected from each site at a distance of 25 m reach and combined together to get composite samples 2 2 2 incubation experiments for incubation studies undisturbed sediment samples were kept at the bottom of constructed air tight chambers dimensions 15 cm 20 cm 30 cm which were then filled with water collected from respective sampling site to match the original status of do of respective sites two do levels were maintained in these chambers 1 the anoxic to hypoxic level 0 to 2 mg l no stirring and aeration and 2 the sub oxic to oxic level 2 5 mg l intermittent stirring and aeration constant temperature 30 c of overlying water was maintained throughout the incubation period each chamber was kept in dark area so that photosynthetic oxygen production can be minimized regular measurements of do and temperature of the overlying waters were done initial concentrations of phosphorus and metals in the overlying waters were measured then periodic estimations were done at intervals of 1 h for 7 days for measuring the rate of sediment p and metal release the samples were collected with the help of pipette from interface of sediment and water of the incubation chambers at an interval of one hour and enough care was taken to minimize disturbances in sediment and overlying waters an equal amount of millipore water was added so that constant water column can be maintained these samples were filtered using cellulose fiber filters having pore size 0 45 μm and stored for analyses after acidification by 2 hno3 2 3 sample collection we collected samples for in situ as well as for incubation studies from 25 m reach during peak low flow may june for the years 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 we collected samples in acid rinsed polyethylene bottles from sub surface 15 to 25 cm and from sediment water interface stainless steel corers were used for collecting the sediment samples from 0 to 2 and 5 10 cm depth these collected samples were stored in ice boxes at a temperature of 4 c and brought to the laboratory for further analyses in laboratory the samples were kept at 4 c in black brown bags to maintain the original status of samples and stop photosynthesis the sediment samples were divided into three parts one part of fresh sediments was kept in desiccators for maintaining the moisture level to 80 and was used for measurement of enzyme activity second part was kept intact in corers to be used in incubation experiments and third part was kept at room temperature for air drying for 3 to 4 days then grinded in mortar and pestle and sieved from 2 mm mesh for further analysis 2 4 measurements the do in water samples collected from the interface of sediment and water was fixed at sampling site following winkler s standard method apha 1998 the relationships given by sànchez et al 2007 was followed to calculate the dissolved oxygen deficit at the interface of sediment and water dodsw dos doa where dodsw dissolved oxygen deficit at sediment water interface dos do concentration at saturation and doa actual do mg l the biological oxygen demand bod was estimated as bod5 following eaton et al 1995 the chemical oxygen demand cod was quantified using potassium dichromate method apha 1998 we followed ling et al 2009 for measuring the sediment oxygen demand sod the phosphorus concentration was determined following murphy and riley 1962 and toc analyzer lotix combustion toc analyzer was used to quantify the total organic carbon toc chloroform fumigation extraction method was used to measure the microbial biomass c cmic jenkinson and powlson 1976 for estimation of metal concentrations in sediment the samples were digested in mixtures of three acids hno3 hcl hclo4 in a ratio of 5 1 1 for this a microwave digestion extraction system was used sineo model no mds 6g the concentrations were measured using aas perkin elmer analyst 800 usa total bio available metal fraction was measured using ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid single step extraction process ure 1996 spectrophotometric method was followed for measuring the fluorescein diacetate hydrolase fdaase activity the fdaase involves all the three classes of enzymes lipase esterase and protease and is used as a proximate of total microbial activity schnurer and rosswall 1982 costa et al 2007 for this the sediment samples were incubated at 24 c with fluorescein diacetate and the fluorescein formed was measured by taking the absorbance at 400 nm 2 5 eutrophication and metal pollution indices based on our data we computed three indices to address state of eutrophy and metal pollution we also considered dodds s classification system dodds 2006 to compare our results on trophic state 2 5 1 trophic state index tsi here we consider carlson s trophic state index using total phosphorus tp data carlson 1977 this index is originally developed for lakes but it is highly comparable to other indices developed for large rivers jaiswal and pandey 2019b usually tp concentrations in rivers are higher than in lakes so the marginal difference in classification may depend on river vs lake the tsi was calculated using the following empirical relationship tsi tp 14 42 ln tp 4 15 tsi 40 represents oligotrophic 40 to 50 mesotrophic 50 to 70 eutrophic and 70 represents a hypereutrophic condition 2 5 2 ecological response index eri the eri simultaneously address metal pollution and eutrophy in large rivers it was calculated following jaiswal and pandey 2019b e r i f d a a s e c m i c t o c t h m where toc total organic carbon cmic microbial biomass c ʃthm i 1 n m i and mi concentration of ith metal on a scale of 0 320 the eri between 0 and 24 represents extreme metal pollution 25 38 a combination of metal pollution and eutrophy 39 77 low metal pollution and hypereutrophy 78 155 eutrophy and 156 320 represents the oligotrophic state 2 5 3 dodds s trophic state classification dodds 2006 dodd s trophic state classification is originally designed for streams here the relative frequency distribution of phosphorus was used to define trophic state the lower third of distribution values represent oligotrophic state middle third indicate mesotrophic state whereas top third values show the eutrophic state 2 5 4 risk index ri the ri was calculated following håkanson 1980 r i i 1 n e r i here e r i represents ecological risk e r i t r i c f i where t r i is toxic response factor represented by a fixed value for an individual element håkanson 1980 as zn 1 cr 2 cu pb ni 5 and cd 30 the c f i represents contamination factor c f i ci co where ci measured concentration of a metal at a site and co background concentration of metal we considered dev prayag the least polluted site of the ganga river for background concentration jaiswal and pandey 2018 the ri 150 represents low ecological risk 150 to 300 represents moderate 300 to 600 considerable and 600 represents very high level of ecological risk 2 6 statistical analysis to define uncertainties the data have been shown as mean and supported by standard error of means se to justify the significance of data a confidence limit above 95 was considered principal component analyses pca was used to identify the relationships between different variables for statistical analysis we used statistical software past version 2 17c and sigmaplot version 11 0 3 results 3 1 main stem trends for main stem sites of river ganga the concentration of dosw appeared highest at sngm site and lowest at jjmu site at temporal scale we found highest concentrations in the month of may fig 2 the dodsw and oxygen demanding processes such as cod and sod followed trend opposite to dosw the dodsw cod and sod values ranged from 6 63 to 8 08 mg l 1 from 21 32 to 48 35 mg l 1 and from 6 25 to 13 77 g o2 m2 day respectively the bod showed deviation and recorded maximum at rjht site and minimum at sngm site fig 2 the sediment p release did show a trend synchronous to the dodsw and ranged from 9 39 to 17 42 mg m2 day the values were minimum at the sngm and maximum at the jjmu site fig 2 the concentration of phosphate po4 3 in river water and toc in the riverbed sediment showed spatiotemporal synchrony with dodsw and the values varied between 117 89 mg l 1 sngm site and 185 26 mg l 1 jjmu site and between 3 48 and 4 68 respectively fig 3 similar to the dosw the cmic and fdaase activity was maximum at sngm and minimum at jjmu site at temporal scale also the microbial biomass and activity showed synchrony with dosw fig 3 the incubation study results of heavy metal release from riverbed sediment of the ganga river showed higher releases of all the study metals in μg m2 d from the sites where dosw appear below 1 0 mg l 1 fig 4 table 1 the tsi results showed a tendency towards hyper eutrophy table 2 whereas dodds s classification indicate knuj jjmu and rjht to be eutrophic fig 5 the eri identified knuj jjmu as extremely metal polluted and rjht with a metal pollution and eutrophy table 2 in ramganga and varuna rivers the dosw was lowest at site 1 away from the confluence and highest at site 4 closest to the confluence the respective values of dosw in these river varied between 0 29 and 0 61 mg l 1 and between 0 10 and 0 51 mg l 1 respectively fig 2 the dodsw showed trends opposite to dosw for both the rivers the deficits were highest in the month of june the oxygen demanding processes bod cod and sod showed synchrony with dodsw at both the scales however the bod and sod was higher for the varuna river sites whereas cod was higher for the ramganga river sites fig 2 similar to dodsw the sediment p release for both the rivers were found to be maximum at site 1 and minimum at site 4 the concentration of toc ranged between 4 23 site 4 and 4 72 site 1 for the ramganga river and between 7 21 site 4 and 7 65 site 1 for the varuna river fig 3 similar to toc the concentration of po4 3 was higher at the varura river sites compared to those at the ramganga sites at temporal scale both the toc and po4 3 were higher in the month of june the cmic and fdaase showed synchrony with dosw for both the main stems however the values were comparatively higher for the ramganga river fig 3 the incubation experiments showed a little higher rate of sediment metal release for main stem of the varuna river compared to those for the ramganga river the release rates for all the study metals were higher at site 1 for both the rivers fig 4 our comparisons based on tsi eri ri and dodds s classification all showed eutrophy and metal associated risk at sites with high sediment p release and metal release fig 5 table 2 3 2 point source downstream trends the dosw remained close to anoxia at locations close to assi drain mouth asdr and up to 300 m downstream the wazidpur drain wpdr fig 6 we found dosw 1 0 mg l 1 at sites situated up to 200 m downstream the asdr and up to 500 m downstream the wpdr whereas the respective values below 2 0 mg l level were reported at sites situated up to 400 m and 800 m downstream the drains the dodsw followed trend contrasting to dosw and the values decreased consistently downstream the drains the bod cod and sod showed similar trend for point sources the bod was comparatively higher at asdr and the values declined from 27 94 to 12 66 mg l 1 whereas at wpdr the values decreased from 20 86 to 7 81 mg l 1 the cod and sod values were significantly higher downstream the wpdr in comparison to those at asdr fig 6 the sediment p release also showed similar trend and the values ranged from 3 78 to 18 56 mg m2 day downstream asdr and from 4 71 to 23 95 mg m2 day at sites situated downstream the wpdr the toc and po4 3 concentrations showed decreasing trend at both the drains however the values were comparatively higher at the asdr at temporal scale the values were higher in the month of june fig 7 the tsi at asdr and wpdr ranged from 78 34 to 104 54 indicating hyper eutrophic condition table 2 although dodds s classification ranked these locations in mesotrophic to eutrophic state fig 5 the cmic and fdaase showed variable trend for both the drains at asdr downstream sites these showed declining trend whereas at wpdr downstream sites the values showed an increasing trend at wpdr the cmic increased from 233 61 to 519 39 μg c g 1 and fdaase increased from to 29 68 to 80 26 μm fluorescein g 1 hr 1 at temporal scale the microbial biomass and activity both were highest in the month of june at asdr whereas these were highest in the month of may for wpdr downstream locations fig 7 the incubation results showed increased rate of sediment metal releases from riverbed sediment downstream the wpdr compared to the asdr a higher rate of sediment metal release was reported up to 600 m downstream the wpdr and up to 400 m downstream the asdr at temporal scale the metal release was higher in the month of june for both the drains fig 8 these results appeared synchronous to eri and ri at sediment water interface table 2 4 discussion despite extensive research on eutrophication as a primary cause of water quality degradation many key questions remain unanswered smith and schindler 2009 much is to be understood with respect to the interactions that can be expected to occur between c eutrophy overall carbon pool and ecosystem feedbacks which can alter the states posing further complexities to delay the recovery from nutrient loading controls schindler et al 2008 although such complexities prohibit accurate predictions certain attributes emerge as generic markers of ecosystem fragility that may be used to detect if the system is close to a tipping point two distinct feedback determinants sediment p release and sediment metal release have led to these insights although hypoxia anoxia is the common causal link for both the cases one feedback uncovers a generic empirical marker of p eutrophy pandey and yadav 2017 with likely effects on trophic cascades whereas the other one reveals the state of increasing metal pollution exacerbating the toxicological implications here we present the results of in situ and incubation experiments to show that hypoxia anoxia induced ecosystem feedbacks sediment p and metal release enhance eutrophy and toxicological implications in the ganga river 4 1 benthic oxygen deficiency causal linkages the depletion of benthic oxygen level has become a common response to human driven perturbations in aquatic ecosystems the hypoxic anoxic areas in the oceans around the world are rapidly increasing 2 45 105 km2 diaz and rosenberg 2008 for a lotic ecosystem the occurrence of hypoxic anoxic zones is not a common phenomenon due probably to the hydrological continuum however the increasing and continuous addition of oxygen demanding substances ods in rivers has been reported to have caused the development of do deficient zones in some of the heavily polluted rivers and river estuaries around the world conley et al 2009 pandey et al 2019 here we found hypoxic anoxic levels of do at interface of sediment and water i e dosw 2 0 mg l in the main stem with severity being high at jjmu and knuj sites dosw 1 0 mg l medium at rjht site dosw 1 5 mg l and low at sngm site dosw 2 0 mg l at jjmu the river receives about 171 million liters per day mld treated and 168 mld untreated sewage from point sources also this segment of the river receives over 200 mld industrial effluents and 400 tonnes of chemical rich wastes from over 450 tanneries cpcb 2013 on the other hand near knuj the ramganga tributary with bod load 7 1 29 mg l and cod load 15 2 55 5 mg l khan et al 2016 adds high amount of ods in the main river siddiqui et al 2019 reported highest value of pollution load index pli 8 and potential ecological risk index peri 300 at sites situated in the middle segment of the ganga river the synchrony of high ods load prolonged hypoxia anoxia and associated risk clearly indicated strong anthropogenic impacts at these sites the sites located in the main stem of the ramganga and varuna tributaries also showed dosw below 1 0 mg l 1 indicating very high load of ods in these tributaries the dodsw at these sites showed strong synchrony with oxygen demanding processes such as bod cod and sod indicating the combined effect of these process creating hypoxic anoxic zones in the river the ganga river receives bod load of 2 5 106 kg day out of which over 53 comes through domestic sewage and rest 47 through industrial sources cpcb 2013 further each day the ramganga adds about 1 32 105 kg and assi drain about 4 06 103 kg bod load to the ganga river additionally high nutrient loading to this river pandey et al 2014 singh and pandey 2019 increases eutrophy supplementing further to the rate of oxygen consumption the river produces 102 58 gg autochthonous c and receives 1 81 tg toc through atmospheric deposition 16 16 26 90 tg toc through surface runoff and over 110 gg toc through point sources annually singh and pandey 2019 our main stem and trajectories analyses results did show high concentrations of po4 3 and toc and high values of chemical oxygen demand cod indicating high organic pollution load to the river lockdown covid 19 period studies show a massive improvement in water quality kumar et al 2020 indicating that during normal period point and non point source driven inputs degrade water quality of the ganga river in addition to water column associated sources the ods in bed sediment also exert pressure on do level raun et al 2010 jaiswal and pandey 2019c our results show high sediment oxygen demand sod at sites close to the mouth of the drain and all sites of main stem of tributaries in water bodies affected by multiple anthropogenic activities the sod increases the oxygen demand by 50 macpherson et al 2007 which may lead to habitat fragmentation shift in benthic communities and trophic cascades rabalais et al 2001 we found low values of cmic and fdaase activity coinciding with sod at all study sites except those situated downstream asdr indicating alteration in microbial community strong linkages between sod and benthic hypoxia anoxia provide cue about the state of ods useful in understanding the magnitude and nature of such human perturbations gibbons et al 2014 4 2 hypoxia anoxia driven ecosystem feedbacks in addition to the death of benthic dwellers including fisheries diaz and rosenberg 2008 benthic hypoxia anoxia induces a number of ecosystem feedbacks conley et al 2009 such as sediment p release and metal release which may exacerbate the degradation of water quality and aquatic ecosystem functioning the hypoxic anoxic condition breaks the bond between phosphate and iron oxides causing the release of phosphorus from the riverbed sediment to overlying water column middelburg and levin 2009 sediment p release was recorded highest at the mouth of wpdr drain followed by the mouth of asdr indicating linkages of sediment p release with benthic hypoxia anoxia prevailed during the study period the sites with dosw level 2 0 mg l 1 show higher rate of p release comparative to those characterized by sub oxic or oxic levels of dosw about 1 95 to 4 6 times higher rate of p release was reported at sites with hypoxic anoxic level of dosw compared to those with oxic level sediment p release at the rates exceeding 100 mg m2 week have been reported from anaerobic sediment of the han river whereas at sites with aerobic sediment the sediment p release was very low kim et al 2003 similar dependency of sediment p release on do levels has been reported for hampshire avon and herefordshire wye river basins jarvie et al 2005 abshineh river jalali and peikam 2013 and nene river tye et al 2016 increased release of sediment p has also been reported from heavily polluted rivers at locations characterized by high concentration of oxygen demanding substances zhang et al 2017 we also found a strong coherence of sediment p release with do levels along all the study gradients indicating that benthic hypoxia anoxia induces sediment p release as a positive feedback that may further exacerbate eutrophy our study further shows the impact of dod on sediment metal release the sediment acts as reservoir of heavy metals and about 85 of metals entering in water bodies accumulates into the bed sediments zhang et al 2016 a change in redox condition at the sediment water interface swi affects the bond between metals and other compounds transforming the bed sediment from a sink to source of metals atkinson et al 2007 kang et al 2019 through incubation studies we found significant release of metals from the bed sediments for sites characterized by hypoxic anoxic levels of dosw the trajectory analysis did show high rate of metal release up to 400 m downstream the asdr and up to 700 m downstream the wpdr the principal component analyses pca separates ecosystem feedbacks opposite to the dosw showing that the hypoxic anoxic condition enhances feedbacks including sediment metal release fig 9 hypoxia driven metal release from the bed sediment has been recorded by banks et al 2012 and liu et al 2019 a change in redox condition at swi also enhances the metal bioavailability eggleton and thomas 2004 higher concentrations of bioavailable fraction of study metals were found in sediment at swi in comparison to those in riverbed sediment rs at sites where dosw appear below 2 0 mg l 1 table 1 further the difference in concentrations did appear highest at sites with dosw 0 5 mg l 1 followed by successive declining levels of dosw with dosw above 2 0 mg l 1 the metal concentration at swi appear lower than those in rs the highest difference between swi and rs metal concentration was recorded at sites close to wpdr mouth a coherence in dosw 2 0 mg l 1 rate of metal release and bioavailability shows that the benthic hypoxia anoxia regulates the bioavailability and metal release from the sediment which can be expected to enhance toxicological implications and a shift in overall biogeochemical cycling of metals 4 3 impacts of ecosystem feedbacks positive feedbacks are integral to the dynamics of ecosystem functioning stone and weisburd 1992 van nes and scheffer 2005 for instance microorganism driven recycling of multitude of resources although some feedbacks are often disadvantageous particularly for human impacted ecosystems neubert and caswell 1997 scheffer et al 2001 2019a positive feedbacks despite being integral are often destabilizing and delay the time required to recover deangelis 1980 van nes and scheffer 2007 we consider carlson s trophic state index tsi ecological response index eri and dodds 2006 classification of trophic state as response determinants to benthic hypoxia anoxia induced release of sediment p we found trophic state in eutrophic to hypereutrophic range at sites with dosw below 2 0 mg l 1 table 2 the tsi and dodds s classification although showed little variation in the main stem did show wide variation in trajectory analysis downstream asdr and wpdr opposite to tsi the eri increased downstream of point sources and in main stem with values being maximum at sngm site of the ganga river and site 4 of both the tributaries table 2 these results show that hypoxia anoxia induced p release in the water column ultimately enhanced the eutrophy with likely increase in microbial degradation and oxygen consumption under such condition the state of hypoxia anoxia will persist for long time and delay the ecosystem recovery or even make the recovery impossible in long term future jaiswal and pandey 2019a european union framework directives have identified the p release from riverine sediments as an indicator of poor ecological status tye et al 2016 another important repercussion of sediment driven imbalances in water level p is that it will alter the n p stoichiometry of the system studies show that elemental stoichiometry plays regulatory role in resource competition makulla and sommer 1993 and ecosystem driven nutrient cycling elser et al 2009 a decline in n p ratio elevated p shifts the phytoplankton assemblage towards diazotrophic cyanobacteria elser et al 2000 and p favored diatoms pandey et al 2017 the ganga river receives huge quantity of p from various anthropogenic sources yadav and pandey 2017 singh and pandey 2019 thus the surplus of sediment added p will enhance the magnitude of consequences associated to altered n p stoichiometry the overall influence will be an altered cellular nutrient balance phytoplankton composition community dominance biogeochemical cycling carbon sequestration biological diversity and trophic cascades teubner and dokulil 2002 elser et al 2009 pandey and yadav 2015 large scale escape of shrimps crab and finfish crown has been reported from oxygen deficient water at the mouth of mississippi river buck 1996 slavik et al 2004 have shown a drastic shift in trophic status after extreme p loading from fertilizers and sediment p release leading to replacement of epilithic diatoms by mosses bryophytes as dominant group of primary producers the study further shows that dissolved oxygen deficit at sediment water interface induces sediment metal release and bioavailability this merit attention because external inputs if coupled with internal release can exacerbate toxicological implications further because the bio available fractions have greater mobility and toxicity xu et al 2017 the increased bioavailability need serious attention to address this issue we used microbial biomass c cmic and fdaase activity a proxy of total microbial activity to assess the effect of benthic hypoxia anoxia induced sediment metal release a drastic decrease in cmic and fdaase at jjmu knuj all sites of ramganga and varuna tributaries and those situated close to wazidpur drain indicated that increased release of bioavailable metals have adversely affected the microbial activity at these sites we also calculated two indices ecological response index eri and risk index ri for rs and swi our observations with eri show that most sites of wdpr all sites of ramganga and varuna river and knuj jjmu and rjht sites of the ganga river all are under extreme condition of metal pollution the ri based computations did support the above observations further the toxicity and risks were higher at swi compared to rs at sites where dosw remained 2 0 mg l 1 the pca separates these indices opposite to dosw indicating that sediment metal release and bioavailability is enhanced with increasing benthic hypoxia anoxia the analysis also separates fdaase and cmic opposite to bio available fraction indicating toxic impact of dosw induced increase in bio available fractions on microbial biomass activity at sites characterized by high oxygen deficit fig 9 similarly the increased metal concentration and bioavailability is expected to affect the mortality rate biodiversity colonization species dispersal and trophic cascade stark et al 2004 this may enhance food chain associated contamination and bio transfer ultimately to human consumers zhang et al 2011 overall together with external input feedback driven rise in sediment p and metal release and bioavailability merit attention for the health of river ecosystems and to human consumers through contaminated fisheries the synergism between such multiple stressors is expected to magnify overall adverse effects beyond the level expected for individual factor considered in isolation if intense human activities continue unabated the interplay of multiple stressors will lead to overstep the resilience driving the system to lose its ability to recover through large rivers this may also influence downstream stretches even estuaries through longitudinal linkages of hydrodynamic and biochemical processes 5 conclusions whereas it is clear that human activities are continuing to degrade river water quality the regulation of overall structural and functional shifts is the result of interconnected biogeochemical processes with poorly understood role of ecosystem feedbacks given the lack of a mechanistic understanding of ecosystem responses to positive feedbacks and the limitation of available data although it is not presently possible to quantitatively represent a holistic scenario of human activities feedback resilience model of large rivers using sediment p and metal release as positive feedback determinants we have quantitatively addressed some possible shifts in ecosystem functioning of the ganga river the results show a shift towards hyper eutrophy at sites characterized by high sediment p release furthermore the sites with higher metal release did show enhanced loss of microbial activity and greater risk to metal pollution together with p eutrophy and metal toxicity the affected region will have increased denitrification thereby leading to a shift in n p stoichiometry potentially expanding in hypoxic anoxic regions a combination of these will shift benthic species composition and lead to trophic cascades and decoupling of nutrient cycling our study calls attention towards understanding the sensitivity of

4529,while it is widely accepted that the magnitude of river water quality degradation depends upon the proportion of human interventions the overall changes are ultimately the consequence of interconnected biogeochemical processes with poorly understood role of ecosystem feedbacks here we conducted in situ and incubation experiments considering a 620 km ganga river main stem two tributaries and two point source downstream locations for trajectory studies to analyze the human driven changes in ecosystem feedback associated changes in ecosystem functioning of the ganga river and its tributaries the main stem coupled trajectory analyses show that benthic hypoxia anoxia resulting from intensive human releases generates positive feedbacks sediment p and metal release to exacerbate the degradation of ecosystem functioning in the ganga river and tributaries we found 1 9 to 4 6 times higher rates of sediment p release and about 1 1 to 3 7 times higher rates of sediment metal releases at sites with dosw 2 0 mg l excess release of phosphorus from sediment enhanced the eutrophy whereas sediment metal release and bioavailability led to a sharp decline in microbial biomass and fdaase activity the carlson s index ecological response index dodds s trophic state classification and risk index support these results because the sites with benthic hypoxic anoxic condition did show trophic state in eutrophic to hypereutrophic range and metal pollution in very high to extremely polluted and high risk category indicating significant effect of these drivers the study for the first time showed that positive feedbacks exacerbate the degradation of ecosystem functioning in human impacted large rivers we suggest the need for increased efforts considering the magnitude and connectivity of positive feedbacks and associated repercussions for improving mechanistic understanding of their contributions to overall structural and functional shifts in the large rivers keywords benthic hypoxia anoxia dissolved oxygen ecosystem feedbacks ganga river sediment metal release sediment p release 1 introduction widespread distribution of excessive c n and p in inland and coastal waters has caused degradation of water quality and an increase in hypoxic anoxic areas rabalais et al 2010 excess n and p enhance algal blooms and coupled with allochthonous c rapidly enlarge the consumption of dissolved oxygen required for inland fisheries and healthy aquatic habitats bottom water oxygen is also strongly influenced by other oxygen demanding substances ods including fe and mn flushed to the water systems from natural and anthropogenic sources oxygen deficiency in bottom waters can damage habitats for living resources and influence biogeochemical processes that control nutrient and heavy metal release from bed sediment to overlying waters hu et al 2001 villnäs et al 2012 which in turn accelerate the rates of eutrophy and metal pollution positive feedbacks arising either by natural or anthropogenic drivers are intrinsic to virtually all ecosystems aquatic ecosystems provide striking examples to understand how positive feedbacks are integral to the dynamics of ecosystem functioning stone and weisburd 1992 van nes and scheffer 2005 in contrast to general notions which address positive feedback effects as desirable for instance microorganisms portray multitude of positive feedbacks to recycle resources a careful reassessment shows that positive feedback effects can often be disadvantageous particularly for human impacted ecosystems neubert and caswell 1997 scheffer et al 2001 2019a positive feedbacks despite being inherent to ecosystem functioning are often destabilizing because they delay the time required by the system to recover from perturbations deangelis 1980 van nes and scheffer 2007 for example if eutrophy persist for longer time period or if the concentrations of sediment based oxygen demanding substances remains high it will trigger benthic hypoxia anoxia leading the ecosystem to behave chaotically even if the external forcing is removed may 1977 the latter may trigger positive feedback for instance sediment p and metal release jaiswal and pandey 2019a 2020 the self fertilizing effects associated with sediment p release can exacerbate eutrophy whereas those associated with sediment metal release will enhance toxic effects on aquatic organisms and human consumers when an ecosystem become degraded by pollution it becomes useful to distinguish immediate effects from those which become apparent after a long time period the immediate effects are generally in proportion to inputs demonstrating a direct causal connection in terms of source concentration dependence on a long time scale or if the disturbances continued we may expect that a progressive loss of ecosystem functioning will arise that may be more destabilizing than what is being predicted for human impacted aquatic ecosystems these changes may occur simultaneously or sequentially and often more detrimental or reach the level where the ecosystem alterations are irreversible understanding these unanticipated and likely irreversible shifts should be an important criteria for policy decisions in surface water management also this invites concern for cautious assessment of anthropogenically impacted water bodies specially the large rivers where the complexities arising from hydrologic control make the prediction uncertain harris and heathwaite 2012 despite the fact that the ganga river is lifeline of 43 of indian population no study so far is available assessing the anthropogenically induced shifts in ecosystem feedback associated changes in the river the studies conducted so far on the ganga river generally consider direct causal connections addressing the magnitude of carbon nutrient and heavy metal loading and associated risk analysis with respect to physico chemical changes fisheries and human consumers pandey et al 2014 jaiswal and pandey 2018 kumar et al 2020 siddiqui et al 2020 there is a lack of studies on major world rivers in general and on the river ganga in particular focusing on how and to what extent anthropogenic inputs are driving positive feedback associated changes in the ecosystem functioning our recent field trials have signaled mosaic of benthic habitat fragmentation in the ganga river jaiswal and pandey 2019a pandey et al 2019 to move a step ahead to our previous field and laboratory trials here we hypothesized that human driven changes in sediment water interaction may increase the degradation of ecosystem functioning in the ganga river the objective was to assess if the human driven positive feedbacks sediment p and bioavailable metal release exacerbate eutrophy and toxicological implications in the ganga river to achieve our goal we consider two trophic state indices and dodds s trophic state classification to test trophic state shifts and two toxicity indices entwined with microbial biomass and activity changes to pin point toxicological implications we found that the sites such as jajmau and those situated close to point sources with highest rates of sediment p and bioavailable metal releases are hypereutrophic and have high risk to metal pollution a synergism between such multiple and consequential effects will magnify the overall adverse effects beyond the level expected for individual factors considered in isolation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we conducted in situ and incubation studies along a 620 km long middle segment of the river ganga between kannauj city 27 10 n lat 79 75 e long and varanasi 25 32 n lat 83 03 e long this river basin covers 26 2 area of india and includes two major river systems the ganga and the brahmputra the ganga river traverses 2525 km through the widely spread gangetic plains and forms world s largest mangrove delta the ganga river receives pollutants from cities situated along the bank in the form of urban sewage industrial release and atmospheric deposition agricultural runoff also flushes large input of pollutants to the river the climate in the ganges basin ranges between tropical to sub tropical with three different seasons in a year a humid rainy from july to september a cold winter from november to february and a dry and hot summer from april to june season a major part of the rainfall 70 80 occurs during monsoon period july september the temperature in the basin varies between 4 c and 46 c the soil is mainly alluvial fluvisol with high natural fertility and represents various combinations of sandy loamy and clayey soils 2 2 experimental protocol 2 2 1 in situ studies we conducted the study in three sets during may june for four consecutive years 2016 2019 first set represents the main stem of the ganga river and includes sites such as kannauj knuj jajmau jjmu sangam sngm and rajghat rjht the second set with four sampling sites each in the main stem of the ramganga and varuna river represents 2 0 8 0 km upstream to their confluences with the ganga in the third set we consider trajectories downstream wazidpur drain at kanpur wpdr and assi drain at varanasi asdr with 11 equidistant locations 100 m apart which covered 1 0 km distance in main stem of the river fig 1 to identify the mechanistic links we divided each site into 3 sub sites triplicate samples were collected from each site at a distance of 25 m reach and combined together to get composite samples 2 2 2 incubation experiments for incubation studies undisturbed sediment samples were kept at the bottom of constructed air tight chambers dimensions 15 cm 20 cm 30 cm which were then filled with water collected from respective sampling site to match the original status of do of respective sites two do levels were maintained in these chambers 1 the anoxic to hypoxic level 0 to 2 mg l no stirring and aeration and 2 the sub oxic to oxic level 2 5 mg l intermittent stirring and aeration constant temperature 30 c of overlying water was maintained throughout the incubation period each chamber was kept in dark area so that photosynthetic oxygen production can be minimized regular measurements of do and temperature of the overlying waters were done initial concentrations of phosphorus and metals in the overlying waters were measured then periodic estimations were done at intervals of 1 h for 7 days for measuring the rate of sediment p and metal release the samples were collected with the help of pipette from interface of sediment and water of the incubation chambers at an interval of one hour and enough care was taken to minimize disturbances in sediment and overlying waters an equal amount of millipore water was added so that constant water column can be maintained these samples were filtered using cellulose fiber filters having pore size 0 45 μm and stored for analyses after acidification by 2 hno3 2 3 sample collection we collected samples for in situ as well as for incubation studies from 25 m reach during peak low flow may june for the years 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 we collected samples in acid rinsed polyethylene bottles from sub surface 15 to 25 cm and from sediment water interface stainless steel corers were used for collecting the sediment samples from 0 to 2 and 5 10 cm depth these collected samples were stored in ice boxes at a temperature of 4 c and brought to the laboratory for further analyses in laboratory the samples were kept at 4 c in black brown bags to maintain the original status of samples and stop photosynthesis the sediment samples were divided into three parts one part of fresh sediments was kept in desiccators for maintaining the moisture level to 80 and was used for measurement of enzyme activity second part was kept intact in corers to be used in incubation experiments and third part was kept at room temperature for air drying for 3 to 4 days then grinded in mortar and pestle and sieved from 2 mm mesh for further analysis 2 4 measurements the do in water samples collected from the interface of sediment and water was fixed at sampling site following winkler s standard method apha 1998 the relationships given by sànchez et al 2007 was followed to calculate the dissolved oxygen deficit at the interface of sediment and water dodsw dos doa where dodsw dissolved oxygen deficit at sediment water interface dos do concentration at saturation and doa actual do mg l the biological oxygen demand bod was estimated as bod5 following eaton et al 1995 the chemical oxygen demand cod was quantified using potassium dichromate method apha 1998 we followed ling et al 2009 for measuring the sediment oxygen demand sod the phosphorus concentration was determined following murphy and riley 1962 and toc analyzer lotix combustion toc analyzer was used to quantify the total organic carbon toc chloroform fumigation extraction method was used to measure the microbial biomass c cmic jenkinson and powlson 1976 for estimation of metal concentrations in sediment the samples were digested in mixtures of three acids hno3 hcl hclo4 in a ratio of 5 1 1 for this a microwave digestion extraction system was used sineo model no mds 6g the concentrations were measured using aas perkin elmer analyst 800 usa total bio available metal fraction was measured using ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid single step extraction process ure 1996 spectrophotometric method was followed for measuring the fluorescein diacetate hydrolase fdaase activity the fdaase involves all the three classes of enzymes lipase esterase and protease and is used as a proximate of total microbial activity schnurer and rosswall 1982 costa et al 2007 for this the sediment samples were incubated at 24 c with fluorescein diacetate and the fluorescein formed was measured by taking the absorbance at 400 nm 2 5 eutrophication and metal pollution indices based on our data we computed three indices to address state of eutrophy and metal pollution we also considered dodds s classification system dodds 2006 to compare our results on trophic state 2 5 1 trophic state index tsi here we consider carlson s trophic state index using total phosphorus tp data carlson 1977 this index is originally developed for lakes but it is highly comparable to other indices developed for large rivers jaiswal and pandey 2019b usually tp concentrations in rivers are higher than in lakes so the marginal difference in classification may depend on river vs lake the tsi was calculated using the following empirical relationship tsi tp 14 42 ln tp 4 15 tsi 40 represents oligotrophic 40 to 50 mesotrophic 50 to 70 eutrophic and 70 represents a hypereutrophic condition 2 5 2 ecological response index eri the eri simultaneously address metal pollution and eutrophy in large rivers it was calculated following jaiswal and pandey 2019b e r i f d a a s e c m i c t o c t h m where toc total organic carbon cmic microbial biomass c ʃthm i 1 n m i and mi concentration of ith metal on a scale of 0 320 the eri between 0 and 24 represents extreme metal pollution 25 38 a combination of metal pollution and eutrophy 39 77 low metal pollution and hypereutrophy 78 155 eutrophy and 156 320 represents the oligotrophic state 2 5 3 dodds s trophic state classification dodds 2006 dodd s trophic state classification is originally designed for streams here the relative frequency distribution of phosphorus was used to define trophic state the lower third of distribution values represent oligotrophic state middle third indicate mesotrophic state whereas top third values show the eutrophic state 2 5 4 risk index ri the ri was calculated following håkanson 1980 r i i 1 n e r i here e r i represents ecological risk e r i t r i c f i where t r i is toxic response factor represented by a fixed value for an individual element håkanson 1980 as zn 1 cr 2 cu pb ni 5 and cd 30 the c f i represents contamination factor c f i ci co where ci measured concentration of a metal at a site and co background concentration of metal we considered dev prayag the least polluted site of the ganga river for background concentration jaiswal and pandey 2018 the ri 150 represents low ecological risk 150 to 300 represents moderate 300 to 600 considerable and 600 represents very high level of ecological risk 2 6 statistical analysis to define uncertainties the data have been shown as mean and supported by standard error of means se to justify the significance of data a confidence limit above 95 was considered principal component analyses pca was used to identify the relationships between different variables for statistical analysis we used statistical software past version 2 17c and sigmaplot version 11 0 3 results 3 1 main stem trends for main stem sites of river ganga the concentration of dosw appeared highest at sngm site and lowest at jjmu site at temporal scale we found highest concentrations in the month of may fig 2 the dodsw and oxygen demanding processes such as cod and sod followed trend opposite to dosw the dodsw cod and sod values ranged from 6 63 to 8 08 mg l 1 from 21 32 to 48 35 mg l 1 and from 6 25 to 13 77 g o2 m2 day respectively the bod showed deviation and recorded maximum at rjht site and minimum at sngm site fig 2 the sediment p release did show a trend synchronous to the dodsw and ranged from 9 39 to 17 42 mg m2 day the values were minimum at the sngm and maximum at the jjmu site fig 2 the concentration of phosphate po4 3 in river water and toc in the riverbed sediment showed spatiotemporal synchrony with dodsw and the values varied between 117 89 mg l 1 sngm site and 185 26 mg l 1 jjmu site and between 3 48 and 4 68 respectively fig 3 similar to the dosw the cmic and fdaase activity was maximum at sngm and minimum at jjmu site at temporal scale also the microbial biomass and activity showed synchrony with dosw fig 3 the incubation study results of heavy metal release from riverbed sediment of the ganga river showed higher releases of all the study metals in μg m2 d from the sites where dosw appear below 1 0 mg l 1 fig 4 table 1 the tsi results showed a tendency towards hyper eutrophy table 2 whereas dodds s classification indicate knuj jjmu and rjht to be eutrophic fig 5 the eri identified knuj jjmu as extremely metal polluted and rjht with a metal pollution and eutrophy table 2 in ramganga and varuna rivers the dosw was lowest at site 1 away from the confluence and highest at site 4 closest to the confluence the respective values of dosw in these river varied between 0 29 and 0 61 mg l 1 and between 0 10 and 0 51 mg l 1 respectively fig 2 the dodsw showed trends opposite to dosw for both the rivers the deficits were highest in the month of june the oxygen demanding processes bod cod and sod showed synchrony with dodsw at both the scales however the bod and sod was higher for the varuna river sites whereas cod was higher for the ramganga river sites fig 2 similar to dodsw the sediment p release for both the rivers were found to be maximum at site 1 and minimum at site 4 the concentration of toc ranged between 4 23 site 4 and 4 72 site 1 for the ramganga river and between 7 21 site 4 and 7 65 site 1 for the varuna river fig 3 similar to toc the concentration of po4 3 was higher at the varura river sites compared to those at the ramganga sites at temporal scale both the toc and po4 3 were higher in the month of june the cmic and fdaase showed synchrony with dosw for both the main stems however the values were comparatively higher for the ramganga river fig 3 the incubation experiments showed a little higher rate of sediment metal release for main stem of the varuna river compared to those for the ramganga river the release rates for all the study metals were higher at site 1 for both the rivers fig 4 our comparisons based on tsi eri ri and dodds s classification all showed eutrophy and metal associated risk at sites with high sediment p release and metal release fig 5 table 2 3 2 point source downstream trends the dosw remained close to anoxia at locations close to assi drain mouth asdr and up to 300 m downstream the wazidpur drain wpdr fig 6 we found dosw 1 0 mg l 1 at sites situated up to 200 m downstream the asdr and up to 500 m downstream the wpdr whereas the respective values below 2 0 mg l level were reported at sites situated up to 400 m and 800 m downstream the drains the dodsw followed trend contrasting to dosw and the values decreased consistently downstream the drains the bod cod and sod showed similar trend for point sources the bod was comparatively higher at asdr and the values declined from 27 94 to 12 66 mg l 1 whereas at wpdr the values decreased from 20 86 to 7 81 mg l 1 the cod and sod values were significantly higher downstream the wpdr in comparison to those at asdr fig 6 the sediment p release also showed similar trend and the values ranged from 3 78 to 18 56 mg m2 day downstream asdr and from 4 71 to 23 95 mg m2 day at sites situated downstream the wpdr the toc and po4 3 concentrations showed decreasing trend at both the drains however the values were comparatively higher at the asdr at temporal scale the values were higher in the month of june fig 7 the tsi at asdr and wpdr ranged from 78 34 to 104 54 indicating hyper eutrophic condition table 2 although dodds s classification ranked these locations in mesotrophic to eutrophic state fig 5 the cmic and fdaase showed variable trend for both the drains at asdr downstream sites these showed declining trend whereas at wpdr downstream sites the values showed an increasing trend at wpdr the cmic increased from 233 61 to 519 39 μg c g 1 and fdaase increased from to 29 68 to 80 26 μm fluorescein g 1 hr 1 at temporal scale the microbial biomass and activity both were highest in the month of june at asdr whereas these were highest in the month of may for wpdr downstream locations fig 7 the incubation results showed increased rate of sediment metal releases from riverbed sediment downstream the wpdr compared to the asdr a higher rate of sediment metal release was reported up to 600 m downstream the wpdr and up to 400 m downstream the asdr at temporal scale the metal release was higher in the month of june for both the drains fig 8 these results appeared synchronous to eri and ri at sediment water interface table 2 4 discussion despite extensive research on eutrophication as a primary cause of water quality degradation many key questions remain unanswered smith and schindler 2009 much is to be understood with respect to the interactions that can be expected to occur between c eutrophy overall carbon pool and ecosystem feedbacks which can alter the states posing further complexities to delay the recovery from nutrient loading controls schindler et al 2008 although such complexities prohibit accurate predictions certain attributes emerge as generic markers of ecosystem fragility that may be used to detect if the system is close to a tipping point two distinct feedback determinants sediment p release and sediment metal release have led to these insights although hypoxia anoxia is the common causal link for both the cases one feedback uncovers a generic empirical marker of p eutrophy pandey and yadav 2017 with likely effects on trophic cascades whereas the other one reveals the state of increasing metal pollution exacerbating the toxicological implications here we present the results of in situ and incubation experiments to show that hypoxia anoxia induced ecosystem feedbacks sediment p and metal release enhance eutrophy and toxicological implications in the ganga river 4 1 benthic oxygen deficiency causal linkages the depletion of benthic oxygen level has become a common response to human driven perturbations in aquatic ecosystems the hypoxic anoxic areas in the oceans around the world are rapidly increasing 2 45 105 km2 diaz and rosenberg 2008 for a lotic ecosystem the occurrence of hypoxic anoxic zones is not a common phenomenon due probably to the hydrological continuum however the increasing and continuous addition of oxygen demanding substances ods in rivers has been reported to have caused the development of do deficient zones in some of the heavily polluted rivers and river estuaries around the world conley et al 2009 pandey et al 2019 here we found hypoxic anoxic levels of do at interface of sediment and water i e dosw 2 0 mg l in the main stem with severity being high at jjmu and knuj sites dosw 1 0 mg l medium at rjht site dosw 1 5 mg l and low at sngm site dosw 2 0 mg l at jjmu the river receives about 171 million liters per day mld treated and 168 mld untreated sewage from point sources also this segment of the river receives over 200 mld industrial effluents and 400 tonnes of chemical rich wastes from over 450 tanneries cpcb 2013 on the other hand near knuj the ramganga tributary with bod load 7 1 29 mg l and cod load 15 2 55 5 mg l khan et al 2016 adds high amount of ods in the main river siddiqui et al 2019 reported highest value of pollution load index pli 8 and potential ecological risk index peri 300 at sites situated in the middle segment of the ganga river the synchrony of high ods load prolonged hypoxia anoxia and associated risk clearly indicated strong anthropogenic impacts at these sites the sites located in the main stem of the ramganga and varuna tributaries also showed dosw below 1 0 mg l 1 indicating very high load of ods in these tributaries the dodsw at these sites showed strong synchrony with oxygen demanding processes such as bod cod and sod indicating the combined effect of these process creating hypoxic anoxic zones in the river the ganga river receives bod load of 2 5 106 kg day out of which over 53 comes through domestic sewage and rest 47 through industrial sources cpcb 2013 further each day the ramganga adds about 1 32 105 kg and assi drain about 4 06 103 kg bod load to the ganga river additionally high nutrient loading to this river pandey et al 2014 singh and pandey 2019 increases eutrophy supplementing further to the rate of oxygen consumption the river produces 102 58 gg autochthonous c and receives 1 81 tg toc through atmospheric deposition 16 16 26 90 tg toc through surface runoff and over 110 gg toc through point sources annually singh and pandey 2019 our main stem and trajectories analyses results did show high concentrations of po4 3 and toc and high values of chemical oxygen demand cod indicating high organic pollution load to the river lockdown covid 19 period studies show a massive improvement in water quality kumar et al 2020 indicating that during normal period point and non point source driven inputs degrade water quality of the ganga river in addition to water column associated sources the ods in bed sediment also exert pressure on do level raun et al 2010 jaiswal and pandey 2019c our results show high sediment oxygen demand sod at sites close to the mouth of the drain and all sites of main stem of tributaries in water bodies affected by multiple anthropogenic activities the sod increases the oxygen demand by 50 macpherson et al 2007 which may lead to habitat fragmentation shift in benthic communities and trophic cascades rabalais et al 2001 we found low values of cmic and fdaase activity coinciding with sod at all study sites except those situated downstream asdr indicating alteration in microbial community strong linkages between sod and benthic hypoxia anoxia provide cue about the state of ods useful in understanding the magnitude and nature of such human perturbations gibbons et al 2014 4 2 hypoxia anoxia driven ecosystem feedbacks in addition to the death of benthic dwellers including fisheries diaz and rosenberg 2008 benthic hypoxia anoxia induces a number of ecosystem feedbacks conley et al 2009 such as sediment p release and metal release which may exacerbate the degradation of water quality and aquatic ecosystem functioning the hypoxic anoxic condition breaks the bond between phosphate and iron oxides causing the release of phosphorus from the riverbed sediment to overlying water column middelburg and levin 2009 sediment p release was recorded highest at the mouth of wpdr drain followed by the mouth of asdr indicating linkages of sediment p release with benthic hypoxia anoxia prevailed during the study period the sites with dosw level 2 0 mg l 1 show higher rate of p release comparative to those characterized by sub oxic or oxic levels of dosw about 1 95 to 4 6 times higher rate of p release was reported at sites with hypoxic anoxic level of dosw compared to those with oxic level sediment p release at the rates exceeding 100 mg m2 week have been reported from anaerobic sediment of the han river whereas at sites with aerobic sediment the sediment p release was very low kim et al 2003 similar dependency of sediment p release on do levels has been reported for hampshire avon and herefordshire wye river basins jarvie et al 2005 abshineh river jalali and peikam 2013 and nene river tye et al 2016 increased release of sediment p has also been reported from heavily polluted rivers at locations characterized by high concentration of oxygen demanding substances zhang et al 2017 we also found a strong coherence of sediment p release with do levels along all the study gradients indicating that benthic hypoxia anoxia induces sediment p release as a positive feedback that may further exacerbate eutrophy our study further shows the impact of dod on sediment metal release the sediment acts as reservoir of heavy metals and about 85 of metals entering in water bodies accumulates into the bed sediments zhang et al 2016 a change in redox condition at the sediment water interface swi affects the bond between metals and other compounds transforming the bed sediment from a sink to source of metals atkinson et al 2007 kang et al 2019 through incubation studies we found significant release of metals from the bed sediments for sites characterized by hypoxic anoxic levels of dosw the trajectory analysis did show high rate of metal release up to 400 m downstream the asdr and up to 700 m downstream the wpdr the principal component analyses pca separates ecosystem feedbacks opposite to the dosw showing that the hypoxic anoxic condition enhances feedbacks including sediment metal release fig 9 hypoxia driven metal release from the bed sediment has been recorded by banks et al 2012 and liu et al 2019 a change in redox condition at swi also enhances the metal bioavailability eggleton and thomas 2004 higher concentrations of bioavailable fraction of study metals were found in sediment at swi in comparison to those in riverbed sediment rs at sites where dosw appear below 2 0 mg l 1 table 1 further the difference in concentrations did appear highest at sites with dosw 0 5 mg l 1 followed by successive declining levels of dosw with dosw above 2 0 mg l 1 the metal concentration at swi appear lower than those in rs the highest difference between swi and rs metal concentration was recorded at sites close to wpdr mouth a coherence in dosw 2 0 mg l 1 rate of metal release and bioavailability shows that the benthic hypoxia anoxia regulates the bioavailability and metal release from the sediment which can be expected to enhance toxicological implications and a shift in overall biogeochemical cycling of metals 4 3 impacts of ecosystem feedbacks positive feedbacks are integral to the dynamics of ecosystem functioning stone and weisburd 1992 van nes and scheffer 2005 for instance microorganism driven recycling of multitude of resources although some feedbacks are often disadvantageous particularly for human impacted ecosystems neubert and caswell 1997 scheffer et al 2001 2019a positive feedbacks despite being integral are often destabilizing and delay the time required to recover deangelis 1980 van nes and scheffer 2007 we consider carlson s trophic state index tsi ecological response index eri and dodds 2006 classification of trophic state as response determinants to benthic hypoxia anoxia induced release of sediment p we found trophic state in eutrophic to hypereutrophic range at sites with dosw below 2 0 mg l 1 table 2 the tsi and dodds s classification although showed little variation in the main stem did show wide variation in trajectory analysis downstream asdr and wpdr opposite to tsi the eri increased downstream of point sources and in main stem with values being maximum at sngm site of the ganga river and site 4 of both the tributaries table 2 these results show that hypoxia anoxia induced p release in the water column ultimately enhanced the eutrophy with likely increase in microbial degradation and oxygen consumption under such condition the state of hypoxia anoxia will persist for long time and delay the ecosystem recovery or even make the recovery impossible in long term future jaiswal and pandey 2019a european union framework directives have identified the p release from riverine sediments as an indicator of poor ecological status tye et al 2016 another important repercussion of sediment driven imbalances in water level p is that it will alter the n p stoichiometry of the system studies show that elemental stoichiometry plays regulatory role in resource competition makulla and sommer 1993 and ecosystem driven nutrient cycling elser et al 2009 a decline in n p ratio elevated p shifts the phytoplankton assemblage towards diazotrophic cyanobacteria elser et al 2000 and p favored diatoms pandey et al 2017 the ganga river receives huge quantity of p from various anthropogenic sources yadav and pandey 2017 singh and pandey 2019 thus the surplus of sediment added p will enhance the magnitude of consequences associated to altered n p stoichiometry the overall influence will be an altered cellular nutrient balance phytoplankton composition community dominance biogeochemical cycling carbon sequestration biological diversity and trophic cascades teubner and dokulil 2002 elser et al 2009 pandey and yadav 2015 large scale escape of shrimps crab and finfish crown has been reported from oxygen deficient water at the mouth of mississippi river buck 1996 slavik et al 2004 have shown a drastic shift in trophic status after extreme p loading from fertilizers and sediment p release leading to replacement of epilithic diatoms by mosses bryophytes as dominant group of primary producers the study further shows that dissolved oxygen deficit at sediment water interface induces sediment metal release and bioavailability this merit attention because external inputs if coupled with internal release can exacerbate toxicological implications further because the bio available fractions have greater mobility and toxicity xu et al 2017 the increased bioavailability need serious attention to address this issue we used microbial biomass c cmic and fdaase activity a proxy of total microbial activity to assess the effect of benthic hypoxia anoxia induced sediment metal release a drastic decrease in cmic and fdaase at jjmu knuj all sites of ramganga and varuna tributaries and those situated close to wazidpur drain indicated that increased release of bioavailable metals have adversely affected the microbial activity at these sites we also calculated two indices ecological response index eri and risk index ri for rs and swi our observations with eri show that most sites of wdpr all sites of ramganga and varuna river and knuj jjmu and rjht sites of the ganga river all are under extreme condition of metal pollution the ri based computations did support the above observations further the toxicity and risks were higher at swi compared to rs at sites where dosw remained 2 0 mg l 1 the pca separates these indices opposite to dosw indicating that sediment metal release and bioavailability is enhanced with increasing benthic hypoxia anoxia the analysis also separates fdaase and cmic opposite to bio available fraction indicating toxic impact of dosw induced increase in bio available fractions on microbial biomass activity at sites characterized by high oxygen deficit fig 9 similarly the increased metal concentration and bioavailability is expected to affect the mortality rate biodiversity colonization species dispersal and trophic cascade stark et al 2004 this may enhance food chain associated contamination and bio transfer ultimately to human consumers zhang et al 2011 overall together with external input feedback driven rise in sediment p and metal release and bioavailability merit attention for the health of river ecosystems and to human consumers through contaminated fisheries the synergism between such multiple stressors is expected to magnify overall adverse effects beyond the level expected for individual factor considered in isolation if intense human activities continue unabated the interplay of multiple stressors will lead to overstep the resilience driving the system to lose its ability to recover through large rivers this may also influence downstream stretches even estuaries through longitudinal linkages of hydrodynamic and biochemical processes 5 conclusions whereas it is clear that human activities are continuing to degrade river water quality the regulation of overall structural and functional shifts is the result of interconnected biogeochemical processes with poorly understood role of ecosystem feedbacks given the lack of a mechanistic understanding of ecosystem responses to positive feedbacks and the limitation of available data although it is not presently possible to quantitatively represent a holistic scenario of human activities feedback resilience model of large rivers using sediment p and metal release as positive feedback determinants we have quantitatively addressed some possible shifts in ecosystem functioning of the ganga river the results show a shift towards hyper eutrophy at sites characterized by high sediment p release furthermore the sites with higher metal release did show enhanced loss of microbial activity and greater risk to metal pollution together with p eutrophy and metal toxicity the affected region will have increased denitrification thereby leading to a shift in n p stoichiometry potentially expanding in hypoxic anoxic regions a combination of these will shift benthic species composition and lead to trophic cascades and decoupling of nutrient cycling our study calls attention towards understanding the sensitivity of large rivers to persistent human perturbations coupled feedbacks on different spatiotemporal scales credit authorship contribution statement deepa jaiswal methodology validation formal analysis
