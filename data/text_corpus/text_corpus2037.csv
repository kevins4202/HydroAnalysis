10185,salt drainage from farmlands can potentially degrade the ecological function of ditch wetlands in arid and semi arid irrigation areas however such ditch wetlands may accept different quantities and salt concentrations of upstream inflows which may have positive or negative effects on the water and salt dynamics of ditch wetland systems and therefore on the associated water and salt management measures in this paper we propose a new theoretical analysis model that enables us to study the influence of different upstream inflows on the water salt dynamics and drainage strategies for ditch wetland in the study area the research carried out by us has revealed that upstream inflow is one of the most important factors influencing ditch wetlands under the current conditions an increase in salinity or a decrease in flow will negatively affect the ecology of the ditch wetland in contrast which will improve the ditch wetland environment nevertheless wetlands are more sensitive to changes in salinity than to the volume of upstream inflow based on the combined effects of the salinity and quantity of its inflow on the wetlands it can be divided into four categories no risk low risk medium risk and high risk the inflow with no risk and low risk will have a positive effect on the ditch wetland system and drainage management while medium risk and high risk conditions will increase the difficulty of drainage management these results provide the insights needed to guide the design of drainage management practices for ditch wetlands in semi arid regions that receive upstream inflows to maximize the benefits to the agricultural system and the environment keywords farmland wetland system water and salt balance risk categories wetland outflow ratio drainage management 1 introduction the ecology of dry areas is fragile because of limited rainfall water resources and wetland resources are scarce in such regions in such a context ditch wetlands composed of an open drainage ditch system can not only provide crucial agricultural production services but also provide crucial ecological and landscape services herzon and helenius 2008 needelman et al 2007 the ditch wetland system is pivotal for the sustainable development of the social economy environment and ecology in arid areas however agricultural drainage systems are mainly designed for salinity control in arid and semi arid regions and drainage water contains a large quantity of salt leached from soils studies have demonstrated that an increase in salinity leads to a significant decrease in vegetation cover huckelbridge et al 2010 when the retained pollutants such as salt exceed the capacity of a ditch the underlying ditch ecosystem will lose its balance if the biodiversity of a ditch wetland is destroyed its function of processing other pollutants will be affected as well the ditch system will transform from a sink colin et al 2004 borin et al 2001 of pollutants into a source defra 2004 of pollutants and spread them throughout the surrounding area through the ditch network system vaughan et al 2007 sharpley et al 2007 nguyen and sukias 2002 moloney et al 2019 thus agricultural production practices such as drainage discharge have been blamed as major contributors to the salinization of wetlands jin 2008 huckelbridge et al 2010 clarke 2015 if agricultural drainage is the sole inflow into a wetland salt accumulation in the ditch wetland is more likely to reach a critical level which would be detrimental to the wetland s ecosystem services jia et al 2011 in the absence of a reasonable strategy to manage the salinity changes in a ditch wetland caused by natural and agricultural production practices large scale salinization of the ditch wetland will occur causing the wetland to lose its ecological service function removing salts from a wetland is difficult a few researchers have suggested that salts may be removed from the system by harvesting wetland plants such as reeds phragmites australis li et al 2008 lan et al 2003 however a reed is considered a pseudohalophyte exclusion halophyte which stores salt in the underground part mainly the root of the plant thus reducing the salt content and salt stress of the aerial parts of the plant breckle 1995 this physiological characteristic ensures normal growth and development of the reed meaning that the amount of salt absorbed by the reed from the wetland is generally insignificant however salt is not the sole force and a diverse array of other abiotic and biotic factors drive biodiversity changes mitsch and gosselink 2000 stated that wetland hydrology is probably the single most vital determinant of the establishment and maintenance of the structure processes and functioning of a wetland salinity is intimately linked to hydrology because water mobilizes salts and alters their distribution and concentration therefore numerous studies have been conducted to devise effective measures to mitigate the adverse impact of ditch wetland salinity among these freshwater recharge and artificial irrigation are two commonly adopted management practices to lower salinity levels lamontagne et al 2006 meredith and beesley 2009 quinn 2009 however drought is another important threat especially in downstream direction of arid and semi arid irrigation areas due to its disadvantage of being located far away from the water source even the irrigation water is rarely guaranteed but in many cases the ditch wetland is often located in here therefore freshwater recharge for ditch wetland is more difficult to guarantee on time once the wetland salinity has breached a critical level poor freshwater may cause wetland salinity management to be in trouble however agricultural drainage often is not the sole route for water and salt input into wetlands in some cases various types of inflow such as external water and salt water from upstream irrigation areas may exist most irrigation areas in china often produce large amounts of irrigation return flows and drainage in the agricultural production process owing to the lack of maintenance and management of irrigation systems imperfect irrigation and drainage projects and the use of traditional irrigation models and empirical irrigation management measures zhao et al 2006 jia et al 2013 lei et al 2002 upstream inflow is an opportunity and challenge for the ditch wetlands that receive water from upstream irrigation areas but this is typically a complex problem when the salt concentration of the inflow is low salt enrichment of the downstream ditch wetland system can be alleviated by contrast the inflow may accelerate the salt enrichment the quantity of the inflow affects the water and salt balance of the downstream ditch wetland system as well therefore recharge events will either have a positive or negative effect on ditch wetland and will lead to highly variable hydrology and salt concentrations however it is unclear how the amounts and salt concentrations of inflows may positively or negatively impact the ditch wetland ecology how rapidly may salt accumulation in these wetlands reach a level endangering their ecological function under the inflows and which management options can be employed to ensure that the inflows sustain the wetland ecosystem lacking of clarity understanding of the inflow influence presents new challenges for drainage management from the perspective of water and salt management and drainage strategies in ditch wetlands our research aims at finding a solution for this challenging problem of drainage management under the upstream inflow influence we examine some previous work and propose an integrated model describing hydrology hydrodynamics and salt dynamics in this study to predict the water and salt balance in ditch wetlands under recharge events the proposed mathematical model was tested in a case study of a semi arid region in china in this paper the established model is used to discuss the influence of upstream water quantity and salt concentration on wetland water environment and drainage management strategies this paper recommends practical water and salinity management options for ditch wetlands that ensure system sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description lubotan is a reclaimed salinized irrigation area located in shaanxi province china with a wetland system consisting of open drainage ditches fig 1 the farmland area in this region is approximately 160 ha the number drainage ditches of all levels is 51 and the ditch wetland area is approximately 14 61 ha in addition to natural precipitation and local drainage surface runoff from two upstream irrigation districts discharge into the low lying lubotan area at the end of each irrigation season drainage water from irrigated farmlands was initially planned to be discharged into a nearby river through a main drainage ditch however this main ditch could not be fully opened for both environmental and economic reasons therefore a large wetland was formed in the ditch drainage system jia et al 2011 according to our observations and investigations over the past few years this ditch wetland has formed a relatively stable ecosystem with reeds phragmites communis and suaeda salsa as the dominant populations mixed with artemisia anethifolia lycium chinense setaria viridis chloris virgata armeniaca mume and other species the dominant species at the bottom of the drainage ditch is reeds and growing season of reeds lasts from april to october the reeds is tall and dense which provide hidden habitats for animals the animal life in this region mainly includes saltwater fish water birds and a few reptiles lubotan has become a farmland wetland system that is suitable for plant and animal habitation according to meteorological data lubotan experiences low precipitation rates averaging 554 mm per year and high evapotranspiration et rates averaging 1200 mm per year the drainage water discharged from farmlands may be partially or entirely lost in the ditches through et leading to an increase in the salinity of the remaining waters over time this is detrimental for crop production and wetland ecology however based on field observations salinity in the wetland ditches has not increased significantly in recent years one possible explanation is that the inflows from the upstream regions are beneficial for salinity control in lubotan 2 2 model development in order to understand the potential effects of upstream inflows with different water volumes and salinity on the ditch wetland and suggest alternatives for the sustainable management of water we modified the model which we developed in jia et al 2011 compared to the original model jia et al 2011 the advantages of new model are as follows 1 upstream inflow and sub irrigation are considered in the ditch wetland water balance 2 wetland outflow ratio are redefined 3 the influence of sediments on wetland water and salt balance are simplified according to the research results of jia et al 2011 4 field drainage dynamic data is included in the calibration and verification of the model to improve the simulation accuracy of the model according to the input and output of wetland water in the drainage ditch the wetland can be viewed as a single wetland entity jia et al 2011 therefore the farmland wetland system can be described as shown in fig 2 the main source of water supply for ditch wetlands are local farmland drainage upstream inflows and some local precipitation the water outputs from the ditch wetland are wetland outflow et and sub irrigation sub irrigation often occurs when the ditch water table is higher than the farmland water table however given the complexity of wetland hydrology it is necessary to describe each of these water components individually 2 2 1 local farmland drainage surface runoff and sub irrigation farmland drainage is a paramount part of the farmland hydrological cycle however owing to the influence of meteorology agricultural production and other factors field observations have shortcomings such as long duration and considerable labor requirements and high material costs therefore field observations and theoretical models are usually used to study the process of farmland hydrological cycles feddes et al 1978 skaggs et al 1981 kanwar et al 1983 the field hydrology model drainmod skaggs 1980 can be used to simulate the water balance in a field this model calculates water infiltration by using the green ampt equation subsurface drainage by using the hooghoudt equation when the water table is below the land surface and subsurface drainage by using the kirkham equation when surface ponding occurs with the abovementioned methods and equations drainmod calculates infiltration subsurface drainage surface runoff and depth to water table on an hourly basis the results can be output on a daily monthly or yearly basis according to the user s choice when the water level of a drainage ditch is higher than the groundwater level in the field the field hydrological process is represented as transportation of water from the drainage ditch to the field this hydrological process can be simulated using the sub irrigation module in the drainmod model the actual situation is set in the model interface when the drainage ditch water level is higher than the field water level the calculated subsurface drainage is negative the negative subsurface drainage represents the water that is transported from the drainage ditch to the field through sub irrigation 2 2 2 evapotranspiration the et calculation mentioned in this paper comprises two aspects field et and wetland et the results of field et calculations comprise one of the files input into drainmod to calculate the field drainage process penman monteith method is used in conjunction with weather data to calculate the daily field potential et et0 and the crop coefficient method is used to calculate the crop potential et petk allen et al 1998 the penman monteith equation is based on the theory of energy balance and water balance monteith 1965 this method includes multiple variables such as air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed which are used to calculate the et thus this method is superior to other empirical approaches in terms of transferability and predictive power jensen et al 1990 it has been used in numerous applications and has been shown to be one of the best models for estimating potential et rates in our study area pan 2011 the et in the drainmod output files is the actual et aet that is determined by comparing the available soil water upward flux and the potential et if the upward flux is greater than or equal to the pet aet equals pet otherwise aet equals the soil water upward flux in drainmod various empirical methods exist for calculating wetland et but most of them use local surface evaporation of water e 0 or potential et et0 to approximate the wetland water consumption thus neglecting the effects of vegetation jia et al 2004 zhou et al 2007 studies have shown that the reed community wetland et is similar to the et under farmland vegetation growth conditions yu et al 2007 and it is also closely related to wetland coverage allen et al 1996 therefore based on the consideration of wetland coverage allen et al 1996 the actual et rate can be calculated as follows 1 e t c e t 0 0 54 s v s 0 0 22 where etc is the actual wetland et mm d et0 is the local potential et mm d and sv and s0 are the vegetation cover and proportion of water surface area respectively 2 2 3 water balance according to the theory of water balance the change in total water volume in a drainage ditch can be expressed as follows 2 δ w w i n w o u t w e t w e t where δw is the change in water volume in the ditch wetland m3 win is the amount of water entering the wetland m3 which can be expressed by eq 3 wout is the wetland drainage m3 which can be expressed by eq 4 wetwet is the et in the ditch wetland m3 3 w i n p a w e t d a a g r a a g q i n 4 w o u t q o u t w s where aag is the farmland area awet is the ditch wetland area p is rainfall mm d is the local farmland subsurface drainage mm r is local surface runoff mm qin is upstream inflow m3 ws is the sub irrigation m3 and qout is the wetland drainage output m3 by substituting eqs 3 and 4 in eq 2 the following equation is obtained 5 δ w p a w e t d a a g r a a g q i n a w e t e t w e t q o u t w s the cross section of the drainage ditch in the study area is a regular trapezoid it is assumed that the bottom width of the drainage ditch is b m and the slope coefficient is i as shown in fig 3 when the water surface depth of the drainage ditch decreases from h 1 to h 2 the amount of water change in the drainage ditch per unit length 1 m can be computed as follows 6 δ w 1 2 δ h 2 b 2 i δ h where w is the volume of water change in the drainage ditch per unit length 1 m m3 and h is the change in the water table in the ditch h h2 h1 m when the water level in the ditch rises h 0 the change in the volume of water w is positive otherwise h 0 w is negative therefore the moisture change in the ditch wetland can be expressed as follows 7 δ w δ w l where l is total length of drainage ditches m by substituting eqs 6 and 7 into eq 5 the following equation is obtained 8 δ q q i n q o u t 1 2 δ h 2 b 2 i δ h l p a w e t d a a g r a a g e t w e t a w e t w s according to eq 8 the relationship between the change in wetland water volume and the upstream inflow input and output can be determined as follows when q 0 the upstream inflow input is main cause of change in the volume of wetland water when q 0 the output from the wetland is main cause of change in the volume of wetland water when q 0 the wetland input and output are balanced 2 2 4 salt balance the purpose of the salt balance analysis is to study how salt change occurs in a wetland with time this is the basis for analyzing the effects of inflow water on the water and salt environment in a ditch wetland to this end water and mass balances are applied to the wetland to determine the exchange of water and salt among farmland inflow and wetland over time which leads to a change in the salinity concentration of the ditch wetland salt is a relatively stable substance and it generally does not react with other substances or decompose by itself according to mass balance analysis the system has two main sources of salt in the farmland wetland system namely drainage from farmland when the field water table is higher than the drainage ditch water table and upstream inflow salt output occurs through the following routes salt is moved from the wetland to the farmland when the field water table is lower than the drainage ditch water table stored in wetland soils discharged from the wetland with drainage and absorbed by plants before reaching a stable state the salinity of the farmland wetland system is dynamic and can be expressed as follows 9 c d t a a g d t c r t a a g r t c i n t a w

to solve however the ditch wetland salinity for water body and soil change in the same process and eventually tend to be equal jia et al 2011 when the time interval is long the salt balance of the soil and the water body in eq 9 can be simplified as follows 10 h s a w e t d c s t d t k s a w e t c w a t e r t c s 0 11 v w e t t d c w a t e r t d t v w e t t c w a t e r t v w e t 0 c 0 thus an expression for the wetland salt concentration c water t can be obtained 12 c w a t e r t c d t a a g d t c r t a a g r t q i n t c i n t a w e t s p t k s a w e t c s 0 c 0 v w e t 0 k s a w e t v w e t t q o u t t w s t where cd is the concentration of drainage salt gl 1 cin is the mixed concentration of salt in the upstream inflow cwater is the salt concentration in the ditch wetland system gl 1 ws is the reverse seepage water from the drainage ditch to the farmland groundwater only when the water level of the drainage ditch is higher than that of field groundwater m3 sp is the annual average amount of salt absorbed by plants hs is the equivalent depth of the salt stored in the wetland soil which is equal to the product of the salt retention depth hs and porosity of soil σ mm ks is the salt exchange coefficient of the wetland soil and water cs 0 is the initial salt concentration of the wetland soil gl 1 vwet is the water depth in the wetland m and vwet 0 and c0 are the initial water depth and initial salt concentration in the wetland respectively the other symbols have the same meanings as before assuming that the parameters c d c r c d d r w s s p and q out are known and constant the influence of the upstream inflow on the wetland salt concentration in the ditch can mainly be ascribed to the two aspects of volume of incoming water and salt concentration of incoming water if the system has a large amount of upstream inflow or a low concentration of water in the area wetland salt accumulation will slow down and even improve the water and salt environment of the wetland thus benefiting the health of the wetland otherwise it will accelerate salt accumulation in the wetland which will be detrimental to the health of the wetland 2 3 ditch wetland water management when the step is long and the drainage outlet is buried at a certain depth fluctuations in the water level of the wetland system can be ignored that is v wet t v wet 0 then we introduce a new parameter β which is the wetland outflow ratio it can be expressed as follows 13 β q o u t q i n p r d by substituting eqs 13 into 12 we can obtain the relationship between the salt concentration of the ditch wetland system and the wetland outflow ratio as follows 14 c w a t e r t c d t a a g d t c r t a a g r t q i n t c i n t a w e t s p t k s a w e t c s 0 c 0 v w e t 0 k s a w e t v w e t 0 β q i n t p t r t d t w s t this parameter β can be used to express wetland water and salt management when β 0 the farmland system is a non closed system meaning that both salt input and salt output occur in the wetland salt output is generally achieved through wetland drainage when the wetland salt input is equal to the output the wetland system has a stable state assuming that the salt concentration in the steady state is c wet and the wetland salt tolerance threshold is c which is the salt concentration for wetland plants fish and typical wetland biological communities can normally grow and reproduce c wet and the c share the following three relationships 1 if c wet c the ditch wetland system is relatively healthy the adverse effects of upstream inflow are not sufficiently strong to damage the health of the wetland under the wetland outflow ratio β this means that drainage control measures can be implemented to appropriately raise the height of the drainage outlet to reduce the discharge 2 if c wet c the wetland health is in a critical state and at this time wetland drainage is necessary and appropriate under the wetland outflow ratio 3 if c wet c the upstream inflow water is threatening the wetland environment and the drainage rate of the wetland should be increased to mitigate the adverse effects of the inflow 2 4 data collection field monitoring was conducted in the study area between 2009 and 2013 data on the weather soil water table ditch water table crop electrical conductivity irrigation information and other parameters were collected these data were used in drainmod calculations and as inputs to the model established in this study meteorological data included real time data june 2009 october 2010 obtained from small automatic weather stations watchdog2000 usa installed in the study area fig 4 and long term 1951 2005 data from nearby weather stations the meteorological parameters monitored included rainfall temperature wind speed barometric pressure relative humidity and incoming radiation in the selected typical farmlands a and b fig 4 the field groundwater table depth in field observation wells ranged from 1 5 to 2 3 m with an average value of 2 1 m during the observation period ditch water table depth was determined using water gauges and the average value was 1 97 m water gauges were installed in two ditches near farmlands a and b electrical conductivity was measured using a conductivity meter sension 156 hach company usa the water samples used to measure the electrical conductivity were collected from the observation wells and three ditches m n and p fig 4 indicated by black dots the average salinity of the groundwater was 4 43 gl 1 and the salinity of the wetland was 3 6 gl 1 with an average value of 3 95 gl 1 the salinity of the irrigation water diverted from the yellow river was 0 5 gl 1 the average salinity of the inflow water was 3 87 gl 1 soil salinity data of the wetland bottom sediment were collected from three ditches fig 4 indicated by black dots the porosity of the ditch wetland soil σ was 0 5 and the effective depth of the soil h s was 0 3 m the salt exchange flux k s was 0 365 myr 1 as derived from thomann and muller 1987 the threshold salinity of the soil saturation extract for achieving 100 cotton yield is 4 92 gl 1 ayers and westcot 1985 the wetland salt tolerance threshold recorded in those studies was 8 10 gl 1 huckelbridge 2008 clunie et al 2002 which can maintain the normal life cycle of wetland plants fishes and some key biomes according to li et al 2008 the salt absorption of phragmites is 0 574 10 3 kgm 2 yr 1 the average depth and bottom width of the drainage ditch were 2 5 m and 3 m respectively the slope coefficient of the drainage ditch was 1 1 5 and the drainage ditch spacing was 100 m the wetland coverage was about 75 unfortunately upstream inflow and outflow data were not available for the ditch wetland to address this problem we used eq 8 to estimate the average outflow and inflow because the ditch wetland drainage output and the upstream inflow input of most drainage ditches shared the same channel if water input existed the drainage output was considered zero 3 results 3 1 calculation and analysis of water balance in study area the field hydrological process is the basis for the calculation and analysis of water balance in the drainage ditch wetland with limited monitoring data the drainmod model was calibrated and verified with existing datasets collated using the data obtained between june 2009 and october 2010 this period was chosen largely based on the availability of data the calibration and validation results can be found in li et al 2018 drainmod simulates the field hydrological process considerably well by using the drainage process simulated by drainmod and the field monitoring data in conjunction with eqs 2 8 the volumes of upstream inflow outflow and sub irrigation in the area were calculated the results are summarized in table 1 according to table 1 for a unit length of the drainage ditch the total upstream inflow was approximately 13 64 m3 sub drainage was 0 28 m3 and rainfall input was only 5 29 m3 within the calculation period the upstream inflow was considerably larger than the other forms of replenishment in the wetlands this means that the upstream inflow was the main factor from the viewpoint of maintaining the wetland hydrological environment in the drainage ditch the total outflow was approximately 8 07 m3 accounting for 42 of the total wetland inflow that is β was equal to 0 42 the time distribution of the upstream inflow that it mainly occurred at the end of each irrigation season the total sub irrigation during the monitoring period was 6 62 m3 per m of ditch sub irrigation restricts field drainage thereby reducing farmland drainage and pollutant output and increasing shallow groundwater use the fundamental reason for sub irrigation is that the upstream inflow raises the water table of the drainage ditch wetland 3 2 verification of analytical model of upstream inflow influence based on salinity monitoring the salt concentration of a ditch wetland is an essential indicator for examining the effects of upstream inflows into the wetland based on the calculated water balance and measured salinity data we used the analytical model of upstream inflow influence to calculate the ditch wetland salinity during the monitoring period the observed salt concentration values were used to regulate the model predicted values fig 5 depicts the measured and model predicted salt concentrations in the ditch wetland during the monitoring period between june 2009 and october 2010 the predictions made using the analytical model for upstream inflow influence generally agreed with the field measurements the average deviation was 0 305 gl 1 mean absolute deviation was 0 484 gl 1 and correlation coefficient was 0 43 between the measured and the predicted values as shown in fig 5 the salinity growth trend was irregular but according to the predicted and observed results the salt concentration exhibited a clear flat trough and periods of low values were highly consistent with the upstream inflows table 1 in addition several peaks were often observed in july and august as well the reason was that the salinity of the ditch wetland increased with time because of the evaporation effect before each recharge event but the upstream low salt content inflow quickly lowered the salinity in the ditches the salinity of the wetland ranged between 3 and 6 gl 1 during the monitoring period with an average value of 3 95 gl 1 which is lower than the wetland salt tolerance threshold therefore the ditch wetland system in the study area was in a relatively healthy state this reflected the positive effect of the inflow from the upstream regions especially the inflow of low salinity on the wetland water and salt environment 3 3 effect of upstream inflows on ditch wetland system in the study area the volume and salt concentrations of the upstream inflows are the two main indicators that reflect the characteristics of the upstream inflows different upstream inflows may have positive or negative effects on the water and salt environment in the ditch wetland analyzing the influence rules of the upstream inflows can help us to formulate scientific and reasonable wetland water and salt management measures to maintain the ecological functions of the wetland water and salt management measures must often be long lasting so we used annual average data to analyze the effects of upstream inflow water on the ditch wetland the average of the measured salt concentration data was used as the initial salt concentration and the average of the ditch water table data was used as the initial water table of the ditch wetland system the basic data are listed in table 2 3 3 1 impact of upstream inflow salt concentration the effects of upstream water volume and water quality on the water and salt environment in the wetland are often inseparable in order to analyze the effect of salt concentration alone we assumed that the only inputs that varied between scenarios were the salinity concentration of the inflow to the wetland which remain constant over time this meant that the wetland hydrological process of scenarios were same then we used the analytical model to simulate and calculate the process of change in wetland salt concentration under upstream inflow of different salt concentrations the results are shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the salinity of the upstream inflow has a great effect on the ditch wetland system the wetland salinity concentration is positively correlated to the upstream inflow salinity concentration as the salinity concentration of the upstream inflow decreases the wetland salinity concentration gradually decreases in the steady state according to the results when c q 2 7 gl 1 the wetland salt concentration decreases rapidly and then gradually reaches a steady state the salt concentration in the stable state is slightly higher than that of the upstream inflow water the upstream inflow exerts a dilution effect on the salinity of the ditch wetland therefore if the salt concentration of the ditch wetland system reaches the salt tolerance limit dilution with fresh water can restore the system to a healthy state but the salt concentration of the supplemental water must be less than 2 7 gl 1 when c q 2 7 gl 1 the upstream inflow has almost no effect on the salt concentration of the ditch wetland system when c q 2 7 gl 1 the salt concentration of the farmland wetland system will gradually increase and then reach a steady state in other words an upstream inflow salinity greater than 2 7 gl 1 will negatively affect the water and salt environment of the ditch wetland system note that when the salinity of the upstream incoming water is 6 1 gl 1 the farmland wetland system will reach the wetland salt tolerance threshold after 5 years when the salinity of the upstream water is greater than 6 1 gl 1 the function of the wetland ecosystem will be damaged and the time window for implementing preventive measures will be shorter than 5 years in summary although the salt input will increase the total salt content of the wetland if the upstream inflow salt concentration is low it may not have a large adverse effect on the water and salt environment of the wetland and it may even dilute the salt concentration of the wetland however when the salt concentration is high measures must be implemented in time to mitigate the damage caused by the upstream water 3 3 2 impact of upstream inflow volume the effect of the volume of upstream inflow on the ditch wetland system is mainly reflected on the total salt input into the wetland and the hydrological processes of the wetland system the change in the volume of upstream inflow in an area will inevitably cause the original water balance to change however if the drainage outlet is kept unchanged the hydrological changes caused by any increase or decrease in the volume of upstream inflow will be directly and quickly reflected in the wetland drainage the other affected wetland hydrological variables are sub irrigation and farmland drainage which change with the depth of the wetland water level changes in the upstream inflow volume in the area have a limited effect on the wetland water table depth because of the large wetland area our observations of wetland water table depth corroborate this point therefore when the system has little change of the amount of upstream inflow its impact on sub irrigation and farmland drainage can be negligible under the above assumptions we use the proposed analytical model to calculate the ditch wetland salinity accumulation process under the six hypothetical scenarios of upstream inflow with different volumes but same salinity 3 87 gl 1 and the results are shown in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that the ditch wetland will reach the steady state under the current upstream inflow and drainage mode after the first 4 years and the steady state salt concentration c wet is 5 74 gl 1 however the salt concentration of the ditch wetland systems shows a cumulative phenomenon with time regardless of whether the volume of upstream inflow water increases or decreases when the salinity of the upstream inflow is constant 3 87 gl 1 this is because the salinity of the upstream inflow 3 87 gl 1 is higher than the critical salt concentration of dilution 2 7 gl 1 however compared with the current upstream inflow as the volume of upstream inflow water increases the time required for the salt concentration of the wetland system to reach a stable state is shortened and the salt concentration in the stable state decreases the reverse is true when the volume of upstream inflow water decreases when the amount of upstream incoming water decreases by 25 of the current status the salt concentration of the farmland wetland system will reach a stable state that is close to the wetland salt tolerance threshold this shows that the volume of external water in the area cannot be less than 75 of the current level to maintain a long term healthy environment for the wetland system under the current conditions therefore the upstream incoming water plays a positive role in the healthy operation of the farmland wetland system however when the volume of upstream incoming water increases or decreases equally the reduction has a stronger effect on the wetland system notably if the volume of upstream inflow water is excessive it can improve the current status of the ditch wetland system but its role will be limited and the wetland discharge will increase which may adversely affect the environment of the downstream water body 3 4 impact of upstream inflow the effects of the volume and salt concentration of the upstream inflow on the ditch wetland system are often inseparable to provide a clearer understanding for water and salt management of ditch wetland systems we studied the comprehensive effects of different volumes and salt concentrations of the upstream inflow on the stable salt concentrations of the ditch wetland system with the current wetland outflow ratio and the results are shown in fig 8 the upstream inflow volumes are increased or decreased by a certain proportion based on the current inflow as expected at a given salinity the stable salt concentration of the ditch wetland system decreases with increasing inflows whereas at a given inflow volume an increase in salinity increases the stable salt concentration in addition a reduction in salinity can to some extent compensate for a decrease in inflow volume conversely an increase in the inflow volume can partially compensate for an increase in salinity however according to this model salinity appears to be a major determinant of the stable salt concentration based on the slope of the curve by drawing the initial salt concentration of the ditch wetland system c 0 3 95 gl 1 stable state salt concentration of the ditch wetland system under the current conditions c wet 5 74 gl 1 and the wetland salt tolerance threshold c 9 gl 1 we can divide the upstream inflow volume and salt concentration combinations into four different risk areas namely risk free interval low risk interval medium risk interval and high risk interval the upstream inflow in the risk free interval will have a positive effect on the ditch wetland system and promote the desalination of salinized wetland although the upstream inflow in the low risk area causes salt accumulation in the ditch wetland system the rate of salt accumulation is lower than the current rate and the resulting salt concentration is lower than the salt concentration in the stable state of the ditch wetland system compared with the current upstream inflow the upstream water in the medium risk interval will increase the level of salination of the wetland system but the salt in the wetland system would still be within the threshold value of wetland salt and the ecosystem function will not be greatly damaged the upstream water in the high risk interval will destroy the ditch wetland ecosystem through this division of risk intervals we can more clearly understand the effects of the upstream inflow on the ditch wetland system which is helpful for guiding the water and salt management of the ditch wetland system to mitigate the effects of the upstream inflow 3 5 water and salt management of ditch wetland under the influence of upstream inflow ditch wetlands are storage response areas for non point source pollution of upstream irrigation areas colin et al 2004 borin et al 2001 when the retained pollutants exceed the capacity of the ditch wetland systems the ditch wetland ecosystem will lose balance and become a source of pollution for the downstream water bodies defra 2004 therefore it is necessary to formulate corresponding drainage strategies based on the effects on upstream inflow on the water and salt dynamics of ditch wetlands to sustain the ecological function of the wetlands and reduce the adverse effects on downstream water bodies the wetland outflow ratio β can be used to determine measures for wetland water and salt management and its value ranges from 0 to 1 different wetland outflow ratios represent different wetland drainage intensities by adjusting the size of the wetland outflow ratio the water and salt balance relationship in the wetland can be adjusted to achieve the desired wetland water and salt management outcomes the wetland outflow ratio can be regulated by implementing controlled drainage and other engineering measures when β equals 1 the ditch wetland is completely open it is difficult to form a wetland in the ditch and the system has no threat of salinization however this scenario will lead to a large amount of salt output which will adversely affect the water environment of the downstream discharge area thus to sustain the healthy operation of ditch wetlands and reduce downstream environmental pollution it is necessary to understand the minimum discharge under the influence of the upstream influent water to guide the formulation of water and salt management measures therefore we use an analytical model to calculate the space available for adjusting the wetland outflow ratio under the current upstream inflow conditions the steady state salt concentration under the current wetland outflow ratio 0 42 is considerably lower than the salt tolerance threshold fig 9 therefore the system has some room to reduce the current wetland outflow ratio to reduce the adverse effects of drainage on the downstream water bodies as the discharge ratio decreases the time required for the wetland to reach a stable salt state gradually increases and the salt concentration in the steady state c wet gradually increases as well when the wetland outflow ratio is 0 25 c wet is relatively close to the wetland salt tolerance threshold therefore the wetland outflow ratio of 0 25 is the minimum drainage intensity under the current upstream inflow conditions the parameters such as drainage and salt output under different wetland outflow ratios are compared the results are summarized in table 3 the data indicate that when the wetland outflow ratio is reduced from 0 42 to 0 25 the wetland water drainage volume and salt output are reduced by approximately 40 and 10 annually respectively the time required to reach the steady state is approximately 10 years which means that a considerable time window is available for wetland governance therefore the space available for adjustment of the wetland outflow ratio under the current upstream inflow conditions is 0 25 1 00 where a β value between 0 25 and 0 42 can reduce the salt output considering the effects of upstream incoming water on the steady state salinity of the ditch wetland compared with the current upstream incoming water when the salt concentration of the upstream incoming water increases or the when volume of upstream incoming water decreases the stable channel salinity salt concentration will change considerably and gradually approaching the salt tolerance threshold of the wetland or even exceed the salt tolerance threshold at this point the appropriate space of β will become smaller and its minimum value will eventually approach 1 otherwise the appropriate space of β will widen and its minimum value will eventually approach 0 therefore an upstream inflow with no risk and low risk will widen the appropriate space of β while an upstream inflow with medium and high risk will narrow the suitable space of β 4 discussion even though the problems of elemental toxicity and elevated salinities have occurred in some wetlands that receive salinized upstream inflow in most cases the impact of upstream inflow on the water and salt environment of wetlands is not very clear and upstream inflow is rarely incorporated into wetland water and salt management models jia et al 2011 this raises questions about the sustainability and safety of wetlands understanding and quantifying the linkages between water and salt in both upstream inflow and the ditch wetland system and assessing the effects of upstream inflows on wetland water and salt balance lend support to the identification of water salt regulation plans that respect wetland integrity and sustainability therefore we developed an analytical model to study this problem and cover some gaps of the influence of inflow from the upstream irrigation area in the literature bauer et al 2006 jolly et al 2008 jia et al 2011 the model has more general applicability and can be used in other areas outside the study area because it is established based on the basic principles of water salt balance however it needs to be stated that this research is mainly aimed at the salinization of ditches and wetlands in semi arid irrigation areas affected by farmland drainage and upstream water the salinity mainly comes from farmland drainage and upstream water which is greatly affected by agricultural production if wetlands in other areas outside the zone face the same problems or under the premise of clarifying the source of salt and moisture the model can still be applied but for the management of ditch wetlands where the main threat is eutrophication some necessary modifications to the model are required because of the different nature of pollutants another potential advantage of this model is simple data acquisition and low cost the input data of this model mainly includes weather drainage upstream water and salt concentration etc which are easy to obtain taking china as an example most county level government departments have established weather stations the weather data is relatively complete and can be obtained for free through the weather data sharing network for farmland drainage data if the drainage system combined with pipe and open ditch or open ditch drainage system is used the farmland drainage can be measured by monitoring equipment such as flow rate and water measuring weir the upstream inflow can be measured at the upstream inflow of the ditch wetland through a weir and other equipment the salt concentration data can be measured with a conductivity meter and other equipment therefore the input data of the model can be easily obtained by using conventional instruments and methods and the cost is usually lower but for a specific study area the monitoring cost is also related to the traffic conditions area size monitoring frequency and hydrological conditions in the area this often leads to a cost increase even so compared with the use of industrial measures to treat farmland drainage pollution pretty et al 2000 controlled of these pollutants at source and treated the pollutants by ditch wetland is still the least costly effective and durable method kay et al 2009 verhoeven et al 2006 our results show that the volume of incoming upstream water is far greater than that from wetland water sources such as farmland drainage rainfall and surface runoff in this study area and the upstream water is the most critical influential factor for this ditch wetland compared with the original model jia et al 2011 the accuracy of the new model that takes into account the influence of upstream water has been improved and the effects of the upstream inflow cannot be ignored a similar conclusion was made in studies involving the ciénega a non tidal brackish wetland with a discrete inflow and outflow huckelbridge et al 2010 gomezsapiens et al 2013 however in the current literature on ditch wetland research the effects of upstream water on the ditch wetland system are rarely included in wetland water and salt management models and few accurate field data pertaining to upstream inflow with time are available an increase in the salt concentration or a decrease in the volume of the upstream inflow adversely affects the ditch wetland ecology this conclusion is consistent with huckelbridge et al 2010 and gomezsapiens et al 2013 they concluded that the wetland is more sensitive to changes in salinity than to the inflow volume our approach supports this conclusion this is greatly significant for the planning of ditch wetland ecological water requirement in dry irrigation areas which often comes from drainage and upstream irrigation return water compared to water quantity water quality does not attract adequate attention in the planning process huckelbridge et al 2010 found that the salinity concentrations in the wetland generally increase over the first 2 years of the calibration period but then follow a relatively steady cycle over the remainder of the period we arrived at similar results but different from huckelbridge et al 2010 we did not find any stable cycle this is because we adopted a year as the time scale and ignored the influence of seasons the results of huckelbridge et al 2010 also show that when the salt concentration of the wetland follows a relatively steady cycle the range of change in the salt concentration is smaller especially in the larger wetland cells this finding is consistent with our result that it is feasible to ignore the influence of seasons when sufficient seasonal monitoring data are not available in addition we analyzed the comprehensive effects of the quantity and salinity of the water inflows and created risk levels for the effects upstream inflows which will help with the development of suitable water and salt management measures for ditch wetland systems to prevent any adverse effects on the ecosystem function we can adjust the water and salt balance of the ditch wetland system by adjusting the wetland outflow ratio to mitigate the adverse effects of salt output on the downstream water bodies however owing to a lack of observation data about the vegetation evolution and insufficient understanding of the responses among salt and water dynamics and vegetation evolution in ditch wetlands in arid areas we did not study the effects of upstream inflows on the vegetation evolution in ditch wetland systems moreover it would be disadvantageous only the threshold value of salinity as a parameter to characterize the effects of upstream inflows on ditch wetland systems therefore we will study the responses of wetland drainage regulation salt and water dynamics vegetation in the future and propose suitable plans for drainage water management by considering both agricultural production and wetland environmental protection 5 conclusion a ditch wetland system in a dry area not only serves as a field drainage for crop growth but also provides ecosystem services however the water resources in dry areas are very scarce and ecological water requirement is often ignored ditch wetland systems face the threat of salinization when they receive only highly saline agricultural drainage nevertheless agricultural drainage often is not the sole source of water and salt input into wetlands because in some cases various types of inflows such as outside water and salt water from upstream irrigation areas may exist this phenomenon exists in most of the ditch wetlands downstream of irrigation areas in china it is of great significance to fully utilize the upstream inflows to maintain the ecological functions of ditch wetland systems however the effects and risks of upstream inflows on ditch wetland systems are unclear with a case study in this paper we proposed an analytical model to reveal the influence of upstream inflows on the water and salt balance of a ditch wetland system the results showed that an increase in salt concentration or a decrease in the volume of upstream inflow that is not in risk free interval will adversely affect the ditch wetland although the current upstream inflow condition will lead to salt accumulation in the ditch wetland system the salt concentration in the stable state would be considerably lower than the salt tolerance threshold and it is possible to regular the wetland outflow ratio to reduce the wetland salt output while we focused on the influence of only salt concentration on ditch wetlands the vegetation evolution of ditches is equally

10185,salt drainage from farmlands can potentially degrade the ecological function of ditch wetlands in arid and semi arid irrigation areas however such ditch wetlands may accept different quantities and salt concentrations of upstream inflows which may have positive or negative effects on the water and salt dynamics of ditch wetland systems and therefore on the associated water and salt management measures in this paper we propose a new theoretical analysis model that enables us to study the influence of different upstream inflows on the water salt dynamics and drainage strategies for ditch wetland in the study area the research carried out by us has revealed that upstream inflow is one of the most important factors influencing ditch wetlands under the current conditions an increase in salinity or a decrease in flow will negatively affect the ecology of the ditch wetland in contrast which will improve the ditch wetland environment nevertheless wetlands are more sensitive to changes in salinity than to the volume of upstream inflow based on the combined effects of the salinity and quantity of its inflow on the wetlands it can be divided into four categories no risk low risk medium risk and high risk the inflow with no risk and low risk will have a positive effect on the ditch wetland system and drainage management while medium risk and high risk conditions will increase the difficulty of drainage management these results provide the insights needed to guide the design of drainage management practices for ditch wetlands in semi arid regions that receive upstream inflows to maximize the benefits to the agricultural system and the environment keywords farmland wetland system water and salt balance risk categories wetland outflow ratio drainage management 1 introduction the ecology of dry areas is fragile because of limited rainfall water resources and wetland resources are scarce in such regions in such a context ditch wetlands composed of an open drainage ditch system can not only provide crucial agricultural production services but also provide crucial ecological and landscape services herzon and helenius 2008 needelman et al 2007 the ditch wetland system is pivotal for the sustainable development of the social economy environment and ecology in arid areas however agricultural drainage systems are mainly designed for salinity control in arid and semi arid regions and drainage water contains a large quantity of salt leached from soils studies have demonstrated that an increase in salinity leads to a significant decrease in vegetation cover huckelbridge et al 2010 when the retained pollutants such as salt exceed the capacity of a ditch the underlying ditch ecosystem will lose its balance if the biodiversity of a ditch wetland is destroyed its function of processing other pollutants will be affected as well the ditch system will transform from a sink colin et al 2004 borin et al 2001 of pollutants into a source defra 2004 of pollutants and spread them throughout the surrounding area through the ditch network system vaughan et al 2007 sharpley et al 2007 nguyen and sukias 2002 moloney et al 2019 thus agricultural production practices such as drainage discharge have been blamed as major contributors to the salinization of wetlands jin 2008 huckelbridge et al 2010 clarke 2015 if agricultural drainage is the sole inflow into a wetland salt accumulation in the ditch wetland is more likely to reach a critical level which would be detrimental to the wetland s ecosystem services jia et al 2011 in the absence of a reasonable strategy to manage the salinity changes in a ditch wetland caused by natural and agricultural production practices large scale salinization of the ditch wetland will occur causing the wetland to lose its ecological service function removing salts from a wetland is difficult a few researchers have suggested that salts may be removed from the system by harvesting wetland plants such as reeds phragmites australis li et al 2008 lan et al 2003 however a reed is considered a pseudohalophyte exclusion halophyte which stores salt in the underground part mainly the root of the plant thus reducing the salt content and salt stress of the aerial parts of the plant breckle 1995 this physiological characteristic ensures normal growth and development of the reed meaning that the amount of salt absorbed by the reed from the wetland is generally insignificant however salt is not the sole force and a diverse array of other abiotic and biotic factors drive biodiversity changes mitsch and gosselink 2000 stated that wetland hydrology is probably the single most vital determinant of the establishment and maintenance of the structure processes and functioning of a wetland salinity is intimately linked to hydrology because water mobilizes salts and alters their distribution and concentration therefore numerous studies have been conducted to devise effective measures to mitigate the adverse impact of ditch wetland salinity among these freshwater recharge and artificial irrigation are two commonly adopted management practices to lower salinity levels lamontagne et al 2006 meredith and beesley 2009 quinn 2009 however drought is another important threat especially in downstream direction of arid and semi arid irrigation areas due to its disadvantage of being located far away from the water source even the irrigation water is rarely guaranteed but in many cases the ditch wetland is often located in here therefore freshwater recharge for ditch wetland is more difficult to guarantee on time once the wetland salinity has breached a critical level poor freshwater may cause wetland salinity management to be in trouble however agricultural drainage often is not the sole route for water and salt input into wetlands in some cases various types of inflow such as external water and salt water from upstream irrigation areas may exist most irrigation areas in china often produce large amounts of irrigation return flows and drainage in the agricultural production process owing to the lack of maintenance and management of irrigation systems imperfect irrigation and drainage projects and the use of traditional irrigation models and empirical irrigation management measures zhao et al 2006 jia et al 2013 lei et al 2002 upstream inflow is an opportunity and challenge for the ditch wetlands that receive water from upstream irrigation areas but this is typically a complex problem when the salt concentration of the inflow is low salt enrichment of the downstream ditch wetland system can be alleviated by contrast the inflow may accelerate the salt enrichment the quantity of the inflow affects the water and salt balance of the downstream ditch wetland system as well therefore recharge events will either have a positive or negative effect on ditch wetland and will lead to highly variable hydrology and salt concentrations however it is unclear how the amounts and salt concentrations of inflows may positively or negatively impact the ditch wetland ecology how rapidly may salt accumulation in these wetlands reach a level endangering their ecological function under the inflows and which management options can be employed to ensure that the inflows sustain the wetland ecosystem lacking of clarity understanding of the inflow influence presents new challenges for drainage management from the perspective of water and salt management and drainage strategies in ditch wetlands our research aims at finding a solution for this challenging problem of drainage management under the upstream inflow influence we examine some previous work and propose an integrated model describing hydrology hydrodynamics and salt dynamics in this study to predict the water and salt balance in ditch wetlands under recharge events the proposed mathematical model was tested in a case study of a semi arid region in china in this paper the established model is used to discuss the influence of upstream water quantity and salt concentration on wetland water environment and drainage management strategies this paper recommends practical water and salinity management options for ditch wetlands that ensure system sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description lubotan is a reclaimed salinized irrigation area located in shaanxi province china with a wetland system consisting of open drainage ditches fig 1 the farmland area in this region is approximately 160 ha the number drainage ditches of all levels is 51 and the ditch wetland area is approximately 14 61 ha in addition to natural precipitation and local drainage surface runoff from two upstream irrigation districts discharge into the low lying lubotan area at the end of each irrigation season drainage water from irrigated farmlands was initially planned to be discharged into a nearby river through a main drainage ditch however this main ditch could not be fully opened for both environmental and economic reasons therefore a large wetland was formed in the ditch drainage system jia et al 2011 according to our observations and investigations over the past few years this ditch wetland has formed a relatively stable ecosystem with reeds phragmites communis and suaeda salsa as the dominant populations mixed with artemisia anethifolia lycium chinense setaria viridis chloris virgata armeniaca mume and other species the dominant species at the bottom of the drainage ditch is reeds and growing season of reeds lasts from april to october the reeds is tall and dense which provide hidden habitats for animals the animal life in this region mainly includes saltwater fish water birds and a few reptiles lubotan has become a farmland wetland system that is suitable for plant and animal habitation according to meteorological data lubotan experiences low precipitation rates averaging 554 mm per year and high evapotranspiration et rates averaging 1200 mm per year the drainage water discharged from farmlands may be partially or entirely lost in the ditches through et leading to an increase in the salinity of the remaining waters over time this is detrimental for crop production and wetland ecology however based on field observations salinity in the wetland ditches has not increased significantly in recent years one possible explanation is that the inflows from the upstream regions are beneficial for salinity control in lubotan 2 2 model development in order to understand the potential effects of upstream inflows with different water volumes and salinity on the ditch wetland and suggest alternatives for the sustainable management of water we modified the model which we developed in jia et al 2011 compared to the original model jia et al 2011 the advantages of new model are as follows 1 upstream inflow and sub irrigation are considered in the ditch wetland water balance 2 wetland outflow ratio are redefined 3 the influence of sediments on wetland water and salt balance are simplified according to the research results of jia et al 2011 4 field drainage dynamic data is included in the calibration and verification of the model to improve the simulation accuracy of the model according to the input and output of wetland water in the drainage ditch the wetland can be viewed as a single wetland entity jia et al 2011 therefore the farmland wetland system can be described as shown in fig 2 the main source of water supply for ditch wetlands are local farmland drainage upstream inflows and some local precipitation the water outputs from the ditch wetland are wetland outflow et and sub irrigation sub irrigation often occurs when the ditch water table is higher than the farmland water table however given the complexity of wetland hydrology it is necessary to describe each of these water components individually 2 2 1 local farmland drainage surface runoff and sub irrigation farmland drainage is a paramount part of the farmland hydrological cycle however owing to the influence of meteorology agricultural production and other factors field observations have shortcomings such as long duration and considerable labor requirements and high material costs therefore field observations and theoretical models are usually used to study the process of farmland hydrological cycles feddes et al 1978 skaggs et al 1981 kanwar et al 1983 the field hydrology model drainmod skaggs 1980 can be used to simulate the water balance in a field this model calculates water infiltration by using the green ampt equation subsurface drainage by using the hooghoudt equation when the water table is below the land surface and subsurface drainage by using the kirkham equation when surface ponding occurs with the abovementioned methods and equations drainmod calculates infiltration subsurface drainage surface runoff and depth to water table on an hourly basis the results can be output on a daily monthly or yearly basis according to the user s choice when the water level of a drainage ditch is higher than the groundwater level in the field the field hydrological process is represented as transportation of water from the drainage ditch to the field this hydrological process can be simulated using the sub irrigation module in the drainmod model the actual situation is set in the model interface when the drainage ditch water level is higher than the field water level the calculated subsurface drainage is negative the negative subsurface drainage represents the water that is transported from the drainage ditch to the field through sub irrigation 2 2 2 evapotranspiration the et calculation mentioned in this paper comprises two aspects field et and wetland et the results of field et calculations comprise one of the files input into drainmod to calculate the field drainage process penman monteith method is used in conjunction with weather data to calculate the daily field potential et et0 and the crop coefficient method is used to calculate the crop potential et petk allen et al 1998 the penman monteith equation is based on the theory of energy balance and water balance monteith 1965 this method includes multiple variables such as air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed which are used to calculate the et thus this method is superior to other empirical approaches in terms of transferability and predictive power jensen et al 1990 it has been used in numerous applications and has been shown to be one of the best models for estimating potential et rates in our study area pan 2011 the et in the drainmod output files is the actual et aet that is determined by comparing the available soil water upward flux and the potential et if the upward flux is greater than or equal to the pet aet equals pet otherwise aet equals the soil water upward flux in drainmod various empirical methods exist for calculating wetland et but most of them use local surface evaporation of water e 0 or potential et et0 to approximate the wetland water consumption thus neglecting the effects of vegetation jia et al 2004 zhou et al 2007 studies have shown that the reed community wetland et is similar to the et under farmland vegetation growth conditions yu et al 2007 and it is also closely related to wetland coverage allen et al 1996 therefore based on the consideration of wetland coverage allen et al 1996 the actual et rate can be calculated as follows 1 e t c e t 0 0 54 s v s 0 0 22 where etc is the actual wetland et mm d et0 is the local potential et mm d and sv and s0 are the vegetation cover and proportion of water surface area respectively 2 2 3 water balance according to the theory of water balance the change in total water volume in a drainage ditch can be expressed as follows 2 δ w w i n w o u t w e t w e t where δw is the change in water volume in the ditch wetland m3 win is the amount of water entering the wetland m3 which can be expressed by eq 3 wout is the wetland drainage m3 which can be expressed by eq 4 wetwet is the et in the ditch wetland m3 3 w i n p a w e t d a a g r a a g q i n 4 w o u t q o u t w s where aag is the farmland area awet is the ditch wetland area p is rainfall mm d is the local farmland subsurface drainage mm r is local surface runoff mm qin is upstream inflow m3 ws is the sub irrigation m3 and qout is the wetland drainage output m3 by substituting eqs 3 and 4 in eq 2 the following equation is obtained 5 δ w p a w e t d a a g r a a g q i n a w e t e t w e t q o u t w s the cross section of the drainage ditch in the study area is a regular trapezoid it is assumed that the bottom width of the drainage ditch is b m and the slope coefficient is i as shown in fig 3 when the water surface depth of the drainage ditch decreases from h 1 to h 2 the amount of water change in the drainage ditch per unit length 1 m can be computed as follows 6 δ w 1 2 δ h 2 b 2 i δ h where w is the volume of water change in the drainage ditch per unit length 1 m m3 and h is the change in the water table in the ditch h h2 h1 m when the water level in the ditch rises h 0 the change in the volume of water w is positive otherwise h 0 w is negative therefore the moisture change in the ditch wetland can be expressed as follows 7 δ w δ w l where l is total length of drainage ditches m by substituting eqs 6 and 7 into eq 5 the following equation is obtained 8 δ q q i n q o u t 1 2 δ h 2 b 2 i δ h l p a w e t d a a g r a a g e t w e t a w e t w s according to eq 8 the relationship between the change in wetland water volume and the upstream inflow input and output can be determined as follows when q 0 the upstream inflow input is main cause of change in the volume of wetland water when q 0 the output from the wetland is main cause of change in the volume of wetland water when q 0 the wetland input and output are balanced 2 2 4 salt balance the purpose of the salt balance analysis is to study how salt change occurs in a wetland with time this is the basis for analyzing the effects of inflow water on the water and salt environment in a ditch wetland to this end water and mass balances are applied to the wetland to determine the exchange of water and salt among farmland inflow and wetland over time which leads to a change in the salinity concentration of the ditch wetland salt is a relatively stable substance and it generally does not react with other substances or decompose by itself according to mass balance analysis the system has two main sources of salt in the farmland wetland system namely drainage from farmland when the field water table is higher than the drainage ditch water table and upstream inflow salt output occurs through the following routes salt is moved from the wetland to the farmland when the field water table is lower than the drainage ditch water table stored in wetland soils discharged from the wetland with drainage and absorbed by plants before reaching a stable state the salinity of the farmland wetland system is dynamic and can be expressed as follows 9 c d t a a g d t c r t a a g r t c i n t a w

to solve however the ditch wetland salinity for water body and soil change in the same process and eventually tend to be equal jia et al 2011 when the time interval is long the salt balance of the soil and the water body in eq 9 can be simplified as follows 10 h s a w e t d c s t d t k s a w e t c w a t e r t c s 0 11 v w e t t d c w a t e r t d t v w e t t c w a t e r t v w e t 0 c 0 thus an expression for the wetland salt concentration c water t can be obtained 12 c w a t e r t c d t a a g d t c r t a a g r t q i n t c i n t a w e t s p t k s a w e t c s 0 c 0 v w e t 0 k s a w e t v w e

ws is the reverse seepage water from the drainage ditch to the farmland groundwater only when the water level of the drainage ditch is higher than that of field groundwater m3 sp is the annual average amount of salt absorbed by plants hs is the equivalent depth of the salt stored in the wetland soil which is equal to the product of the salt retention depth hs and porosity of soil σ mm ks is the salt exchange coefficient of the wetland soil and water cs 0 is the initial salt concentration of the wetland soil gl 1 vwet is the water depth in the wetland m and vwet 0 and c0 are the initial water depth and initial salt concentration in the wetland respectively the other symbols have the same meanings as before assuming that the parameters c d c r c d d r w s s p and q out are known and constant the influence of the upstream inflow on the wetland salt concentration in the ditch can mainly be ascribed to the two aspects of volume of incoming water and salt concentration of incoming water if the system has a large amount of upstream inflow or a low concentration of water in the area wetland salt accumulation will slow down and even improve the water and salt environment of the wetland thus benefiting the health of the wetland otherwise it will accelerate salt accumulation in the wetland which will be detrimental to the health of the wetland 2 3 ditch wetland water management when the step is long and the drainage outlet is buried at a certain depth fluctuations in the water level of the wetland system can be ignored that is v wet t v wet 0 then we introduce a new parameter β which is the wetland outflow ratio it can be expressed as follows 13 β q o u t q i n p r d by substituting eqs 13 into 12 we can obtain the relationship between the salt concentration of the ditch wetland system and the wetland outflow ratio as follows 14 c w a t e r t c d t a a g d t c r t a a g r t q i n t c i n t a w e t s p t k s a w e t c s 0 c 0 v w e t 0 k s a w e t v w e t 0 β q i n t p t r t d t w s t this parameter β can be used to express wetland water and salt management when β 0 the farmland system is a non closed system meaning that both salt input and salt output occur in the wetland salt output is generally achieved through wetland drainage when the wetland salt input is equal to the output the wetland system has a stable state assuming that the salt concentration in the steady state is c wet and the wetland salt tolerance threshold is c which is the salt concentration for wetland plants fish and typical wetland biological communities can normally grow and reproduce c wet and the c share the following three relationships 1 if c wet c the ditch wetland system is relatively healthy the adverse effects of upstream inflow are not sufficiently strong to damage the health of the wetland under the wetland outflow ratio β this means that drainage control measures can be implemented to appropriately raise the height of the drainage outlet to reduce the discharge 2 if c wet c the wetland health is in a critical state and at this time wetland drainage is necessary and appropriate under the wetland outflow ratio 3 if c wet c the upstream inflow water is threatening the wetland environment and the drainage rate of the wetland should be increased to mitigate the adverse effects of the inflow 2 4 data collection field monitoring was conducted in the study area between 2009 and 2013 data on the weather soil water table ditch water table crop electrical conductivity irrigation information and other parameters were collected these data were used in drainmod calculations and as inputs to the model established in this study meteorological data included real time data june 2009 october 2010 obtained from small automatic weather stations watchdog2000 usa installed in the study area fig 4 and long term 1951 2005 data from nearby weather stations the meteorological parameters monitored included rainfall temperature wind speed barometric pressure relative humidity and incoming radiation in the selected typical farmlands a and b fig 4 the field groundwater table depth in field observation wells ranged from 1 5 to 2 3 m with an average value of 2 1 m during the observation period ditch water table depth was determined using water gauges and the average value was 1 97 m water gauges were installed in two ditches near farmlands a and b electrical conductivity was measured using a conductivity meter sension 156 hach company usa the water samples used to measure the electrical conductivity were collected from the observation wells and three ditches m n and p fig 4 indicated by black dots the average salinity of the groundwater was 4 43 gl 1 and the salinity of the wetland was 3 6 gl 1 with an average value of 3 95 gl 1 the salinity of the irrigation water diverted from the yellow river was 0 5 gl 1 the average salinity of the inflow water was 3 87 gl 1 soil salinity data of the wetland bottom sediment were collected from three ditches fig 4 indicated by black dots the porosity of the ditch wetland soil σ was 0 5 and the effective depth of the soil h s was 0 3 m the salt exchange flux k s was 0 365 myr 1 as derived from thomann and muller 1987 the threshold salinity of the soil saturation extract for achieving 100 cotton yield is 4 92 gl 1 ayers and westcot 1985 the wetland salt tolerance threshold recorded in those studies was 8 10 gl 1 huckelbridge 2008 clunie et al 2002 which can maintain the normal life cycle of wetland plants fishes and some key biomes according to li et al 2008 the salt absorption of phragmites is 0 574 10 3 kgm 2 yr 1 the average depth and bottom width of the drainage ditch were 2 5 m and 3 m respectively the slope coefficient of the drainage ditch was 1 1 5 and the drainage ditch spacing was 100 m the wetland coverage was about 75 unfortunately upstream inflow and outflow data were not available for the ditch wetland to address this problem we used eq 8 to estimate the average outflow and inflow because the ditch wetland drainage output and the upstream inflow input of most drainage ditches shared the same channel if water input existed the drainage output was considered zero 3 results 3 1 calculation and analysis of water balance in study area the field hydrological process is the basis for the calculation and analysis of water balance in the drainage ditch wetland with limited monitoring data the drainmod model was calibrated and verified with existing datasets collated using the data obtained between june 2009 and october 2010 this period was chosen largely based on the availability of data the calibration and validation results can be found in li et al 2018 drainmod simulates the field hydrological process considerably well by using the drainage process simulated by drainmod and the field monitoring data in conjunction with eqs 2 8 the volumes of upstream inflow outflow and sub irrigation in the area were calculated the results are summarized in table 1 according to table 1 for a unit length of the drainage ditch the total upstream inflow was approximately 13 64 m3 sub drainage was 0 28 m3 and rainfall input was only 5 29 m3 within the calculation period the upstream inflow was considerably larger than the other forms of replenishment in the wetlands this means that the upstream inflow was the main factor from the viewpoint of maintaining the wetland hydrological environment in the drainage ditch the total outflow was approximately 8 07 m3 accounting for 42 of the total wetland inflow that is β was equal to 0 42 the time distribution of the upstream inflow that it mainly occurred at the end of each irrigation season the total sub irrigation during the monitoring period was 6 62 m3 per m of ditch sub irrigation restricts field drainage thereby reducing farmland drainage and pollutant output and increasing shallow groundwater use the fundamental reason for sub irrigation is that the upstream inflow raises the water table of the drainage ditch wetland 3 2 verification of analytical model of upstream inflow influence based on salinity monitoring the salt concentration of a ditch wetland is an essential indicator for examining the effects of upstream inflows into the wetland based on the calculated water balance and measured salinity data we used the analytical model of upstream inflow influence to calculate the ditch wetland salinity during the monitoring period the observed salt concentration values were used to regulate the model predicted values fig 5 depicts the measured and model predicted salt concentrations in the ditch wetland during the monitoring period between june 2009 and october 2010 the predictions made using the analytical model for upstream inflow influence generally agreed with the field measurements the average deviation was 0 305 gl 1 mean absolute deviation was 0 484 gl 1 and correlation coefficient was 0 43 between the measured and the predicted values as shown in fig 5 the salinity growth trend was irregular but according to the predicted and observed results the salt concentration exhibited a clear flat trough and periods of low values were highly consistent with the upstream inflows table 1 in addition several peaks were often observed in july and august as well the reason was that the salinity of the ditch wetland increased with time because of the evaporation effect before each recharge event but the upstream low salt content inflow quickly lowered the salinity in the ditches the salinity of the wetland ranged between 3 and 6 gl 1 during the monitoring period with an average value of 3 95 gl 1 which is lower than the wetland salt tolerance threshold therefore the ditch wetland system in the study area was in a relatively healthy state this reflected the positive effect of the inflow from the upstream regions especially the inflow of low salinity on the wetland water and salt environment 3 3 effect of upstream inflows on ditch wetland system in the study area the volume and salt concentrations of the upstream inflows are the two main indicators that reflect the characteristics of the upstream inflows different upstream inflows may have positive or negative effects on the water and salt environment in the ditch wetland analyzing the influence rules of the upstream inflows can help us to formulate scientific and reasonable wetland water and salt management measures to maintain the ecological functions of the wetland water and salt management measures must often be long lasting so we used annual average data to analyze the effects of upstream inflow water on the ditch wetland the average of the measured salt concentration data was used as the initial salt concentration and the average of the ditch water table data was used as the initial water table of the ditch wetland system the basic data are listed in table 2 3 3 1 impact of upstream inflow salt concentration the effects of upstream water volume and water quality on the water and salt environment in the wetland are often inseparable in order to analyze the effect of salt concentration alone we assumed that the only inputs that varied between scenarios were the salinity concentration of the inflow to the wetland which remain constant over time this meant that the wetland hydrological process of scenarios were same then we used the analytical model to simulate and calculate the process of change in wetland salt concentration under upstream inflow of different salt concentrations the results are shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the salinity of the upstream inflow has a great effect on the ditch wetland system the wetland salinity concentration is positively correlated to the upstream inflow salinity concentration as the salinity concentration of the upstream inflow decreases the wetland salinity concentration gradually decreases in the steady state according to the results when c q 2 7 gl 1 the wetland salt concentration decreases rapidly and then gradually reaches a steady state the salt concentration in the stable state is slightly higher than that of the upstream inflow water the upstream inflow exerts a dilution effect on the salinity of the ditch wetland therefore if the salt concentration of the ditch wetland system reaches the salt tolerance limit dilution with fresh water can restore the system to a healthy state but the salt concentration of the supplemental water must be less than 2 7 gl 1 when c q 2 7 gl 1 the upstream inflow has almost no effect on the salt concentration of the ditch wetland system when c q 2 7 gl 1 the salt concentration of the farmland wetland system will gradually increase and then reach a steady state in other words an upstream inflow salinity greater than 2 7 gl 1 will negatively affect the water and salt environment of the ditch wetland system note that when the salinity of the upstream incoming water is 6 1 gl 1 the farmland wetland system will reach the wetland salt tolerance threshold after 5 years when the salinity of the upstream water is greater than 6 1 gl 1 the function of the wetland ecosystem will be damaged and the time window for implementing preventive measures will be shorter than 5 years in summary although the salt input will increase the total salt content of the wetland if the upstream inflow salt concentration is low it may not have a large adverse effect on the water and salt environment of the wetland and it may even dilute the salt concentration of the wetland however when the salt concentration is high measures must be implemented in time to mitigate the damage caused by the upstream water 3 3 2 impact of upstream inflow volume the effect of the volume of upstream inflow on the ditch wetland system is mainly reflected on the total salt input into the wetland and the hydrological processes of the wetland system the change in the volume of upstream inflow in an area will inevitably cause the original water balance to change however if the drainage outlet is kept unchanged the hydrological changes caused by any increase or decrease in the volume of upstream inflow will be directly and quickly reflected in the wetland drainage the other affected wetland hydrological variables are sub irrigation and farmland drainage which change with the depth of the wetland water level changes in the upstream inflow volume in the area have a limited effect on the wetland water table depth because of the large wetland area our observations of wetland water table depth corroborate this point therefore when the system has little change of the amount of upstream inflow its impact on sub irrigation and farmland drainage can be negligible under the above assumptions we use the proposed analytical model to calculate the ditch wetland salinity accumulation process under the six hypothetical scenarios of upstream inflow with different volumes but same salinity 3 87 gl 1 and the results are shown in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 that the ditch wetland will reach the steady state under the current upstream inflow and drainage mode after the first 4 years and the steady state salt concentration c wet is 5 74 gl 1 however the salt concentration of the ditch wetland systems shows a cumulative phenomenon with time regardless of whether the volume of upstream inflow water increases or decreases when the salinity of the upstream inflow is constant 3 87 gl 1 this is because the salinity of the upstream inflow 3 87 gl 1 is higher than the critical salt concentration of dilution 2 7 gl 1 however compared with the current upstream inflow as the volume of upstream inflow water increases the time required for the salt concentration of the wetland system to reach a stable state is shortened and the salt concentration in the stable state decreases the reverse is true when the volume of upstream inflow water decreases when the amount of upstream incoming water decreases by 25 of the current status the salt concentration of the farmland wetland system will reach a stable state that is close to the wetland salt tolerance threshold this shows that the volume of external water in the area cannot be less than 75 of the current level to maintain a long term healthy environment for the wetland system under the current conditions therefore the upstream incoming water plays a positive role in the healthy operation of the farmland wetland system however when the volume of upstream incoming water increases or decreases equally the reduction has a stronger effect on the wetland system notably if the volume of upstream inflow water is excessive it can improve the current status of the ditch wetland system but its role will be limited and the wetland discharge will increase which may adversely affect the environment of the downstream water body 3 4 impact of upstream inflow the effects of the volume and salt concentration of the upstream inflow on the ditch wetland system are often inseparable to provide a clearer understanding for water and salt management of ditch wetland systems we studied the comprehensive effects of different volumes and salt concentrations of the upstream inflow on the stable salt concentrations of the ditch wetland system with the current wetland outflow ratio and the results are shown in fig 8 the upstream inflow volumes are increased or decreased by a certain proportion based on the current inflow as expected at a given salinity the stable salt concentration of the ditch wetland system decreases with increasing inflows whereas at a given inflow volume an increase in salinity increases the stable salt concentration in addition a reduction in salinity can to some extent compensate for a decrease in inflow volume conversely an increase in the inflow volume can partially compensate for an increase in salinity however according to this model salinity appears to be a major determinant of the stable salt concentration based on the slope of the curve by drawing the initial salt concentration of the ditch wetland system c 0 3 95 gl 1 stable state salt concentration of the ditch wetland system under the current conditions c wet 5 74 gl 1 and the wetland salt tolerance threshold c 9 gl 1 we can divide the upstream inflow volume and salt concentration combinations into four different risk areas namely risk free interval low risk interval medium risk interval and high risk interval the upstream inflow in the risk free interval will have a positive effect on the ditch wetland system and promote the desalination of salinized wetland although the upstream inflow in the low risk area causes salt accumulation in the ditch wetland system the rate of salt accumulation is lower than the current rate and the resulting salt concentration is lower than the salt concentration in the stable state of the ditch wetland system compared with the current upstream inflow the upstream water in the medium risk interval will increase the level of salination of the wetland system but the salt in the wetland system would still be within the threshold value of wetland salt and the ecosystem function will not be greatly damaged the upstream water in the high risk interval will destroy the ditch wetland ecosystem through this division of risk intervals we can more clearly understand the effects of the upstream inflow on the ditch wetland system which is helpful for guiding the water and salt management of the ditch wetland system to mitigate the effects of the upstream inflow 3 5 water and salt management of ditch wetland under the influence of upstream inflow ditch wetlands are storage response areas for non point source pollution of upstream irrigation areas colin et al 2004 borin et al 2001 when the retained pollutants exceed the capacity of the ditch wetland systems the ditch wetland ecosystem will lose balance and become a source of pollution for the downstream water bodies defra 2004 therefore it is necessary to formulate corresponding drainage strategies based on the effects on upstream inflow on the water and salt dynamics of ditch wetlands to sustain the ecological function of the wetlands and reduce the adverse effects on downstream water bodies the wetland outflow ratio β can be used to determine measures for wetland water and salt management and its value ranges from 0 to 1 different wetland outflow ratios represent different wetland drainage intensities by adjusting the size of the wetland outflow ratio the water and salt balance relationship in the wetland can be adjusted to achieve the desired wetland water and salt management outcomes the wetland outflow ratio can be regulated by implementing controlled drainage and other engineering measures when β equals 1 the ditch wetland is completely open it is difficult to form a wetland in the ditch and the system has no threat of salinization however this scenario will lead to a large amount of salt output which will adversely affect the water environment of the downstream discharge area thus to sustain the healthy operation of ditch wetlands and reduce downstream environmental pollution it is necessary to understand the minimum discharge under the influence of the upstream influent water to guide the formulation of water and salt management measures therefore we use an analytical model to calculate the space available for adjusting the wetland outflow ratio under the current upstream inflow conditions the steady state salt concentration under the current wetland outflow ratio 0 42 is considerably lower than the salt tolerance threshold fig 9 therefore the system has some room to reduce the current wetland outflow ratio to reduce the adverse effects of drainage on the downstream water bodies as the discharge ratio decreases the time required for the wetland to reach a stable salt state gradually increases and the salt concentration in the steady state c wet gradually increases as well when the wetland outflow ratio is 0 25 c wet is relatively close to the wetland salt tolerance threshold therefore the wetland outflow ratio of 0 25 is the minimum drainage intensity under the current upstream inflow conditions the parameters such as drainage and salt output under different wetland outflow ratios are compared the results are summarized in table 3 the data indicate that when the wetland outflow ratio is reduced from 0 42 to 0 25 the wetland water drainage volume and salt output are reduced by approximately 40 and 10 annually respectively the time required to reach the steady state is approximately 10 years which means that a considerable time window is available for wetland governance therefore the space available for adjustment of the wetland outflow ratio under the current upstream inflow conditions is 0 25 1 00 where a β value between 0 25 and 0 42 can reduce the salt output considering the effects of upstream incoming water on the steady state salinity of the ditch wetland compared with the current upstream incoming water when the salt concentration of the upstream incoming water increases or the when volume of upstream incoming water decreases the stable channel salinity salt concentration will change considerably and gradually approaching the salt tolerance threshold of the wetland or even exceed the salt tolerance threshold at this point the appropriate space of β will become smaller and its minimum value will eventually approach 1 otherwise the appropriate space of β will widen and its minimum value will eventually approach 0 therefore an upstream inflow with no risk and low risk will widen the appropriate space of β while an upstream inflow with medium and high risk will narrow the suitable space of β 4 discussion even though the problems of elemental toxicity and elevated salinities have occurred in some wetlands that receive salinized upstream inflow in most cases the impact of upstream inflow on the water and salt environment of wetlands is not very clear and upstream inflow is rarely incorporated into wetland water and salt management models jia et al 2011 this raises questions about the sustainability and safety of wetlands understanding and quantifying the linkages between water and salt in both upstream inflow and the ditch wetland system and assessing the effects of upstream inflows on wetland water and salt balance lend support to the identification of water salt regulation plans that respect wetland integrity and sustainability therefore we developed an analytical model to study this problem and cover some gaps of the influence of inflow from the upstream irrigation area in the literature bauer et al 2006 jolly et al 2008 jia et al 2011 the model has more general applicability and can be used in other areas outside the study area because it is established based on the basic principles of water salt balance however it needs to be stated that this research is mainly aimed at the salinization of ditches and wetlands in semi arid irrigation areas affected by farmland drainage and upstream water the salinity mainly comes from farmland drainage and upstream water which is greatly affected by agricultural production if wetlands in other areas outside the zone face the same problems or under the premise of clarifying the source of salt and moisture the model can still be applied but for the management of ditch wetlands where the main threat is eutrophication some necessary modifications to the model are required because of the different nature of pollutants another potential advantage of this model is simple data acquisition and low cost the input data of this model mainly includes weather drainage upstream water and salt concentration etc which are easy to obtain taking china as an example most county level government departments have established weather stations the weather data is relatively complete and can be obtained for free through the weather data sharing network for farmland drainage data if the drainage system combined with pipe and open ditch or open ditch drainage system is used the farmland drainage can be measured by monitoring equipment such as flow rate and water measuring weir the upstream inflow can be measured at the upstream inflow of the ditch wetland through a weir and other equipment the salt concentration data can be measured with a conductivity meter and other equipment therefore the input data of the model can be easily obtained by using conventional instruments and methods and the cost is usually lower but for a specific study area the monitoring cost is also related to the traffic conditions area size monitoring frequency and hydrological conditions in the area this often leads to a cost increase even so compared with the use of industrial measures to treat farmland drainage pollution pretty et al 2000 controlled of these pollutants at source and treated the pollutants by ditch wetland is still the least costly effective and durable method kay et al 2009 verhoeven et al 2006 our results show that the volume of incoming upstream water is far greater than that from wetland water sources such as farmland drainage rainfall and surface runoff in this study area and the upstream water is the most critical influential factor for this ditch wetland compared with the original model jia et al 2011 the accuracy of the new model that takes into account the influence of upstream water has been improved and the effects of the upstream inflow cannot be ignored a similar conclusion was made in studies involving the ciénega a non tidal brackish wetland with a discrete inflow and outflow huckelbridge et al 2010 gomezsapiens et al 2013 however in the current literature on ditch wetland research the effects of upstream water on the ditch wetland system are rarely included in wetland water and salt management models and few accurate field data pertaining to upstream inflow with time are available an increase in the salt concentration or a decrease in the volume of the upstream inflow adversely affects the ditch wetland ecology this conclusion is consistent with huckelbridge et al 2010 and gomezsapiens et al 2013 they concluded that the wetland is more sensitive to changes in salinity than to the inflow volume our approach supports this conclusion this is greatly significant for the planning of ditch wetland ecological water requirement in dry irrigation areas which often comes from drainage and upstream irrigation return water compared to water quantity water quality does not attract adequate attention in the planning process huckelbridge et al 2010 found that the salinity concentrations in the wetland generally increase over the first 2 years of the calibration period but then follow a relatively steady cycle over the remainder of the period we arrived at similar results but different from huckelbridge et al 2010 we did not find any stable cycle this is because we adopted a year as the time scale and ignored the influence of seasons the results of huckelbridge et al 2010 also show that when the salt concentration of the wetland follows a relatively steady cycle the range of change in the salt concentration is smaller especially in the larger wetland cells this finding is consistent with our result that it is feasible to ignore the influence of seasons when sufficient seasonal monitoring data are not available in addition we analyzed the comprehensive effects of the quantity and salinity of the water inflows and created risk levels for the effects upstream inflows which will help with the development of suitable water and salt management measures for ditch wetland systems to prevent any adverse effects on the ecosystem function we can adjust the water and salt balance of the ditch wetland system by adjusting the wetland outflow ratio to mitigate the adverse effects of salt output on the downstream water bodies however owing to a lack of observation data about the vegetation evolution and insufficient understanding of the responses among salt and water dynamics and vegetation evolution in ditch wetlands in arid areas we did not study the effects of upstream inflows on the vegetation evolution in ditch wetland systems moreover it would be disadvantageous only the threshold value of salinity as a parameter to characterize the effects of upstream inflows on ditch wetland systems therefore we will study the responses of wetland drainage regulation salt and water dynamics vegetation in the future and propose suitable plans for drainage water management by considering both agricultural production and wetland environmental protection 5 conclusion a ditch wetland system in a dry area not only serves as a field drainage for crop growth but also provides ecosystem services however the water resources in dry areas are very scarce and ecological water requirement is often ignored ditch wetland systems face the threat of salinization when they receive only highly saline agricultural drainage nevertheless agricultural drainage often is not the sole source of water and salt input into wetlands because in some cases various types of inflows such as outside water and salt water from upstream irrigation areas may exist this phenomenon exists in most of the ditch wetlands downstream of irrigation areas in china it is of great significance to fully utilize the upstream inflows to maintain the ecological functions of ditch wetland systems however the effects and risks of upstream inflows on ditch wetland systems are unclear with a case study in this paper we proposed an analytical model to reveal the influence of upstream inflows on the water and salt balance of a ditch wetland system the results showed that an increase in salt concentration or a decrease in the volume of upstream inflow that is not in risk free interval will adversely affect the ditch wetland although the current upstream inflow condition will lead to salt accumulation in the ditch wetland system the salt concentration in the stable state would be considerably lower than the salt tolerance threshold and it is possible to regular the wetland outflow ratio to reduce the wetland salt output while we focused on the influence of only salt concentration on ditch wetlands the vegetation evolution of ditches is equally

al 2018 leading to poor soil structure and lowering the productivity of the land this contributes to a decline of soil fertility which has a critical impact on sustainable development of agriculture and forestry ping et al 2013 shi and shao 2000 zhao et al 2013 apple orchard soil management is an important link in apple production on the loess plateau because it directly affects apple yield and quality but also the sustainable land use of apple orchards jin et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 however clear tillage and chemical fertilization are currently widely used in rainfed apple orchards on the loess plateau and tillage could lead to loess of soil water due to soil evaporation thus resulting in shortage of plant available water furthermore chemical fertilization application leads to a decline of soil quality which results in low saturated hydraulic conductivity and poor soil structure liu et al 2013 su et al 2007 due to the difficulty of setting up irrigation rainwater has become the only water input for apple orchards on the loess plateau however this is inadequate to meet the demand to sustain apple growth in rainfed apple orchards on the loess plateau the greatest amount of rainfall from july to september most of which is heavy rainfall events results in heavy runoff and serious land degradation li et al 2018 thus soil on the loess plateau is of poor quality limiting crop yields land with little resilience to erosion and does not support sustainable land use for agriculture productivity he et al 2019 seeking a technical measure to improve soil structure and increase smc has become an important research direction in soil research rainwater harvesting measures could improve capture of rainfall by allowing it to seep into soil and be utilized by the plant

implemented in rainfed orchards on flat land and are not suitable for orchards located on hill slopes semicircular micro catchments which are called fish scale pits fsp have been shown to effectively

prevent soil compaction erosion and desertification which are problems on the loess plateau celik et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 the proportion of stable macroaggregate in organic amended soils has been found to be higher than that in non amended soils and soils amended with inorganic fertilizers in a silty clay to clay rice wheat crop system mitran et al 2018 organic amendment applied alone or in

paradelo et al 2019 somerville et al 2019 droughts poor soil structure low soil fertility and a lack of synchronization between plant water demand and rainfall results in low rainfall use efficiency in hill rainfed apple orchard hence it is clear that an investigation of the combination of biomaterial amendment application and rainwater harvesting measures will improve soil structure alleviate drought and increase available water in rainfed apple orchards on the loess plateau needs is justified in recent years numerous rainwater harvesting techniques were introduced into rainfed apple orchard on the loess plateau song et al 2017 applied rainwater collection and infiltration system which buried branches and leaves as an extra organic matter addition in rcp in rainfed apple orchard and it was found that the system increased soil smc in 20 140 cm soil depth and promoted fine roots growth which was directly related to wetted soil guo et al 2021 found that rainwater collection infiltration promoting and soil anti seepage system increased soil moisture content by over 24 0 in 0 60 cm soil depth and fine root system by over 11 7 within 0 200 cm soil depth compared with ck treatment in a hilly apple orchard on the loess plateau tadros et al 2021 reported that the combined water harvesting techniques straw mulching and the 36 m2 micro catchment improved soil moisture content plant morphology plant height and leaf number per tree and physiology of pistachio trees rainwater collection technology significantly increased rainwater infiltration resulting in the rainwater and nutrients to leave the root zone and infiltrate into deeper soil layers during rainy season suo et al 2019 the combination of organic amendment and rainwater harvesting technology could have both potential positive environmental and productive effects due to their benefits of water infiltration and fine root growth in field ecosystem however the research to date had tended to focus on single measure for rainwater harvesting and fertilization rather than both together though a few studies have investigated the effect of the combination of organic matter and rainwater harvesting measure on soil moisture and fine roots of apple orchard on the loess plateau song et al 2017 2018 nonetheless the organic matter in these studies were weeds and branches which was too simple hence the importance and originality of this study were that it combines the organic and inorganic fertilization with rainwater harvesting technique to explore the effect of an integrated management system of orchard on soil water structure and fine roots distribution we hypothesized that the combination management to apple orchard would alter the soil moisture soil structure and fine root distribution also the wue and yield therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the dynamic changes in soil moisture and soil water storage among 300 cm soil profiles 2 examine the soil bulk density soil saturated conductivity and soil aggregates 3 evaluate apple roots and 4 illustrate the relationships between soil water storage and fine roots this study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the optimal soil management for orchard in the loess plateau and other rain fed area around the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site was

the typical range of daily air temperature was from 1 to 29 c during the apple growing season in 2016 2017 and 2018 2 2 barh measure design the barh measure consisted of a semicircle ridge called fish scale pit fsp which had a radius of 150 cm and height of 15 cm and the rainwater collection pit rcp was located upslope of an apple tree fig 3 a square rcp 80 cm 80 cm 40 cm depth was dug under the crown of the tree about 150 cm upslope of the tree trunk a plastic film was placed only at the bottom of the pit to prevent deep leakage and a pvc tube 40 cm length 15 cm diameter was placed vertically at the center of each pit on top of the liner to serve as an additional rainfall collection reservoir there were 8 rows of evenly distributed holes 1 cm diameter on the pvc tube and the holes are evenly distributed on each row in 5 cm increments the pvc tube was placed on top of the liner such that the top of the tube was flush with the rcp surface the tube was secured by filling the space around the tube with a mixture of soil and plant residues straw weeds and branches finally the top of the rcp was covered with a plastic film which funneled any collected rainwater into the pvc tube a mixture of biomaterial amendment and 0 40 cm soil was used to line in the fsp the biomaterial amendment was primarily from industrial and agricultural waste resources and included oil residues a mixture of crushed straw weeds and branches and solid cattle manure the three components were combined based on dry mass in a 4 1 1 ratio thoroughly mixed cured fermented materials were amended by adding a water retention agent of polyacrylamide pam at a rate of 37 5 kg ha 1 after thoroughly mixing the biomaterial was used to mix thoroughly with the 0 40 cm soil in the fsp within the barh

spacing within and between rows respectively on a uniform slope of 15 degrees three treatments were established 1 the barh treatment which used a shallow semicircle fsp and rcp for collecting hill slope runoff and 7 mg ha 1 biomaterial which mixed with chemical fertilizer 33 2 of total n and 48 6 of total p in the barh treatment and the 0 40 cm soil evenly was lined in the fsp 2 the rh treatment which used a fsp filled with a mixture of the local soil chemical fertilizer and the rcp only no biomaterial amendment and 3 the ck treatment which was the local traditional treatment using chemical fertilizer mixed with 0 40 cm soil upslope of an apple tree without any rainwater collection and storage enhancement practices within the selected 1 ha area treatments were assigned to trees using a completely randomized design crd with three replications and fertilized in april 2016 2017 and 2018 fertilizer applied to apple trees included 800 kg n ha 1 urea 46 n and 350 kg p ha 1 diammonium phosphate 18 n 46 p we ensured that equal nitrogen and phosphorus contents were applied in each treatment other agrochemicals in each treatment pesticides herbicides and fungicides were applied as need 2 4 measurements the volumetric soil moisture content was measured using a soil moisture profile measurement system trime pico iph tdr germany during the apple growing season hu et al 2019 the tdr tube was installed at a distance of 60 cm from the apple tree trunk fig 3 the tdr tube was 300 cm length and volumetric soil moisture content was measured at 20 cm intervals and about every 10 day for a month a pit was dug upslope of an apple tree and randomly located 20 cm away from the rcp in the fsp in october 2016 2017 and 2018 and undisturbed soil samples were collected with a 5 cm diameter by 5 cm high cutting ring at three random positions at soil depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm each undisturbed soil sample was oven dried at 105 c until constant weight and used for measuring soil bulk density soil saturated conductivity was measured using the constant head method herath et al 2013 mi et al 2017 soil organic c was determined by wet oxidation with k2cr2o7 and h2so4 fang et al 2021 soil total n was determined by kjeldahl analysis bremner and breitenbeck 1983 and total p and k were determined using uv vis spectrophotometer and flame photometer respectively jackson 1973 in october 2018 the fine root samples were collected using a 9 cm diameter steel root auger at 50 cm from the apple tree trunk and 50 cm from the fsp li et al 2017 soil samples were collected at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 300 cm the soil samples then were sieved over 16 mesh screens and all the roots were picked out a vernier caliper was used to size and remove the coarse roots with diameters larger than 2 mm the fine roots were scanned with a scanner to obtain the root image 300 dpi and the root image was analyzed using delta t scan image analysis software delta t scan delta t devices company uk to obtain the root length li et al 2017 after each data collection the fine roots were then dried at 80 c after dried the fine roots were weighed using an electronic balance the remaining 0 100 cm soil samples were air dried crushed to pass through a 2 mm sieve and then stored in plastic jars for determine soil microaggregate soil aggregates were determined according to the international soil classification standard using a model apa2000 laser particle size analyzer malvern instruments ltd the soil with particle size 0 002 0 002 0 02 and 0 02

spss inc chicago il usa all statistics are reported as means of three replicates 3 results 3 1 soil moisture content all treatments and soil layers had a significant effect p 0 001 on volumetric smc during the apple growing season in 2016 2017 and 2018 table 2 the interaction between treatments and soil layers had a significant effect p 0 05 on the smc during the apple growing seasons in 2016 july in 2017 and august and september in 2018 compared with the ck treatment the barh and rh treatments improved smc in all years fig 4 the mean smc of the three years within 0 300 cm soil depth under the barh treatment increased by 18 83 and 31 08 compared to the rh and ck treatments respectively under the barh smc within 0 160 cm soil depth by 15 52 and 33 98 in comparison to that of rh and ck treatments respectively the smc under different treatments within 0 300 cm soil layers displayed an increasing trend with time in 2016 2017 and 2018 fig 5 3 2 soil water storage the barh treatment had a significant effect p 0 05 on soil water storage within the 0 300 cm soil layer which had the greatest soil water storage in all years fig 6 it was obvious that soil water storage within 0 100 cm soil layer was higher in comparison to 100 300 cm under each treatment and the variation of soil water storage within soil layer in barh treatment was the deepest over three years the mean soil water storage were 423 7 mm 356 8 mm and 321 6 mm within 0 300 cm soil layer under barh rh and ck treatment over three years respectively compared with ck treatment the barh and rh treatment improved the mean soil water storage within 0 300 cm soil layers during the apple growing season by 48 8 and 30 1 in 2016 respectively 29 9 and 2 2 in 2017 respectively and 21 7 and 6 1 in 2018 respectively soil water collected by fsp infiltrated into the soil up to 100 cm soil and in some cases deeper than 100 cm fig 6g in the autumn when heavy rainfall occurred and there was reduced water consumption by the apple trees soil water storage was improved significantly by the barh and rh treatments and they increased soil water storage in early spring the following year in apple orchard and alleviated droughts of rainfed apple orchard on the loess plateau 3 3 soil bulk density the variation of soil bulk density under the barh treatment was similar over the three years tables 3 and 4 the effects of different treatments on soil bulk density were significant p 0 05 at 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil layers but not at the 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil layers the barh treatment reduced bulk density in comparison to the other treatments over the three years 3 4 saturated conductivity the barh treatment had a significant effect p 0 05 on ksat compared with ck treatment resulting in the largest ksat within the same soil layer and ksat was the largest in barh treatment within all the soil layer for all years which was 33 1 and 42 5 higher in comparison with rh and ck treatments within 0 100 cm soil layer over three years respectively 3 5 soil aggregates over the three years compared with the rh and ck treatment the proportion of aggregates 0 02 2 mm in the barh treatment increased significantly p 0 05 by 4 4 and 4 9 respectively and proportion of the aggregates less than 0 002 decreased significantly p 0 05 by 8 3 and 12 7 respectively fig 7 3 6 apple roots the sum of rwd under the barh rh and ck treatments within 0 300 cm soil layers in 2018 were 869 93 g m 3 701 44 g m 3 and 652 36 g m 3 respectively fig 8a 70 of the fine roots were found in the 0 160 cm soil depth under barh rh and ck treatments fine roots accounted for 75 59 75 31 and 72 67 of the total roots respectively which equated to 657 59 g m 3 528 27 g m 3 and 474 07 g m 3 respectively compared with the ck treatment the barh and rh treatments enhanced rwd by 33 35 and 7 52 within the 0 300 cm soil layer respectively the sum of rld under the barh rh and ck treatments within 0 300 cm soil layer in 2018 were 7986 51 6552 98 and 5244 45 mm 3 respectively compared with ck treatment the barh and rh treatments enhanced rld by 52 16 and 21 34 within the 0 300 cm soil layer respectively 3 7 correlation between soil water storage and apple roots correlation between mean soil water storage during the apple growing season and rwd and rld within 0 300 cm in 2018 was investigated to test the relationship between the root growth and soil water storage under different treatments fig 9 soil water storage had a significant positive correlation with rwd and rld with correlation coefficients of 0 82 and 0 88 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 choice of soil biomaterial amendment in recent years biochar solid manure and bio organic fertilizer are commonly used as biomaterial amendment du et al 2020 hafez et al 2021 nguyen et al 2021 and at present biochar is widely used in the world which could improve soil hydraulic properties soil structure and increase crop yield hussain et al 2021 however it costs too much that farmers could not accept it the biomaterial amendment in this study included castor pomace a mixture of crushed straw weeds and branches and solid cattle manure which were combined on dry mass in a 4 1 1 ratio due to its rich in organic matter and a variety of mineral elements oil residue can improve the soil structure and nutrients enhance water holding capacity innangi et al 2017 so it is used to the main material of biomaterial amendment previous studies reported that pomace as an organic amendment could enhance soil properties due to its high content of organic matter and exchangeable cations innangi et al 2017 muscolo et al 2019 rojas valencia et al 2011 this is the reason why we chose pomace as the main material of biomaterial amendment many studies have shown that crushing straw can improve the soil physical and chemical properties enhance water holding capacity and increase soil nutrients fang et al 2021 hu et al 2020 li et al 2020 maneepitak et al 2019 hence we select local corn straw as one of the materials of biomaterial amendment weeds and branches were also good soil amendment material to improvement soil structure and nutrients attribute to its easy access and it is a model of rational use of materials guo et al 2021 song et al 2017 2020b solid cattle manure such as cow dung a common local manure is rich in organic and mineral elements that improve the soil nutrients many studies showed that application of manure significantly increased crop yields soil organic c and nutrients gai et al 2018 wang et al 2021 due to its highly water absorption rate polyacrylamide can repeatedly absorb water and slowly release water absorption to keep moist for a long time tadayonnejad et al 2017 these materials were fully mixed with soil and buried in fsp and rcp the results showed that barh treatment could increase soil moisture and promote root growth which was a good management measure in rainfed apple orchard on the loess plateau 4 2 soil moisture and water storage in our study it was obvious that barh treatment increased smc significantly than ck treatment fig 4 this might because that soil amendments could be used to increase water retention capacity due to its mineralogical structure which allows it to absorb water quickly and release water slowly as a tiny reservoir under drought conditions this result was comparable to the findings by mi et al 2017 who found that soil biomaterial amendments could be used as a tiny reservoir to continuously provide water for crop growth since the biomaterial amendment was incorporated down to 40 cm the barh treatment reached the greatest smc at 40 cm soil depth over three years within the 0 300 cm soil layer rainwater seeped into soil and wetted soil biomaterial which buried in 0 40 cm that could keep higher moisture content for a long period thus increased smc due to gathering rainwater to seep into soil rainfall harvest rh system is an effective measure thus could improve water retention in soil improve rainfall use efficiency improve crop yields and reduce soil evaporation in the rainfed regions on the loess plateau wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and barh treatment was better than rh in keeping higher soil moisture figs 4 and 5 real limits on crop yield must be determined before any soil amendments or restoration measures can be undertaken celestina et al 2019 in the past several years the land area occupied by apple orchards has increased over one million ha on the loess plateau song et al 2020a due to the high moisture requirements soil water may decline sharply in a rainfed orchard significantly affecting apple production therefore soil moisture is an important factor for sustainable development of orchard on china s loess plateau song et al 2017 our result found that barh treatment could significantly increase smc within the 0 300 cm soil depth especially within 0 100 cm the barh treatment had a significant effect on smc at 20 60 cm and 160 220 cm soil depths over three years fig 4 this might be the effect of the fsp and rcp plus film mulching which could have significantly decreased water exchange between the soil and air this would have reduced soil evaporation and soil biomaterial which was regarded as a reservoir was buried at 0 40 soil depth so as to keep moist for a long time when wetted by rainwater thus to increase soil moisture we also found that smc under rh treatment declined over after the first year this might attribute to that it was dry in 2016 wet in 2017 and normal in 2018 and application of rh treatment in dry year 2016 could significant increased smc by collecting limited rainwater in soil and after the first year water shortage was not critical rainwater was more in 2017 and 2018 there was more available water for apple tree use the smc in the whole apple orchard in 2017 and 2018 was higher than that in 2016 tubeileh et al 2016 reported that water harvesting measures could increase water availability for trees grum et al 2017 shown that tied ridges plus straw mulch effectively reduced runoff and increased smc li et al 2018 found that a fish scale pit could improve soil moisture during the rainy season these findings are in agreement with our results 4 3 soil bulk density saturated conductivity and soil aggregates in our study compared with ck treatment there was significant difference in soil bulk density and soil saturated conductivity under barh treatment but not rh treatment tables 3 and 4 this demonstrated the effects on soil physical properties in dryland agriculture ecosystem only depend on organic amendment materials and are not related to fsp application of the barh measure the combination of soil biomaterial amendment and fish scale pit in rainfed apple orchard on loess plateau altered soil physical properties within the root zone such as soil bulk density soil saturated conductivity and soil aggregates previous field experiments suggest that the application of organic amendment to soil could improve soil structure by altering soil bulk density soil saturated conductivity soil aggregate and soil quality he et al 2019 khaliq and kaleem abbasi 2015 mitran et al 2018 shen et al 2018 however most studies highlighting the improvements associated with organic amendments were conducted in wheat and maize rotations and different types of organic amendments have different effects on soil physical properties in different soil few experiments have been conducted on rainfed apple orchards on the loess plateau in the present study barh system significantly changed soil structure and increased the proportion of size sand particle aggregates 0 02 2 mm the total aggregate porosity will increase with increasing soil size according to the findings of dexter 1988 who reported that the larger the proportion of soil aggregates the greater the total porosity of soil these variation in soil structure might have resulted in a reduction of soil bulk density previous studies indicated that the application of organic amendment in soil promoted the formation of large sized aggregates this resulted in the larger proportion of soil macroaggregates thus increased soil porosity then reduced soil bulk density this is similar with our results that the barh treatment had a significant effect on soil bulk density at 0 60 cm soil depths in all three years this might because soil biomaterial had a fluffy texture and a high porosity and when incorporated into the 0 40 cm soil depth the amendment led to greater soil aggregates then increased soil porosity and therefore reduce soil bulk density this was consistent with sun and han 2018 who reported that soil amendments reduced soilbulk density in a sandy soil our results also found that the barh treatment could significantly increase soil saturated conductivity in the 0 40 cm soil layer with largest effect at 20 40 cm soil depth in all three years table 4 the correlation between soil porosity and soil saturated water conductivity is obvious this might be attributed to enhanced of soil porosity han et al 2010 4 4 apple roots rwd and rld decreased with the increasing soil depth fig 8 which are consistent with the findings by wang et al 2020 and song et al 2017 who reported that the fine root biomass and root length density decreased with increased soil depth this might be because root system grew towards soil layers with higher moisture and nutrient content and more root systems will be concentrated in soil layers with high smc guo et al 2021 also the soil physical chemical and microbial characteristics were unsuitable in deep soil layers for root growth polverigiani et al 2018 distribution characteristics of roots especially the fine roots and their resistance to drought are the primary determinants of forest productivity in semi arid areas therefore it is of great significance to study the distribution of apple tree roots previous studies showed that fruit tree fine roots were mainly concentrated in 0 200 cm ma et al 2013 forey et al 2017 in our study over 70 of fine roots were concentrated in 0 160 cm soil layer this is consisting with the results by song et al 2018 who found that 60 of apple tree fine roots were mainly distributed in the 0 200 cm soil layer 4 5 correlation between apple roots and soil water in this study soil water storage had significant positive correlations with rwd and rld and the correlation coefficients were 0 82 and 0 88 respectively which was consistent with wang et al 2020 who reported that root biomass decreased with increasing soil depth as a result of a decline in smc with increasing soil depth this demonstrates that the more water there is in the soil the more apple roots there are the barh treatment significantly changed the soil water conditions and therefore influenced apple root growth root water uptake strategy could also affect soil water redistribution previous studies suggested that root growth is highly related to soil water conditions and apple roots were affected by soil water storage and other management methods in apple orchards song et al 2018 li et al 2019 song et al 2017 reported that apple roots were mainly concentrated in the soil layers with higher smc which could affect root water uptake strategies and the roots distribution in different soil layers assuming that the distribution of fine roots under the barh treatment was the same as the ck treatment there should be a higher smc under the barh treatment it can be seen that the root distribution has a positive correlation with soil water storage within the root zone the plant available moisture within the root zone provides conditions favorable to apple tree root growth and soil moisture accumulation that is essential for the successful growth of the apple trees within this region 5 conclusion soil biomaterial amendment combined with rainwater harvesting measures had significant effects on smc water storage soil bulk density soil saturated conductivity particle size distribution of microaggregate apple roots and yield the barh treatment had the greatest smc and soil water storage within 0 300 cm soil depth over three years the proportion of sand size soil microaggregates under the barh treatment was the highest over three years likewise the barh treatment increased soil saturated conductivity within the 0 40 cm soil depth and reduced soil bulk density within 0 60 cm soil depth compared to the ck treatment the barh treatment increased rwd and rld within 0 300 cm soil depth by 33 35 and 52 16 respectively over three years soil water storage showed positive correlations with rwd and rld within the 0 300 cm soil depth our research indicates that the barh measure in rainfed apple orchards on the loess plateau is an effective measure to improve soil hydraulic parameters and apple roots further research on long term effect of the barh measure on soil physical chemical and biological properties is required to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms of the barh treatment on increasing apple yields in rainfed apple orchards on the loess

amendment and rainwater harvesting barh and evaluated the effect of barh on soil moisture content smc soil water storage sws soil saturated hydraulic conductivity soil structure and apple roots in a field experiment in rainfed apple orchard on the loess plateau from 2016 to 2018 three treatments 1 the barh treatment combination of biomaterial amendment and rainwater harvesting 2 the rh treatment rainwater harvesting measure only and 3 the control ck treatment which is the local traditional practice compared with the ck treatment the barh and rh treatment significantly p 0 05 improved smc by 31 08 and 18 83 respectively and sws by 102 19 mm and 35 30 mm respectively within 0 300 cm during the apple growing season from april to october over three years there were notable and significant increases in smc in the 0 160 cm soil layer swc in the autumn improved due to heavy rainfall and lower water consumption by the apple trees this alleviated the critical water requirements of early spring apple trees for the following year and therefore less rainfall was required the barh treatment had a soil bulk density bd that was 3 52 lower p 0 05 within 0 60 cm soil depth 83 93 higher saturated soil conductivity ksat and 4 9 higher sand size soil macroaggregates 0 02 2 mm within 0 40 cm soil depth compared to the ck treatment over three years 70 of the root systems were concentrated in the 0 160 cm soil layer in all treatments which was highly correlated with smc root dry weight density rwd under barh and rh treatments increased by 33 35 and 7 52 within 0 300 cm of the soil in comparison to the ck treatment respectively likewise the root length density rld under barh and rh treatments increased by 52 16 and 21 34 within the 0 300 cm soil layer compared to the ck treatment respectively therefore the combination of biomaterial amendment and rainwater harvesting is an effective cultivation measure for sustainable development of rainfed apple orchards on the loess plateau keywords soil biomaterial amendment rainwater harvesting soil water soil physical properties apple roots 1 introduction erosion is a serious concern on the loess plateau of china chen et al 2018 leading to poor soil structure and lowering the productivity of the land this contributes to a decline of soil fertility which has a critical impact on sustainable development of agriculture and forestry ping et al 2013 shi and shao 2000 zhao et al 2013 apple orchard soil management is an important link in apple production on the loess plateau because it directly affects apple yield and quality but also the sustainable land use of apple orchards jin et al 2007 zhang et al 2007 however clear tillage and chemical fertilization are currently widely used in rainfed apple orchards on the loess plateau and tillage could lead to loess of soil water due to soil evaporation thus resulting in shortage of plant available water furthermore chemical fertilization application leads to a decline of soil quality which results in low saturated hydraulic conductivity and poor soil structure liu et al 2013 su et al 2007 due to the difficulty of setting up irrigation rainwater has become the only water input for apple orchards on the loess plateau however this is inadequate to meet the demand to sustain apple growth in rainfed apple orchards on the loess plateau the greatest amount of rainfall from july to september most of which is heavy rainfall events results in heavy runoff and serious land degradation li et al 2018 thus soil on the loess plateau is of poor quality limiting crop yields land with little resilience to erosion and does not support sustainable land use for agriculture productivity he et al 2019 seeking a technical measure to improve soil structure and increase smc has become an important research direction in soil research rainwater harvesting measures could improve capture of rainfall by allowing it to seep into soil and be utilized by the plant numerous rainwater harvesting measures have been shown to effectively save rainwater ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting rfrh system collect runoff under plastic mulched ridges has been shown to be a useful method to improve crop productivity in northwest china wu et al 2015 water storage pits wsp are a widely used rainwater harvesting measure for improving soil moisture within the root zone promoting root growth and increasing rainwater use efficiency and yields in rainfed apple orchards on the loess plateau song et al 2017 meng et al 2019 however these measures have previously been implemented in rainfed orchards on flat land and are not suitable for orchards located on hill slopes semicircular micro catchments which are called fish scale pits fsp have been shown to effectively relieve drought in gently a sloping rainfed orchard by intercepting run off and increase soil water content li et al 2018 semicircular bunds scb which are widespread in the semi arid zones of africa e g half moons or demi lunes have been shown to significantly increase soil moisture in burkina faso africa vohland and barry 2009 locating a fsp or scb on a slope has been shown to significantly increase soil moisture content by altering the micro topography thus reducing runoff and enhancing the local impoundment and infiltration of rainfall ge et al 2014 especially when faced with heavy storms of a short duration sun et al 2018 guo et al 2019a to improve the quality of the soil adding organic materials to the soil can significantly improve soil structure and affect the soil hydraulic characteristic thereby storing more plant available water for crop production in arid and semiarid regions guo et al 2019b previous studies have indicated that application of organic amendments in soil significantly decreased soil bulk density laird et al 2010 improved soil physical chemical and biological properties and reduced soil water stress xu et al 2015 organic amendments may also prevent soil compaction erosion and desertification which are problems on the loess plateau celik et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 the proportion of stable macroaggregate in organic amended soils has been found to be higher than that in non amended soils and soils amended with inorganic fertilizers in a silty clay to clay rice wheat crop system mitran et al 2018 organic amendment applied alone or in combination with chemical fertilizers could lower soil bulk density and increase soil saturated conductivity and aggregate stability in wheat soybean rotation khaliq and kaleem abbasi 2015 soil biomaterial is a valuable soil amendment and is recognized to have positive effects on soil physical and hydraulic properties githinji 2014 it may effectively regulate the conditions of soil water heat and gas and reduce evaporation from the soil surface li et al 2018 improve soil structure celik et al 2010 franzluebbers 2002 and improve soil conditions such as bulk density soil structure water retention and nutrient contents dhaliwal et al 2019 haynes and naidu 1998 however the effects of organic amendments on soil structure and soil moisture differ by soil type moragues saitua et al 2017 paradelo et al 2019 somerville et al 2019 droughts poor soil structure low soil fertility and a lack of synchronization between plant water demand and rainfall results in low rainfall use efficiency in hill rainfed apple orchard hence it is clear that an investigation of the combination of biomaterial amendment application and rainwater harvesting measures will improve soil structure alleviate drought and increase available water in rainfed apple orchards on the loess plateau needs is justified in recent years numerous rainwater harvesting techniques were introduced into rainfed apple orchard on the loess plateau song et al 2017 applied rainwater collection and infiltration system which buried branches and leaves as an extra organic matter addition in rcp in rainfed apple orchard and it was found that the system increased soil smc in 20 140 cm soil depth and promoted fine roots growth which was directly related to wetted soil guo et al 2021 found that rainwater collection infiltration promoting and soil anti seepage system increased soil moisture content by over 24 0 in 0 60 cm soil depth and fine root system by over 11 7 within 0 200 cm soil depth compared with ck treatment in a hilly apple orchard on the loess plateau tadros et al 2021 reported that the combined water harvesting techniques straw mulching and the 36 m2 micro catchment improved soil moisture content plant morphology plant height and leaf number per tree and physiology of pistachio trees rainwater collection technology significantly increased rainwater infiltration resulting in the rainwater and nutrients to leave the root zone and infiltrate into deeper soil layers during rainy season suo et al 2019 the combination of organic amendment and rainwater harvesting technology could have both potential positive environmental and productive effects due to their benefits of water infiltration and fine root growth in field ecosystem however the research to date had tended to focus on single measure for rainwater harvesting and fertilization rather than both together though a few studies have investigated the effect of the combination of organic matter and rainwater harvesting measure on soil moisture and fine roots of apple orchard on the loess plateau song et al 2017 2018 nonetheless the organic matter in these studies were weeds and branches which was too simple hence the importance and originality of this study were that it combines the organic and inorganic fertilization with rainwater harvesting technique to explore the effect of an integrated management system of orchard on soil water structure and fine roots distribution we hypothesized that the combination management to apple orchard would alter the soil moisture soil structure and fine root distribution also the wue and yield therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the dynamic changes in soil moisture and soil water storage among 300 cm soil profiles 2 examine the soil bulk density soil saturated conductivity and soil aggregates 3 evaluate apple roots and 4 illustrate the relationships between soil water storage and fine roots this study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring the optimal soil management for orchard in the loess plateau and other rain fed area around the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site was located in yan an city shaanxi province china 36 11 37 09n 109 21 110 03e fig 1 and has an arid to semiarid climate the mean annual precipitation is approximately 400 600 mm and 60 70 of that falls from july to september in the form of high intensity short duration rain storms the mean annual temperature is 9 4 c with an annual frost free season that typically lasts 170 186 days the baseline soil physical characteristics are presented in table 1 daily precipitation and air temperature in study area from march to october in 2016 2017 and 2018 are shown in fig 2 total precipitation was 425 mm 531 mm and 448 mm during the apple growing season from march to october in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively 2016 and 2017 were both dry in march and april there were 94 mm 80 mm and 82 mm more rain than average of many years from 2001 to 2015 in july august and october 2017 respectively which was good for apple growth there was no heavy precipitation in the apple growing season in 2016 and 2018 the typical range of daily air temperature was from 1 to 29 c during the apple growing season in 2016 2017 and 2018 2 2 barh measure design the barh measure consisted of a semicircle ridge called fish scale pit fsp which had a radius of 150 cm and height of 15 cm and the rainwater collection pit rcp was located upslope of an apple tree fig 3 a square rcp 80 cm 80 cm 40 cm depth was dug under the crown of the tree about 150 cm upslope of the tree trunk a plastic film was placed only at the bottom of the pit to prevent deep leakage and a pvc tube 40 cm length 15 cm diameter was placed vertically at the center of each pit on top of the liner to serve as an additional rainfall collection reservoir there were 8 rows of evenly distributed holes 1 cm diameter on the pvc tube and the holes are evenly distributed on each row in 5 cm increments the pvc tube was placed on top of the liner such that the top of the tube was flush with the rcp surface the tube was secured by filling the space around the tube with a mixture of soil and plant residues straw weeds and branches finally the top of the rcp was covered with a plastic film which funneled any collected rainwater into the pvc tube a mixture of biomaterial amendment and 0 40 cm soil was used to line in the fsp the biomaterial amendment was primarily from industrial and agricultural waste resources and included oil residues a mixture of crushed straw weeds and branches and solid cattle manure the three components were combined based on dry mass in a 4 1 1 ratio thoroughly mixed cured fermented materials were amended by adding a water retention agent of polyacrylamide pam at a rate of 37 5 kg ha 1 after thoroughly mixing the biomaterial was used to mix thoroughly with the 0 40 cm soil in the fsp within the barh

treatment which used a fsp filled with a mixture of the local soil chemical fertilizer and the rcp only no biomaterial amendment and 3 the ck treatment which was the local traditional treatment using chemical fertilizer mixed with 0 40 cm soil upslope of an apple tree without any rainwater collection and storage enhancement practices within the selected 1 ha area treatments were assigned to trees using a completely randomized design crd with three replications and fertilized in april 2016 2017 and 2018 fertilizer applied to apple trees included 800 kg n ha 1 urea 46 n and 350 kg p ha 1 diammonium phosphate 18 n 46 p we ensured that equal nitrogen and phosphorus contents were applied in each treatment other agrochemicals in each treatment pesticides herbicides and fungicides were applied as need 2 4 measurements the volumetric soil moisture content was measured using a soil moisture profile measurement system trime pico iph tdr germany during the apple growing season hu et al 2019 the tdr tube was installed at a distance of 60 cm from the apple tree trunk fig 3 the tdr tube was 300 cm length and volumetric soil moisture content was measured at 20 cm intervals and about every 10 day for a month a pit was dug upslope of an apple tree and randomly located 20 cm away from the rcp in the fsp in october 2016 2017 and 2018 and undisturbed soil samples were collected with a 5 cm diameter by 5 cm high cutting ring at three random positions at soil depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm each undisturbed soil sample was oven dried at 105 c until constant weight and used for measuring soil bulk density soil saturated conductivity was measured using the constant head method herath et al 2013 mi et al 2017 soil organic c was determined by wet oxidation with k2cr2o7 and h2so4 fang et al 2021 soil total n was determined by kjeldahl analysis bremner and breitenbeck 1983 and total p and k were determined using uv vis spectrophotometer and flame photometer respectively jackson 1973 in october 2018 the fine root samples were collected using a 9 cm diameter steel root auger at 50 cm from the apple tree trunk and 50 cm from the fsp li et al 2017 soil samples were collected at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 300 cm the soil samples then were sieved over 16 mesh screens and all the roots were picked out a vernier caliper was used to size and remove the coarse roots with diameters larger than 2 mm the fine roots were scanned with a scanner to obtain the root image 300 dpi and the root image was analyzed using delta t scan image analysis software delta t scan delta t devices company uk to obtain the root length li et al 2017 after each data collection the fine roots were then dried at 80 c after dried the fine roots were weighed using an electronic balance the remaining 0 100 cm soil samples were air dried crushed to pass through a 2 mm sieve and then stored in plastic jars for determine soil microaggregate soil aggregates were determined according to the international soil classification standard using a model apa2000 laser particle size analyzer malvern instruments ltd the soil with particle size 0 002 0 002 0 02 and 0 02

spss inc chicago il usa all statistics are reported as means of three replicates 3 results 3 1 soil moisture content all treatments and soil layers had a significant effect p 0 001 on volumetric smc during the apple growing season in 2016 2017 and 2018 table 2 the interaction between treatments and soil layers had a significant effect p 0 05 on the smc during the apple growing seasons in 2016 july in 2017 and august and september in 2018 compared with the ck treatment the barh and rh treatments improved smc in all years fig 4 the mean smc of the three years within 0 300 cm soil depth under the barh treatment increased by 18 83 and 31 08 compared to the rh and ck treatments respectively under the barh smc within 0 160 cm soil depth by 15 52 and 33 98 in comparison to that of rh and ck treatments respectively the smc under different treatments within 0 300 cm soil layers displayed an increasing trend with time in 2016 2017 and 2018 fig 5 3 2 soil water storage the barh treatment had a significant effect p 0 05 on soil water storage within the 0 300 cm soil layer which had the greatest soil water storage in all years fig 6 it was obvious that soil water storage within 0 100 cm soil layer was higher in comparison to 100 300 cm under each treatment and the variation of soil water storage within soil layer in barh treatment was the deepest over three years the mean soil water storage were 423 7 mm 356 8 mm and 321 6 mm within 0 300 cm soil layer under barh rh and ck treatment over three years respectively compared with ck treatment the barh and rh treatment improved the mean soil water storage within 0 300 cm soil layers during the apple growing season by 48 8 and 30 1 in 2016 respectively 29 9 and 2 2 in 2017 respectively and 21 7 and 6 1 in 2018 respectively soil water collected by fsp infiltrated into the soil up to 100 cm soil and in some cases deeper than 100 cm fig 6g in the autumn when heavy rainfall occurred and there was reduced water consumption by the apple trees soil water storage was improved significantly by the barh and rh treatments and they increased soil water storage in early spring the following year in apple orchard and alleviated droughts of rainfed apple orchard on the loess plateau 3 3 soil bulk density the variation of soil bulk density under the barh treatment was similar over the three years tables 3 and 4 the effects of different treatments on soil bulk density were significant p 0 05 at 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil layers but not at the 60 80 and 80 100 cm soil layers the barh treatment reduced bulk density in comparison to the other treatments over the three years 3 4 saturated conductivity the barh treatment had a significant effect p 0 05 on ksat compared with ck treatment resulting in the largest ksat within the same soil layer and ksat was the largest in barh treatment within all the soil layer for all years which was 33 1 and 42 5 higher in comparison with rh and ck treatments within 0 100 cm soil layer over three years respectively 3 5 soil aggregates over the three years compared with the rh and ck treatment the proportion of aggregates 0 02 2 mm in the barh treatment increased significantly p 0 05 by 4 4 and 4 9 respectively and proportion of the aggregates less than 0 002 decreased significantly p 0 05 by 8 3 and 12 7 respectively fig 7 3 6 apple roots the sum of rwd under the barh rh and ck treatments within 0 300 cm soil layers in 2018 were 869 93 g m 3 701 44 g m 3 and 652 36 g m 3 respectively fig 8a 70 of the fine roots were found in the 0 160 cm soil depth under barh rh and ck treatments fine roots accounted for 75 59 75 31 and 72 67 of the total roots respectively which equated to 657 59 g m 3 528 27 g m 3 and 474 07 g m 3 respectively compared with the ck treatment the barh and rh treatments enhanced rwd by 33 35 and 7 52 within the 0 300 cm soil layer respectively the sum of rld under the barh rh and ck treatments within 0 300 cm soil layer in 2018 were 7986 51 6552 98 and 5244 45 mm 3 respectively compared with ck treatment the barh and rh treatments enhanced rld by 52 16 and 21 34 within the 0 300 cm soil layer respectively 3 7 correlation between soil water storage and apple roots correlation between mean soil water storage during the apple growing season and rwd and rld within 0 300 cm in 2018 was investigated to test the relationship between the root growth and soil water storage under different treatments fig 9 soil water storage had a significant positive correlation with rwd and rld with correlation coefficients of 0 82 and 0 88 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 choice of soil biomaterial amendment in recent years biochar solid manure and bio organic fertilizer are commonly used as biomaterial amendment du et al 2020 hafez et al 2021 nguyen et al 2021 and at present biochar is widely used in the world which could improve soil hydraulic properties soil structure and increase crop yield hussain et al 2021 however it costs too much that farmers could not accept it the biomaterial amendment in this study included castor pomace a mixture of crushed straw weeds and branches and solid cattle manure which were combined on dry mass in a 4 1 1 ratio due to its rich in organic matter and a variety of mineral elements oil residue can improve the soil structure and nutrients enhance water holding capacity innangi et al 2017 so it is used to the main material of biomaterial amendment previous studies reported that pomace as an organic amendment could enhance soil properties due to its high content of organic matter and exchangeable cations innangi et al 2017 muscolo et al 2019 rojas valencia et al 2011 this is the reason why we chose pomace as the main material of biomaterial amendment many studies have shown that crushing straw can improve the soil physical and chemical properties enhance water holding capacity and increase soil nutrients fang et al 2021 hu et al 2020 li et al 2020 maneepitak et al 2019 hence we select local corn straw as one of the materials of biomaterial amendment weeds and branches were also good soil amendment material to improvement soil structure and nutrients attribute to its easy access and it is a model of rational use of materials guo et al 2021 song et al 2017 2020b solid cattle manure such as cow dung a common local manure is rich in organic and mineral elements that improve the soil nutrients many studies showed that application of manure significantly increased crop yields soil organic c and nutrients gai et al 2018 wang et al 2021 due to its highly water absorption rate polyacrylamide can repeatedly absorb water and slowly release water absorption to keep moist for a long time tadayonnejad et al 2017 these materials were fully mixed with soil and buried in fsp and rcp the results showed that barh treatment could increase soil moisture and promote root growth which was a good management measure in rainfed apple orchard on the loess plateau 4 2 soil moisture and water storage in our study it was obvious that barh treatment increased smc significantly than ck treatment fig 4 this might because that soil amendments could be used to increase water retention capacity due to its mineralogical structure which allows it to absorb water quickly and release water slowly as a tiny reservoir under drought conditions this result was comparable to the findings by mi et al 2017 who found that soil biomaterial amendments could be used as a tiny reservoir to continuously provide water for crop growth since the biomaterial amendment was incorporated down to 40 cm the barh treatment reached the greatest smc at 40 cm soil depth over three years within the 0 300 cm soil layer rainwater seeped into soil and wetted soil biomaterial which buried in 0 40 cm that could keep higher moisture content for a long period thus increased smc due to gathering rainwater to seep into soil rainfall harvest rh system is an effective measure thus could improve water retention in soil improve rainfall use efficiency improve crop yields and reduce soil evaporation in the rainfed regions on the loess plateau wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and barh treatment was better than rh in keeping higher soil moisture figs 4 and 5 real limits on crop yield must be determined before any soil amendments or restoration measures can be undertaken celestina et al 2019 in the past several years the land area occupied by apple orchards has increased over one million ha on the loess plateau song et al 2020a due to the high moisture requirements soil water may decline sharply in a rainfed orchard significantly affecting apple production therefore soil moisture is an important factor for sustainable development of orchard on china s loess plateau song et al 2017 our result found that barh treatment could significantly increase smc within the 0 300 cm soil depth especially within 0 100 cm the barh treatment had a significant effect on smc at 20 60 cm and 160 220 cm soil depths over three years fig 4 this might be the effect of the fsp and rcp plus film mulching which could have significantly decreased water exchange between the soil and air this would have reduced soil evaporation and soil biomaterial which was regarded as a reservoir was buried at 0 40 soil depth so as to keep moist for a long time when wetted by rainwater thus to increase soil moisture we also found that smc under rh treatment declined over after the first year this might attribute to that it was dry in 2016 wet in 2017 and normal in 2018 and application of rh treatment in dry year 2016 could significant increased smc by collecting limited rainwater in soil and after the first year water shortage was not critical rainwater was more in 2017 and 2018 there was more available water for apple tree use the smc in the whole apple orchard in 2017 and 2018 was higher than that in 2016 tubeileh et al 2016 reported that water harvesting measures could increase water availability for trees grum et al 2017 shown that tied ridges plus straw mulch effectively reduced runoff and increased smc li et al 2018 found that a fish scale pit could improve soil moisture during the rainy season these findings are in agreement with our results 4 3 soil bulk density saturated conductivity and soil aggregates in our study compared with ck treatment there was significant difference in soil bulk density and soil saturated conductivity under barh treatment but not rh treatment tables 3 and 4 this demonstrated the effects on soil physical properties in dryland agriculture ecosystem only depend on organic amendment materials and are not related to fsp application of the barh measure the combination of soil biomaterial amendment and fish scale pit in rainfed apple orchard on loess plateau altered soil physical properties within the root zone such as soil bulk density soil saturated conductivity and soil aggregates previous field experiments suggest that the application of organic amendment to soil could improve soil structure by altering soil bulk density soil saturated conductivity soil aggregate and soil quality he et al 2019 khaliq and kaleem abbasi 2015 mitran et al 2018 shen et al 2018 however most studies highlighting the improvements associated with organic amendments were conducted in wheat and maize rotations and different types of organic amendments have different effects on soil physical properties in different soil few experiments have been conducted on rainfed apple orchards on the loess plateau in the present study barh system significantly changed soil structure and increased the proportion of size sand particle aggregates 0 02 2 mm the total aggregate porosity will increase with increasing soil size according to the findings of dexter 1988 who reported that the larger the proportion of soil aggregates the greater the total porosity of soil these variation in soil structure might have resulted in a reduction of soil bulk density previous studies indicated that the application of organic amendment in soil promoted the formation of large sized aggregates this resulted in the larger proportion of soil macroaggregates thus increased soil porosity then reduced soil bulk density this is similar with our results that the barh treatment had a significant effect on soil bulk density at 0 60 cm soil depths in all three years this might because soil biomaterial had a fluffy texture and a high porosity and when incorporated into the 0 40 cm soil depth the amendment led to greater soil aggregates then increased soil porosity and therefore reduce soil bulk density this was consistent with sun and han 2018 who reported that soil amendments reduced soilbulk density in a sandy soil our results also found that the barh treatment could significantly increase soil saturated conductivity in the 0 40 cm soil layer with largest effect at 20 40 cm soil depth in all three years table 4 the correlation between soil porosity and soil saturated water conductivity is obvious this might be attributed to enhanced of soil porosity han et al 2010 4 4 apple roots rwd and rld decreased with the increasing soil depth fig 8 which are consistent with the findings by wang et al 2020 and song et al 2017 who reported that the fine root biomass and root length density decreased with increased soil depth this might be because root system grew towards soil layers with higher moisture and nutrient content and more root systems will be concentrated in soil layers with high smc guo et al 2021 also the soil physical chemical and microbial characteristics were unsuitable in deep soil layers for root growth polverigiani et al 2018 distribution characteristics of roots especially the fine roots and their resistance to drought are the primary determinants of forest productivity in semi arid areas therefore it is of great significance to study the distribution of apple tree roots previous studies showed that fruit tree fine roots were mainly concentrated in 0 200 cm ma et al 2013 forey et al 2017 in our study over 70 of fine roots were concentrated in 0 160 cm soil layer this is consisting with the results by song et al 2018 who found that 60 of apple tree fine roots were mainly distributed in the 0 200 cm soil layer 4 5 correlation between apple roots and soil water in this study soil water storage had significant positive correlations with rwd and rld and the correlation coefficients were 0 82 and 0 88 respectively which was consistent with wang et al 2020 who reported that root biomass decreased with increasing soil depth as a result of a decline in smc with increasing soil depth this demonstrates that the more water there is in the soil the more apple roots there are the barh treatment significantly changed the soil water conditions and therefore influenced apple root growth root water uptake strategy could also affect soil water redistribution previous studies suggested that root growth is highly related to soil water conditions and apple roots were affected by soil water storage and other management methods in apple orchards song et al 2018 li et al 2019 song et al 2017 reported that apple roots were mainly concentrated in the soil layers with higher smc which could affect root water uptake strategies and the roots distribution in different soil layers assuming that the distribution of fine roots under the barh treatment was the same as the ck treatment there should be a higher smc under the barh treatment it can be seen that the root distribution has a positive correlation with soil water storage within the root zone the plant available moisture within the root zone provides conditions favorable to apple tree root growth and soil moisture accumulation that is essential for the successful growth of the apple trees within this region 5 conclusion soil biomaterial amendment combined with rainwater harvesting measures had significant effects on smc water storage soil bulk density soil saturated conductivity particle size distribution of microaggregate apple roots and yield the barh treatment had the greatest smc and soil water storage within 0 300 cm soil depth over three years the proportion of sand size soil microaggregates under the barh treatment was the highest over three years likewise the barh treatment increased soil saturated conductivity within the 0 40 cm soil depth and reduced soil bulk density within 0 60 cm soil depth compared to the ck treatment the barh treatment increased rwd and rld within 0 300 cm soil depth by 33 35 and 52 16 respectively over three years soil water storage showed positive correlations with rwd and rld within the 0 300 cm soil depth our research indicates that the barh measure in rainfed apple orchards on the loess plateau is an effective measure to improve soil hydraulic parameters and apple roots further research on long term effect of the barh measure on soil physical chemical and biological properties is required to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms of the barh treatment on increasing apple yields in rainfed apple orchards on the loess

10187,this study assesses the accuracy of estimating daily grass reference evapotranspiration pm eto using daily shortwave radiation rs and reference evapotranspiration etref products provided by the meteosat second generation msg geostationary satellite delivered by the satellite applications facility on land surface analysis lsa saf framework the accuracy of using reanalysis era5 shortwave radiation data rs era5 provided by the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf is also evaluated the assessments were performed using observed weather variables at 37 weather stations distributed across continental portugal where climate conditions range from semi arid to humid and 12 weather stations located in azores islands characterized by humid windy and often cloudy conditions this study s use of data from a variety of climate conditions contributed to a unique and innovative assessment of the usability of lsa saf and era5 products for eto estimation the first assessment focused on comparing lsa saf estimates of rs rs lsa saf against ground stations rs ground the results showed a good matching between the two rs data sets for continental portugal but a tendency for rs lsa saf to under estimate rs ground in the cloudy islands of azores eto values computed using rs lsa saf data and observed temperature humidity and wind speed eto lsa saf were then compared with pm eto estimates with ground based data which were used as benchmark input data of temperature and humidity needed for pm eto were quality checked for surface aridity effects it was observed that eto lsa saf is strongly correlated with pm eto r2 0 97 for most locations in continental portugal with regression coefficient of a linear regression forced to the origin ranging between 0 95 and 1 05 mean root mean square error rmse of 0 13 mm d 1 and nash and sutcliff efficiency of modeling ef above 0 95 for most azores locations eto lsa saf over estimated pm eto this is likely a consequence of the high spatio temporal heterogeneity of weather conditions that occur in these oceanic islands together with the different footprints of satellite averaged over the pixel and station observations reanalysis era5 shortwave radiation data presented similar behavior to the lsa saf products however with slightly lower accuracy the daily lsa saf etref product etref lsa saf was assessed and results have shown a good accuracy of this product with acceptable rmse and high ef values for continental portugal but a low accuracy for the azores islands a simplified bias correction approach was shown to improve both eto derived from the lsa saf products namely for azores stations which seem to be representative of smaller areas the use of the fao pm temperature approach pmt was also assessed using the rs lsa saf and rs era5 data which showed a superiority of the lsa saf product for eto estimations eto pmt lsa saf no significant differences p 0 05 were observed in terms of the median value of the rmse when adopting eto pmt and etref lsa saf differently results showed that using the rs lsa saf in the pmt approach eto pmt lsa saf produces significantly better rmse results than eto pmt and etref lsa saf overall the performed assessment allows concluding that the use of rs lsa saf and to a lesser extent the use of the rs era5 highly improves the accuracy of computation of eto when rs observations are not available including when only temperature data are accessible the use of the etref lsa saf product is a good alternative when observed weather data are not

1 introduction evapotranspiration is a key meteorological and hydrological variable particularly important in terms of the water cycle in basin water management to quantify the water balance from the field to the hydrological basin scales and in water resources planning and management for the diverse uses of water agricultural water management particularly irrigation management requires good knowledge of crop evapotranspiration etc namely aiming at improved water use performance and productivity coping with the ever increasing water scarcity and water saving thus addressing ongoing climate change challenges allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2009 2012 pereira 2017 fao56 allen et al 1998 aiming at improving the estimation of crop water requirements and defining irrigation scheduling modes propose to estimate crop et as etc kc eto where kc is the crop coefficient dimensionless and eto mm d 1 is the grass reference evapotranspiration eto represents the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and results from parameterizing the penman monteith combination equation for clipped grass allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 while the kc incorporates the main characteristics that distinguish each crop from the grass reference crop in terms of evapotranspiration updated reviews on kc are provided in various articles of this special issue pereira et al 2021a b as well as reviews on the estimation of etc and kc from remote sensing french et al 2020 pôças et al 2020 the grass reference evapotranspiration eto is defined as the rate of evapotranspiration from a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height h equal to 0 12 m a fixed daily canopy resistance rs 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling the evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing completely shading the ground and not short of water allen et al 1998 eto is computed with the fao penman monteith equation pm eto as discussed by allen et al 1994 1998 and pereira et al 1999 for daily time step calculations it is written as 1 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 tmean is mean daily air temperature c at the reference height of 2 m es ea represents the vapor pressure deficit of air kpa at 2 m height u2 is wind speed m s 1 at 2 m height δ represents the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship at mean air temperature kpa ºc 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 its computation requires data on daily temperature solar radiation air humidity and wind speed however often observed weather data do not include all the variables required for computing pm eto eq 1 or those data are not freely available from the relevant meteorological services or available data sets may have large gaps or may be of poor quality due to insufficient maintenance of equipment and quality control furthermore the observations required to derive pm eto should be performed over well watered grass to avoid surface aridity errors allen et al 1998 then to cope with reduced and or inadequate data sets alternative et equations or computational approaches may be used approaches for computing eto with reduced weather data sets are reviewed and updated by paredes et al 2020 mainly the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 and the pm eto temperature approach pmt which have proved accurate for daily and monthly time steps and diverse climates and regions popova et al 2006 jabloun and sahli 2008 sentelhas et al 2010 todorovic et al 2013 raziei and pereira 2013 ren et al 2016 almorox et al 2018 paredes et al 2018a b paredes and pereira 2019 in the absence of radiation measurements an alternative source for shortwave radiation rs is the use of remotely sensed data such as those retrieved from geostationary satellites examples include the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri radiometers onboard the meteosat second generation msg satellites trigo et al 2011 ramírez cuesta et al 2018 or the radiances provided by the imager on board the geostationary operational environmental satellite goes liang et al 2010 inamdar and guillevic 2015 the satellite application facility on land surface analysis lsa saf is part of the european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat ground processing segment and is committed to process information on land surface variables from remote sensing currently the lsa saf uses observations provided by the geostationary system meteosat second generation msg as reviewed by trigo et al 2011 the main advantages of msg products include the monitoring of large areas of the earth at regular intervals of time furthermore the increasing number of satellite products that are freely available make these products a practical and cost effective means of gathering information over land surfaces for a wide range of applications including the nearly continuous assessment of vegetation state and water stress trigo et al 2011 the accuracy of remote sensing solar radiation products has been widely evaluated roerink et al 2012 bojanowski et al 2014 mokhtari et al 2018 ramírez cuesta et al 2018 however some constraints have been reported namely those referring to rapidly changing cloud sky conditions geiger et al 2008 macke et al 2010 cristóbal and anderson 2013 carrer et al 2019 accurate eto estimations were reported when combining the use of remotely sensed shortwave radiation with ground temperature observations bois et al 2008 cammalleri and ciraolo 2013 cruz blanco et al 2014 or with temperature data provided by reanalysis products de bruin et al 2010 2016 cruz blanco et al 2015 more recently the studies by trigo et al 2018 and de bruin and trigo 2019 reported on the very good accuracy of the reference evapotranspiration product provided by the lsa saf herein etref lsa saf when compared with eto obtained from lysimeter for sites under diverse climatic conditions reanalysis products are another important source of atmospheric variables namely shortwave radiation which are made available at various spatial resolutions and allowing high temporal sampling reanalysis has the advantage of providing consistent information that span along several decades good accuracy of eto estimations were reported when using reanalysis products such as era 40 ishak et al 2010 era interim boulard et al 2016 paredes et al 2018c both provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf or reanalysis products provided by the national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar srivastava et al 2013 2015 martins et al 2017 recently pelosi et al 2020 also reported on the good accuracy of two ecmwf reanalysis products the era5 land and the uerra mescan surfex used for estimating eto the present study aims at assessing the use of the lsa saf remote sensing rs product and of the ecmwf era5 reanalysis rs product for estimating daily eto when full data sets are not available the assessment is performed over a wide range of climate conditions including continental sites and oceanic islands the latter are characterized by frequent cloudy conditions with fast fluctuating broken cloud conditions high air humidity and windy conditions throughout the year the objectives of the study using full data pm eto eq 1 as a benchmark consists of assessing 1 the quality of the lsa saf remote sensing rs product rs lsa saf and of era5 reanalysis rs product rs era5 comparatively to local rs observations rs ground 2 the performance of daily pm eto estimates using rs lsa saf and rs era5 combined with ground based observations of tmax tmin rh and u2 3 the accuracy of the etref lsa saf without and with bias correction to adjust satellite based estimates to locally observed conditions 4 the performance of the fao pm temperature approach pmt when using temperature data and the rs lsa saf and rs era5 products the assessment of the usability of lsa saf and era5 products for eto estimation consists of an innovative approach when observation data sets are incomplete since the related calculation accuracy demonstrates that it is not only possible but appropriate to avoid the search for alternative et equations and computational procedures 2 overview on the geostationary meteosat second generation products 2 1 products the satellite application facility on land surface analysis lsa saf uses observations provided by the geostationary msg system and the eumetsat polar system eps to generate a suite of land surface variables that are made publicly available in near real time or offline the satellite products generated and distributed by the lsa saf are related to a the surface radiation budget parameters including the long and short wave surface fluxes the land surface temperature the albedo and the emissivity b vegetation products state stress and wildfires and c biophysical parameters including soil moisture and vegetation evapotranspiration the latter resulting from combining information on the radiation budget and vegetation state in addition a daily reference evapotranspiration product etref lsa saf is also made available in near real time and off line data available since 2004 to present the land surface variables provided by lsa saf are generated on a pixel by pixel basis the data are distributed on the original satellite geostationary projection for the whole msg disk encompassing africa most of europe and part of south america trigo et al 2011 geostationary platforms such as msg provide high frequency observations at moderate spatial resolution and are particularly useful to obtain variables with pronounced diurnal cycles such as shortwave radiation trigo et al 2011 carrer et al 2012 2 2 shortwave radiation rs lsa saf since 2004 the lsa saf has offered surface radiation budget related parameters and the dissemination at a regular basis after operational consolidation was performed in 2007 shortwave radiation at the surface is obtained from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri radiometer onboard the msg with a spatial resolution between 3 and 5 km over africa and most of europe schmetz et al 2002 the lsa saf shortwave radiation products downwelling surface shortwave fluxes dssf lsa saf products are generated at high frequency every 30 min using data from the three solar spectrum channels of the seviri sensor centered on 0 6 0 8 and 1 6 µm as such the lsa saf operationally derives and distributes spatially continuous downward shortwave fluxes as 30 min instantaneous values or as daily averages trigo et al 2011 rs lsa saf data consists of the energy within the solar domain mostly within the 0 3 4 0 µm wavelength interval that reaches the earth s surface per surface unit per day eumetsat lsa saf has an internal quality control for each datum provided the quality indicator includes the number of missing slots within the corresponding 24 h period trigo et al 2011 the data may be acquired in near real time or off line http lsa saf eumetsat int shortwave radiation at the surface is inferred from cloud information obtained from msg observations taking into account that measured top of atmosphere toa reflectances in channels within the solar spectral domain visible and near infrared are anti correlated with the shortwave radiation reaching the surface under cloudy sky conditions the method proposed by gautier et al 1980 and brisson et al 1999 for the radiation transfer in the cloud atmosphere surface system is used the cloud transmittance and cloud albedo may present high variability at small time scales depending on the daily evolution of the clouds under cloudy conditions it is assumed that the whole image pixel is covered by a homogeneous cloud layer a full description of the algorithm is provided by geiger et al 2008 here we stress that the methodology may be applied to any satellite data with measurements at least in the visible bands nevertheless given the strong diurnal cycle of the shortwave radiation the accuracy of the daily values will be highly influenced by the temporal sampling the lsa saf estimations of solar irradiance at the surface have been thoroughly validated against in situ measurements revealing relative errors generally below 5 geiger et al 2008 carrer et al 2012 the actual product accuracy depends on retrieval conditions such as the amount and type of clouds geiger et al 2008 journée and bertrand 2010 cristóbal and anderson 2013 as well as on the uncertainty in aerosol loads ceamanos et al 2014 the impact of uncertainties in cloud coverage will be higher in the presence of broken clouds carrer et al 2019 as discussed by cristóbal and anderson 2013 topography may also affect remote sensing rs estimations with slightly higher estimation errors for hilly locations considering such variability we present here an assessment of the rs lsa saf product for a set of in situ observations over both mainland portugal and the azores islands covering a wide range of conditions focus is placed on the impact of shortwave radiation uncertainties on estimates of grass reference evapotranspiration 2 3 reference evapotranspiration etref lsa saf considering that evapotranspiration over the reference surface is not water limited eto will be essentially controlled by rs as the main source of external energy driving the atmospheric evaporative demand trigo et al 2011 2018 de bruin et al 2016 de bruin and trigo 2019 therefore most methods to estimate eto will require reliable observations or estimations of rs however we are often faced with cases where rs observations are either not available or they are sparsely distributed or measured by poorly maintained instruments which then may lead to substantial measurement errors wild 2009 urraca et al 2018 thus to overcome the quality of data as well as the lack of continuous measurements the etref lsa saf product is based upon a thermodynamical model combined with an atmospheric boundary layer model etref lsa saf is calculated from the daily rs lsa saf product and from the daily air temperature at 2 m obtained from the operational forecasts provided by the ecmwf through the claussius clapeyron equation following the algorithm described by de bruin et al 2016 for this reason etref lsa saf is not affected by local factors such as aridity or local advection since the main driver for its estimation is global radiation de bruin et al 2016 de bruin and trigo 2019 the etref lsa saf is generated daily and made available at pixel size for the whole seviri msg disk almost at real time air temperature data at 2 m data are provided at 3 hourly ecmwf forecasts with a resolution of about 9 km which were linearly interpolated in time to hourly ones and bi linearly interpolated in space to the seviri msg resolution the air temperature values underwent a further adjustment to correct differences between ecmwf model surface orography and the finer scale seviri pixel altitude using a constant slope rate of 0 0067 ºc m 1 de bruin et al 2010 a detailed description of ecmwf data is provided by owens and hewson 2018 as previously presented etref lsa saf was validated against in situ eto measurements performed over well watered grass using eddy covariance and lysimeters collected over sites with different climates and characteristics the validation of the etref lsa saf product presents overall very good accuracy especially for sites which are not affected by advection or aridity in accordance with the definition of eto cruz blanco et al 2014 de bruin et al 2016 trigo et al 2018 de bruin and trigo 2019 3 the reference crop evapotranspiration the computation of the daily grass reference evapotranspiration pm eto eq 1 was performed using the procedures proposed by allen et al 1998 for daily time steps it writes 1 bis et o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 tmean is mean daily air temperature c at the reference height of 2 m es ea represents the vapor pressure deficit of air kpa at 2 m height u2 is wind speed m s 1 at 2 m height δ represents the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relationship at mean air temperature kpa c 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 the daily soil heat flux g was assumed to be null because its value beneath a dense grass canopy is very small allen et al 1998 therefore the daily net balance of energy available at the grass canopy reduces to the net radiation rn computed as the difference between the net shortwave radiation rns mj m 2 d 1 and the net long wave radiation rnl mj m 2 d 1 rn rns rnl rns is computed as the difference between the incoming solar radiation rs mj m 2 d 1 and the reflected shortwave solar radiation thus rns rs 1 α where α is the albedo of the surface with α 0 23 for the grass reference surface as assumed in the definition of eto allen et al 1998 the net long wave radiation rnl mj m 2 d 1 is obtained from the balance between the outgoing and incoming longwave

speed data was adjusted to the standard height of 2 m using the logarithmic wind speed profile proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 in the fao pm temperature approach pmt air temperature is used as estimator of ea and rs allen et al 1998 as recommended by allen et al 1998 to compute ea it was assumed that tdew could be acceptably estimated from tmin using a correction factor at 0 to 3 ºc depending upon the aridity of the site thus with tdew tmin at the aridity of the site was estimated using the unep aridity index ai unep 1997 defined as the ratio between the long term averages of the annual precipitation and the annual potential climatic et pet thornthwaite 1948 this approach has been tested for several climates and locations as reviewed by paredes et al 2020 thus ea was estimated

pereira 2013 todorovic et al 2013 ren et al 2016 paredes et al 2018a c paredes and pereira 2019 in the pmt approach the predictive rs equation of hargreaves and samani 1985 was used as proposed by allen et al 1998 and recently discussed by paredes and pereira 2019 this equation assumes rs as a linear function of the square root of the daily temperature differences td tmax tmin thus 7 r s k r s t max t min 0 5 r a where krs is an empirical radiation adjustment coefficient c 0 5 and ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m2 d 1 the krs coefficient varies with the atmospheric conditions of the location which impact the availability of shortwave solar radiation at the surface allen et al 1998 previous studies have related the variation of krs with the climate dryness wetness as well as with wind speed raziei and pereira 2013 ren et al 2016 paredes et al 2018a 2020 paredes and pereira 2019 other factors which influence the krs values include the elevation of the site allen 1997 and the distance to large water bodies hargreaves and samani 1985 allen et al 1998 the reported increase of krs values in areas close to large water bodies namely the ocean relative to inland locations may be the consequence of the combined effect of air moisture and wind speed prevailing in coastal areas to ease the use of eq 7 without requiring local calibration of krs paredes and pereira 2019 and paredes et al 2020 adopted multi linear regression equations to estimate krs using long time averages of td rh and u2 characterizing the site thus krs used herein was obtained using these equations the u2 default estimator used in the present study was the local u2 average u2 avg the hargreaves samani hs eto equation hargreaves and samani 1985 is also commonly used when only temperature data are available this equation may be written as 8 et o hs 0 0135 k rs r a λ t max t min 0 5 t mean 17 8 where eto hs corresponds to the daily grass reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 tmax tmin and tmean are respectively the maximum minimum and mean daily temperature c λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 krs is the empirical radiation adjustment coefficient c 0 5 ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 d 1 0 0135 is a factor for conversion of units from the american to the international system and 17 8 is an empirical factor related to temperature units used in the original formulations the krs radiation adjustment coefficient used in the hs equation eq 8 is similar to the one used in the pmt approach and therefore varies with climate paredes et al 2020 also developed a simple procedure to parameterize the eto hs equation by estimating krs from long time averages of td rh and u2 characterizing the site which is used in the present study 4 data 4 1 ground based data daily weather data sets were collected across continental portugal from 37 weather stations 22 maintained by the portuguese institute for sea and atmosphere ipma and 15 by the operative and technological center for irrigation cotr the azores daily datasets used in the present study refer to 12 weather stations located in eight islands which are in charge of various regional institutions the following observations are available maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax and tmin c measured at 2 m height relative humidity at 2 m height rh shortwave radiation rs mj m 2 d 1 and wind speed at the standard height of 2 m u2 m s 1 in cases where wind speed data were measured with instruments placed above 2 m a logarithmic wind speed profile allen et al 1998 was used rh were available as daily averages rhmean in the case of ipma and as maximum and minimum daily values rhmax rhmin in other locations the various weather stations sites are located within regions in continental portugal characterized by diverse climate conditions ranging from semi arid to humid the climate in the azores islands is humid cloudy and windy typical for oceanic islands and shows a great time and space variability of solar radiation due to variable cloudiness the location of continental portugal and the archipelago of azores is presented in fig 1 the weather stations used in the study are listed in table 1 and their locations are depicted in fig 2 most of these stations were used in previous studies of rs estimations and to assess eto computations either with reduced datasets teixeira et al 2008 paredes et al 2018a b 2020 paredes and pereira 2019 or with data derived from era interim reanalysis paredes et al 2018c available information suggested that the selected weather stations could be considered as reference sites as recommended by allen et al 1998 qa qc for all observed data sets was performed using the guidelines described by allen 1996 to further ensure the appropriateness of data quality an analysis of the lower quartile q1 the median q2 and the upper quartile q3 the minimum and maximum values as well as the search for outliers was performed for all locations and all weather variables additionally a quality check for surface aridity effects was performed using temperature and humidity data 4 2 remote sensing data extraction and processing procedures spatial sampling of the daily rs lsa saf and etref lsa saf products is 4 to 5 km over continental portugal and the azores data were extracted from the msg pixels that were nearest to the given meteorological station location because the daily lsa saf estimations of both rs lsa saf and etref lsa saf rely on retrievals of instantaneous solar radiation performed every 30 min days with more than five missing slots out of a total of 48 slots were removed from the analysis performed here this procedure aims to ensure that only rs lsa saf and etref lsa saf estimates with a minimum of observation gaps were used the missing 30 min slots may occur for several reasons most notably a failure of the data acquisition system or in the algorithm processing system on average less than 10 of days were removed due to missing over five 30 min slots the maximum percentage of missing values from individual stations was reached in miranda do douro 22 relative to the period of 2010 2013 from 2015 on the number of missing 30 min slots is residual and gaps on both rs and etref lsa saf data sets represent less than 2 4 3 shortwave radiation reanalysis data the era5 is the most recent reanalysis dataset provided by the ecmwf which replaced the previous era interim by august 2019 era5 data span from 1979 to present and are made available on regular grids with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 latitude longitude corresponding to an approximately uniform spacing of 31 km hersbach et al 2018 2019 era5 is based on the integrated forecasting system ifs cycle 41r2 which was the ecmwf s model version used for operational forecasts in 2016 era5 further innovates from era interim including an hourly forecast the era5 dataset includes a very wide range of atmospheric and surface variables including incoming solar radiation at the surface which is used in this study the solar radiation product rs era5 is estimated taking into account total solar irradiance ozone and greenhouse gases profiles model clouds and aerosols developed for the world climate research programme wcrp initiative cmip5 including stratospheric sulfate aerosols hersbach et al 2019 era5 reanalysis products are operationally generated with a 5 day latency further information on era5 is provided by hersbach et al 2018 2019 in the present study the nearest grid points to the station location were considered for retrieving and cumulating the data on hourly global solar radiation at the surface w m 2 5 procedures for assessing the quality of estimates and bias correction several goodness of fit indicators were used for assessing the performance of the diverse approaches in representing the amplitude and time variation of eto estimations when using observations the accuracy assessment focused on the pairwise comparison between measured rs or eto obtained from ground observed weather values oi and the corresponding predicted values pi through the various estimation processes assessed thus to verify the similarity between oi and pi the following set of indicators were used as in previous applications martins et al 2017 paredes and pereira 2019 i the regression coefficient b0 of a linear regression forced to the origin fto which is an overall constant of proportionality between observation and predicted values and often interpreted as a measure of bias with b0 1 suggesting under estimation and b0 1 over estimation thus considering a target value b0 1 0 ii the coefficient of determination r2 of the ordinary least squares regression ols that assesses the dispersion of pairs oi and pi along the regression line i e indicates how close are the predicted and the observed variables where r2 1 0 is maximum agreement iii the root mean square error rmse mm d 1 which is an overall measurement of the differences between observed and predicted values iv the normalized rmse nrmse defined as the ratio between rmse and the mean of observations o and consists of a non dimensional measure of the relative error of estimate and v the nash and sutcliff 1970 efficiency of modeling ef which measures the relative magnitude of the mean square error mse rmse2 relative to the observed data variance σ legates and mccabe jr 1999 with an ef value of 1 0 indicating perfect efficiency contrarily negative ef values indicate that the fitting is poor and that there is no advantage in using the predicted values pi instead of the mean of observed values oi the non parametric wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test wilcoxon 1945 conover 1999 was used to assess when the approaches used for eto estimation were significantly different p 0 05 in terms of the median value of rmse this test was selected because rmse data series did not follow a normal distribution this test has been previously used to compare the relative performance of various hydrologic modeling approaches including for reanalysis corrections in eto estimations ricard and anctil 2019 due to the impact of cloud coverage rapidly changing in space and time such as in the cloudy and rainy region of the azores islands a bias correction of the rs lsa saf could be required badescu and dumitrescu 2013 polo et al 2016 due to the eto dependency on rs a bias correction could also be required for the etref lsa saf product the objective of the bias correction is to reduce the differences between the satellite derived values which are representative of a given pixel of the order of 4 5 4 5 km2 over the azores and the observed rs the bias correction procedure may be applied directly to eto using etref lsa saf and eto computed with ground full data several studies reported on the inaccuracies of satellite derived rs particularly under non clear sky conditions e g guidard et al 2011 and in island conditions mazorra aguiar et al 2019 despite improvements on the removal of systematic errors prior to assimilation in the present study a simplified bias correction scheme was used for operational purposes however because rs lsa saf is used to compute etref lsa saf the bias correction procedure was preferably applied to etref lsa saf instead of rs lsa saf product several bias correction methods have been used and assessed for various rs satellite products journée and bertrand 2010 badescu and dumitrescu 2013 polo et al 2015 2016 kambezidis et al 2016 given that the etref lsa saf product is still fairly recent bias correction studies have not been reported yet in the present study the bias correction procedure consisted in dividing each data set relative to each targeted location into two subsets of the same size separated in time the more distant set of data was used for training and the more recent one was kept for validation thus the correction parameters were obtained from the training data set and the same correction parameters were used with the validation set the simplified bias correction used in several applications of remote sensing and reanalysis data e g polo et al 2015 2016 paredes et al 2018c mazorra aguiar et al 2019 consists of the difference between the fitted line ysatellite a xground b and the y x line thus the daily corrected estimates are 9 y new t y satellite a 1 x ground b the assessment of the performance of the bias correction procedure was performed for the validation sets 6 results and discussion 6 1 comparing lsa saf and era5 shortwave radiation products rs lsa saf and rs era5 with ground observations for continental portugal rs lsa saf data are in close agreement with rs ground data as per the results of the goodness of fit indicators fig 3 the values of the regression coefficient b0 range from 0 96 to 1 06 with 95 of values in the interval 0 95 1 05 with only two locations presenting values above 1 05 the mean b0 is 1 02 which indicates that rs lsa saf tends to be only slightly greater than rs ground the coefficients of determination are very high with most locations 84 having values above 0 95 and only two locations with r2 0 90 fig 3 the normalized rmse is smaller than 10 for most locations 73 of cases averaging 9 2 with a standard deviation of 4 3 nrmse 20 refers to only one weather station the efficiency of modeling ef is larger than 0 80 for all cases and is above 0 95 for 78 of cases these results indicate that the values of rs lsa saf are similar or very similar to those observed in the continental weather stations lower goodness of fit indicators refer to a weather station located in higher altitude guarda thus in agreement with results of other studies reporting lower accuracy for hilly locations cristóbal and anderson 2013 gómez et al 2016 it can therefore be concluded that rs lsa saf data may be used with high accuracy throughout continental portugal the goodness of fit results comparing rs era5 with rs ground data in continental portugal are worse than those shown for rs lsa saf fig 3 likely due to the higher heterogeneity of weather conditions within the larger pixels of era5 31 km for era5 vs 5 km for lsa saf which reduces the ability to estimate point site rs values data in fig 3 shows that the frequency of b0 1 05 is larger for rs era5 comparatively to rs lsa saf thus indicating a greater trend for over estimation however most of r2 values are in the range 0 80 0 90 the nrmse values are higher than 15 for all cases fig 3 with nrmse averaging 22 and the majority of cases having nrmse 20 for all cases ef 0 90 however with most weather stations having ef ranging from 0 80 to 0 90 the spatial distribution of the goodness of fit indicators relative to rs lsa saf throughout continental portugal is homogeneous contrarily to rs era5 fig 3 likely this difference depends upon the pixel size of both grids although era5 is a state of the art global reanalysis its spatial resolution of about 31 km 31 km is much greater than that of msg lsa saf derived products of about 5 km 5 km which implies that era5 products will perform less well particularly over regions where the spatial variability of factors influencing solar radiation at the surface most notably cloud coverage is high results show that the locations where rs era5 tends to over estimate rs ground b0 1 05 and r2 is smaller are located in northern coastal area where the weather variability is larger and cloudiness is more frequent and variable than in inland and southern locations it results that higher nrmse are also found in northern coastal locations where ef shows smaller values overall the goodness of fit indicators are reasonably good thus suggesting that rs era5 data are also adequate to be used in the absence of rs observations the superiority of rs provided by msg relative to reanalysis products was also reported in other studies e g bojanowski et al 2014 ramirez camargo and dorner 2016 and urraca et al 2017 the application of lsa saf and era5 products to the azores islands faces a large variability of both the cloud coverage and the respective dynamic influences as well as the presence of low clouds azevedo et al 1999 magarreiro et al 2014 remillard and tselioud 2015 mechem et al 2018 which may contribute to increased differences between station and pixel rs estimates indeed high winds and scattered and broken clouds contribute to less favorable conditions for satellite observation of solar radiation geiger et al 2008 journée and bertrand 2010 macke et al 2010 cristóbal and anderson 2013 carrer et al 2019 in addition palmer et al 2018 reported higher errors of estimates for locations more distant to the satellite grid point and with elevation due to those weather conditions and to the greater difficulty of having accurate rs ground observations in windy and cloudy areas the goodness of fit indicators for azores were not as good as those for continental portugal b0 1 05 are often observed for both rs lsa saf and rs era5 fig 4 thus indicating that both rs products generally over estimate rs ground r2 0 90 for rs lsa saf and r2 0 70 values for rs era5 indicate that the usability of these rs values is less adequate in azores than in continental portugal due to the referred high variability of weather conditions mainly related with clouds dynamics the nrmse values are generally high averaging 31 for rs lsa saf and 41 in case of rs era5 low ef were obtained in azores fig 4 particularly relative to rs era5 thus indicating a reduced gain in its use in azores contrarily to continental portugal the spatial distribution of the goodness of fit indicators in azores fig 4 shows that the more favorable results of both rs lsa saf and rs era5 occurred in low altitude coastal locations where the variability of rs ground is smaller as it is the case of most locations of the western and central islands groups differently goodness of fit results are worse for weather stations located in elevation and slopes exposed to the wet winds which is typically the case for santa bárbara terceira central group fig 4 that station is located in high elevation table 1 and has very cloudy and windy conditions with occult horizontal precipitation equaling the vertical rainfall fontes et al 2006 thus where in situ radiation measurements are hampered by the frequent deposition of fog results for santa bárbara indicate that there is no gain in using rs era5 and a reduced gain in using rs lsa saf thus it is likely that using both gridded rs products as estimators of rs values are questionable for high elevation cloudy and windy areas where broken and low clouds impacts are large a study applied to the oceanic islands of canarias using msg products also reported high errors of estimation of rs under high cloud conditions particularly in higher altitudes mazorra aguiar et al 2019 similar findings relative to high elevation and cloudiness conditions were reported for the corsica island in the mediterranean sea voyant et al 2014 fig 5 shows the variability of the goodness of fit indicators using a box and whiskers plot it shows that the results for continental portugal and azores islands are very different for both rs lsa saf and rs era5 the interquartile ranges of the continental locations show to be much smaller than those of the azores islands which is associated with the high variability of weather conditions observed in the islands stations coherently the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the indicators is also much smaller in continental portugal both the interquartile ranges and the differences between the maximum and minimum values are also smaller for the rs lsa saf product fig 5 also shows that there is a non symmetric distribution of the indicator values which is particularly notable in the azores islands a highly critical aspect in comparing rs products with observations in islands refers to the footprint sizes with that of the weather station much smaller than that of the nearest msg or era5 pixel over highly heterogeneous terrain namely hilly terrains of high altitude the area integrated values obtained from satellite observations or from model estimates as in the case of era5 may differ much from in situ observations this fact may contribute to explain the high b0 and nrmse values for weather stations located in high and sloping fields e g previously referred cases of santa bárbara ribeirinha and granja in terceira island furnas in s miguel and maia in s maria fig 4 particularly referring to era5 products consequently ranges of goodness of fit indicators for the weather stations of azores are quite large since the dispersion of estimates is large ranges of indicators for continental portugal are much smaller than for azores fig 5 the nrmse results analyzed above generally agree with those reported in other studies using msg products for two regions of france one having a climate influenced by the atlantic ocean and the other a mediterranean climate bois et al 2008 reported average nrmse of 20 and 14 respectively thus showing higher values when clouds are more frequent and variable for catalonia spain cristóbal and anderson 2013 reported nrmse averaging 17 for cloudy and hilly locations in contrast with nrmse averaging 6 under clear sky and flat areas bojanowski et al 2014 assessed the accuracy of rs lsa saf product for europe reporting an average nrmse of 16 54 7 73 however ranging approximately 10 15 for locations in continental portugal and ranging 15 20 or 20 30 for locations in northern england and ireland thus with higher cloudiness for andalusia region spain cruz blanco et al 2014 reported nrmse values below 10 for summer thus mostly under clear sky and values averaging 11 5 for the winter months thus suggesting the influence of increased clouds occurrence and variability for the lerma valley argentina ramirez camargo and dorner 2016 studied the impacts of cloud conditions on the accuracy of rs satellite derived products reporting nrmse averaging 33 and 12 under cloud and clear sky conditions respectively urraca et al 2017 for central spain thus for conditions where cloudiness is low reported good accuracy of rs satellite derived products with nrmse averaging 8 3 thus the reported nrmse results confirm the favorable assessment of both rs products for continental portugal and support interpretations of less good results obtained for the oceanic islands of azores considering the results discussed above it may be concluded that both rs lsa saf and rs era5 are good to very good estimates of rs for continental portugal however should be used with caution when cloudiness and clouds variability and wind highly influence the climate of the site both rs lsa saf and rs era5 are less accurate estimates of rs in case of the azores islands however depending upon local variability of weather conditions their accuracy is quite acceptable for low altitude and less cloudy locations nevertheless when rs lsa saf and rs era5 are used to compute the pm eto different conditions and associated accuracies need to be considered as discussed in the following sections 6 2 and 6 4 6 2 computing the pm eto with rs lsa saf and rs era5 the assessment of rs lsa saf and rs era5 products performed in the previous section justify their use to compute the pm eto eq 1 when ground observed temperature air humidity and wind speed are available their goodness of fit indicators for continental portugal and the azores islands are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively however instead of using the nrmse indicator to assess the accuracy of the rs lsa saf and rs era5 products the rmse values were used since they are better suited for comparing the performance of the different approaches used for eto estimations as it is commonly adopted in the literature as discussed before the goodness of fit indicators should be used having in mind the differences in the footprint of the weather stations relative to the grid pixel of both the msg satellite and the reanalysis the latter much larger it was assumed that all weather stations satisfy reference site conditions allen et al 1998 particularly that observations of air temperature and humidity were performed over a grass crop as already mentioned earlier and reported by paredes et al 2020 the goodness of fit indicators from comparing the pm eto values computed with the rs lsa saf and rs era5 products combined with observed temperature air humidity and wind speed respectively eto lsa saf and eto era5 with pm eto computed with full data sets observed at various weather stations of continental portugal are shown in fig 6 the b0 values relative to eto lsa saf are close to 1 0 for all locations while there are a few cases indicating a slight over estimation for eto era5 mainly for weather stations located in coastal areas where the weather variability is higher the r2 average is very high and its standard deviation sd is small 0 99 0 01 for eto lsa saf and 0 97 0 02 for eto era5 thus indicating that for all locations these predicted values are close to the pm eto computed with observed full data sets rmse are small particularly for eto lsa saf which average 0 13 0 04 mm d 1 and has the majority of cases below 0 20 mm d 1 for the era5 products the average rmse is higher 0 34 0 06 mm d 1 but nevertheless small and most locations have rmse 0 30 mm d 1 coherently with the previously referred indicators ef are very high when using both rs products averaging 0 99 and 0 96 for eto lsa saf and eto era5 respectively the spatial distribution of rmse for eto lsa saf is homogeneous and that of eto era5 shows that the lower values occur inland and in southern areas where weather conditions are less variable and cloudiness is less frequent eto lsa saf shows superior results relative to eto era5 thus in accordance with the results obtained for the rs products analyzed in the precedent section as expected from the analysis relative to rs in the precedent section the goodness of fit results for both eto lsa saf and eto era5 applied to the azores islands fig 7 are inferior to those relative to continental portugal for both eto lsa saf and eto era5 b0 1 05 in half of the locations which indicates a trend for over estimation of eto when using the rs products thus following similar over estimation tendency relative to rs r2 values are generally high being greater than 0 90 for eto lsa saf for most locations thus showing that modeled eto lsa saf are close to eto computed with observed data for most stations fig 7 differently for eto era5 predicted and observed eto are less close despite r2 0 80 for most locations which likely is due to the previously referred large size of the reanalysis pixel with the consequent lower ability in capturing the heterogeneity of the weather conditions particularly under highly variable cloud conditions most rmse values are low 0 35 mm d 1 in case of eto lsa saf and 0 50 mm d 1 for eto era5 larger rmse values are observed for eto lsa saf in four locations and in five locations for eto era5 ef values mostly exceed 0 80 with only three locations having ef 0 80 in case of eto lsa saf but five in case of eto era5 as expected all weather stations having worse goodness of fit indicators are located in high elevation and in windy slopes the spatial distribution of the goodness of fit follows those relative to rs however with b0 closer to 1 0 higher r2 and ef and reduced rmse these more favorable results are due to the fact that eto does not depend only on rs but from the combined effects of all weather variables therefore it results that eto lsa saf and eto era5 mainly the former are usable with high accuracy for the locations of low altitude and with acceptable accuracy for stations located in hilly areas where the influence of clouds is major the distribution of the goodness of fit indicators data into quartiles fig 8 shows a narrower range of variation of indicators relative to both eto lsa saf and eto era5 when compared with the ranges relative to the same rs products fig 5 for both continental portugal and azores islands these results indicate that both eto lsa saf and eto era5 are highly accurate despite the low accuracy of the rs lsa saf and rs era5 products used for their computation with eq 1 anyway for the azores islands the interquartile range and the skewness of the distributions of the indicators are larger than for continental portugal results in fig 8 support the appropriateness for using rs from lsa saf or secondarily from era5 in both studied regions despite less accurate eto estimates in the azores islands the era5 product has the advantage relative to lsa saf of the continuity of the data sets while the latter may present gaps however eto era5 can be used for gap filling of the missing eto lsa saf data sets because a very high association between eto lsa saf and eto era5 values exists results from the linear regression between eto lsa saf and eto era5 were assessed for both continental portugal and azores islands respectively eto era5 1 02 eto lsa saf with r2 0 98 and eto era5 0 98 eto lsa saf with r2 0 92 therefore the usability of eto era5 for gap filling of the eto lsa saf data series may be assumed accurate including for the azores islands few studies are available relative to the use of rs products for eto calculation when other than rs variables are observed this is the case of the study by bois et al 2008 where eto lsa saf were compared with full data pm eto resulting in rmse ranging 0 21 0 25 mm d 1 thus within the range of values obtained for eto lsa saf in continental portugal 0 09 0 38 mm d 1 the rmse results obtained in the current study are better or much better than those reported in literature relative to estimating eto when rs is predicted from temperature data eq 7 including when the krs coefficient is locally calibrated for bulgaria popova et al 2006 reported rmse ranging from 0 18 to 0 32 mm d 1 whereas jabloun and sahli 2008 reported on rmse values ranging from 0 34 to 0 44 mm d 1 for continental dry climate locations of tunisia trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 referred rmse ranging from 0 10 to 0 23 mm d 1 for serbia sentelhas et al 2010 reported rmse averaging 0 70 mm d 1 while kwon and choi 2011 reported rmse averaging 0 27 mm d 1 for the korea peninsula using worldwide monthly weather data almorox and grieser 2016 reported rmse ranging 0 33 1 22 mm d 1 with an average of 0 85 mm d 1 using a simplified approach to derive krs for continental portugal paredes et al 2020 reported an average rmse 0 36 mm d 1 while the current rmse average is 0 13 mm d 1 comparing rmse obtained in the current study with those referred above it may be concluded that the use of rs lsa saf to compute the pm eto when rs data is not available leads to very accurate computations of pm eto few studies are available applied to islands environments paredes et al 2018b reported for the azores islands rmse ranging 0 33 0 58 mm d 1 while paredes et al 2020 reported rmse averaging 0 52 mm d 1 in the current study rmse values relative to eto lsa saf range 0 19 0 71 mm d 1 and average 0 41 mm d 1 with most values smaller than 0 35 mm d 1 it may be concluded that the use of rs lsa saf to compute the pm eto is advisable for azores particularly for weather stations located at low elevation where the frequency and variability of cloud cover is not high 6 3 using the lsa saf reference evapotranspiration product etref lsa saf when ground observations are not available the reference evapotranspiration etref lsa saf is a main product of lsa saf available almost at real time which does not require ground observed weather data to assess its usability it was compared with the pm eto eq 1 computed with full data sets of ground observed variables for continental portugal and the azores islands the frequency of distribution of the respective goodness of fit indicators are presented in table 2 and the variability of those indicators is shown in fig 9 when a simple bias correction is or is not applied the spatial distribution of the goodness of fit indicators relative to such comparisons follows those in figs 6 and 7 and are presented as supplementary material figs s1 and s2 for most stations of continental portugal etref lsa saf raw shows a tendency to under estimate pm eto with b0 0 95 in most locations table 2 that under estimation mainly occurs in the southern and inland areas of the country which are marked by a dry climate fig s1 r2 values are generally above 0 90 thus indicating that etref lsa saf values are close to pm eto used as benchmark however the average rmse exceeds 0 50 mm d 1 for most locations 68 of cases with a mean value of 0 70 0 30 mm d 1 table 2 ef values are in general above 0 80 thus showing that the magnitude of the mean square error is smaller or much smaller than the variance of pm eto these results for rmse are in line with those presented by trigo et al 2018 and de bruin and trigo 2019 these authors argued that etref lsa saf assumes that advection effects are absent from the reference surface see pereira et al 1999 and therefore yields lower estimates than pm eto for stations located in dry and hot conditions e g summer months in évora and portalegre for azores results are worse than for continental portugal differently from the latter an over estimation with b0 1 05 is observed in nearly half of locations r2 is low r2 0 80 and rmse values exceed 0 50 mm d 1 in all cases consistently ef values are lower or much lower than for continental portugal this denotes the impact of clouds cover and variability of weather conditions the box and whiskers plot fig 9 shows a very large range of indicators values thus a wide distribution of the values of the goodness of fit indicators particularly in the azores islands to be noted all indicators show a skewed distribution with the lower values of the indicators generally pulling down the mean values relative to the median values the extreme values of r2 rmse and ef in azores show a wide range of scores these results show that the use of the raw etref lsa saf product when climatic data is missing should be performed with caution to improve the usability of etref lsa saf for both continental portugal and azores islands a simplified bias correction was considered section 5 and eq 9 despite it can only be performed when a set of observations are available as expected the fit results generally improved table 2 decreasing the under estimation trends in continental portugal with reducing to 32 4 the number of locations where b0 0 95 and decreasing the over estimation trend in azores with decreasing to 8 3 the number of locations where b0 1 05 observing results for the validation data set table 2 it may be noted that the benefit of bias correction over continental portugal improves b0 values in all sites therefore the proximity of etref lsa saf and pm eto becomes higher r2 results are also improved with r2 0 90 in most locations in addition the average rmse decreases from 0 70 mm d 1 to 0 61 mm d 1 and the number of cases with rmse 0 65 mm d 1 increases from 51 to 62 there is a gain but it may not justify the operational adoption of a bias correction instead of using the raw etref lsa saf product in the case of the azores the bias correction largely reduces the over estimation of eto the number of occurrences in the b0 interval 0 95 1 05 increases from 8 3 to 75 and r2 values become larger than 0 80 for half of the locations thus increasing the proximity between etref lsa saf and pm eto rmse become smaller with rmse 0 65 mm d 1 for most locations and its average decreasing from 0 74 0 19 mm d 1 to 0 62 0 12 mm d 1 the ef values also improve with ef 0 70 for 49 of locations without occurring negative ef values the spread of the distribution of the goodness of fit values decreases for both continental portugal and azores fig 9 the average values of the goodness of fit indicators become closer to the median value due to the decrease of the extreme values of the indicators nevertheless the differences between etref lsa saf and pm eto remain high these differences may be due to uncertainties in this lsa saf product mainly over the azores islands and to uncertainties of in situ observations which are affected by the prevailing climatic conditions moreover it should be stressed that the sampling footprint differences between the satellite and the weather stations strongly influence the outcomes especially for the highly heterogeneous island areas with their specific environmental conditions and frequent changes in clouds and wind that uncertainty and high rmse values are particularly important for weather stations located above 500 m e g s bárbara where fog precipitation represents about 50 of total precipitation 6 4 estimating eto with reduced data sets using temperature data and using the rs lsa saf and rs era5 products the rs lsa saf and rs era5 products were used to compute eto with the pmt approach in combination with observed temperature to estimate the actual vapor pressure eq 6 and the default wind speed u2 avg section 3 and paredes et al 2020 eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 respectively their accuracy was assessed in comparison with pm eto eq 1 computed with full observed data the assessment was further performed through their comparison with the pmt approach where only observed temperature data were used the eto pmt where rs is estimated with eq 7 the frequency distribution of the goodness of fit indicators relative to assess eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 are presented in table 3 results for continental portugal show that for both estimation procedures the majority of the b0 values range 0 95 1 05 with the mean b0 1 01 and 1 02 respectively for eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 thus indicating no trend for over or under estimation the r2 values are high all above 0 80 and the average r2 are 0 94 0 02 and 0 92 0 03 for eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 respectively thus suggesting that predicted values are close to the pm eto values for both approaches the majority of locations show a small rmse 0 65 mm d 1 eto pmt lsa saf outperforms eto pmt era5 with an average rmse of 0 52 0 12 mm d 1 while eto pmt era5 has an average rmse of 0 62 0 12 mm d 1 the ef values are high with ef 0 90 in 87 of locations for eto pmt lsa saf and 62 2 in case of eto pmt era5 thus results show the high accuracy of using the pmt approach with both rs products preferably with rs lsa saf for the azores islands results vary with the environmental conditions of the location as referred above when analyzing the accuracy of rs products i e with the variability and intensity of clouds cover wind speed and elevation spatial distribution shown in fig s4 in supplementary material an under estimation trend is apparent for both eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 with half of locations presenting a b0 within the interval 0 70 0 95 table 3 as a result of the larger variability of weather conditions r2 values are lower than for continental portugal most locations have r2 in the range 0 70 0 90 in case of eto pmt lsa saf and ranging 0 60 0 80 for eto pmt era5 the rmse values for eto pmt lsa saf are generally below 0 65 mm d 1 table 3 with an average rmse of 0 62 0 12 mm d 1 which suggest an acceptable error of estimate differently for eto pmt era5 due to the effect of a much large pixel size the rmse values fall in the interval 0 65 1 00 mm d 1 for most locations with a mean of 0 72 0 08 mm d 1 therefore errors are larger but of reasonable size when using the lsa saf product the ef values are in the interval 0 50 0 90 for all locations whilst using the era5 product ef values fall in the interval 0 50 0 70 for most locations these positive ef values indicate that the error of estimates is reasonably smaller than the variance of the pm eto values however there is not a clear advantage in using rs products of lsa saf and era5 with the pmt approach particularly era5 for the azores eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 were compared with the pmt approach computed with observed temperature only eto pmt with actual vapor pressure computed with eq 6 rs estimated with eq 7 and the default u2 avg and the hargreaves samani equation eto hs eq 8 the krs values used in eqs 7 and 8 were computed with the global equation defined by paredes et al 2020 results in table 3 for continental portugal show that the b0 values for eto pmt commonly range 0 95 1 05 averaging 0 98 while the eto hs tends to under estimate pm eto in most locations with b0 averaging 0 93 for both approaches the r2 values are high with most values above 0 80 the average rmse are 0 66 0 12 mm d 1 for eto pmt and 0 64 0 13 mm d 1 for eto hs however differences in median rmse for the pmt and hs approaches were not significant p 0 05 for azores both pmt and hs approaches show an under estimation tendency with b0 ranging 0 85 0 95 for most locations r2 generally range from 0 60 to 0 80 and rmse values mostly range from 0 65 to 0 80 mm d 1 differences in median rmse in azores were also not significant p 0 05 the dispersion of the goodness of fit indicators values is presented in fig 10 as expected due to the large variability of weather conditions results in azores show a higher spread for most indicators this behavior is evidenced when contrasting the mean and median of all indicators with those for continental portugal in the azores islands the mean b0 values are quite similar for all approaches but the use of the lsa saf and era5 products lead to a wider interquartile range which reflects the climatic impacts on rs discussed in section 6 1 differences among approaches observed in terms of r2 are small for continental portugal but the interquartile range and the differences between the maximum and minimum r2 values are wider for eto pmt lsa saf than for other approaches in azores results also show that for all the eto pmt approaches the rmse have similar mean and median values in both continental portugal and azores islands the interquartile ranges for ef are quite narrow particularly for continental portugal comparing for continental portugal table 4 the goodness of fit results of eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 with the temperature methods eto pmt and eto hs there is evidence of the superiority of eto pmt lsa saf in capturing the variability of the weather conditions and therefore producing better fittings the second best approach is the eto pmt era5 both eto pmt and eto hs tend to under estimate pm eto and to present higher differences between their predicted eto values and those computed with pm eto with full data sets for the azores islands eto pmt lsa saf also has advantage relative to the other studied approaches despite the eto pmt lsa saf inaccuracies in capturing the highly changing weather conditions in some locations its performance is generally quite adequate the second best option is the use of either the eto hs or the eto pmt for the azores islands table 4 eto pmt era5 is the least accurate and therefore the less advisable approach to be used overall these results indicate that it is highly advantageous to compute the pmt approach using the rs lsa saf product the use of the rs era5 product is appropriate for continental portugal but not for azores likely due to the lower ability of era5 in capturing the heterogeneity of the weather conditions particularly under highly variable cloudy conditions due to a large pixel size nevertheless due to the continuity of era5 products the eto pmt era5 may be used for gap filling of eto pmt lsa saf time series a linear regression between all data on eto pmt era5 and eto pmt lsa saf has shown a very high correlation b0 1 02 and r2 0 95 for continental portugal and b0 0 98 and r2 0 90 for the azores islands a comparison between the eto pmt with the raw etref lsa saf product revealed that in terms of median value of rmse there is no statistical difference p 0 05 between the approaches however the use of eto pmt lsa saf reveals a median rmse significantly lower p 0 05 than the raw etref lsa saf product as might be expected these results and those presented in table 4 suggest that eto estimations based on the pmt approach ingesting in situ rs or rs lsa saf compare better than the raw etref lsa saf product with the standard pmt approach however in the absence of accurate temperature measurements the use of raw etref lsa saf shows to be appropriate but should be used with caution to our knowledge there are no studies using the eto pmt with ingestion of either satellite rs or reanalysis rs data thus a comparison of rmse results were performed with other eto pmt studies which used tmin as predictors of tdew eq 6 and used eq 7 with calibrated krs values for continental portugal the rmse results of the current study are similar or better than other pmt results reported in literature using daily weather data popova et al 2006 jabloun and sahli 2008 sentelhas et al 2010 ren et al 2016 in addition rmse results of the current study are within the range of those reported when monthly climatic data were used e g raziei and pereira 2013 todorovic et al 2013 almorox et al 2018 similar rmse results relative to the use of eto pmt were reported for azores islands by paredes et al 2018b there are no additional studies in literature referring to the use of eto pmt in islands characterized by humid windy and often cloudy conditions thus no further assessment was possible the eto hs rmse results of the present study are within the range of those reported in literature after calibration of krs eq 8 such as the one by gavílan et al 2006 sentelhas et al 2010 raziei and pereira 2013 todorovic et al 2013 ren et al 2016 almorox et al 2018 and paredes et al 2020 7 conclusions the lsa saf products assessed in this study revealed a high potential for accurately computing the reference grass evapotranspiration that is required for a variety of uses in agriculture hydrology and water management results have shown that the solar radiation product rs lsa saf consist of an accurate estimator of the shortwave radiation rs when it is not observed however its accuracy is affected by local climate conditions when the cloudiness is frequent and clouds quickly change therefore results are less good for the oceanic islands of azores mainly for locations in higher altitude where fog is frequent and the occurrence of fog precipitation is high results also have shown the superiority of rs lsa saf relative to rs era5 which is mainly due to the pixel size smaller for lsa saf about 4 4 km and 31 31 km for era5 therefore obtaining the location value from the pixel value is more uncertain with rs era5 mainly when the short term local variability of weather conditions determining rs is large as for azores islands when rs lsa saf and rs era5 are used with the pm eto to replace ground observations of rs i e for computing respectively eto lsa saf and eto era5 the goodness of fit indicators relative to their association with pm eto computed with full data sets are very good to excellent for continental portugal with quite small rmse the accuracy of estimates is better for the lsa saf product but results for era5 are close for azores due to the weather variability influencing rs results are not as good as for the continental stations particularly those relative to eto era5 nevertheless they can be used operationally mainly eto lsa saf considering the effective continuity of the era5 data sets the use of its products is advantageous relative to lsa saf which often has gaps in the time series up to 22 values in the series used in the present study however currently the gaps represent only 2 however these gaps affect the operational use of rs lsa saf for computing eto due to the continuity of era5 products and to the closeness of eto estimates using both products despite rmse results of eto era5 are larger the combined use of both rs products may be considered with rs era5 being used to fill the gaps of rs lsa saf however this option must be considered with care when the variability of weather conditions namely for azores locations at high elevation may largely affect rs and eto estimations the etref lsa saf is a unique product that estimates eto without using ground observations its computational algorithm uses rs lsa saf and ecwmf 2 m air temperature forecast products the goodness of fit results from comparing etref lsa saf with the benchmark pm eto computed with full data are clearly worse than those relative to eto lsa saf and eto era5 the rmse are acceptable for continental portugal but are poorer for the azores islands at those sites differences between eto computed with ground weather data and with satellite data may be large for humid cloudy and windy locations in higher altitude the differences between etref lsa saf and pm eto may result as previously discussed from inaccuracies of the rs lsa saf product as well as from uncertainties in the ground measurements themselves furthermore the etref lsa saf makes use of a different formulation to estimate eto that allows relying on variables that can be inferred from satellite measurements and avoids a high dependency on others that need to be provided by models the difference in spatial resolution between lsa saf and ecmwf source of the 2 m air temperature about 4 km vs 9 km may be a further source of uncertainty for etref lsa saf especially in areas where elevation is irregular for reduced data sets when only temperature data are available instead of using the pmt or the hs temperature approaches eto may be estimated by ingesting the rs products rs lsa saf and rs era5 in the pmt approach i e where these products are used to replace the estimation of rs from temperature eq 7 the resulting eto pmt lsa saf combining the use of ground temperature data with rs lsa saf eto pmt lsa saf revealed to be preferable relative to the use of ground temperature data only eto pmt and eto hs as well as to the use of the etref lsa saf product the results of the current study demonstrate for a wide range of climates and environmental conditions that rs lsa saf and rs era5 may be used accurately to compute eto when observation data sets are incomplete which consists of an innovative approach relative to the use of alternative equations and calculation procedures moreover when observed weather data are not available the etref lsa saf product proved to be a good alternative which is also an innovative approach relative to interpolating methods however a lower accuracy was observed in oceanic islands particularly for locations sited in high elevation characterized by highly changing cloudy conditions high air humidity and windy conditions throughout the year while proving the good usability of these lsa saf products and for the first time of the rs era5 product also identifies the need

10187,this study assesses the accuracy of estimating daily grass reference evapotranspiration pm eto using daily shortwave radiation rs and reference evapotranspiration etref products provided by the meteosat second generation msg geostationary satellite delivered by the satellite applications facility on land surface analysis lsa saf framework the accuracy of using reanalysis era5 shortwave radiation data rs era5 provided by the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf is also evaluated the assessments were performed using observed weather variables at 37 weather stations distributed across continental portugal where climate conditions range from semi arid to humid and 12 weather stations located in azores islands characterized by humid windy and often cloudy conditions this study s use of data from a variety of climate conditions contributed to a unique and innovative assessment of the usability of lsa saf and era5 products for eto estimation the first assessment focused on comparing lsa saf estimates of rs rs lsa saf against ground stations rs ground the results showed a good matching between the two rs data sets for continental portugal but a tendency for rs lsa saf to under estimate rs ground in the cloudy islands of azores eto values computed using rs lsa saf data and observed temperature humidity and wind speed eto lsa saf were then compared with pm eto estimates with ground based data which were used as benchmark input data of temperature and humidity needed for pm eto were quality checked for surface aridity effects it was observed that eto lsa saf is strongly correlated with pm eto r2 0 97 for most locations in continental portugal with regression coefficient of a linear regression forced to the origin ranging between 0 95 and 1 05 mean root mean square error rmse of 0 13 mm d 1 and nash and sutcliff efficiency of modeling ef above 0 95 for most azores locations eto lsa saf over estimated pm eto this is likely a consequence of the high spatio temporal heterogeneity of weather conditions that occur in these oceanic islands together with the different footprints of satellite averaged over the pixel and station observations reanalysis era5 shortwave radiation data presented similar behavior to the lsa saf products however with slightly lower accuracy the daily lsa saf etref product etref lsa saf was assessed and results have shown a good accuracy of this product with acceptable rmse and high ef values for continental portugal but a low accuracy for the azores islands a simplified bias correction approach was shown to improve both eto derived from the lsa saf products namely for azores stations which seem to be representative of smaller areas the use of the fao pm temperature approach pmt was also assessed using the rs lsa saf and rs era5 data which showed a superiority of the lsa saf product for eto estimations eto pmt lsa saf no significant differences p 0 05 were observed in terms of the median value of the rmse when adopting eto pmt and etref lsa saf differently results showed that using the rs lsa saf in the pmt approach eto pmt lsa saf produces significantly better rmse results than eto pmt and etref lsa saf overall the performed assessment allows concluding that the use of rs lsa saf and to a lesser extent the use of the rs era5 highly improves the accuracy of computation of eto when rs observations are not available including when only temperature data are accessible the use of the etref lsa saf product is a good alternative when observed weather data are not

1 introduction evapotranspiration is a key meteorological and hydrological variable particularly important in terms of the water cycle in basin water management to quantify the water balance from the field to the hydrological basin scales and in water resources planning and management for the diverse uses of water agricultural water management particularly irrigation management requires good knowledge of crop evapotranspiration etc namely aiming at improved water use performance and productivity coping with the ever increasing water scarcity and water saving thus addressing ongoing climate change challenges allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2009 2012 pereira 2017 fao56 allen et al 1998 aiming at improving the estimation of crop water requirements and defining irrigation scheduling modes propose to estimate crop et as etc kc eto where kc is the crop coefficient dimensionless and eto mm d 1 is the grass reference evapotranspiration eto represents the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and results from parameterizing the penman monteith combination equation for clipped grass allen et al 1998 pereira et al 1999 while the kc incorporates the main characteristics that distinguish each crop from the grass reference crop in terms of evapotranspiration updated reviews on kc are provided in various articles of this special issue pereira et al 2021a b as well as reviews on the estimation of etc and kc from remote sensing french et al 2020 pôças et al 2020 the grass reference evapotranspiration eto is defined as the rate of evapotranspiration from a hypothetical reference crop with an assumed crop height h equal to 0 12 m a fixed daily canopy resistance rs 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 closely resembling the evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height actively growing completely shading the ground and not short of water allen et al 1998 eto is computed with the fao penman monteith equation pm eto as discussed by allen

not freely available from the relevant meteorological services or available data sets may have large gaps or may be of poor quality due to insufficient maintenance of equipment and quality control furthermore the observations required to derive pm eto should be performed over well watered grass to avoid surface aridity errors allen et al 1998 then to cope with reduced and or inadequate data sets alternative et equations or computational approaches may be used approaches for computing eto with reduced weather data sets are reviewed and updated by paredes et al 2020 mainly the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 and the pm eto temperature approach pmt which have proved accurate for daily and monthly time steps and diverse climates and regions popova et al 2006

measurements an alternative source for shortwave radiation rs is the use of remotely sensed data such as those retrieved from geostationary satellites examples include the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri radiometers onboard the meteosat second generation msg satellites trigo et al 2011 ramírez cuesta et al 2018 or the radiances provided by the imager on board the geostationary operational environmental satellite goes liang et al 2010 inamdar and guillevic 2015 the satellite application facility on land surface analysis lsa saf is part of the european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat ground processing segment and is committed to process information on land surface variables from remote sensing currently the lsa saf uses observations provided by the geostationary system meteosat second generation msg as reviewed by trigo et al 2011 the main advantages of msg products include the monitoring of large areas of the earth at regular intervals of time furthermore the increasing number of satellite products that are freely available make these products a practical and cost effective means of gathering information over land surfaces for a wide range of applications including the nearly continuous assessment of vegetation state and water stress trigo et al 2011 the accuracy of remote sensing solar radiation products has been widely evaluated roerink et al 2012 bojanowski et al 2014 mokhtari et al 2018 ramírez cuesta et al 2018 however some constraints have been reported namely those referring to rapidly changing cloud sky conditions geiger et al 2008 macke et al 2010 cristóbal and anderson 2013 carrer et al 2019 accurate eto estimations were reported when combining the use of remotely sensed shortwave radiation with ground temperature observations bois et al 2008 cammalleri and ciraolo 2013 cruz blanco et al 2014 or with temperature data provided by reanalysis products de bruin et al 2010 2016 cruz blanco et al 2015 more recently the studies by trigo et al 2018 and de bruin and trigo 2019 reported on the very good accuracy of the reference evapotranspiration product provided by the lsa saf herein etref lsa saf when compared with eto obtained from lysimeter for sites under diverse climatic conditions reanalysis products are another important source of atmospheric variables namely shortwave radiation which are made available at various spatial resolutions and allowing high temporal sampling reanalysis has the advantage of providing consistent information that span along several decades good accuracy of eto estimations were reported when using reanalysis products such as era 40 ishak et al 2010 era interim boulard et al 2016 paredes et al 2018c both provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf or reanalysis products provided by the national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar srivastava et al 2013 2015 martins et al 2017 recently pelosi et al 2020 also reported on the good accuracy of two ecmwf reanalysis products the era5 land and the uerra mescan surfex used for estimating eto the present study aims at assessing the use of the lsa saf remote sensing rs product and of the ecmwf era5 reanalysis rs product for estimating daily eto when full data sets are not available the assessment is performed over a wide range of climate conditions including continental sites and oceanic islands the latter are characterized by frequent cloudy conditions with fast fluctuating broken cloud conditions high air humidity and windy conditions throughout the year the objectives of the study using full data pm eto eq 1 as a benchmark consists of assessing 1 the quality of the lsa saf remote sensing rs product rs lsa saf and of era5 reanalysis rs product rs era5 comparatively to local rs observations rs ground 2 the performance of daily pm eto estimates using rs lsa saf and rs era5 combined with ground based observations of tmax tmin rh and u2 3 the accuracy of the etref lsa saf without and with bias correction to adjust satellite based estimates to locally observed conditions 4 the performance of the fao pm temperature approach pmt when using temperature data and the rs lsa saf and rs era5 products the assessment of the usability of lsa saf and era5 products for eto estimation consists of an innovative approach when observation data sets are incomplete since the related calculation accuracy demonstrates that it is not only possible but appropriate to avoid the search for alternative et equations and computational procedures 2 overview on the geostationary meteosat second generation products 2 1 products the satellite application facility on land surface analysis lsa saf uses observations provided by the geostationary msg system and the eumetsat polar system eps to generate a suite of land surface variables that are made publicly available in near real time or offline the satellite products generated and distributed by the lsa saf are related to a the surface radiation budget parameters including the long and short wave surface fluxes the land surface temperature the albedo and the emissivity b vegetation products state stress and wildfires and c biophysical parameters including soil moisture and vegetation evapotranspiration the latter resulting from combining information on the radiation budget and vegetation state in addition a daily reference evapotranspiration product etref lsa saf is also made available in near real time and off line data available since 2004 to present the land surface variables provided by lsa saf are generated on a pixel by pixel basis the data are distributed on the original satellite geostationary projection for the whole msg disk encompassing africa most of europe and part of south america trigo et al 2011 geostationary platforms such as msg provide high frequency observations at moderate spatial resolution and are particularly useful to obtain variables with pronounced diurnal cycles such as shortwave radiation trigo et al 2011 carrer et al 2012 2 2 shortwave radiation rs lsa saf since 2004 the lsa saf has offered surface radiation budget related parameters and the dissemination at a regular basis after operational consolidation was performed in 2007 shortwave radiation at the surface is obtained from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager seviri radiometer onboard the msg with a spatial resolution between 3 and 5 km over africa and most of europe schmetz et al 2002 the lsa saf shortwave radiation products downwelling surface shortwave fluxes dssf lsa saf products are generated at high frequency every 30 min using data from the three solar spectrum channels of the seviri sensor centered on 0 6 0 8 and 1 6 µm as such the lsa saf operationally derives and distributes spatially continuous downward shortwave fluxes as 30 min instantaneous values or as daily averages trigo et al 2011 rs lsa saf data consists of the energy within the solar domain mostly within the 0 3 4 0 µm wavelength interval that reaches the earth s surface per surface unit per day eumetsat lsa saf has an internal quality control for each datum provided the quality indicator includes the number of missing slots within the corresponding 24 h period trigo et al 2011 the data may be acquired in near real time or off line http lsa saf eumetsat int shortwave radiation at the surface is inferred from cloud information obtained from msg observations taking into account that measured top of atmosphere toa reflectances in channels within the solar spectral domain visible and near infrared are anti correlated with the shortwave radiation reaching the surface under cloudy sky conditions the method proposed by gautier et al 1980 and brisson et al 1999 for the radiation transfer in the cloud atmosphere surface system is used the cloud transmittance and cloud albedo may present high variability at small time scales depending on the daily evolution of the clouds under cloudy conditions it is assumed that the whole image pixel is covered by a homogeneous cloud layer a full description of the algorithm is provided by geiger et al 2008 here we stress that the methodology may be applied to any satellite data with measurements at least in the visible bands nevertheless given the strong diurnal cycle of the shortwave radiation the accuracy of the daily values will be highly influenced by the temporal sampling the lsa saf estimations of solar irradiance at the surface have been thoroughly validated against in situ measurements revealing relative errors generally below 5 geiger et al 2008 carrer et al 2012 the actual product accuracy depends on retrieval conditions such as the amount and type of clouds geiger et al 2008 journée and bertrand 2010 cristóbal and anderson 2013 as well as on the uncertainty in aerosol loads ceamanos et al 2014 the impact of uncertainties in cloud coverage will be higher in the presence of broken clouds carrer et al 2019 as discussed by cristóbal and anderson 2013 topography may also affect remote sensing rs estimations with slightly higher estimation errors for hilly locations considering such variability we present here an assessment of the rs lsa saf product for a set of in situ observations over both mainland portugal and the azores islands covering a wide range of conditions focus is placed on the impact of shortwave radiation uncertainties on estimates of grass reference evapotranspiration 2 3 reference evapotranspiration etref lsa saf considering that evapotranspiration over the reference surface is not water limited eto will be essentially controlled by rs as the main source of external energy driving the atmospheric evaporative demand trigo et al 2011 2018 de bruin et al 2016 de bruin and trigo 2019 therefore most methods to estimate eto will require reliable observations or estimations of rs however we are often faced with cases where rs observations are either not available or they are sparsely distributed or measured by poorly maintained instruments which then may lead to substantial measurement errors wild 2009 urraca et al 2018 thus to overcome the quality of data as well as the lack of continuous measurements the etref lsa saf product is based upon a thermodynamical model combined with an atmospheric boundary layer model etref lsa saf is calculated from the daily rs lsa saf product and from the daily air temperature at 2 m obtained from the operational forecasts provided by the ecmwf through the claussius clapeyron equation following the algorithm described by de bruin et al 2016 for this reason etref lsa saf is not affected by local factors such as aridity or local advection since the main driver for its estimation is global radiation de bruin et al 2016 de bruin and trigo 2019 the etref lsa saf is generated daily and made available at pixel size for the whole seviri msg disk almost at real time air temperature data at 2 m data are provided at 3 hourly ecmwf forecasts with a resolution of about 9 km which were linearly interpolated in time to hourly ones and bi linearly interpolated in space to the seviri msg resolution the air temperature values underwent a further adjustment to correct differences between ecmwf model surface orography and the finer scale seviri pixel altitude using a constant slope rate of 0 0067 ºc m 1 de bruin et al 2010 a detailed description of ecmwf data is provided by owens and hewson 2018 as previously presented etref lsa saf was validated against in situ eto measurements performed over well watered grass using eddy covariance and lysimeters collected over sites with different climates and characteristics the validation of the etref lsa saf product presents overall very good accuracy especially for sites which are not affected by advection or aridity in accordance with the definition of eto cruz blanco et al 2014 de bruin et al 2016 trigo et al 2018 de bruin and trigo 2019 3 the reference crop evapotranspiration the computation of the daily grass reference evapotranspiration pm eto eq 1 was performed using the procedures proposed by allen et al 1998 for daily time steps it writes 1 bis et o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34

the psychometric constant kpa c 1 the daily soil heat flux g was assumed to be null because its value beneath a dense grass canopy is very small allen et al 1998 therefore the daily net balance of energy available at the grass canopy reduces to the net radiation rn computed as the difference between the net shortwave radiation rns mj m 2 d 1 and the net long wave radiation rnl mj m 2 d 1 rn rns rnl rns is computed as the difference between the incoming solar radiation rs mj m 2 d 1 and the reflected shortwave solar radiation thus rns rs 1 α where α is the albedo of the surface with α 0 23 for the grass reference surface as assumed in the definition of eto allen et al 1998 the net long wave radiation rnl mj m 2 d 1 is obtained from the balance between the outgoing and incoming longwave

speed data was adjusted to the standard height of 2 m using the logarithmic wind speed profile proposed in fao56 allen et al 1998 in the fao pm temperature approach pmt air temperature is used as estimator of ea and rs allen et al 1998 as recommended by allen et al 1998 to compute ea it was assumed that tdew could be acceptably estimated from tmin using a correction factor at 0 to 3 ºc depending upon the aridity of the site thus with tdew tmin at the aridity of the site was estimated using the unep aridity index ai unep 1997 defined as the ratio between the long term averages of the annual precipitation and the annual potential climatic et pet thornthwaite 1948 this approach has been tested for several climates and locations as reviewed by paredes et al 2020 thus ea was estimated

pereira 2013 todorovic et al 2013 ren et al 2016 paredes et al 2018a c paredes and pereira 2019 in the pmt approach the predictive rs equation of hargreaves and samani 1985 was used as proposed by allen et al 1998 and recently discussed by paredes and pereira 2019 this equation assumes rs as a linear function of the square root of the daily temperature differences td tmax tmin thus 7 r s k r s t max t min 0 5 r a where krs is an empirical radiation adjustment coefficient c 0 5 and ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m2 d 1 the krs coefficient varies with the atmospheric conditions of the location which impact the availability of shortwave solar radiation at the surface allen et al 1998 previous studies have related the variation of krs with the climate dryness wetness as well as with wind speed raziei and pereira 2013 ren et al 2016 paredes et al 2018a 2020 paredes and pereira 2019 other factors which influence the krs values include the elevation of the site allen 1997 and the distance to large water bodies hargreaves and samani 1985 allen et al 1998 the reported increase of krs values in areas close to large water bodies namely the ocean relative to inland locations may be the consequence of the combined effect of air moisture and wind speed prevailing in coastal areas to ease the use of eq 7 without requiring local calibration of krs paredes and pereira 2019 and paredes et al 2020 adopted multi linear regression equations to estimate krs using long time averages of td rh and u2 characterizing the site thus krs used herein was obtained using these equations the u2 default estimator used in the present study was the local u2 average u2 avg the hargreaves samani hs eto equation hargreaves and samani 1985 is also commonly used when only temperature data are available this equation may be written as 8 et o hs 0 0135 k rs r a λ t max t min 0 5 t mean 17 8 where eto hs corresponds to the daily grass reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 tmax tmin and tmean are respectively the maximum minimum and mean daily temperature c λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 krs is the empirical radiation adjustment coefficient c 0 5 ra is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 d 1 0 0135 is a factor for conversion of units from the american to the international system and 17 8 is an empirical factor related to temperature units used in the original formulations the krs radiation adjustment coefficient used in the hs equation eq 8 is similar to the one used in the pmt approach and therefore varies with climate paredes et al 2020 also developed a simple procedure to parameterize the eto hs equation by estimating krs from long time averages of td rh and u2 characterizing the site which is used in the present study 4 data 4 1 ground based data daily weather data sets were collected across continental portugal from 37 weather stations 22 maintained by the portuguese institute for sea and atmosphere ipma and 15 by the operative and technological center for irrigation cotr the azores daily datasets used in the present study refer to 12 weather stations located in eight islands which are in charge of various regional institutions the following observations are available maximum and minimum air temperatures tmax and tmin c measured at 2 m height relative humidity at 2 m height rh shortwave radiation rs mj m 2 d 1 and wind speed at the standard height of 2 m u2 m s 1 in cases where wind speed data were measured with instruments placed above 2 m a logarithmic wind speed profile allen et al 1998 was used rh were available as daily averages rhmean in the case of ipma and as maximum and minimum daily values rhmax rhmin in other locations the various weather stations sites are located within regions in continental portugal characterized by diverse climate conditions ranging from semi arid to humid the climate in the azores islands is humid cloudy and windy typical for oceanic islands and shows a great time and space variability of solar radiation due to variable cloudiness the location of continental portugal and the archipelago of azores is presented in fig 1 the weather stations used in the study are listed in table 1 and their locations are depicted in fig 2 most of these stations were used in previous studies of rs estimations and to assess eto computations either with reduced datasets teixeira et al 2008 paredes et al 2018a b 2020 paredes and pereira 2019 or with data derived from era interim reanalysis paredes et al 2018c available information suggested that the selected weather stations could be considered as reference sites as recommended by allen et al 1998 qa qc for all observed data sets was performed using the guidelines described by allen 1996 to further ensure the appropriateness of data quality an analysis of the lower quartile q1 the median q2 and the upper quartile q3 the minimum and maximum values as well as the search for outliers was performed for all locations and all weather variables additionally a quality check for surface aridity effects was performed using temperature and humidity data 4 2 remote sensing data extraction and processing procedures spatial sampling of the daily rs lsa saf and etref lsa saf products is 4 to 5 km over continental portugal and the azores data were extracted from the msg pixels that were nearest to the given meteorological station location because the daily lsa saf estimations of both rs lsa saf and etref lsa saf rely on retrievals of instantaneous solar radiation performed every 30 min days with more than five missing slots out of a total of 48 slots were removed from the analysis performed here this procedure aims to ensure that only rs lsa saf and etref lsa saf estimates with a minimum of observation gaps were used the missing 30 min slots may occur for several reasons most notably a failure of the data acquisition system or in the algorithm processing system on average less than 10 of days were removed due to missing over five 30 min slots the maximum percentage of missing values from individual stations was reached in miranda do douro 22 relative to the period of 2010 2013 from 2015 on the number of missing 30 min slots is residual and gaps on both rs and etref lsa saf data sets represent less than 2 4 3 shortwave radiation reanalysis data the era5 is the most recent reanalysis dataset provided by the ecmwf which replaced the previous era interim by august 2019 era5 data span from 1979 to present and are made available on regular grids with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 latitude longitude corresponding to an approximately uniform spacing of 31 km hersbach et al 2018 2019 era5 is based on the integrated forecasting system ifs cycle 41r2 which was the ecmwf s model version used for operational forecasts in 2016 era5 further innovates from era interim including an hourly forecast the era5 dataset includes a very wide range of atmospheric and surface variables including incoming solar radiation at the surface which is used in this study the solar radiation product rs era5 is estimated taking into account total solar irradiance ozone and greenhouse gases profiles model clouds and aerosols developed for the world climate research programme wcrp initiative cmip5 including stratospheric sulfate aerosols hersbach et al 2019 era5 reanalysis products are operationally generated with a 5 day latency further information on era5 is provided by hersbach et al 2018 2019 in the present study the nearest grid points to the station location were considered for retrieving and cumulating the data on hourly global solar radiation at the surface w m 2 5 procedures for assessing the quality of estimates and bias correction several goodness of fit indicators were used for assessing the performance of the diverse approaches in representing the amplitude and time variation of eto estimations when using observations the accuracy assessment focused on the pairwise comparison between measured rs or eto obtained from ground observed weather values oi and the corresponding predicted values pi through the various estimation processes assessed thus to verify the similarity between oi and pi the following set of indicators were used as in previous applications martins et al 2017 paredes and pereira 2019 i the regression coefficient b0 of a linear regression forced to the origin fto which is an overall constant of proportionality between observation and predicted values and often interpreted as a measure of bias with b0 1 suggesting under estimation and b0 1 over estimation thus considering a target value b0 1 0 ii the coefficient of determination r2 of the ordinary least squares regression ols that assesses the dispersion of pairs oi and pi along the regression line i e indicates how close are the predicted and the observed variables where r2 1 0 is maximum agreement iii the root mean square error rmse mm d 1 which is an overall measurement of the differences between observed and predicted values iv the normalized rmse nrmse defined as the ratio between rmse and the mean of observations o and consists of a non dimensional measure of the relative error of estimate and v the nash and sutcliff 1970 efficiency of modeling ef which measures the relative magnitude of the mean square error mse rmse2 relative to the observed data variance σ legates and mccabe jr 1999 with an ef value of 1 0 indicating perfect efficiency contrarily negative ef values indicate that the fitting is poor and that there is no advantage in using the predicted values pi instead of the mean of observed values oi the non parametric wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test wilcoxon 1945 conover 1999 was used to assess when the approaches used for eto estimation were significantly different p 0 05 in terms of the median value of rmse this test was selected because rmse data series did not follow a normal distribution this test has been previously used to compare the relative performance of various hydrologic modeling approaches including for reanalysis corrections in eto estimations ricard and anctil 2019 due to the impact of cloud coverage rapidly changing in space and time such as in the cloudy and rainy region of the azores islands a bias correction of the rs lsa saf could be required badescu and dumitrescu 2013 polo et al 2016 due to the eto dependency on rs a bias correction could also be required for the etref lsa saf product the objective of the bias correction is to reduce the differences between the satellite derived values which are representative of a given pixel of the order of 4 5 4 5 km2 over the azores and the observed rs the bias correction procedure may be applied directly to eto using etref lsa saf and eto computed with ground full data several studies reported on the inaccuracies of satellite derived rs particularly under non clear sky conditions e g guidard et al 2011 and in island conditions mazorra aguiar et al 2019 despite improvements on the removal of systematic errors prior to assimilation in the present study a simplified bias correction scheme was used for operational purposes however because rs lsa saf is used to compute etref lsa saf the bias correction procedure was preferably applied to etref lsa saf instead of rs lsa saf product several bias correction methods have been used and assessed for various rs satellite products journée and bertrand 2010 badescu and dumitrescu 2013 polo et al 2015 2016 kambezidis et al 2016 given that the etref lsa saf product is still fairly recent bias correction studies have not been reported yet in the present study the bias correction procedure consisted in dividing each data set relative to each targeted location into two subsets of the same size separated in time the more distant set of data was used for training and the more recent one was kept for validation thus the correction parameters were obtained from the training data set and the same correction parameters were used with the validation set the simplified bias correction used in several applications of remote sensing and reanalysis data e g polo et al 2015 2016 paredes et al 2018c mazorra aguiar et al 2019 consists of the difference between the fitted line ysatellite a xground b and the y x line thus the daily corrected estimates are 9 y new t y satellite a 1 x ground b the assessment of the performance of the bias correction procedure was performed for the validation sets 6 results and discussion 6 1 comparing lsa saf and era5 shortwave radiation products rs lsa saf and rs era5 with ground observations for continental portugal rs lsa saf data are in close agreement with rs ground data as per the results of the goodness of fit indicators fig 3 the values of the regression coefficient b0 range from 0 96 to 1 06 with 95 of values in the interval 0 95 1 05 with only two locations presenting values above 1 05 the mean b0 is 1 02 which indicates that rs lsa saf tends to be only slightly greater than rs ground the coefficients of determination are very high with most locations 84 having values above 0 95 and only two locations with r2 0 90 fig 3 the normalized rmse is smaller than 10 for most locations 73 of cases averaging 9 2 with a standard deviation of 4 3 nrmse 20 refers to only one weather station the efficiency of modeling ef is larger than 0 80 for all cases and is above 0 95 for 78 of cases these results indicate that the values of rs lsa saf are similar or very similar to those observed in the continental weather stations lower goodness of fit indicators refer to a weather station located in higher altitude guarda thus in agreement with results of other studies reporting lower accuracy for hilly locations cristóbal and anderson 2013 gómez et al 2016 it can therefore be concluded that rs lsa saf data may be used with high accuracy throughout continental portugal the goodness of fit results comparing rs era5 with rs ground data in continental portugal are worse than those shown for rs lsa saf fig 3 likely due to the higher heterogeneity of weather conditions within the larger pixels of era5 31 km for era5 vs 5 km for lsa saf which reduces the ability to estimate point site rs values data in fig 3 shows that the frequency of b0 1 05 is larger for rs era5 comparatively to rs lsa saf thus indicating a greater trend for over estimation however most of r2 values are in the range 0 80 0 90 the nrmse values are higher than 15 for all cases fig 3 with nrmse averaging 22 and the majority of cases having nrmse 20 for all cases ef 0 90 however with most weather stations having ef ranging from 0 80 to 0 90 the spatial distribution of the goodness of fit indicators relative to rs lsa saf throughout continental portugal is homogeneous contrarily to rs era5 fig 3 likely this difference depends upon the pixel size of both grids although era5 is a state of the art global reanalysis its spatial resolution of about 31 km 31 km is much greater than that of msg lsa saf derived products of about 5 km 5 km which implies that era5 products will perform less well particularly over regions where the spatial variability of factors influencing solar radiation at the surface most notably cloud coverage is high results show that the locations where rs era5 tends to over estimate rs ground b0 1 05 and r2 is smaller are located in northern coastal area where the weather variability is larger and cloudiness is more frequent and variable than in inland and southern locations it results that higher nrmse are also found in northern coastal locations where ef shows smaller values overall the goodness of fit indicators are reasonably good thus suggesting that rs era5 data are also adequate to be used in the absence of rs observations the superiority of rs provided by msg relative to reanalysis products was also reported in other studies e g bojanowski et al 2014 ramirez camargo and dorner 2016 and urraca et al 2017 the application of lsa saf and era5 products to the azores islands faces a large variability of both the cloud coverage and the respective dynamic influences as well as the presence of low clouds azevedo et al 1999 magarreiro et al 2014 remillard and tselioud 2015 mechem et al 2018 which may contribute to increased differences between station and pixel rs estimates indeed high winds and scattered and broken clouds contribute to less favorable conditions for satellite observation of solar radiation geiger et al 2008 journée and bertrand 2010 macke et al 2010 cristóbal and anderson 2013 carrer et al 2019 in addition palmer et al 2018 reported higher errors of estimates for locations more distant to the satellite grid point and with elevation due to those weather conditions and to the greater difficulty of having accurate rs ground observations in windy and cloudy areas the goodness of fit indicators for azores were not as good as those for continental portugal b0 1 05 are often observed for both rs lsa saf and rs era5 fig 4 thus indicating that both rs products generally over estimate rs ground r2 0 90 for rs lsa saf and r2 0 70 values for rs era5 indicate that the usability of these rs values is less adequate in azores than in continental portugal due to the referred high variability of weather conditions mainly related with clouds dynamics the nrmse values are generally high averaging 31 for rs lsa saf and 41 in case of rs era5 low ef were obtained in azores fig 4 particularly relative to rs era5 thus indicating a reduced gain in its use in azores contrarily to continental portugal the spatial distribution of the goodness of fit indicators in azores fig 4 shows that the more favorable results of both rs lsa saf and rs era5 occurred in low altitude coastal locations where the variability of rs ground is smaller as it is the case of most locations of the western and central islands groups differently goodness of fit results are worse for weather stations located in elevation and slopes exposed to the wet winds which is typically the case for santa bárbara terceira central group fig 4 that station is located in high elevation table 1 and has very cloudy and windy conditions with occult horizontal precipitation equaling the vertical rainfall fontes et al 2006 thus where in situ radiation measurements are hampered by the frequent deposition of fog results for santa bárbara indicate that there is no gain in using rs era5 and a reduced gain in using rs lsa saf thus it is likely that using both gridded rs products as estimators of rs values are questionable for high elevation cloudy and windy areas where broken and low clouds impacts are large a study applied to the oceanic islands of canarias using msg products also reported high errors of estimation of rs under high cloud conditions particularly in higher altitudes mazorra aguiar et al 2019 similar findings relative to high elevation and cloudiness conditions were reported for the corsica island in the mediterranean sea voyant et al 2014 fig 5 shows the variability of the goodness of fit indicators using a box and whiskers plot it shows that the results for continental portugal and azores islands are very different for both rs lsa saf and rs era5 the interquartile ranges of the continental locations show to be much smaller than those of the azores islands which is associated with the high variability of weather conditions observed in the islands stations coherently the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the indicators is also much smaller in continental portugal both the interquartile ranges and the differences between the maximum and minimum values are also smaller for the rs lsa saf product fig 5 also shows that there is a non symmetric distribution of the indicator values which is particularly notable in the azores islands a highly critical aspect in comparing rs products with observations in islands refers to the footprint sizes with that of the weather station much smaller than that of the nearest msg or era5 pixel over highly heterogeneous terrain namely hilly terrains of high altitude the area integrated values obtained from satellite observations or from model estimates as in the case of era5 may differ much from in situ observations this fact may contribute to explain the high b0 and nrmse values for weather stations located in high and sloping fields e g previously referred cases of santa bárbara ribeirinha and granja in terceira island furnas in s miguel and maia in s maria fig 4 particularly referring to era5 products consequently ranges of goodness of fit indicators for the weather stations of azores are quite large since the dispersion of estimates is large ranges of indicators for continental portugal are much smaller than for azores fig 5 the nrmse results analyzed above generally agree with those reported in other studies using msg products for two regions of france one having a climate influenced by the atlantic ocean and the other a mediterranean climate bois et al 2008 reported average nrmse of 20 and 14 respectively thus showing higher values when clouds are more frequent and variable for catalonia spain cristóbal and anderson 2013 reported nrmse averaging 17 for cloudy and hilly locations in contrast with nrmse averaging 6 under clear sky and flat areas bojanowski et al 2014 assessed the accuracy of rs lsa saf product for europe reporting an average nrmse of 16 54 7 73 however ranging approximately 10 15 for locations in continental portugal and ranging 15 20 or 20 30 for locations in northern england and ireland thus with higher cloudiness for andalusia region spain cruz blanco et al 2014 reported nrmse values below 10 for summer thus mostly under clear sky and values averaging 11 5 for the winter months thus suggesting the influence of increased clouds occurrence and variability for the lerma valley argentina ramirez camargo and dorner 2016 studied the impacts of cloud conditions on the accuracy of rs satellite derived products reporting nrmse averaging 33 and 12 under cloud and clear sky conditions respectively urraca et al 2017 for central spain thus for conditions where cloudiness is low reported good accuracy of rs satellite derived products with nrmse averaging 8 3 thus the reported nrmse results confirm the favorable assessment of both rs products for continental portugal and support interpretations of less good results obtained for the oceanic islands of azores considering the results discussed above it may be concluded that both rs lsa saf and rs era5 are good to very good estimates of rs for continental portugal however should be used with caution when cloudiness and clouds variability and wind highly influence the climate of the site both rs lsa saf and rs era5 are less accurate estimates of rs in case of the azores islands however depending upon local variability of weather conditions their accuracy is quite acceptable for low altitude and less cloudy locations nevertheless when rs lsa saf and rs era5 are used to compute the pm eto different conditions and associated accuracies need to be considered as discussed in the following sections 6 2 and 6 4 6 2 computing the pm eto with rs lsa saf and rs era5 the assessment of rs lsa saf and rs era5 products performed in the previous section justify their use to compute the pm eto eq 1 when ground observed temperature air humidity and wind speed are available their goodness of fit indicators for continental portugal and the azores islands are presented in figs 6 and 7 respectively however instead of using the nrmse indicator to assess the accuracy of the rs lsa saf and rs era5 products the rmse values were used since they are better suited for comparing the performance of the different approaches used for eto estimations as it is commonly adopted in the literature as discussed before the goodness of fit indicators should be used having in mind the differences in the footprint of the weather stations relative to the grid pixel of both the msg satellite and the reanalysis the latter much larger it was assumed that all weather stations satisfy reference site conditions allen et al 1998 particularly that observations of air temperature and humidity were performed over a grass crop as already mentioned earlier and reported by paredes et al 2020 the goodness of fit indicators from comparing the pm eto values computed with the rs lsa saf and rs era5 products combined with observed temperature air humidity and wind speed respectively eto lsa saf and eto era5 with pm eto computed with full data sets observed at various weather stations of continental portugal are shown in fig 6 the b0 values relative to eto lsa saf are close to 1 0 for all locations while there are a few cases indicating a slight over estimation for eto era5 mainly for weather stations located in coastal areas where the weather variability is higher the r2 average is very high and its standard deviation sd is small 0 99 0 01 for eto lsa saf and 0 97 0 02 for eto era5 thus indicating that for all locations these predicted values are close to the pm eto computed with observed full data sets rmse are small particularly for eto lsa saf which average 0 13 0 04 mm d 1 and has the majority of cases below 0 20 mm d 1 for the era5 products the average rmse is higher 0 34 0 06 mm d 1 but nevertheless small and most locations have rmse 0 30 mm d 1 coherently with the previously referred indicators ef are very high when using both rs products averaging 0 99 and 0 96 for eto lsa saf and eto era5 respectively the spatial distribution of rmse for eto lsa saf is homogeneous and that of eto era5 shows that the lower values occur inland and in southern areas where weather conditions are less variable and cloudiness is less frequent eto lsa saf shows superior results relative to eto era5 thus in accordance with the results obtained for the rs products analyzed in the precedent section as expected from the analysis relative to rs in the precedent section the goodness of fit results for both eto lsa saf and eto era5 applied to the azores islands fig 7 are inferior to those relative to continental portugal for both eto lsa saf and eto era5 b0 1 05 in half of the locations which indicates a trend for over estimation of eto when using the rs products thus following similar over estimation tendency relative to rs r2 values are generally high being greater than 0 90 for eto lsa saf for most locations thus showing that modeled eto lsa saf are close to eto computed with observed data for most stations fig 7 differently for eto era5 predicted and observed eto are less close despite r2 0 80 for most locations which likely is due to the previously referred large size of the reanalysis pixel with the consequent lower ability in capturing the heterogeneity of the weather conditions particularly under highly variable cloud conditions most rmse values are low 0 35 mm d 1 in case of eto lsa saf and 0 50 mm d 1 for eto era5 larger rmse values are observed for eto lsa saf in four locations and in five locations for eto era5 ef values mostly exceed 0 80 with only three locations having ef 0 80 in case of eto lsa saf but five in case of eto era5 as expected all weather stations having worse goodness of fit indicators are located in high elevation and in windy slopes the spatial distribution of the goodness of fit follows those relative to rs however with b0 closer to 1 0 higher r2 and ef and reduced rmse these more favorable results are due to the fact that eto does not depend only on rs but from the combined effects of all weather variables therefore it results that eto lsa saf and eto era5 mainly the former are usable with high accuracy for the locations of low altitude and with acceptable accuracy for stations located in hilly areas where the influence of clouds is major the distribution of the goodness of fit indicators data into quartiles fig 8 shows a narrower range of variation of indicators relative to both eto lsa saf and eto era5 when compared with the ranges relative to the same rs products fig 5 for both continental portugal and azores islands these results indicate that both eto lsa saf and eto era5 are highly accurate despite the low accuracy of the rs lsa saf and rs era5 products used for their computation with eq 1 anyway for the azores islands the interquartile range and the skewness of the distributions of the indicators are larger than for continental portugal results in fig 8 support the appropriateness for using rs from lsa saf or secondarily from era5 in both studied regions despite less accurate eto estimates in the azores islands the era5 product has the advantage relative to lsa saf of the continuity of the data sets while the latter may present gaps however eto era5 can be used for gap filling of the missing eto lsa saf data sets because a very high association between eto lsa saf and eto era5 values exists results from the linear regression between eto lsa saf and eto era5 were assessed for both continental portugal and azores islands respectively eto era5 1 02 eto lsa saf with r2 0 98 and eto era5 0 98 eto lsa saf with r2 0 92 therefore the usability of eto era5 for gap filling of the eto lsa saf data series may be assumed accurate including for the azores islands few studies are available relative to the use of rs products for eto calculation when other than rs variables are observed this is the case of the study by bois et al 2008 where eto lsa saf were compared with full data pm eto resulting in rmse ranging 0 21 0 25 mm d 1 thus within the range of values obtained for eto lsa saf in continental portugal 0 09 0 38 mm d 1 the rmse results obtained in the current study are better or much better than those reported in literature relative to estimating eto when rs is predicted from temperature data eq 7 including when the krs coefficient is locally calibrated for bulgaria popova et al 2006 reported rmse ranging from 0 18 to 0 32 mm d 1 whereas jabloun and sahli 2008 reported on rmse values ranging from 0 34 to 0 44 mm d 1 for continental dry climate locations of tunisia trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 referred rmse ranging from 0 10 to 0 23 mm d 1 for serbia sentelhas et al 2010 reported rmse averaging 0 70 mm d 1 while kwon and choi 2011 reported rmse averaging 0 27 mm d 1 for the korea peninsula using worldwide monthly weather data almorox and grieser 2016 reported rmse ranging 0 33 1 22 mm d 1 with an average of 0 85 mm d 1 using a simplified approach to derive krs for continental portugal paredes et al 2020 reported an average rmse 0 36 mm d 1 while the current rmse average is 0 13 mm d 1 comparing rmse obtained in the current study with those referred above it may be concluded that the use of rs lsa saf to compute the pm eto when rs data is not available leads to very accurate computations of pm eto few studies are available applied to islands environments paredes et al 2018b reported for the azores islands rmse ranging 0 33 0 58 mm d 1 while paredes et al 2020 reported rmse averaging 0 52 mm d 1 in the current study rmse values relative to eto lsa saf range 0 19 0 71 mm d 1 and average 0 41 mm d 1 with most values smaller than 0 35 mm d 1 it may be concluded that the use of rs lsa saf to compute the pm eto is advisable for azores particularly for weather stations located at low elevation where the frequency and variability of cloud cover is not high 6 3 using the lsa saf reference evapotranspiration product etref lsa saf when ground observations are not available the reference evapotranspiration etref lsa saf is a main product of lsa saf available almost at real time which does not require ground observed weather data to assess its usability it was compared with the pm eto eq 1 computed with full data sets of ground observed variables for continental portugal and the azores islands the frequency of distribution of the respective goodness of fit indicators are presented in table 2 and the variability of those indicators is shown in fig 9 when a simple bias correction is or is not applied the spatial distribution of the goodness of fit indicators relative to such comparisons follows those in figs 6 and 7 and are presented as supplementary material figs s1 and s2 for most stations of continental portugal etref lsa saf raw shows a tendency to under estimate pm eto with b0 0 95 in most locations table 2 that under estimation mainly occurs in the southern and inland areas of the country which are marked by a dry climate fig s1 r2 values are generally above 0 90 thus indicating that etref lsa saf values are close to pm eto used as benchmark however the average rmse exceeds 0 50 mm d 1 for most locations 68 of cases with a mean value of 0 70 0 30 mm d 1 table 2 ef values are in general above 0 80 thus showing that the magnitude of the mean square error is smaller or much smaller than the variance of pm eto these results for rmse are in line with those presented by trigo et al 2018 and de bruin and trigo 2019 these authors argued that etref lsa saf assumes that advection effects are absent from the reference surface see pereira et al 1999 and therefore yields lower estimates than pm eto for stations located in dry and hot conditions e g summer months in évora and portalegre for azores results are worse than for continental portugal differently from the latter an over estimation with b0 1 05 is observed in nearly half of locations r2 is low r2 0 80 and rmse values exceed 0 50 mm d 1 in all cases consistently ef values are lower or much lower than for continental portugal this denotes the impact of clouds cover and variability of weather conditions the box and whiskers plot fig 9 shows a very large range of indicators values thus a wide distribution of the values of the goodness of fit indicators particularly in the azores islands to be noted all indicators show a skewed distribution with the lower values of the indicators generally pulling down the mean values relative to the median values the extreme values of r2 rmse and ef in azores show a wide range of scores these results show that the use of the raw etref lsa saf product when climatic data is missing should be performed with caution to improve the usability of etref lsa saf for both continental portugal and azores islands a simplified bias correction was considered section 5 and eq 9 despite it can only be performed when a set of observations are available as expected the fit results generally improved table 2 decreasing the under estimation trends in continental portugal with reducing to 32 4 the number of locations where b0 0 95 and decreasing the over estimation trend in azores with decreasing to 8 3 the number of locations where b0 1 05 observing results for the validation data set table 2 it may be noted that the benefit of bias correction over continental portugal improves b0 values in all sites therefore the proximity of etref lsa saf and pm eto becomes higher r2 results are also improved with r2 0 90 in most locations in addition the average rmse decreases from 0 70 mm d 1 to 0 61 mm d 1 and the number of cases with rmse 0 65 mm d 1 increases from 51 to 62 there is a gain but it may not justify the operational adoption of a bias correction instead of using the raw etref lsa saf product in the case of the azores the bias correction largely reduces the over estimation of eto the number of occurrences in the b0 interval 0 95 1 05 increases from 8 3 to 75 and r2 values become larger than 0 80 for half of the locations thus increasing the proximity between etref lsa saf and pm eto rmse become smaller with rmse 0 65 mm d 1 for most locations and its average decreasing from 0 74 0 19 mm d 1 to 0 62 0 12 mm d 1 the ef values also improve with ef 0 70 for 49 of locations without occurring negative ef values the spread of the distribution of the goodness of fit values decreases for both continental portugal and azores fig 9 the average values of the goodness of fit indicators become closer to the median value due to the decrease of the extreme values of the indicators nevertheless the differences between etref lsa saf and pm eto remain high these differences may be due to uncertainties in this lsa saf product mainly over the azores islands and to uncertainties of in situ observations which are affected by the prevailing climatic conditions moreover it should be stressed that the sampling footprint differences between the satellite and the weather stations strongly influence the outcomes especially for the highly heterogeneous island areas with their specific environmental conditions and frequent changes in clouds and wind that uncertainty and high rmse values are particularly important for weather stations located above 500 m e g s bárbara where fog precipitation represents about 50 of total precipitation 6 4 estimating eto with reduced data sets using temperature data and using the rs lsa saf and rs era5 products the rs lsa saf and rs era5 products were used to compute eto with the pmt approach in combination with observed temperature to estimate the actual vapor pressure eq 6 and the default wind speed u2 avg section 3 and paredes et al 2020 eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 respectively their accuracy was assessed in comparison with pm eto eq 1 computed with full observed data the assessment was further performed through their comparison with the pmt approach where only observed temperature data were used the eto pmt where rs is estimated with eq 7 the frequency distribution of the goodness of fit indicators relative to assess eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 are presented in table 3 results for continental portugal show that for both estimation procedures the majority of the b0 values range 0 95 1 05 with the mean b0 1 01 and 1 02 respectively for eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 thus indicating no trend for over or under estimation the r2 values are high all above 0 80 and the average r2 are 0 94 0 02 and 0 92 0 03 for eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 respectively thus suggesting that predicted values are close to the pm eto values for both approaches the majority of locations show a small rmse 0 65 mm d 1 eto pmt lsa saf outperforms eto pmt era5 with an average rmse of 0 52 0 12 mm d 1 while eto pmt era5 has an average rmse of 0 62 0 12 mm d 1 the ef values are high with ef 0 90 in 87 of locations for eto pmt lsa saf and 62 2 in case of eto pmt era5 thus results show the high accuracy of using the pmt approach with both rs products preferably with rs lsa saf for the azores islands results vary with the environmental conditions of the location as referred above when analyzing the accuracy of rs products i e with the variability and intensity of clouds cover wind speed and elevation spatial distribution shown in fig s4 in supplementary material an under estimation trend is apparent for both eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 with half of locations presenting a b0 within the interval 0 70 0 95 table 3 as a result of the larger variability of weather conditions r2 values are lower than for continental portugal most locations have r2 in the range 0 70 0 90 in case of eto pmt lsa saf and ranging 0 60 0 80 for eto pmt era5 the rmse values for eto pmt lsa saf are generally below 0 65 mm d 1 table 3 with an average rmse of 0 62 0 12 mm d 1 which suggest an acceptable error of estimate differently for eto pmt era5 due to the effect of a much large pixel size the rmse values fall in the interval 0 65 1 00 mm d 1 for most locations with a mean of 0 72 0 08 mm d 1 therefore errors are larger but of reasonable size when using the lsa saf product the ef values are in the interval 0 50 0 90 for all locations whilst using the era5 product ef values fall in the interval 0 50 0 70 for most locations these positive ef values indicate that the error of estimates is reasonably smaller than the variance of the pm eto values however there is not a clear advantage in using rs products of lsa saf and era5 with the pmt approach particularly era5 for the azores eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 were compared with the pmt approach computed with observed temperature only eto pmt with actual vapor pressure computed with eq 6 rs estimated with eq 7 and the default u2 avg and the hargreaves samani equation eto hs eq 8 the krs values used in eqs 7 and 8 were computed with the global equation defined by paredes et al 2020 results in table 3 for continental portugal show that the b0 values for eto pmt commonly range 0 95 1 05 averaging 0 98 while the eto hs tends to under estimate pm eto in most locations with b0 averaging 0 93 for both approaches the r2 values are high with most values above 0 80 the average rmse are 0 66 0 12 mm d 1 for eto pmt and 0 64 0 13 mm d 1 for eto hs however differences in median rmse for the pmt and hs approaches were not significant p 0 05 for azores both pmt and hs approaches show an under estimation tendency with b0 ranging 0 85 0 95 for most locations r2 generally range from 0 60 to 0 80 and rmse values mostly range from 0 65 to 0 80 mm d 1 differences in median rmse in azores were also not significant p 0 05 the dispersion of the goodness of fit indicators values is presented in fig 10 as expected due to the large variability of weather conditions results in azores show a higher spread for most indicators this behavior is evidenced when contrasting the mean and median of all indicators with those for continental portugal in the azores islands the mean b0 values are quite similar for all approaches but the use of the lsa saf and era5 products lead to a wider interquartile range which reflects the climatic impacts on rs discussed in section 6 1 differences among approaches observed in terms of r2 are small for continental portugal but the interquartile range and the differences between the maximum and minimum r2 values are wider for eto pmt lsa saf than for other approaches in azores results also show that for all the eto pmt approaches the rmse have similar mean and median values in both continental portugal and azores islands the interquartile ranges for ef are quite narrow particularly for continental portugal comparing for continental portugal table 4 the goodness of fit results of eto pmt lsa saf and eto pmt era5 with the temperature methods eto pmt and eto hs there is evidence of the superiority of eto pmt lsa saf in capturing the variability of the weather conditions and therefore producing better fittings the second best approach is the eto pmt era5 both eto pmt and eto hs tend to under estimate pm eto and to present higher differences between their predicted eto values and those computed with pm eto with full data sets for the azores islands eto pmt lsa saf also has advantage relative to the other studied approaches despite the eto pmt lsa saf inaccuracies in capturing the highly changing weather conditions in some locations its performance is generally quite adequate the second best option is the use of either the eto hs or the eto pmt for the azores islands table 4 eto pmt era5 is the least accurate and therefore the less advisable approach to be used overall these results indicate that it is highly advantageous to compute the pmt approach using the rs lsa saf product the use of the rs era5 product is appropriate for continental portugal but not for azores likely due to the lower ability of era5 in capturing the heterogeneity of the weather conditions particularly under highly variable cloudy conditions due to a large pixel size nevertheless due to the continuity of era5 products the eto pmt era5 may be used for gap filling of eto pmt lsa saf time series a linear regression between all data on eto pmt era5 and eto pmt lsa saf has shown a very high correlation b0 1 02 and r2 0 95 for continental portugal and b0 0 98 and r2 0 90 for the azores islands a comparison between the eto pmt with the raw etref lsa saf product revealed that in terms of median value of rmse there is no statistical difference p 0 05 between the approaches however the use of eto pmt lsa saf reveals a median rmse significantly lower p 0 05 than the raw etref lsa saf product as might be expected these results and those presented in table 4 suggest that eto estimations based on the pmt approach ingesting in situ rs or rs lsa saf compare better than the raw etref lsa saf product with the standard pmt approach however in the absence of accurate temperature measurements the use of raw etref lsa saf shows to be appropriate but should be used with caution to our knowledge there are no studies using the eto pmt with ingestion of either satellite rs or reanalysis rs data thus a comparison of rmse results were performed with other eto pmt studies which used tmin as predictors of tdew eq 6 and used eq 7 with calibrated krs values for continental portugal the rmse results of the current study are similar or better than other pmt results reported in literature using daily weather data popova et al 2006 jabloun and sahli 2008 sentelhas et al 2010 ren et al 2016 in addition rmse results of the current study are within the range of those reported when monthly climatic data were used e g raziei and pereira 2013 todorovic et al 2013 almorox et al 2018 similar rmse results relative to the use of eto pmt were reported for azores islands by paredes et al 2018b there are no additional studies in literature referring to the use of eto pmt in islands characterized by humid windy and often cloudy conditions thus no further assessment was possible the eto hs rmse results of the present study are within the range of those reported in literature after calibration of krs eq 8 such as the one by gavílan et al 2006 sentelhas et al 2010 raziei and pereira 2013 todorovic et al 2013 ren et al 2016 almorox et al 2018 and paredes et al 2020 7 conclusions the lsa saf products assessed in this study revealed a high potential for accurately computing the reference grass evapotranspiration that is required for a variety of uses in agriculture hydrology and water management results have shown that the solar radiation product rs lsa saf consist of an accurate estimator of the shortwave radiation rs when it is not observed however its accuracy is affected by local climate conditions when the cloudiness is frequent and clouds quickly change therefore results are less good for the oceanic islands of azores mainly for locations in higher altitude where fog is frequent and the occurrence of fog precipitation is high results also have shown the superiority of rs lsa saf relative to rs era5 which is mainly due to the pixel size smaller for lsa saf about 4 4 km and 31 31 km for era5 therefore obtaining the location value from the pixel value is more uncertain with rs era5 mainly when the short term local variability of weather conditions determining rs is large as for azores islands when rs lsa saf and rs era5 are used with the pm eto to replace ground observations of rs i e for computing respectively eto lsa saf and eto era5 the goodness of fit indicators relative to their association with pm eto computed with full data sets are very good to excellent for continental portugal with quite small rmse the accuracy of estimates is better for the lsa saf product but results for era5 are close for azores due to the weather variability influencing rs results are not as good as for the continental stations particularly those relative to eto era5 nevertheless they can be used operationally mainly eto lsa saf considering the effective continuity of the era5 data sets the use of its products is advantageous relative to lsa saf which often has gaps in the time series up to 22 values in the series used in the present study however currently the gaps represent only 2 however these gaps affect the operational use of rs lsa saf for computing eto due to the continuity of era5 products and to the closeness of eto estimates using both products despite rmse results of eto era5 are larger the combined use of both rs products may be considered with rs era5 being used to fill the gaps of rs lsa saf however this option must be considered with care when the variability of weather conditions namely for azores locations at high elevation may largely affect rs and eto estimations the etref lsa saf is a unique product that estimates eto without using ground observations its computational algorithm uses rs lsa saf and ecwmf 2 m air temperature forecast products the goodness of fit results from comparing etref lsa saf with the benchmark pm eto computed with full data are clearly worse than those relative to eto lsa saf and eto era5 the rmse are acceptable for continental portugal but are poorer for the azores islands at those sites differences between eto computed with ground weather data and with satellite data may be large for humid cloudy and windy locations in higher altitude the differences between etref lsa saf and pm eto may result as previously discussed from inaccuracies of the rs lsa saf product as well as from uncertainties in the ground measurements themselves furthermore the etref lsa saf makes use of a different formulation to estimate eto that allows relying on variables that can be inferred from satellite measurements and avoids a high dependency on others that need to be provided by models the difference in spatial resolution between lsa saf and ecmwf source of the 2 m air temperature about 4 km vs 9 km may be a further source of uncertainty for etref lsa saf especially in areas where elevation is irregular for reduced data sets when only temperature data are available instead of using the pmt or the hs temperature approaches eto may be estimated by ingesting the rs products rs lsa saf and rs era5 in the pmt approach i e where these products are used to replace the estimation of rs from temperature eq 7 the resulting eto pmt lsa saf combining the use of ground temperature data with rs lsa saf eto pmt lsa saf revealed to be preferable relative to the use of ground temperature data only eto pmt and eto hs as well as to the use of the etref lsa saf product the results of the current study demonstrate for a wide range of climates and environmental conditions that rs lsa saf and rs era5 may be used accurately to compute eto when observation data sets are incomplete which consists of an innovative approach relative to the use of alternative equations and calculation procedures moreover when observed weather data are not available the etref lsa saf product proved to be a good alternative which is also an innovative approach relative to interpolating methods however a lower accuracy was observed in oceanic islands particularly for locations sited in high elevation characterized by highly changing cloudy conditions high air humidity and windy conditions throughout the year while proving the good usability of these lsa saf products and for the first time of the rs era5 product also identifies the need

10188,improving water productivity wp in grain production wpg is critical for maintaining food supply in regions with water shortage a long term field experiment from 1980 to 2019 was used to investigate the changes in wpg and its influencing factors for summer maize in the north china plain ncp the results showed that grain yield increased from 5 1 t ha 1 to 8 8 t ha 1 and wpg from 1 35 kg m 3 to 2 36 kg m 3 during the past four decades under full irrigation condition overall a 75 increase in yield and a 73 increase in wpg were achieved further analysis indicated that in 1980 s and 1990 s the improvements in yield and wpg were mainly associated with a significant increase in biomass production which was related to the increase in fertilizer use and the improvement in soil fertility in 2000 s and 2010 s the increase in yield and wpg was due to a significant increase in harvest index hi which was related to the introduction of modern hybrid maize overall increased hi contributed to 65 of the wpg increase for the past 40 years the results also indicated that during the recent years large seasonal yield variation was observed which was related to some deteriorating weather factors such as the reduced sunshine hours and the large variation in temperature based on the linear positive correlation of grain yield with wpg management practices that can minimize the negative effects of weather on grain production would favor an improved wpg in future keywords harvest index grain production biomass production soil fertility cultivar weather conditions 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is one of the most important grain production regions in china winter wheat and summer maize the annual double cropping system produce approximately 45 of the national wheat and 30 of the national maize with the continuing increases in population maintaining grain production in the ncp is quite important however the serious water shortage problem in this region is a great challenge for grain production under a changing climate li 2010 kang et al 2017 producing more food with less water by increasing water productivity wp is an important measure to reduce the impacts of water shortage on grain production zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 2013 2017 and lu et al 2016 analyzed the wp changes of winter wheat and summer maize at a typical site in the ncp for the past three decades and their results demonstrated there was an average seasonal increase in wp by 0 014 kg m 3 for winter wheat and 0 032 kg m 3 for summer maize with new cultivars and improved management practices grain production has increased without a concomitant increase in water use wp at the grain yield level wpg is generally defined as grain produced per unit of water consumption it can be calculated by the following equation wpg grain yield et biomass hi et where et is evapotranspiration which is the sum of crop transpiration and soil evaporation during the growing season crop grain yield depends on the above ground biomass and harvest index hi hi is defined as the ratio of grain yield to total above ground biomass at physiological maturity wp at biomass level wpb can be calculated as biomass et therefore wpg wpb hi increasing wpg can be achieved either by increasing biomass and hi or reducing et the worldwide average wpg of the three major crops wheat rice and maize is 1 09 1 09 and 1 80 kg m 3 respectively zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 there are also large variations in wpg for the same crop grown in different regions and under different management practices e g zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 zhang et al 2005 2013 sun et al 2018 for many agricultural crops an increase in hi has been achieved either genetically or agronomically hütsch and schubert 2018 the green revolution in shifting from early tall cultivars to dwarf cultivars has significantly increased hi for winter wheat however many studies have found a close positive correlation between dry matter production with grain production in maize hütsch schubert 2017 russell 1991 tollenaar and lee 2002 curin et al 2020 indicated that the positive effects of breeding across argentina on maize biomass production and its partitioning improved radiation and water use efficiency duvick 2005 found that plant breeding and improved management contributed equally to maize yield increases in the usa maize belt biomass production requires nutrients and water input therefore increased hi will be important for maize to improve its resource use efficiency yang 2015 curin et al 2020 enhanced hi generally improved wpg without compromising grain production davies et al 2011 yang 2015 long term field experiments provide an opportunity to analyze the changes in yield and wp and their influencing factors many studies indicated a continuously increasing trend for maize production from the 1980 s to the present in china tao and zhang 2010 guo et al 2014 yield increase was associated with the introduction of new cultivars and improved management e g zhang et al 2011 tao and zhang 2010 lu et al 2016 sun et al 2016 however the actual yield increase contrasted with the decreasing trends in potential yield influenced by climatic conditions and the weather changes during the maize growing seasons have negatively affected maize production during the past four decades guo et al 2014 sun et al 2016 guo et al 2014 indicated that from 1961 to 2010 technological advancement contributed to the increase in maize yield up to 140 while climate change negatively affected yield up to 40 decreased radiation and increased temperature negatively influenced maize production while technological advance offset the negative effects of climate change on maize production in china guo et al 2014 with the intensifying in water shortage using less water to increase or maintain crop production requires a higher wp as compared with the extensive studies on yield changes the historical changes in wp and its influencing factors have been less studied therefore the objectives of this study were to examine the changes in maize yield and wpg to distinguish the contributions of biomass production and hi to those changes based on a long term field experiment from 1980 to 2019 the results might provide references for agricultural production on maintaining higher wpg under a changing climate 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the data collected and analyzed in this study was from an on going long term irrigation experiment started in 1980 at luancheng agro eco experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences the results presented in this study were from 1980 to 2019 this experimental station is located in the northern part of the ncp 37 53 n 114 40 e 50 m above sea level the common planting practice in this region is to sow winter wheat triticum aestivum l at the beginning of october and to harvest the crop around the 10th of june the following year after winter wheat harvesting summer maize zea mays l is immediately sown and harvested at the end of september together the two crops form the annual double cropping system this region is in a monsoon climate zone the annual rainfall varies from 247 mm to 774 mm with 70 falling in the summer maize season the soil has a loam texture in the top 80 cm soil layer which changes to silt clay loam in deeper layers the soil has a high water holding capacity and deep soil profile which is suitable to grow crops the average field capacity is 36 v v 1 and the wilting point is 13 v v 1 for the top 2 m soil profile zhang et al 2008 2 2 experimental design this long term field irrigation experiment contains six irrigation treatments ranging from no irrigation up to 5 irrigations during the growing seasons of winter wheat and maize the experiment was set up in a complete randomized plot design with four replicates for each treatment each plot had an area of 5 8 m2 and was surrounded by a 2 m wide zone without irrigation to minimize the mutual effects of adjacent plots the data used in this study was collected from the treatment with the optimized irrigation supply i e the treatment with the highest yield each season for summer maize generally maize reaches the highest yield with the following irrigation practices irrigation at sowing for immediate emergence and irrigation at the 9th leaf stage for n application the summer rain usually meets the water requirements of this crop in dry seasons an extra irrigation at the grain filling stage was also applied irrigation was conducted using a water pump and transported to the field by a tube installed with a flow meter to record the irrigation applied to each plot for each irrigation 60 80 mm of water was generally applied 2 3 field management during the experimental duration the field management practices for this long term experiment followed local practices in straw management fertilizer application and use of new cultivars at the beginning of the experiment the straw of the two crops was all removed from the field after harvesting in the middle of the 1980 s the straw of winter wheat was left in the field after harvesting and beginning in the middle of the 1990 s the straw of both crops was returned to the field for this annual double cropping system fertilization was carried out as the following phosphorus and one fourth of the nitrogen were applied as base fertilizers before sowing winter wheat with soil tillage the remaining nitrogen fertilizer was divided into two equal parts and separately applied at the jointing stage for winter wheat and v9 stage for maize with an irrigation the use of chemical fertilizers had increased from the 1980 2000 s in the 1980 s n at 150 200 kg ha 1 and p2o5 at 80 100 kg ha 1 were applied to wheat and maize annually n was increased to 250 300 kg ha 1 and p2o5 to 100 150 kg ha 1 annually in the 1990 s again in the 2000 s n was further increased to 350 375 kg ha and p2o5 to 130 170 kg ha 1 annually potash fertilizer was added at rate of 20 kg ha 1 k2o as a base fertilizer before sowing winter wheat recently n has been maintained around 400 425 kg ha 1 p2o5 around 180 200 kg ha 1 and k2o around 30 40 kg ha 1 annually fig 1 shows the changes in the fertilizer application to summer maize for the past 40 years half of the base fertilizers applied before sowing winter wheat were allocated to summer maize four types of maize cultivars were used from 1980 to 2019 single cross cultivars were used in the 1980 s and compact plant type hybrids were introduced in the 1990 s from the late 1990 s to the early 2000 s big ear type hybrids were planted zhengdan958 a very popular hybrid maize cultivar in china has been used since 2005 fig 1 summer maize was manually planted immediately after winter wheat harvesting around 15th june each season without soil tillage the row spacing was set at 60 cm with a density of approximately 50 000 60 000 plants ha 1 the harvesting usually occurs at the end of september to allow time to prepare land for sowing winter wheat around 10th october each year the sowing and harvesting time for summer maize were relative stable 2 4 parameters monitored a standard meteorological station approximately 50 m away from the experimental site was used to record the daily rainfall temperature humidity wind speed and hours of sunshine daily reference evapotranspiration et0 grass as the reference crop was calculated based on the fao recommended penmen monteith equation allen et al 1998 soil water content was regularly monitored for each plot down to 2 m at increments of 20 cm at sowing harvesting and other major growing stages of the crop by soil augur method before 1986 after 1986 neutron probe method was used ih ii cambridge uk from 1986 to 2012 and 503dr cpn international inc usa from 2013 to 2019 the probes were well calibrated using the method of soil cores the soil water content in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm was measured gravimetrically at regular intervals soil bulk density for the top 2 m soil profile was measured at the beginning of the experiment in 1991 and again in 2014 soil nutrient content was regularly sampled and measured using conventional methods every five years the timing of sowing harvesting and other major growing stages were recorded for each season the plant density was counted the biomass at harvest for maize was monitored by harvesting four plants above the soil surface from each plot after drying the total dry weight and the grain weight from the four plants was recorded to obtain the harvest index the grain yield of maize was obtained by manually harvesting the plants in each plot and a thresher was used to obtain the grains after air drying water content at 13 the weight of the grain was recorded to calculate the grain production 2 5 seasonal evapotranspiration et and wp calculation seasonal evapotranspiration et was calculated using the water balance equation described by zhang et al 2011 et swd p i wg d r where p is seasonal rainfall swd is soil water depletion i is irrigation d is drainage from the root zone wg is capillary rise and r is runoff runoff was not observed due to the low rainfall high soil water holding capacity and plot bordering capillary rise was omitted due to the deep groundwater table 15 40 m below the soil surface from 1980 to 2019 downward movement of soil water from 160 cm was taken as the drainage since the average maximum rooting depth for maize was approximately 140 160 cm drainage from the root zone was determined based on darcy s law using the pressure gradient between 160 cm and 180 cm of soil depth the following equation was used to calculate the drainage k δh δz where k is the hydraulic conductivity δh is the soil water potential difference between 160 cm and 180 cm and δz is the depth difference between the two soil layers soil water potential was determined by the matric water potential and gravitational potential matric water potential was determined using the soil water retention curves that were developed at the experimental site zhang et al 2001 hydraulic conductivity k was calculated using an exponential relationship between k and θ k k s exp α θs θ θs θd where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity α is a dimensionless constant here α 14 5 θs is the saturated volumetric moisture content of the soil layer θ is the soil volumetric water content and θd is the moisture content of dry soil kendy et al 2003 water productivity wp at grain yield level wpg was calculated as grain yield et wp at biomass level wpb was determined by the above ground biomass divided by et the unit of kg m 3 was used for the two wps in this study 2 6 methods to assess the changes and contributions from different factors the changes in yield biomass hi wpb and wpg during the 40 years were calculated by the following methods average value for each variable was calculated during each ten years from 1980 to 1989 1980 s from 1990 to 1999 1990 s from 2000 to 2009 2000 s and from 2010 to 2019 2010 s as four decades and the averaged values were further compared by the difference in their absolute values or percentages the contributions of biomass b and hi to grain yield y improvement and the contributions of wpb and hi to wpg improvement were calculated using the following equations 1 y h i b y h i b b h i h i b h i b y b h i y h i b y 100 2 w p g h i w p b w p g h i w p b w p b h i h i w p b h i w p b w p g w p b h i w p g h i w p b w p g 100 where y hi b wp g wp b are the changes in the average values from one decade to another decade for yield harvest index biomass water productivity at grain yield level and water productivity at biomass level respectively the changes in yield can be attributed to the changes in biomass b hi harvest index hi b and the combined effects of the two variables hi b similarly the changes in wpg can be attributed to the changes in wpb wpb hi harvest index hi wpb and the combined effects of the two variables hi wpb b hi y and hi b y are the contributions of biomass and harvest index to yield improvement and wpb hi wp g and hi wpb wp g are the contributions of wpb and harvest index to wpg improvement respectively 2 7 statistical analysis the average value of the four replicates with the highest yield for summer maize among the different irrigation treatments was used for the analysis standard deviation of the four replicates was calculated for each variable involved in this study linear regression analysis was conducted to relate the changes in yield biomass hi wpb and wpg with time correlation analysis between wp with yield and biomass were performed all the analysis was done using spss version 19 0 spss for windows ibm armonk new york and excel software for each linear regression r square value r 2 p value and standard error of the slope se were provided 3 results 3 1 weather conditions fig 2 illustrates the changes in average seasonal maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin hours of sunshine and seasonal reference evapotranspiration et0 the results indicated that there were significant increasing trends for seasonal average daily tmax and tmin and a significant declining trend for hours of sunshine p 0 05 during the growth seasons of summer maize from 1980 to 2019 no significant change was found in the seasonal average et0 which indicated a relative stable atmospheric evaporation demand the increased temperature but reduced sunshine duration compensated each other on their effects on et0 overall from 1980 to 2019 it was becoming warmer for summer maize but the radiation was greatly reduced 3 2 soil nutrients and water conditions fig 3 illustrates the changes in available n p k and organic matter om from 1980 to 2019 for the top 20 cm soil layer at the experimental site significant increases in om and available n were found from 1980 to 2019 the om doubled from 10 g kg 1 to more than 20 g kg 1 during the experimental duration the available p was maintained at a relatively stable level before the 2010 s but there was an increasing trend since 2010 available k decreased from the 1980 s to 2000 due to no application of k fertilizer from then on k fertilizer was applied and together with straw returning to the field soil available k increased overall soil fertility at the experimental site was improved over the past 40 years especially for om and n the data used for this analysis was from the treatment with the highest yield which was generally irrigated two to three times for summer maize therefore the soil moisture for the treatment selected during the experimental duration met the water requirements for this crop without apparent water deficit fig 4 shows the changes in soil water content for the top 1 m soil profiles in a wet season a normal season and a dry season for summer maize the soil moisture for the main root zone was generally maintained over 65 of field capacity which was usually taken as the threshold value for maize 3 3 changes in biomass and grain yield under full water supply grain yield for summer maize has increased from the 1980 s to present fig 5 the average yield was 5 1 t ha 1 in the 1980 s 7 0 t ha 1 in the 1990 s 7 9 t ha 1 in the 2000 s and 8 8 t ha 1 in the 2010 s however the increase in biomass mainly occurred during the first 20 years for the last 20 years biomass was decreased as compared with that during the 1980 s and 1990 s fig 5 the increase in maize yield during this period was mostly related to the increase in hi table 1 lists the average yield biomass and hi for each of the decade the largest increase in yield occurred from the 1980 1990 s which was related to the rapid increase in biomass production from the 1990 2000 s yield increases slowed down due to the decreased biomass production although the increased hi compensated the loss in biomass production during this period in the 2000 s and 2010 s maize biomass was maintained at a relatively stable level and the increase in hi contributed more to the increase in grain production overall the grain yield of summer maize was increased by 75 from the 1980 2010 s approximately 25 of this increase could be explained by the biomass increase and 64 by the hi increase the remaining 11 increase could be attributed to the collective effects of the two factors harvest index played a more important role in summer maize yield increase than that of biomass during the past 40 years fig 5 also indicates that there was much more seasonal variation in grain yield and biomass production in 2000 s and 2010 s indicating that the production of summer maize has been more affected by the seasonal weather variations recently than that in 1980 s and 1990 s 3 4 changes in crop water use and wp seasonal water use for summer maize during the past four decades is shown in fig 6 there was no significant change for maize similar to the seasonal et0 changes fig 2 overall the seasonal et was maintained at a relatively stable level with the continuous increase in grain yield and relatively stable seasonal et a significant continuous increase in wpg was found with maize p 0 01 fig 7 the changes in wpb was different from that of wpg it was in a increasing trend before 2000 but in decreasing trend in 2000 s recently wpb was again in an increasing trend corresponding to the large variation in biomass production during the 2010 s there was also a large variation in seasonal et the seasonal variation in wpg was smaller than that in seasonal variations in et or yield 3 5 contributions from wpb and hi to wpg improvement the average wpg was 1 35 kg m 3 in 1980 s 1 84 kg m 3 in 1990 s 1 98 kg m 3 in 2000 s and 2 36 kg m 3 in 2010 s overall a 73 increase was observed from 1980 2010 s during the same period wpb changed from 3 53 kg m 3 to 4 19 kg m 3 representing a total increase of 18 and hi changed from 0 38 to 0 57 representing a total increase of 48 similar to grain yield the contribution of wpb to the increase in wpg from the 1980 2010 s was approximately 24 and the contribution of hi to wpg improvement was approximately 65 the remaining 11 increase in wpg could be associated with the collective effects of both factors the results indicated that during the past 40 years the major improvement in maize wpg mainly came from the increase in hi the contribution of wpb and hi to the increase in wpg also changed during the past 40 years fig 7 from the 1980 1990 s the contributions of wpb and hi to wpg improvement were approximately 92 and 6 respectively during this time the hi was relatively stable and the yield increase was mainly due to the increased biomass production the increase in biomass production was achieved without a similar increase in et therefore wpb was increased wpb was the major driver for wpg improvement during the 1980 s and 1990 s from the 1990 2000 s with the introduction of modern hybrid varieties hi was significantly improved but the biomass production and wpb of the new hybrid varieties were lower than that of the previous maize cultivars the large increase in hi compensated for the losses in biomass and wpb therefore an improved yield and wpg was maintained from the 2000 2010 s a large increase in wpg was observed which was related to the increase in both wpb and hi on average the improvement in hi and wpb contributed to 74 and 26 of the wpg improvement during this period respectively 4 discussion 4 1 soil fertility improvement on crop production and wp results from this study showed that the increase in maize grain yield and wpg was largely due to the increased biomass production before 2000 during this period due to the lower hi of cultivars biomass production was critical for maintaining a higher grain yield the significant increase in soil organic matter improved biomass production during this period on average soil om for the 20 cm soil layer increased from 1 to 1 5 when soil om was lower its increase would significantly increase production castleberry et al 1984 showed that a difference in maize yield up to 50 was observed under lower and higher soil fertilities oldfield et al 2019 found that yields of maize and wheat were on average greater with higher concentrations of soil organic carbon the changes in management practices specially the straw return from both crops for the annual double cropping system in the ncp significantly increased the om fig 3 crop straw return has been widely recognized as an effective practice to manage carbon sequestration in agricultural ecosystems oldfield et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 also indicated a significant increase in soil om by the long term practice of straw return in china the soil fertility increase at the experimental site was also related to the increase in chemical fertilizer use especially urea together with the improved soil om soil n contents also significantly increased fig 3 wang et al 2013 indicated that n supply affects the linear relationship of et with grain yield when n is below a certain level increasing n supply increases the slope of this linear relationship resulting in a higher wp there are also studies showing that increases in n supply improve the intrinsic wp of plants köhler et al 2012 for the duration of this experiment the increase in soil n contents may have positively influenced wp another aspect in wp improvement was related to the reduction in soil evaporation the increased maize biomass production would result in a large canopy size and the increased canopy coverage would reduce soil evaporation liu et al 2002 indicated that soil evaporation for summer maize in the ncp was approximately 30 of the total seasonal et zhang et al 2005 indicated that using the straw from winter wheat to mulch summer maize could reduce soil evaporation up to 40 mm during a growing season therefore the increased canopy coverage and the use of straw mulch all contributed to the improved wp in the ncp 4 2 harvest index effects on wpg biomass production for maize requires large amounts of water and nutrients the increase in hi would allow a more stable yield as well as improved water and nutrient use efficiency nue yang and zhang 2010 harvest index has a high heritability and is less affected by environmental factors maize usually has hi ranging from 0 25 to 0 58 the values for modern varieties usually fall within the range of 0 4 0 6 hay 1995 during the entire experimental duration of this study hi was improved by 48 which contributed to 64 of the wpg increase the results from this study indicated that breeding efforts had the positive effects on biomass production and its partitioning without apparent increasing in water use the yield improvement driven by biomass or hi had increased water productivity results from curin et al 2020 demonstrated that breeding efforts on maize had unintended positive effects on radiation and water use efficiency which are welcome on a global scale considering that the predicted trends of water shortage will require increased water productivity rather than increased water use by crops the modern hybrid maize already has a high hi the results from this study indicated that the average hi for summer maize has remained at approximately 0 56 in 2010 s fig 8 further hi improvements for maize would require breakthroughs in new varieties and management skills in the ncp hütsch and schubert 2017 suggested using different phytohormones to either enhance the activity of h atpase for better kernel setting or reduce the shoot growth for higher hi the results from this study also showed that during the 2000 s reduced biomass production was observed however with improved hi the maize yield was maintained and wpg was significantly increased genetic or agronomic improvements to hi are becoming more important for higher resource use efficiency under resource limited environments 4 3 maintaining high yield and high wp under a changing climate many studies indicated that the significant seasonal yield variation in maize was due to the variation in weather factors liu et al 2010 ray et al 2015 sun et al 2016 farmaha et al 2016 fang et al 2019 managing practices to minimize the negative effects of climate on maize production are becoming more important lobell and asner 2003 rurinda et al 2015 ruffo et al 2015 rahimi moghaddam et al 2018 seed weight was the major factor affecting the annual yield fluctuation under full water supply conditions for maize in the ncp fang et al 2019 the critical period that determines seed weight is from the blister stage to maturity fang et al 2019 during this period wide daily temperature ranges and extended sunshine exposure would result in a higher seed weight however the climate changing trend showed declining trends for both factors therefore under the current changing climate the growing condition for summer maize especially during the grain fill duration is deteriorating ceglar et al 2016 reported that temperature and solar radiation contributed to the variation in spring maize yield in france wang et al 2014 also showed that temperature and solar radiation were the main weather factors that caused summer maize yield fluctuation in china crops with adequate canopy structure to intercept more solar radiation may provide a benefit for dry matter accumulation stewart et al 2003 in addition to the cultivar leaf structure changing the planting patterns would also affect the exposure to solar radiation lu et al 2017 indicated that more uniform planting of summer maize increased the light capture at vegetative stages which accelerated the biomass accumulation sun et al 2016 indicated that optimizing planting density could reduce the seasonal yield variation of summer maize caused by weather factors in the same region the yield improvement related to the practices described above would also favor or maintain a higher wpg for maize under a changing climate 5 conclusion previous studies using long term field experiments have mostly focused on grain yield changes while this study provided an opportunity to examine the historical wp changes and their related factors the results from this study indicated the improvement in maize wpg for the past 40 years is largely attributed to the improvement in hi after modern hybrids were introduced in recent years hi was maintained at a relatively higher and stable level further improvement in wpg induced by hi will need breakthrough in breeding to further increase wpg through manipulating biomass production was another opportunity under a changing climate the growing condition for maize in this region is becoming less favorable and there is large variation in seasonal yield management practices such as optimizing plant density and narrowing row spacing to increase solar radiation exposure are possible options to improve maize production and water productivity in the ncp in the future declaration of competing interest the

10188,improving water productivity wp in grain production wpg is critical for maintaining food supply in regions with water shortage a long term field experiment from 1980 to 2019 was used to investigate the changes in wpg and its influencing factors for summer maize in the north china plain ncp the results showed that grain yield increased from 5 1 t ha 1 to 8 8 t ha 1 and wpg from 1 35 kg m 3 to 2 36 kg m 3 during the past four decades under full irrigation condition overall a 75 increase in yield and a 73 increase in wpg were achieved further analysis indicated that in 1980 s and 1990 s the improvements in yield and wpg were mainly associated with a significant increase in biomass production which was related to the increase in fertilizer use and the improvement in soil fertility in 2000 s and 2010 s the increase in yield and wpg was due to a significant increase in harvest index hi which was related to the introduction of modern hybrid maize overall increased hi contributed to 65 of the wpg increase for the past 40 years the results also indicated that during the recent years large seasonal yield variation was observed which was related to some deteriorating weather factors such as the reduced sunshine hours and the large variation in temperature based on the linear positive correlation of grain yield with wpg management practices that can minimize the negative effects of weather on grain production would favor an improved wpg in future keywords harvest index grain production biomass production soil fertility cultivar weather conditions 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is one of the most important grain production regions in china winter wheat and summer maize the annual double cropping system produce approximately 45 of the national wheat and 30 of the national maize with the continuing increases in population maintaining grain production in the ncp is quite important however the serious water shortage problem in this region is a great challenge for grain production under a changing climate li 2010 kang et al 2017 producing more food with less water by increasing water productivity wp is an important measure to reduce the impacts of water shortage on grain production zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 2013 2017 and lu et al 2016 analyzed the wp changes of winter wheat and summer maize at a typical site in the ncp for the past three decades and their results demonstrated there was an average seasonal increase in wp by 0 014 kg m 3 for winter wheat and 0 032 kg m 3 for summer maize with new cultivars and improved management practices grain production has increased without a concomitant increase in water use wp at the grain yield level wpg is generally defined as grain produced per unit of water consumption it can be calculated by the following equation wpg grain yield et biomass hi et where et is evapotranspiration which is the sum of crop transpiration and soil evaporation during the growing season crop grain yield depends on the above ground biomass and harvest index hi hi is defined as the ratio of grain yield to total above ground biomass at physiological maturity wp at biomass level wpb can be calculated as biomass et therefore wpg wpb hi increasing wpg can be achieved either by increasing biomass and hi or reducing et the worldwide average wpg of the three major crops wheat rice and maize is 1 09 1 09 and 1 80 kg m 3 respectively zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 there are also large variations in wpg for the same crop grown in different regions and under different management practices e g zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 zhang et al 2005 2013 sun et al 2018 for many agricultural crops an increase in hi has been achieved either genetically or agronomically hütsch and schubert 2018 the green revolution in shifting from early tall cultivars to dwarf cultivars has significantly increased hi for winter wheat however many studies have found a close positive correlation between dry matter production with grain production in maize hütsch schubert 2017 russell 1991 tollenaar and lee 2002 curin et al 2020 indicated that the positive effects of breeding across argentina on maize biomass production and its partitioning improved radiation and water use efficiency duvick 2005 found that plant breeding and improved management contributed equally to maize yield increases in the usa maize belt biomass production requires nutrients and water input therefore increased hi will be important for maize to improve its resource use efficiency yang 2015 curin et al 2020 enhanced hi generally improved wpg without compromising grain production davies et al 2011 yang 2015 long term field experiments provide an opportunity to analyze the changes in yield and wp and their influencing factors many studies indicated a continuously increasing trend for maize production from the 1980 s to the present in china tao and zhang 2010 guo et al 2014 yield increase was associated with the introduction of new cultivars and improved management e g zhang et al 2011 tao and zhang 2010 lu et al 2016 sun et al 2016 however the actual yield increase contrasted with the decreasing trends in potential yield influenced by climatic conditions and the weather changes during the maize growing seasons have negatively affected maize production during the past four decades guo et al 2014 sun et al 2016 guo et al 2014 indicated that from 1961 to 2010 technological advancement contributed to the increase in maize yield up to 140 while climate change negatively affected yield up to 40 decreased radiation and increased temperature negatively influenced maize production while technological advance offset the negative effects of climate change on maize production in china guo et al 2014 with the intensifying in water shortage using less water to increase or maintain crop production requires a higher wp as compared with the extensive studies on yield changes the historical changes in wp and its influencing factors have been less studied therefore the objectives of this study were to examine the changes in maize yield and wpg to distinguish the contributions of biomass production and hi to those changes based on a long term field experiment from 1980 to 2019 the results might provide references for agricultural production on maintaining higher wpg under a changing climate 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site the data collected and analyzed in this study was from an on going long term irrigation experiment started in 1980 at luancheng agro eco experimental station of the chinese academy of sciences the results presented in this study were from 1980 to 2019 this experimental station is located in the northern part of the ncp 37 53 n 114 40 e 50 m above sea level the common planting practice in this region is to sow winter wheat triticum aestivum l at the beginning of october and to harvest the crop around the 10th of june the following year after winter wheat harvesting summer maize zea mays l is immediately sown and harvested at the end of september together the two crops form the annual double cropping system this region is in a monsoon climate zone the annual rainfall varies from 247 mm to 774 mm with 70 falling in the summer maize season the soil has a loam texture in the top 80 cm soil layer which changes to silt clay loam in deeper layers the soil has a high water holding capacity and deep soil profile which is suitable to grow crops the average field capacity is 36 v v 1 and the wilting point is 13 v v 1 for the top 2 m soil profile zhang et al 2008 2 2 experimental design this long term field irrigation experiment contains six irrigation treatments ranging from no irrigation up to 5 irrigations during the growing seasons of winter wheat and maize the experiment was set up in a complete randomized plot design with four replicates for each treatment each plot had an area of 5 8 m2 and was surrounded by a 2 m wide zone without irrigation to minimize the mutual effects of adjacent plots the data used in this study was collected from the treatment with the optimized irrigation supply i e the treatment with the highest yield each season for summer maize generally maize reaches the highest yield with the following irrigation practices irrigation at sowing for immediate emergence and irrigation at the 9th leaf stage for n application the summer rain usually meets the water requirements of this crop in dry seasons an extra irrigation at the grain filling stage was also applied irrigation was conducted using a water pump and transported to the field by a tube installed with a flow meter to record the irrigation applied to each plot for each irrigation 60 80 mm of water was generally applied 2 3 field management during the experimental duration the field management practices for this long term experiment followed local practices in straw management fertilizer application and use of new cultivars at the beginning of the experiment the straw of the two crops was all removed from the field after harvesting in the middle of the 1980 s the straw of winter wheat was left in the field after harvesting and beginning in the middle of the 1990 s the straw of both crops was returned to the field for this annual double cropping system fertilization was carried out as the following phosphorus and one fourth of the nitrogen were applied as base fertilizers before sowing winter wheat with soil tillage the remaining nitrogen fertilizer was divided into two equal parts and separately applied at the jointing stage for winter wheat and v9 stage for maize with an irrigation the use of chemical fertilizers had increased from the 1980 2000 s in the 1980 s n at 150 200 kg ha 1 and p2o5 at 80 100 kg ha 1 were applied to wheat and maize annually n was increased to 250 300 kg ha 1 and p2o5 to 100 150 kg ha 1 annually in the 1990 s again in the 2000 s n was further increased to 350 375 kg ha and p2o5 to 130 170 kg ha 1 annually potash fertilizer was added at rate of 20 kg ha 1 k2o as a base fertilizer before sowing winter wheat recently n has been maintained around 400 425 kg ha 1 p2o5 around 180 200 kg ha 1 and k2o around 30 40 kg ha 1 annually fig 1 shows the changes in the fertilizer application to summer maize for the past 40 years half of the base fertilizers applied before sowing winter wheat were allocated to summer maize four types of maize cultivars were used from 1980 to 2019 single cross cultivars were used in the 1980 s and compact plant type hybrids were introduced in the 1990 s from the late 1990 s to the early 2000 s big ear type hybrids were planted zhengdan958 a very popular hybrid maize cultivar in china has been used since 2005 fig 1 summer maize was manually planted immediately after winter wheat harvesting around 15th june each season without soil tillage the row spacing was set at 60 cm with a density of approximately 50 000 60 000 plants ha 1 the harvesting usually occurs at the end of september to allow time to prepare land for sowing winter wheat around 10th october each year the sowing and harvesting time for summer maize were relative stable 2 4 parameters monitored a standard meteorological station approximately 50 m away from the experimental site was used to record the daily rainfall temperature humidity wind speed and hours of sunshine daily reference evapotranspiration et0 grass as the reference crop was calculated based on the fao recommended penmen monteith equation allen et al 1998 soil water content was regularly monitored for each plot down to 2 m at increments of 20 cm at sowing harvesting and other major growing stages of the crop by soil augur method before 1986 after 1986 neutron probe method was used ih ii cambridge uk from 1986 to 2012 and 503dr cpn international inc usa from 2013 to 2019 the probes were well calibrated using the method of soil cores the soil water content in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm was measured gravimetrically at regular intervals soil bulk density for the top 2 m soil profile was measured at the beginning of the experiment in 1991 and again in 2014 soil nutrient content was regularly sampled and measured using conventional methods every five years the timing of sowing harvesting and other major growing stages were recorded for each season the plant density was counted the biomass at harvest for maize was monitored by harvesting four plants above the soil surface from each plot after drying the total dry weight and the grain weight from the four plants was recorded to obtain the harvest index the grain yield of maize was obtained by manually harvesting the plants in each plot and a thresher was used to obtain the grains after air drying water content at 13 the weight of the grain was recorded to calculate the grain production 2 5 seasonal evapotranspiration et and wp calculation seasonal evapotranspiration et was calculated using the water balance equation described by zhang et al 2011 et swd p i wg d r where p is seasonal rainfall swd is soil water depletion i is irrigation d is drainage from the root zone wg is capillary rise and r is runoff runoff was not observed due to the low rainfall high soil water holding capacity and plot bordering capillary rise was omitted due to the deep groundwater table 15 40 m below the soil surface from 1980 to 2019 downward movement of soil water from 160 cm was taken as the drainage since the average maximum rooting depth for maize was approximately 140 160 cm drainage from the root zone was determined based on darcy s law using the pressure gradient between 160 cm and 180 cm of soil depth the following equation was used to calculate the drainage k δh δz where k is the hydraulic conductivity δh is the soil water potential difference between 160 cm and 180 cm and δz is the depth difference between the two soil layers soil water potential was determined by the matric water potential and gravitational potential matric water potential was determined using the soil water retention curves that were developed at the experimental site zhang et al 2001 hydraulic conductivity k was calculated using an exponential relationship between k and θ k k s exp α θs θ θs θd where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity α is a dimensionless constant here α 14 5 θs is the saturated volumetric moisture content of the soil layer θ is the soil volumetric water content and θd is the moisture content of dry soil kendy et al 2003 water productivity wp at grain yield level wpg was calculated as grain yield et wp at biomass level wpb was determined by the above ground biomass divided by et the unit of kg m 3 was used for the two wps in this study 2 6 methods to assess the changes and contributions from different factors the changes in yield biomass hi wpb and wpg during the 40 years were calculated by the following methods average value for each variable was calculated during each ten years from 1980 to 1989 1980 s from 1990 to 1999 1990 s from 2000 to 2009 2000 s and from 2010 to 2019 2010 s as four decades and the averaged values were further compared by the difference in their absolute values or percentages the contributions of biomass b and hi to grain yield y improvement and the contributions of wpb and hi to wpg improvement were calculated using the following equations 1 y h i b y h i b b h i h i b h i b y b h i y h i b y 100 2 w p g h i w p b w p g h i w p b w p b h i h i w p b h i w p b w p g w p b h i w p g h i w p b w p g 100 where y hi b wp g wp b are the changes in the average values from one decade to another decade for yield harvest index biomass water productivity at grain yield level and water productivity at biomass level respectively the changes in yield can be attributed to the changes in biomass b hi harvest index hi b and the combined effects of the two variables hi b similarly the changes in wpg can be attributed to the changes in wpb wpb hi harvest index hi wpb and the combined effects of the two variables hi wpb b hi y and hi b y are the contributions of biomass and harvest index to yield improvement and wpb hi wp g and hi wpb wp g are the contributions of wpb and harvest index to wpg improvement respectively 2 7 statistical analysis the average value of the four replicates with the highest yield for summer maize among the different irrigation treatments was used for the analysis standard deviation of the four replicates was calculated for each variable involved in this study linear regression analysis was conducted to relate the changes in yield biomass hi wpb and wpg with time correlation analysis between wp with yield and biomass were performed all the analysis was done using spss version 19 0 spss for windows ibm armonk new york and excel software for each linear regression r square value r 2 p value and standard error of the slope se were provided 3 results 3 1 weather conditions fig 2 illustrates the changes in average seasonal maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin hours of sunshine and seasonal reference evapotranspiration et0 the results indicated that there were significant increasing trends for seasonal average daily tmax and tmin and a significant declining trend for hours of sunshine p 0 05 during the growth seasons of summer maize from 1980 to 2019 no significant change was found in the seasonal average et0 which indicated a relative stable atmospheric evaporation demand the increased temperature but reduced sunshine duration compensated each other on their effects on et0 overall from 1980 to 2019 it was becoming warmer for summer maize but the radiation was greatly reduced 3 2 soil nutrients and water conditions fig 3 illustrates the changes in available n p k and organic matter om from 1980 to 2019 for the top 20 cm soil layer at the experimental site significant increases in om and available n were found from 1980 to 2019 the om doubled from 10 g kg 1 to more than 20 g kg 1 during the experimental duration the available p was maintained at a relatively stable level before the 2010 s but there was an increasing trend since 2010 available k decreased from the 1980 s to 2000 due to no application of k fertilizer from then on k fertilizer was applied and together with straw returning to the field soil available k increased overall soil fertility at the experimental site was improved over the past 40 years especially for om and n the data used for this analysis was from the treatment with the highest yield which was generally irrigated two to three times for summer maize therefore the soil moisture for the treatment selected during the experimental duration met the water requirements for this crop without apparent water deficit fig 4 shows the changes in soil water content for the top 1 m soil profiles in a wet season a normal season and a dry season for summer maize the soil moisture for the main root zone was generally maintained over 65 of field capacity which was usually taken as the threshold value for maize 3 3 changes in biomass and grain yield under full water supply grain yield for summer maize has increased from the 1980 s to present fig 5 the average yield was 5 1 t ha 1 in the 1980 s 7 0 t ha 1 in the 1990 s 7 9 t ha 1 in the 2000 s and 8 8 t ha 1 in the 2010 s however the increase in biomass mainly occurred during the first 20 years for the last 20 years biomass was decreased as compared with that during the 1980 s and 1990 s fig 5 the increase in maize yield during this period was mostly related to the increase in hi table 1 lists the average yield biomass and hi for each of the decade the largest increase in yield occurred from the 1980 1990 s which was related to the rapid increase in biomass production from the 1990 2000 s yield increases slowed down due to the decreased biomass production although the increased hi compensated the loss in biomass production during this period in the 2000 s and 2010 s maize biomass was maintained at a relatively stable level and the increase in hi contributed more to the increase in grain production overall the grain yield of summer maize was increased by 75 from the 1980 2010 s approximately 25 of this increase could be explained by the biomass increase and 64 by the hi increase the remaining 11 increase could be attributed to the collective effects of the two factors harvest index played a more important role in summer maize yield increase than that of biomass during the past 40 years fig 5 also indicates that there was much more seasonal variation in grain yield and biomass production in 2000 s and 2010 s indicating that the production of summer maize has been more affected by the seasonal weather variations recently than that in 1980 s and 1990 s 3 4 changes in crop water use and wp seasonal water use for summer maize during the past four decades is shown in fig 6 there was no significant change for maize similar to the seasonal et0 changes fig 2 overall the seasonal et was maintained at a relatively stable level with the continuous increase in grain yield and relatively stable seasonal et a significant continuous increase in wpg was found with maize p 0 01 fig 7 the changes in wpb was different from that of wpg it was in a increasing trend before 2000 but in decreasing trend in 2000 s recently wpb was again in an increasing trend corresponding to the large variation in biomass production during the 2010 s there was also a large variation in seasonal et the seasonal variation in wpg was smaller than that in seasonal variations in et or yield 3 5 contributions from wpb and hi to wpg improvement the average wpg was 1 35 kg m 3 in 1980 s 1 84 kg m 3 in 1990 s 1 98 kg m 3 in 2000 s and 2 36 kg m 3 in 2010 s overall a 73 increase was observed from 1980 2010 s during the same period wpb changed from 3 53 kg m 3 to 4 19 kg m 3 representing a total increase of 18 and hi changed from 0 38 to 0 57 representing a total increase of 48 similar to grain yield the contribution of wpb to the increase in wpg from the 1980 2010 s was approximately 24 and the contribution of hi to wpg improvement was approximately 65 the remaining 11 increase in wpg could be associated with the collective effects of both factors the results indicated that during the past 40 years the major improvement in maize wpg mainly came from the increase in hi the contribution of wpb and hi to the increase in wpg also changed during the past 40 years fig 7 from the 1980 1990 s the contributions of wpb and hi to wpg improvement were approximately 92 and 6 respectively during this time the hi was relatively stable and the yield increase was mainly due to the increased biomass production the increase in biomass production was achieved without a similar increase in et therefore wpb was increased wpb was the major driver for wpg improvement during the 1980 s and 1990 s from the 1990 2000 s with the introduction of modern hybrid varieties hi was significantly improved but the biomass production and wpb of the new hybrid varieties were lower than that of the previous maize cultivars the large increase in hi compensated for the losses in biomass and wpb therefore an improved yield and wpg was maintained from the 2000 2010 s a large increase in wpg was observed which was related to the increase in both wpb and hi on average the improvement in hi and wpb contributed to 74 and 26 of the wpg improvement during this period respectively 4 discussion 4 1 soil fertility improvement on crop production and wp results from this study showed that the increase in maize grain yield and wpg was largely due to the increased biomass production before 2000 during this period due to the lower hi of cultivars biomass production was critical for maintaining a higher grain yield the significant increase in soil organic matter improved biomass production during this period on average soil om for the 20 cm soil layer increased from 1 to 1 5 when soil om was lower its increase would significantly increase production castleberry et al 1984 showed that a difference in maize yield up to 50 was observed under lower and higher soil fertilities oldfield et al 2019 found that yields of maize and wheat were on average greater with higher concentrations of soil organic carbon the changes in management practices specially the straw return from both crops for the annual double cropping system in the ncp significantly increased the om fig 3 crop straw return has been widely recognized as an effective practice to manage carbon sequestration in agricultural ecosystems oldfield et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 also indicated a significant increase in soil om by the long term practice of straw return in china the soil fertility increase at the experimental site was also related to the increase in chemical fertilizer use especially urea together with the improved soil om soil n contents also significantly increased fig 3 wang et al 2013 indicated that n supply affects the linear relationship of et with grain yield when n is below a certain level increasing n supply increases the slope of this linear relationship resulting in a higher wp there are also studies showing that increases in n supply improve the intrinsic wp of plants köhler et al 2012 for the duration of this experiment the increase in soil n contents may have positively influenced wp another aspect in wp improvement was related to the reduction in soil evaporation the increased maize biomass production would result in a large canopy size and the increased canopy coverage would reduce soil evaporation liu et al 2002 indicated that soil evaporation for summer maize in the ncp was approximately 30 of the total seasonal et zhang et al 2005 indicated that using the straw from winter wheat to mulch summer maize could reduce soil evaporation up to 40 mm during a growing season therefore the increased canopy coverage and the use of straw mulch all contributed to the improved wp in the ncp 4 2 harvest index effects on wpg biomass production for maize requires large amounts of water and nutrients the increase in hi would allow a more stable yield as well as improved water and nutrient use efficiency nue yang and zhang 2010 harvest index has a high heritability and is less affected by environmental factors maize usually has hi ranging from 0 25 to 0 58 the values for modern varieties usually fall within the range of 0 4 0 6 hay 1995 during the entire experimental duration of this study hi was improved by 48 which contributed to 64 of the wpg increase the results from this study indicated that breeding efforts had the positive effects on biomass production and its partitioning without apparent increasing in water use the yield improvement driven by biomass or hi had increased water productivity results from curin et al 2020 demonstrated that breeding efforts on maize had unintended positive effects on radiation and water use efficiency which are welcome on a global scale considering that the predicted trends of water shortage will require increased water productivity rather than increased water use by crops the modern hybrid maize already has a high hi the results from this study indicated that the average hi for summer maize has remained at approximately 0 56 in 2010 s fig 8 further hi improvements for maize would require breakthroughs in new varieties and management skills in the ncp hütsch and schubert 2017 suggested using different phytohormones to either enhance the activity of h atpase for better kernel setting or reduce the shoot growth for higher hi the results from this study also showed that during the 2000 s reduced biomass production was observed however with improved hi the maize yield was maintained and wpg was significantly increased genetic or agronomic improvements to hi are becoming more important for higher resource use efficiency under resource limited environments 4 3 maintaining high yield and high wp under a changing climate many studies indicated that the significant seasonal yield variation in maize was due to the variation in weather factors liu et al 2010 ray et al 2015 sun et al 2016 farmaha et al 2016 fang et al 2019 managing practices to minimize the negative effects of climate on maize production are becoming more important lobell and asner 2003 rurinda et al 2015 ruffo et al 2015 rahimi moghaddam et al 2018 seed weight was the major factor affecting the annual yield fluctuation under full water supply conditions for maize in the ncp fang et al 2019 the critical period that determines seed weight is from the blister stage to maturity fang et al 2019 during this period wide daily temperature ranges and extended sunshine exposure would result in a higher seed weight however the climate changing trend showed declining trends for both factors therefore under the current changing climate the growing condition for summer maize especially during the grain fill duration is deteriorating ceglar et al 2016 reported that temperature and solar radiation contributed to the variation in spring maize yield in france wang et al 2014 also showed that temperature and solar radiation were the main weather factors that caused summer maize yield fluctuation in china crops with adequate canopy structure to intercept more solar radiation may provide a benefit for dry matter accumulation stewart et al 2003 in addition to the cultivar leaf structure changing the planting patterns would also affect the exposure to solar radiation lu et al 2017 indicated that more uniform planting of summer maize increased the light capture at vegetative stages which accelerated the biomass accumulation sun et al 2016 indicated that optimizing planting density could reduce the seasonal yield variation of summer maize caused by weather factors in the same region the yield improvement related to the practices described above would also favor or maintain a higher wpg for maize under a changing climate 5 conclusion previous studies using long term field experiments have mostly focused on grain yield changes while this study provided an opportunity to examine the historical wp changes and their related factors the results from this study indicated the improvement in maize wpg for the past 40 years is largely attributed to the improvement in hi after modern hybrids were introduced in recent years hi was maintained at a relatively higher and stable level further improvement in wpg induced by hi will need breakthrough in breeding to further increase wpg through manipulating biomass production was another opportunity under a changing climate the growing condition for maize in this region is becoming less favorable and there is large variation in seasonal yield management practices such as optimizing plant density and narrowing row spacing to increase solar radiation exposure are possible options to improve maize production and water productivity in the ncp in the future declaration of competing interest the

10189,greenhouse industry has been rapidly expanded worldwide an accurate partitioning evapotranspiration et into transpiration t r and evaporation e s is critical for developing precise irrigation scheduling and enhancing water productivity in greenhouses here we proposed a modified priestley taylor mpt model considering the effects of leaf senescence and plant temperature constraint on t r and effect of index of soil water stress f sw on e s to estimate e s t r and et in the mpt model the performance of three sub models for estimating e s was evaluated the mpt model was assessed based on the measurements in 2016 2017 2019 and 2020 the et e s and t r of greenhouse grown tomato under drip irrigation were measured by the weighting lysimeters micro lysimeters and sap flow monitor system respectively results showed that the total seasonal et of tomato was 315 1 350 8 mm of which 15 4 26 5 was consumed by e s the partitioning of et was controlled by leaf area index lai as indicated by a significant logarithmical relationship between e s et and lai lai and air temperature t a are two important factors affecting et as shown by good correlations between pt coefficient α m and lai t a the daily e s can be reasonably estimated by the sub model with the soil water related f sw moreover the mpt model can also well estimate hourly and daily t r and et hence can be used as a tool to develop precise irrigation scheduling for similar greenhouse cultivation keywords boundary line analysis modified priestley taylor model plant transpiration soil evaporation sensitivity analysis 1 introduction nowadays the development of precise agriculture production should consider efficient use of water resources blasco et al 2007 greenhouse as a protected cultivation agriculture has been recommended as a suitable strategy to improve water productivity rahimikhoob et al 2020 shamshiri et al 2018 in china solar greenhouse is a widely adopted type by local farmers because no extra heating system is needed solar energy is stored and released through back wall and underneath soil to maintain the indoor air temperature which can meet the requirement of vegetable growth according to ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic the area of solar greenhouse cultivation has expanded 1 36 times from 2008 0 25 million ha to 2018 0 59 million ha since no precipitation is received in greenhouses irrigation is the only source of water supply for crops grown in greenhouses hence a scientific and reasonable irrigation scheduling is critical for improving crop water productivity in greenhouses in farmland almost all of irrigation water is consumed by plant transpiration t r and soil evaporation e s referring to as evapotranspiration et kool et al 2016 gong et al 2019 reported that the e s and t r of drip irrigated tomato accounted for 25 and 75 of et respectively over the whole growing season in a greenhouse generally the e s can be regarded as an ineffective water consumption which has no effect on formation of production hence e s should be as small as possible especially in arid and semi arid regions which can be achieved by farmland management such as mulching and appropriate irrigation technology allen et al 2005 conversely the t r can affect crop growth and production which should be paid more attention katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 li et al 2020 therefore accurate partitioning et into e s and t r during the crop growing period is highly required to develop precise irrigation scheduling in greenhouses since direct measurement of e s t r and et are costly and timely several mathematic models have been developed to separate e s and t r allen et al 2005 monteith and unsworth 2008 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 utset et al 2004 when reviewing recent literatures two layer shuttleworth wallace sw model has robust performance in separating e s and t r and has been applied in the greenhouse grown tomato gong et al 2019 and cucumber huang et al 2019 however the sw model required substantial input parameters and parameterization limiting its application gharsallah et al 2013 the dual crop coefficient dual k c method is another approach to separate e s and t r and has been successfully used in greenhouses gong et al 2019 libardi et al 2019 however the daily scale dual k c model may limit its application in smaller scale such as in hourly et the well known energy driven priestley taylor pt model priestley and taylor 1972 has been extensively used and offers a compromise between model complexity and predictive skills the et in the pt model was estimated by multiplying a pt coefficient α e and the equilibrium evaporation eteq where eteq only depends on meteorological conditions including net radiation r n ground soil heat flux g and air temperature t a especially the modified pt model can also effectively estimate e s and t r according to received available energy flux by the underlying surface ding et al 2013a qiu et al 2019 in addition numerous studies have indicated that crop et was primary controlled by radiation both for crops planted in open fields irmak et al 2008 qiu et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 and in greenhouses gong et al 2020 li et al 2020 which provided a basis for selecting pt model to predict crop et however to the best of our knowledge in solar greenhouses rare study focus on assessing the performance of pt model for estimating e s t r and et which may be partly due to the difficulty for obtaining accurately short term crop et and its components as mentioned earlier the successful use of the pt model also requires precise determination of the αe ai and yang 2016 ding et al 2013a pereira 2004 pereira and villa nova 1992 qiu et al 2019 2021a utset et al 2004 although a number of reports have showed that the αe could be used as a constant 1 26 on some vegetated surface pereira 2004 utset et al 2004 conversely numerous studies believe that the αe was variable over the whole growing stage and changed greatly with mulching ai and yang 2016 ding et al 2013a green canopy fraction jiao et al 2018 soil moisture availability liu et al 2019 and leaf senescence qiu et al 2019 they suggested that the αe should be modified according to its main affecting factors which largely linked to the coefficient of e s α s and t r α c for separating e s and t r from et the factors affecting α s and α c reported in the literature include air temperature relative humidity soil moisture availability and leaf area index lai ai and yang 2016 ding et al 2013a ershadi et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 2021a steduto et al 2009 tanner and jury 1976 therefore developing a dynamic function of αe in greenhouses taking into account various limited factors is critical for estimation of e s t r and et another controversy in existing studies is how to determine the key parameters of the e s sub model index of soil water stress for e s f sw deardorff 1977 showed that the f sw was mainly related to surface soil water content and can be calculated by the effective surface saturation in the soil depth of 0 0 1 m yao et al 2013 indicated that the f sw was largely controlled by the diurnal temperature range while ershadi et al 2014 showed that the f sw can be expressed as a function of vapor pressure deficit and relative humidity the latter two methods have been proved in estimating large scale e s however fewer attempts have been made to compare the performance of three e s sub model in the pt model therefore in this study in order to accurate partition et into e s and t r we proposed a modified pt mpt model by incorporating the effect of plant temperature constraint and leaf senescence on t r and effect of index of soil water stress on e s the performance of the mpt model for estimating e s t r and et on hourly daily scale was evaluated based on the four year measurements of greenhouse grown tomato in northern china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was carried out in a solar greenhouse for four years i e 2016 2017 2019 and 2020 at the agro ecological experimental station which is located in xinxiang city henan province of china 35 86 n 113 68 e altitude 78 7 m the average annual air temperature is 14 2 c the coldest month is in january with a mean value of 0 7 c whereas the hottest month is in july with an average value of 27 1 c the average annual precipitation is 573 mm which mainly concentrated in july and august a local solar greenhouse was used in the experiment which is 60 m in length and 8 5 m in width the greenhouse is a steel frame structure oriented in the east west direction top of the greenhouse was covered with polyethylene sheet at night the surface of the sheet was spread with a 25 mm thick cotton quilt to maintain the interior temperature especially during seedlings stage a local leading variety solanum lycopersicum c v jinding of tomato was used for four year experiment the planting pattern for tomato was wide 65 cm and narrow 40 cm rows two rows of tomato seedlings were transplanted along the edge of narrow row 30 cm within rows in the north south direction a drip irrigation system was used with one drip line per crop row and the spacing of emitter is the same as plant spacing pressure compensated emitters with discharge rate 1 1 l h 1 were used to ensure the survival of seedlings 20 mm water was irrigated by a drip irrigation system after transplanting thereafter the irrigation scheduling was determined according to the measurement of an evaporation pan 20 cm in diameter and 11 cm in depth which was located 20 cm height above the tomato canopy when the measurements of cumulative evaporation e p reached 20 2 mm the

the lysimeter was filled with 10 cm layer of coarse gravel to facilitate drainage in each weighting lysimeter six tomato plants were planted with the same planting pattern as outside daily soil evaporation e s was determined by four micro lysimeters in 2016 2019 and 2020 four cylinders of micro lysimeters made by galvanized iron with diameter of 10 cm and depth of 15 cm were installed within and between rows in order to make the operation more convenient four outer cylinders with a slightly larger diameter 12 cm in diameter 15 cm in depth were pre buried into the ground in order to avoid the influence of heat conduction on soil evaporation inner cylinders are wrapped with heat insulating wool during the measurement period the inner cylinders were weighted every day at 8 00 am by using an electronic scale with an accuracy of 0 1 g the soil of inner cylinders was replaced every 2 3 days as well as after each irrigation event in this study two stages of e s were distinguished by

greenhouse during the whole growing season of tomato in 2016 2017 2019 and 2020 the monthly total r n varied from 43 3 to 334 5mjm 2 the maximum monthly mean t a and vpd were frequently occurred in june and july and the four year average values were 23 6 c and 0 95kpa respectively the values of monthly average u 2 were low in greenhouse due to the limited ventilation system ranging from 0 08 to 0 21 m s 1 during the whole growing seasons 3 2 soil evaporation es et and relationship between es et and lai the total and daily et and e s e s et and mean lai for the greenhouse grown tomato in different months are shown in table 3 the annual variation of total et was small with a mean value of 330 5 mm and a standard deviation of 18 3 mm which may be attributed to the similar microclimate condition among these years the consumption of et mainly concentrated in may and june accounting for more than 65 of total the variation of et rate in different months was similar in four year experiment the et rate increased rapidly from 1 05 mmd 1 in march to 3 79 mmd 1 in may or june and then decreased to 2 60 mmd 1 in july table 3 the average daily et rate of drip irrigated tomato over the whole growing period varied from 2 54 to 2 83 mmd 1 which was comparable with the water consumption reported in many studies under greenhouse condition liu et al 2013 wang et al 2011 yuan et al 2001 these values were lower than those under furrow irrigation while higher than those in winter season in a similar solar greenhouse li et al 2020 the e s rate decreased from 0 70 mmd 1 in mar to 0 40 mmd 1 in jun and then increased to 0 64 mmd 1 in jul table 3 this trend can be explained by the variations of canopy coverage or lai ai et al 2018 gong et al 2017a b 2019 hossen et al 2012 qiu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 during the seedling stage the low canopy coverage or lai allows more energy reached the soil surface resulted in a high e s rate with the increased canopy coverage or lai more energy was received by crop canopy leading to a reduction of e s rate in the late stage e s rate increased gradually due to leaf senescence the variations of e s et in difference months showed similar trend with that of e s rate varying between 0 11 and 0 59 these values were comparable with the values ranged from 0 05 to 0 45 reported in huang et al 2019 however for greenhouse grown pepper under furrow irrigation with film mulching the average seasonal e s only accounted for 6 1 of et over the whole growing season qiu et al 2015 the variation of e s et is closely related to lai θ and coverage type qiu et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 since the soil water content was not limited here the e s et was mainly affected by lai a significantly logarithmic function was found between e s et and lai as shown in fig 2 25 e s et a ln lai b where a and b are empirical coefficients this form of function was also derived for rain fed spring maize gao et al 2018 when reviewing the literature various forms of function were reported between e s et or tr et and lai for varying canopy types zhao et al 2018 although qiu et al 2019 established a linear function between e s et and lai for winter wheat majority studies have shown that the correlation between e s et and lai was nonlinear e g polynomial exponential logarithmic and power functions which may be attributed to the difference in energy received by soil surface and canopy alberto et al 2014 gong et al 2017a 2017b liu et al 2002 qiu et al 2019 3 3 controlling factors of et former study displayed that the r n was the leading factor determining et and mainly through direct action which provides a basis for selecting the energy driven pt model to estimate et gong et al 2020 the λeteq described the amount of surface available energy received monteith and unsworth 2008 therefore the measured pt coefficient α m λet λeteq a normalized et was frequently used to quantify the relationship between et and ecological i e lai and environmental factors i e vpd and t a ding et al 2013a liu et al 2019 in this study the pooled data from four year experiment were used to analysis the correlation between α m and other ecological and environmental factors a significant power function was found between α m and lai with r 2 of 0 976 fig 3a the increased α m with increasing lai indicate that the rate of energy absorbed by the canopy increased as the crop grew different forms of empirical correlations between α m and lai have been reported gao et al 2018 reported that the α m increased linearly with increasing lai for rain fed spring maize however a threshold lai of 2 8 3 0 m2 m 2 for relation between α m and lai for maize was found ding et al 2013a jiao et al 2018 which may be attributed to relative low increase rate of energy received by the crop canopy when lai 2 8 3 0 m2 m 2 in addition at the maturity stage the stomata may partial closure as a result of leaf senescence and the decline of leaf physiological function which affect t r and et steduto and hsiao 1998 and ding et al 2013a also indicated that et rate decreased drastically due to leaf senescence therefore the effect of leaf senescence was taken into account in the mpt model by using fraction of leaf senescence f s the variation of vpd 0 4 3kpa was insensitive to α m as shown in fig 3b the similar result was also reported by ding et al 2013a and eichinger et al 1996 the possible reason may be related to the fact that et for crops grown in greenhouses was less affected by vpd gong et al 2020 agam et al 2010 also indicated that most crops have a small change in α m when vpd was in a range of 0 4 0kpa the α m significantly increased as t a increased fig 3c indicating that et was significantly influenced by t a former studies also showed that t a was a limited factor affecting et gong et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 this result provided a basis for considering plant temperature constraint f t in the mpt model 3 4 estimation of es tr and et by the modified pt model 3 4 1 performance in estimating es fig 4 presents the scatter plots between estimated and measured e s in two stages during the whole growing season in 2016 2019 and 2020 the overall performance of the pt f sw 1 model was acceptable and better than that of the pt f sw 2 and the pt f sw 3 models table 4 this is because e s is a physical process and highly correlated with soil moisture jiang et al 2016 kerridge et al 2013 naveen gupta et al 2019 raz yaseef et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 although former study showed that the f sw 2 closely related to the s e yao et al 2013 the pt f sw 2 model still greatly underestimated e s in greenhouse in addition the performance of three models for estimating e s during the stage 2 was better than the stage 1 which may be attributed to the fact that e s in greenhouse was also influenced by other environmental factors such as vpd during the stage 1 the statistical analysis of the three e s models also showed underestimation of e s for greenhouse grown tomato table 4 the possible reasons are as follows 1 the correlation between crop physiological characteristics and canopy or lai and surface soil moisture were ignored in the models zhao et al 2018 2 the wetted soil surface was nonuniform under drip irrigation leading to a bias for measured e s and soil water content allen et al 2005 3 4 2 performance in estimating tr statistical analysis shows that the estimated hourly values of t r were close to the measured ones in 2016 and 2020 with the b 0 of 0 93 0 94 and r2 of 0 92 0 94 fig 5a and table 5 the mae and rmse between measured and estimated hourly t r were 0 04 and 0 06 mm h 1 respectively in 2016 and 0 06 and 0 08 mm h 1 respectively in 2020 table 5 the estimated daily t r by the mpt model also showed a good agreement with measurements with the b 0 of 0 94 0 95 r2 of 0 97 0 98 mae of 0 39 0 44 mmd 1 and rmse of 0 50 0 54 mmd 1 table 5 these statistical indicators indicate that t r of greenhouse grown tomato can be well estimated by the mpt model the possible reason is that t r was primary controlled by r n for greenhouse grown crops gong et al 2020 and the radiation based mpt model has advantages than other models in estimating t r for crops grown in greenhouses particularly for crops with a great t r et over the whole growing period 3 4 3 performance in estimating et there was a good agreement between estimated and measured hourly and daily et for greenhouse grown tomato fig 6 and table 5 the b 0 were 1 01 1 08 and 0 95 1 00 for hourly and daily scales respectively the r 2 changed from 0 88 to 0 91 in various seasons both for hourly and daily scales suggesting that the mpt model can explain most of the total variance of measured et the values of mae and rmse were 0 05 mm h 1 and 0 08 mm h 1 respectively in hourly scale and 0 35 0 46 mmd 1 and 0 53 0 56 mmd 1 respectively in daily scale table 5 these statistical indicators show that et of greenhouse grown tomato can be reasonably reproduced by the mpt model in both hourly and daily scales valdés gómez et al 2009 also suggested that the pt model can reasonably model the et of greenhouse grown tomato and can be used for irrigation scheduling in addition the mpt model was also widely used in open field crops and showed an acceptable accuracy ai and yang 2016 ding et al 2013a ershadi et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 2021a yao et al 2013 the dynamic α e in these studies was developed based on a combination of various factors such as meteorological t a rh and solar radiation plant lai and green canopy fraction and soil variables soil water content and mulching although mpt can reasonably estimate et there still existed some bias between estimated and measured et this may be partly attributed to the errors in et measurement by the weighting lysimeters both small area and edge effect of the device may prevent the lateral movement of soil water resulting in the measurement errors of et rana and katerji 2000 ding et al 2013b suspected that the uncertainty of measurements by weighing lysimeter after irrigation will also lead to bias in the measurement of et 3 5 sensitivity analysis of the modified pt model the analysis of sensitivity for the mpt model to uncertainties in input variables i e t a θ lai and f s is shown in fig 7 where t a and θ were linked to the f t and f sw respectively the variation of input parameters was set to 30 and then the percentage variations in predicted e s t r and et were evaluated predicted e s was very sensitive to lai with the deviation ranging from 107 to 50 fig 7a while insensitive to f s because leaf senescence of greenhouse grown tomato mainly occurred at the late stage when the e s rate was small predicted t r was sensitive to t a and lai with the deviation ranging from 12 to 46 fig 7b while insensitive to θ in the depth of 0 10 cm this is not surprising since the opening of leaf stomata is affected by t a and the magnitude of t r is closely related to lai gao et al 2018 jiao et al 2018 the non limited soil water content leads to the insensitive of t r to θ the et was sensitive to t a varying from 14 to 40 but insensitive to f s the sensitivity of et to θ is comparable to lai fig 7c qiu et al 2019 indicated that the mpt model was sensitive to t a but insensitive to θ and lai for open field rice winter wheat rotation system garcía et al 2013 showed that f t and f sw were the two most sensitive variables for the mpt model in grassland and an open woody savannah the difference in the sensitivity of these parameters to the mpt model may be attributed to crop species and environmental conditions 4 conclusions a four year experiment showed that the seasonal et of greenhouse grown tomato was 330 5 18 3 mm and seasonal mean daily et varied from 2 54 to 2 83 mmd 1 total e s accounted for 15 4 26 5 of total seasonal et and e s et logarithmic decreased with increased lai the et for greenhouse grown tomato was mainly controlled by r n and greatly impacted by lai and t a when comparing three sub models of e s in the mpt model we found that the e s estimates by sub model considering available soil water content were in good agreement with the measured ones the sub model for t r produced an acceptable accuracy in simulation hourly and daily t r the mpt model incorporating the effects of f t f sw and f s on et could accurately predict et of greenhouse grown tomato both in hourly and daily scales hence can be used as a simple tool to develop exact irrigation scheduling for similar greenhouse cultivation declaration of

10189,greenhouse industry has been rapidly expanded worldwide an accurate partitioning evapotranspiration et into transpiration t r and evaporation e s is critical for developing precise irrigation scheduling and enhancing water productivity in greenhouses here we proposed a modified priestley taylor mpt model considering the effects of leaf senescence and plant temperature constraint on t r and effect of index of soil water stress f sw on e s to estimate e s t r and et in the mpt model the performance of three sub models for estimating e s was evaluated the mpt model was assessed based on the measurements in 2016 2017 2019 and 2020 the et e s and t r of greenhouse grown tomato under drip irrigation were measured by the weighting lysimeters micro lysimeters and sap flow monitor system respectively results showed that the total seasonal et of tomato was 315 1 350 8 mm of which 15 4 26 5 was consumed by e s the partitioning of et was controlled by leaf area index lai as indicated by a significant logarithmical relationship between e s et and lai lai and air temperature t a are two important factors affecting et as shown by good correlations between pt coefficient α m and lai t a the daily e s can be reasonably estimated by the sub model with the soil water related f sw moreover the mpt model can also well estimate hourly and daily t r and et hence can be used as a tool to develop precise irrigation scheduling for similar greenhouse cultivation keywords boundary line analysis modified priestley taylor model plant transpiration soil evaporation sensitivity analysis 1 introduction nowadays the development of precise agriculture production should consider efficient use of water resources blasco et al 2007 greenhouse as a protected cultivation agriculture has been recommended as a suitable strategy to improve water productivity rahimikhoob et al 2020 shamshiri et al 2018 in china solar greenhouse is a widely adopted type by local farmers because no extra heating system is needed solar energy is stored and released through back wall and underneath soil to maintain the indoor air temperature which can meet the requirement of vegetable growth according to ministry of agriculture and rural affairs of the people s republic the area of solar greenhouse cultivation has expanded 1 36 times from 2008 0 25 million ha to 2018 0 59 million ha since no precipitation is received in greenhouses irrigation is the only source of water supply for crops grown in greenhouses hence a scientific and reasonable irrigation scheduling is critical for improving crop water productivity in greenhouses in farmland almost all of irrigation water is consumed by plant transpiration t r and soil evaporation e s referring to as evapotranspiration et kool et al 2016 gong et al 2019 reported that the e s and t r of drip irrigated tomato accounted for 25 and 75 of et respectively over the whole growing season in a greenhouse generally the e s can be regarded as an ineffective water consumption which has no effect on formation of production hence e s should be as small as possible especially in arid and semi arid regions which can be achieved by farmland management such as mulching and appropriate irrigation technology allen et al 2005 conversely the t r can affect crop growth and production which should be paid more attention katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 li et al 2020 therefore accurate partitioning et into e s and t r during the crop growing period is highly required to develop precise irrigation scheduling in greenhouses since direct measurement of e s t r and et are costly and timely several mathematic models have been developed to separate e s and t r allen et al 2005 monteith and unsworth 2008 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 utset et al 2004 when reviewing recent literatures two layer shuttleworth wallace sw model has robust performance in separating e s and t r and has been applied in the greenhouse grown tomato gong et al 2019 and cucumber huang et al 2019 however the sw model required substantial input parameters and parameterization limiting its application gharsallah et al 2013 the dual crop coefficient dual k c method is another approach to separate e s and t r and has been successfully used in greenhouses gong et al 2019 libardi et al 2019 however the daily scale dual k c model may limit its application in smaller scale such as in hourly et the well known energy driven priestley taylor pt model priestley and taylor 1972 has been extensively used and offers a compromise between model complexity and predictive skills the et in the pt model was estimated by multiplying a pt coefficient α e and the equilibrium evaporation eteq where eteq only depends on meteorological conditions including net radiation r n ground soil heat flux g and air temperature t a especially the modified pt model can also effectively estimate e s and t r according to received available energy flux by the underlying surface ding et al 2013a qiu et al 2019 in addition numerous studies have indicated that crop et was primary controlled by radiation both for crops planted in open fields irmak et al 2008 qiu et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 and in greenhouses gong et al 2020 li et al 2020 which provided a basis for selecting pt model to predict crop et however to the best of our knowledge in solar greenhouses rare study focus on assessing the performance of pt model for estimating e s t r and et which may be partly due to the difficulty for obtaining accurately short term crop et and its components as mentioned earlier the successful use of the pt model also requires precise determination of the αe ai and yang 2016 ding et al 2013a pereira 2004 pereira and villa nova 1992 qiu et al 2019 2021a utset et al 2004 although a number of reports have showed that the αe could be used as a constant 1 26 on some vegetated surface pereira 2004 utset et al 2004 conversely numerous studies believe that the αe was variable over the whole growing stage and changed greatly with mulching ai and yang 2016 ding et al 2013a green canopy fraction jiao et al 2018 soil moisture availability liu et al 2019 and leaf senescence qiu et al 2019 they suggested that the αe should be modified according to its main affecting factors which largely linked to the coefficient of e s α s and t r α c for separating e s and t r from et the factors affecting α s and α c reported in the literature include air temperature relative humidity soil moisture availability and leaf area index lai ai and yang 2016 ding et al 2013a ershadi et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 2021a steduto et al 2009 tanner and jury 1976 therefore developing a dynamic function of αe in greenhouses taking into account various limited factors is critical for estimation of e s t r and et another controversy in existing studies is how to determine the key parameters of the e s sub model index of soil water stress for e s f sw deardorff 1977 showed that the f sw was mainly related to surface soil water content and can be calculated by the effective surface saturation in the soil depth of 0 0 1 m yao et al 2013 indicated that the f sw was largely controlled by the diurnal temperature range while ershadi et al 2014 showed that the f sw can be expressed as a function of vapor pressure deficit and relative humidity the latter two methods have been proved in estimating large scale e s however fewer attempts have been made to compare the performance of three e s sub model in the pt model therefore in this study in order to accurate partition et into e s and t r we proposed a modified pt mpt model by incorporating the effect of plant temperature constraint and leaf senescence on t r and effect of index of soil water stress on e s the performance of the mpt model for estimating e s t r and et on hourly daily scale was evaluated based on the four year measurements of greenhouse grown tomato in northern china

2 m lever principle with high precision electronic scale were equipped in the weighing lysimeters the soil texture in weighing lysimeter was almost the same as the surrounding field and the bottom of the lysimeter was filled with 10 cm layer of coarse gravel to facilitate drainage in each weighting lysimeter six tomato plants were planted with the same planting pattern as outside daily soil evaporation e s was determined by four micro lysimeters in 2016 2019 and 2020 four cylinders of micro lysimeters made by galvanized iron with diameter of 10 cm and depth of 15 cm were installed within and between rows in order to make the operation more convenient four outer cylinders with a slightly larger diameter 12 cm in diameter 15 cm in depth were pre buried into the ground in order to avoid the influence of heat conduction on soil evaporation inner cylinders are wrapped with heat insulating wool during the measurement period the inner cylinders were weighted every day at 8 00 am by using an electronic scale with an accuracy of 0 1 g the soil of inner cylinders was replaced every 2 3 days as well as after each irrigation event in this study two stages of e s were distinguished by comparing the cumulative depth of evaporation d e and readily evaporable water rew 8 mm for silt loam allen et al 1998 stage 1 is the energy limiting stage when d e rew the stage 2 is termed falling

relationship between the measured middle day pt coefficient α m and lai vpd and t a in the bla method top dependent variable point should be selected for each corresponding independent variable range

greenhouse during the whole growing season of tomato in 2016 2017 2019 and 2020 the monthly total r n varied from 43 3 to 334 5mjm 2 the maximum monthly mean t a and vpd were frequently occurred in june and july and the four year average values were 23 6 c and 0 95kpa respectively the values of monthly average u 2 were low in greenhouse due to the limited ventilation system ranging from 0 08 to 0 21 m s 1 during the whole growing seasons 3 2 soil evaporation es et and relationship between es et and lai the total and daily et and e s e s et and mean lai for the greenhouse grown tomato in different months are shown in table 3 the annual variation of total et was small with a mean value of 330 5 mm and a standard deviation of 18 3 mm which may be attributed to the similar microclimate condition among these years the consumption of et mainly concentrated in may and june accounting for more than 65 of total the variation of et rate in different months was similar in four year experiment the et rate increased rapidly from 1 05 mmd 1 in march to 3 79 mmd 1 in may or june and then decreased to 2 60 mmd 1 in july table 3 the average daily et rate of drip irrigated tomato over the whole growing period varied from 2 54 to 2 83 mmd 1 which was comparable with the water consumption reported in many studies under greenhouse condition liu et al 2013 wang et al 2011 yuan et al 2001 these values were lower than those under furrow irrigation while higher than those in winter season in a similar solar greenhouse li et al 2020 the e s rate decreased from 0 70 mmd 1 in mar to 0 40 mmd 1 in jun and then increased to 0 64 mmd 1 in jul table 3 this trend can be explained by the variations of canopy coverage or lai ai et al 2018 gong et al 2017a b 2019 hossen et al 2012 qiu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 during the seedling stage the low canopy coverage or lai allows more energy reached the soil surface resulted in a high e s rate with the increased canopy coverage or lai more energy was received by crop canopy leading to a reduction of e s rate in the late stage e s rate increased gradually due to leaf senescence the variations of e s et in difference months showed similar trend with that of e s rate varying between 0 11 and 0 59 these values were comparable with the values ranged from 0 05 to 0 45 reported in huang et al 2019 however for greenhouse grown pepper under furrow irrigation with film mulching the average seasonal e s only accounted for 6 1 of et over the whole growing season qiu et al 2015 the variation of e s et is closely related to lai θ and coverage type qiu et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 since the soil water content was not limited here the e s et was mainly affected by lai a significantly logarithmic function was found between e s et and lai as shown in fig 2 25 e s et a ln lai b where a and b are empirical coefficients this form of function was also derived for rain fed spring maize gao et al 2018 when reviewing the literature various forms of function were reported between e s et or tr et and lai for varying canopy types zhao et al 2018 although qiu et al 2019 established a linear function between e s et and lai for winter wheat majority studies have shown that the correlation between e s et and lai was nonlinear e g polynomial exponential logarithmic and power functions which may be attributed to the difference in energy received by soil surface and canopy alberto et al 2014 gong et al 2017a 2017b liu et al 2002 qiu et al 2019 3 3 controlling factors of et former study displayed that the r n was the leading factor determining et and mainly through direct action which provides a basis for selecting the energy driven pt model to estimate et gong et al 2020 the λeteq described the amount of surface available energy received monteith and unsworth 2008 therefore the measured pt coefficient α m λet λeteq a normalized et was frequently used to quantify the relationship between et and ecological i e lai and environmental factors i e vpd and t a ding et al 2013a liu et al 2019 in this study the pooled data from four year experiment were used to analysis the correlation between α m and other ecological and environmental factors a significant power function was found between α m and lai with r 2 of 0 976 fig 3a the increased α m with increasing lai indicate that the rate of energy absorbed by the canopy increased as the crop grew different forms of empirical correlations between α m and lai have been reported gao et al 2018 reported that the α m increased linearly with increasing lai for rain fed spring maize however a threshold lai of 2 8 3 0 m2 m 2 for relation between α m and lai for maize was found ding et al 2013a jiao et al 2018 which may be attributed to relative low increase rate of energy received by the crop canopy when lai 2 8 3 0 m2 m 2 in addition at the maturity stage the stomata may partial closure as a result of leaf senescence and the decline of leaf physiological function which affect t r and et steduto and hsiao 1998 and ding et al 2013a also indicated that et rate decreased drastically due to leaf senescence therefore the effect of leaf senescence was taken into account in the mpt model by using fraction of leaf senescence f s the variation of vpd 0 4 3kpa was insensitive to α m as shown in fig 3b the similar result was also reported by ding et al 2013a and eichinger et al 1996 the possible reason may be related to the fact that et for crops grown in greenhouses was less affected by vpd gong et al 2020 agam et al 2010 also indicated that most crops have a small change in α m when vpd was in a range of 0 4 0kpa the α m significantly increased as t a increased fig 3c indicating that et was significantly influenced by t a former studies also showed that t a was a limited factor affecting et gong et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 this result provided a basis for considering plant temperature constraint f t in the mpt model 3 4 estimation of es tr and et by the modified pt model 3 4 1 performance in estimating es fig 4 presents the scatter plots between estimated and measured e s in two stages during the whole growing season in 2016 2019 and 2020 the overall performance of the pt f sw 1 model was acceptable and better than that of the pt f sw 2 and the pt f sw 3 models table 4 this is because e s is a physical process and highly correlated with soil moisture jiang et al 2016 kerridge et al 2013 naveen gupta et al 2019 raz yaseef et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 although former study showed that the f sw 2 closely related to the s e yao et al 2013 the pt f sw 2 model still greatly underestimated e s in greenhouse in addition the performance of three models for estimating e s during the stage 2 was better than the stage 1 which may be attributed to the fact that e s in greenhouse was also influenced by other environmental factors such as vpd during the stage 1 the statistical analysis of the three e s models also showed underestimation of e s for greenhouse grown tomato table 4 the possible reasons are as follows 1 the correlation between crop physiological characteristics and canopy or lai and surface soil moisture were ignored in the models zhao et al 2018 2 the wetted soil surface was nonuniform under drip irrigation leading to a bias for measured e s and soil water content allen et al 2005 3 4 2 performance in estimating tr statistical analysis shows that the estimated hourly values of t r were close to the measured ones in 2016 and 2020 with the b 0 of 0 93 0 94 and r2 of 0 92 0 94 fig 5a and table 5 the mae and rmse between measured and estimated hourly t r were 0 04 and 0 06 mm h 1 respectively in 2016 and 0 06 and 0 08 mm h 1 respectively in 2020 table 5 the estimated daily t r by the mpt model also showed a good agreement with measurements with the b 0 of 0 94 0 95 r2 of 0 97 0 98 mae of 0 39 0 44 mmd 1 and rmse of 0 50 0 54 mmd 1 table 5 these statistical indicators indicate that t r of greenhouse grown tomato can be well estimated by the mpt model the possible reason is that t r was primary controlled by r n for greenhouse grown crops gong et al 2020 and the radiation based mpt model has advantages than other models in estimating t r for crops grown in greenhouses particularly for crops with a great t r et over the whole growing period 3 4 3 performance in estimating et there was a good agreement between estimated and measured hourly and daily et for greenhouse grown tomato fig 6 and table 5 the b 0 were 1 01 1 08 and 0 95 1 00 for hourly and daily scales respectively the r 2 changed from 0 88 to 0 91 in various seasons both for hourly and daily scales suggesting that the mpt model can explain most of the total variance of measured et the values of mae and rmse were 0 05 mm h 1 and 0 08 mm h 1 respectively in hourly scale and 0 35 0 46 mmd 1 and 0 53 0 56 mmd 1 respectively in daily scale table 5 these statistical indicators show that et of greenhouse grown tomato can be reasonably reproduced by the mpt model in both hourly and daily scales valdés gómez et al 2009 also suggested that the pt model can reasonably model the et of greenhouse grown tomato and can be used for irrigation scheduling in addition the mpt model was also widely used in open field crops and showed an acceptable accuracy ai and yang 2016 ding et al 2013a ershadi et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 2021a yao et al 2013 the dynamic α e in these studies was developed based on a combination of various factors such as meteorological t a rh and solar radiation plant lai and green canopy fraction and soil variables soil water content and mulching although mpt can reasonably estimate et there still existed some bias between estimated and measured et this may be partly attributed to the errors in et measurement by the weighting lysimeters both small area and edge effect of the device may prevent the lateral movement of soil water resulting in the measurement errors of et rana and katerji 2000 ding et al 2013b suspected that the uncertainty of measurements by weighing lysimeter after irrigation will also lead to bias in the measurement of et 3 5 sensitivity analysis of the modified pt model the analysis of sensitivity for the mpt model to uncertainties in input variables i e t a θ lai and f s is shown in fig 7 where t a and θ were linked to the f t and f sw respectively the variation of input parameters was set to 30 and then the percentage variations in predicted e s t r and et were evaluated predicted e s was very sensitive to lai with the deviation ranging from 107 to 50 fig 7a while insensitive to f s because leaf senescence of greenhouse grown tomato mainly occurred at the late stage when the e s rate was small predicted t r was sensitive to t a and lai with the deviation ranging from 12 to 46 fig 7b while insensitive to θ in the depth of 0 10 cm this is not surprising since the opening of leaf stomata is affected by t a and the magnitude of t r is closely related to lai gao et al 2018 jiao et al 2018 the non limited soil water content leads to the insensitive of t r to θ the et was sensitive to t a varying from 14 to 40 but insensitive to f s the sensitivity of et to θ is comparable to lai fig 7c qiu et al 2019 indicated that the mpt model was sensitive to t a but insensitive to θ and lai for open field rice winter wheat rotation system garcía et al 2013 showed that f t and f sw were the two most sensitive variables for the mpt model in grassland and an open woody savannah the difference in the sensitivity of these parameters to the mpt model may be attributed to crop species and environmental conditions 4 conclusions a four year experiment showed that the seasonal et of greenhouse grown tomato was 330 5 18 3 mm and seasonal mean daily et varied from 2 54 to 2 83 mmd 1 total e s accounted for 15 4 26 5 of total seasonal et and e s et logarithmic decreased with increased lai the et for greenhouse grown tomato was mainly controlled by r n and greatly impacted by lai and t a when comparing three sub models of e s in the mpt model we found that the e s estimates by sub model considering available soil water content were in good agreement with the measured ones the sub model for t r produced an acceptable accuracy in simulation hourly and daily t r the mpt model incorporating the effects of f t f sw and f s on et could accurately predict et of greenhouse grown tomato both in hourly and daily scales hence can be used as a simple tool to develop exact irrigation scheduling for similar greenhouse cultivation declaration of
