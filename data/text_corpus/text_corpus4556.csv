22780,in this paper a flexible pipe conveying variable density fluid and simultaneously undergoing vortex induced vibrations viv is mathematically simulated and analysed resulting from multi phase flows the total fluid density inside the pipe may fluctuate temporally and spatially this variable density fluid is simulated with a mathematical model which obeys the conservation law of fluid mass for the external viv the lift force caused by vortices shedding is modelled with a classic van der pol wake oscillator based on the principle of hamilton the governing equations for the vibration of the pipe are derived when only considering the fluctuation of the internal fluid density the pipe is parametrically excited the parametric resonances are determined with the floquet theory after this the external viv is taken into account and the influence from the internal varying fluid density on the viv of the pipe is analysed in detail when the internal fluid density fluctuates with different circular frequency the vibrations of the pipe would become non uniform or aperiodic the root mean square displacement would increase or decrease with the increase of the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density these phenomena would become more obvious nevertheless the initial phase angle of the internal fluid density standing for the initial condition has seldom effect on the viv of the pipe keywords variable density fluid parametric excitation vortex induced vibrations internal and external fluid structure interactions 1 introduction the flexible pipes undergoing vortex induced vibrations viv can be found in many engineering components such as heat exchangers water suppliers marine risers and submarine pipelines these pipes are often used to transport fluid flows like water oil and gas the fluid flow inside the pipe may contain several types of fluids or impurities as a result the total fluid density may be unsteady and non homogenous along the pipe when the density of the internal fluid flow varies with time and space the viv of the pipe may become more complicated which needs further investigations blevins 1990 wu et al 2012 paı doussis 2014 as a typical fluid structure interaction the viv of flexible pipes have been extensively studied for several decades as comprehensively reviewed by sarpkaya 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 and wu et al 2012 when a pipe is subjected to an incoming fluid flow some vortices are shedding from the pipe alternately in the wake flow when the frequency of vortex shedding is close to one of the natural frequencies of the pipe the viv lock in or synchronization would occur the pipe would vibrate with large amplitudes resulting in severe structural fatigue damage or even failure williamson and govardhan 2004 to gain a thorough understanding about viv a large number of experiments have been performed with short elastically mounted rigid cylinders or long flexible model pipes in uniform sheared and stepped flows lehn 2003 trim et al 2005 gabbai and benaroya 2005 gao et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 xu et al 2017 2018 to simulate and predict viv the methods of computational fluid dynamics cfd huang et al 2011 wang and xiao 2016 have been employed moreover some semi empirical tools such as vivana shear7 and wake oscillator models sarpkaya 2004 chaplin et al 2005 facchinetti et al 2004 have also been developed recently thorsen et al 2016 proposed a new semi empirical model that can predict viv of flexible pipes in oscillating flows when only considering the fluid flow conveyed by pipes there is another fluid structure interaction which has also been widely investigated for many decades paı doussis 2014 li et al 2015 the internal fluid flow can add coriolis and centrifugal forces to the outside pipe for a simply supported pipe it would lose its stability and become buckling when the velocity of the internal fluid flow is sufficiently high paı doussis 2014 the fluid conveying pipe may also subject to viv from the external fluid flow the marine risers can be taken as an example in this circumstance the internal and external fluid structure interactions should be both considered guo and lou 2008 conducted a series of experiments to investigate the influence of the internal fluid flow on a model riser that was undergoing viv the experimental results demonstrated that as the internal flow velocity increases the riser s vibration amplitude would increase while the vibration frequency would decrease chen et al 2012 simulated a fluid conveying pipe subjected to viv in linearly sheared flows by utilizing cfd techniques they found that the vibration amplitude frequency and dominating mode of the pipe would be significantly affected by the fluid flow inside the pipe dai et al 2013 theoretically analysed the viv of a flexible pipe conveying fluid the velocity of the internal fluid flow was increased from the subcritical regime to the supercritical regime some complex dynamics of the pipe were found like chaotic oscillations subsequently the influences from the internal varying flow velocity dai et al 2014 and the top end fluctuating tension he et al 2017 on the viv of the pipe have been investigated recently meng et al 2017a 2017b carried out theoretical studies for a simply supported pipe and a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid and simultaneously undergoing viv up to now according to the authors best knowledge the fluid flow inside viv pipes is usually considered as a single phase flow the fluid density is a constant however when the pipe transports multi phase flows or the internal fluid flow contains impurities such as solid particles the total fluid density may change temporally and spatially along the pipe patel and seyed 1989 utilized a mathematical function to describe the variation of the fluid density of multi phase flows which were conveyed by flexible pipes ortega et al 2012 2013 employed the lagrangian slug tracking model to simulate a slug flow travelling in lazy wave and catenary risers respectively montoya hernández et al 2014 used a pseudo single phase flow to describe multi phase flows which contain water oil and gas chatjigeorgiou 2017 numerically studied the vibrations of catenary pipelines under the actions from the top harmonic motions and the internal slug flows these studies indicated that the dynamics of the pipe would be significantly affected by the internal fluid flow when the fluid density varies as for the viv of flexible pipes however there are still lacking of researches in the literature that have considered the variation of the internal fluid density therefore the main objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe this paper is organized as follows in section 2 a mathematical model for a flexible pipe conveying variable density fluid and simultaneously subjected to viv is established in section 3 the parametric excitation on the pipe caused by the internal varying fluid density is investigated then the influence from the internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe is further simulated and analysed in section 4 some conclusions of this paper are summarized in the last section 5 2 mathematical model as schematically shown in fig 1 a vertical flexible pipe conveying fluid and exposed to an external fluid flow is considered the internal and external fluids of the pipe are both assumed as incompressible the external fluid density ρ ex is constant while the internal fluid density ρ in x t may fluctuate with time t and space x since the pipe conveys multi phase flows the pipe is simply supported at both ends with a total length of l at the top end a pretension f n is given at the bottom end a cartesian coordinate system is built to describe the motion of the pipe the x and y axes are in the vertical and horizontal directions respectively the z axis is perpendicular to them and parallels with the velocity of the external fluid flow u 2 1 equations of the internal variable density fluid the pipe transports multi phase flows from the bottom to the top the total fluid density inside the pipe may vary temporally and spatially the varying fluid density could be simulated with a mathematical function which includes a constant component superposed a fluctuating component patel and seyed 1989 bai

the fluctuation of the fluid density in space ω is the circular frequency standing for the fluctuation of the fluid density in time and θ is the initial phase angle which is for the initial condition of the fluid density the fluid flow velocity u is related to the circular frequency and wave number of the fluid density patel and seyed 1989 it is 2 u ω k this mathematical model about variable density fluid conveyed by pipes satisfies the conservation law of fluid mass as confirmed by bai et al 2018 utilizing integral formulas it could also provide reasonable simulations for multi phase flows especially for the slug flows 2 2 equations of the external vortex induced forces when the external fluid flow passes the pipe with velocity u as shown in fig 1 some vortices are released from the pipe alternately and periodically which causes hydrodynamic forces acting on the pipe blevins 1990 these vortex induced forces f ex can be divided into a lift force f l and a drag force f d ogink

2 for a stationary circular cylinder 2 3 governing equations of the pipe motion since the pipe is continuous and flexible the governing equations for the motion of the pipe can be derived with the hamilton s principle paı doussis 2014 according to this principle the total kinetic energy e k potential energy e p and non conservative work w of the pipe system are integrated as 6 t 1 t 2 δ e k e p δ w d t 0 the total kinetic energy e k consists of kinetic energies from the internal fluid flow e k in the pipe structure e k p and the external fluid added mass e k ex they are written as 7 e k e k

fluid flow a p is the cross sectional area of the pipe structure and a ex a in a p is the total cross sectional area of the pipe i and j are the unit vectors in the x and y directions respectively ρ p is the density of the pipe structure c a is the coefficient of the external fluid added mass and it can be taken as one for a circular cylinder vibrating in the fluid the total potential energy of the pipe system e p is mainly composed of the elastic strain energy stored in the pipe structure e p p and the potential energy due to the gravity and external fluid buoyancy e p gf bar avi 2000 they are expressed as 11 e p e p p e p gf 12 e p p 0 l 1 2 ei 2 y x 2 2 dx 13 e p gf 0 l 1 2 x l a ex ρ ex a p ρ p a in ρ in x t gdx f n a in p in x l y x 2 dx where ei is the bending stiffness of the pipe

vortex induced forces they are 14 w 0 l c y t ydx 0 l f ex ydx where c is the damping coefficient of the pipe structure as the two ends of the pipe are both simply supported the boundary conditions are written as 15 y x 0 2 y x 2 x 0 y x l 2 y x 2 x l 0 by substituting eqs 7 14 into eq 6 and applying the hamilton s variation technique the governing equation for the motion of the pipe can be derived 16 a in ρ in x t 2 y t 2 2 u 2 y t x u 2 2 y x 2 a p ρ p 2 y t 2 c a a ex ρ ex 2 y t 2 x l a ex ρ ex a p ρ p a in ρ in x t gdx f n a in p in x l 2 y x 2 a ex ρ ex a p ρ p a in ρ in x t g y x

into eq 16 then the nonlinear coupled governing equations for a flexible pipe conveying variable density fluid and simultaneously subjected to viv are obtained they can be rewritten in dimensionless

the density of the internal fluid flow varies that means the pipe is parametrically excited by the internal varying fluid density nayfeh and mook 1995 kuiper et al 2008 in this section the parametric excitation is analysed and some parametric resonances are determined 3 1 solution method to investigate the parametric excitation on the pipe system the external vortex induced forces are neglected the governing equation of pipe motion is reduced to 18 β 1 1 ε c o s k ξ ω τ θ 2 η τ 2 2 v 1 2 η τ ξ v 1 2 2 η ξ 2 1 c a β 2 2 η τ 2 ξ 1 β 2 1 β 1 1 ε c o s k ξ ω τ θ g d ξ f n a p ξ 1 2 η ξ 2 β 2 1 β

displacement of the pipe is expressed as 19 η i 1 n ϕ i ξ e i τ in which ϕ i ξ is the modal function of the pipe which can be taken as ϕ i ξ s i n i π ξ for a simply supported pipe e i is the corresponding generalized coordinate and it is also denoted as the modal response or the modal weight factor trim et al 2005 n is the number of modal functions accounted by substituting eq 19 into eq 18 multiplying each term with ϕ j ξ s i n j π ξ and integrating from 0 to 1 with respect to ξ eq 18 is discretized and it can be expressed in a matrix form 20 m m 2 e τ 2 c c e τ k k e 0 in which e is the displacement vector of the modal responses m c and k are the time independent matrices of mass damping and stiffness of the system respectively whereas m c and k are the corresponding time

the pipe system are important for analysing the parametric excitation and the viv after solving the standard eigenvalue problem of eq 21 the complex frequencies of the pipe system are obtained the real parts of the complex frequencies stand for the natural frequencies the imaginary parts are the oscillating damping païdoussis 2014 as an example the dimensionless parameters of a fluid conveying pipe are taken as β 1 0 11 and f n ap ξ 1 c g 0 which are given by païdoussis 2014 in order to compare with the results of païdoussis 2014 the external fluid added mass and the internal varying fluid density are ignored with β 2 0 and ε 0 respectively in the present model the first ten modal functions are selected i e n 10 and the complex frequencies of the pipe are calculated the comparison results are plotted in the argand diagram of fig 2 the results from païdoussis 2014 have been modified in this figure because of different dimensionless quantities and variables fig 2 shows that the results of the present model agree well with the results obtained by païdoussis 2014 although there are some discrepancies these discrepancies might be generated by calculation errors from the truncation of the modal functions because eq 18 is discretized with the galerkin s method and for more modal functions accounted the calculation results would be more accuracy and the discrepancies would be smaller but the computing resources would be larger in fig 2 it can be known that when n 10 the discrepancies are acceptable with the increase of the internal fluid flow velocity v 1 the natural frequencies of the pipe system re ω are decreasing when v 1 increases to 3π the critical velocity the first mode natural frequency reduces to zero and a pitchfork bifurcation of the pipe would occur up to 6π the second mode natural frequency also reduces to zero when the fluid density inside the pipe fluctuates with time and space the instantaneous complex frequencies of the pipe system are calculated and plotted in fig 2 the variation of the internal fluid density is typically considered with ε 0 5 ω ω 1 v 1 6 k ω v 1 ω 1 6 and θ 0 where ω 1 is the first mode natural frequency of the pipe conveying constant density fluid ε 0 at v 1 6 fig 2 illustrates that as the dimensionless time τ increases the instantaneous complex frequencies are cycling in the argand diagram reflecting that the natural frequencies and damping of the pipe system are changing periodically with time this is reasonable because the internal fluid density is assumed as a periodic function of time as given in eq 1 3 3 parametric resonances the pipe is parametrically excited by the internal variable density fluid in parametric resonances the pipe would become unstable and vibrate with large amplitudes which is dangerous and should be avoided nayfeh and mook 1995 kuiper et al 2008 the floquet theory is employed to distinguish the stable and unstable regions of the pipe system nayfeh and mook 1995 paı doussis 2014 eq 21 is numerically integrated over a period of time t 2π ω for 2n times and for each time i i 1 2 2n the initial conditions of γ 0 are set as γ j i 1 and γ j i 0 j 1 2 2n where γ j is the element j of γ the system state transition matrix φ t is constructed as 22 φ t γ 1 t γ 2 t γ 2 n t where γ i t i 1 2 2n are the integration results at the end of the period the stability of the pipe is determined by considering the eigenvalues λ i i 1 2 2n of φ t if at least one of them has an absolute value larger than one λ i 1 the system is unstable to show the stability of the pipe system the dimensionless parameters are taken as v 1 6 β 1 0 11 β 2 0 2 f n ap ξ 1 c g 0 and θ 0 in which the external fluid added mass is considered the circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω is increased from 0 to 85 with an increment of 0 01 meanwhile the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density ε is increased from 0 to 1 with an increment of 0 02 nearly 8501 51 points have been calculated the stability diagram of the pipe is plotted in fig 3 the maximum eigenvalue of the state transition matrix λ i max is calculated for each point the colored areas represent the unstable regions since λ i max 1 while the white areas are the stable regions because of λ i max 1 the first three mode natural frequencies of the pipe are ω 1 6 62 ω 2 32 72 and ω 3 75 85 for constant density fluid at v 1 6 the unstable regions in fig 3 can be classified into simple parametric resonances ω ω 1 2 2ω 1 3 ω 1 2ω 1 ω 2 2ω 2 and ω 3 and combination resonances ω ω 1 ω 2 2 ω 1 ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 2 ω 2 ω 3 2 2 ω 1 ω 2 and ω 1 ω 3 nayfeh and mook 1995 paı doussis 2014 with the increase of the fluctuation amplitude ε the unstable regions generally become wider and the value of λ i max increases especially for the case of ω 2ω 1 the unstable regions are different for different resonance conditions as shown in fig 3 a possible reason for this is that the wave number of the internal fluid density k is changed with the circular frequency ω via k ω v 1 as the circular frequency ω increases the wave number k is also increased and the fluid density becomes more non uniform to further demonstrate the stability of the pipe system the dynamic responses of the pipe can be calculated by solving eq 21 with the fourth order runge kutta method the initial calculation conditions are set as e i 1 0 10 4 and de i dτ 0 i 1 2 10 six different cases are selected from fig 3 namely ω 10 ω 1 2ω 1 2ω 2 ω 1 ω 2 and ω 1 ω 3 2 they are represented for the stable regions simple parametric resonances and combination resonances the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density is chosen as ε 0 8 the first five modal responses are plotted in fig 4 to clearly show the modes of the pipe being excited for different cases the case of ω 10 is taken as an example for the stable regions fig 4 a shows that the modal responses e i i 1 2 3 4 and 5 of the pipe almost remain constant after the initial perturbation in the unstable regions however the vibration amplitudes of the excited modal responses are exponentially increased with time as shown in fig 4 b f in the simple parametric resonances fig 4 b d show that only one mode is excited and its vibration amplitude increases when ω ω 1 fig 4 b and ω 2ω 1 fig 4 c the first mode is excited and the amplitude of the first modal response e 1 increases with time at ω ω 2 fig 4 d only the amplitude of the second modal response e 2 increases with time in the combination resonances as shown in fig 4 e and f two modes of the pipe are excited and the amplitudes of them are both exponentially increasing with time in the case of ω ω 1 ω 2 fig 4 e shows that the first and second modes of the pipe are excited and the vibration amplitudes of them are increased with time when ω ω 1 ω 3 2 the amplitudes of the first and third modal responses are increased with time as shown in fig 4 f the modal responses plotted in fig 4 could confirm the parametric resonances of the pipe system in fig 3 which are determined with the floquet theory furthermore fig 4 demonstrates that the vibration amplitudes of the excited modal responses increase faster as the maximum eigenvalue of the state transition matrix λ i max increases this indicates that for a larger maximum eigenvalue λ i max the stability of the pipe system would be more seriously affected by internal variable density fluid 4 impacts of internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe in the above section a flexible pipe conveying variable density fluid is analysed the parametric excitation on the pipe is investigated and some parametric resonances are distinguished in this section the external incoming fluid flow is also taken into account and the vortex induced vibrations are considered the influence of the internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe is further analysed 4 1 solution methods when the internal and external fluid flows are simultaneously considered the governing equations of the pipe eq 17 can be solved with the runge kutta method combined with central difference formulas kuiper et al 2008 the pipe is equally divided into a number of segments and connected by nodes with the central difference formulas the governing equations are discretized into a set of ordinary differential equations for the connected nodes then these equations are solved with the fourth order runge kutta method in the time domain in order to get stable and convergent solutions a large number of segments 100 and a sufficiently small time increment δτ 1 0 10 5 are employed the initial calculation conditions are set as η η τ q τ 0 and q 2 for every connected node once the dynamic responses of the pipe are obtained the vibration frequencies can be got through the fast fourier transform technique additionally the modes of the pipe participating in the vibrations are identified with the modal analysis method as utilized by trim et al 2005 4 2 viv model validation to validate the effectiveness of the present model for simulating viv the viv experiment performed by exxonmobil lehn 2003 at the marintek is chosen for comparison in the experiment a vertical flexible pipe rotated around a central column to create uniform incoming flows the main properties of the experiment as well as the dimensionless parameters are listed in table 1 the pipe structural damping is very small when compared with the external fluid damping lehn 2003 wang and xiao 2016 hence it is neglected in the present model the viv results from the experiment cfd simulations huang 2011 wang and xiao 2016 and the present model are compared in fig 5 fig 5 a shows that the steady state response displacements of the pipe at x l 0 22 predicted by the present model agree with the results from the experiment and the cfd simulation wang and xiao 2016 the associated amplitude spectra are plotted in fig 5 b it can be found that the relative errors of the results from the cfd simulation with respect to the experimental results are 12 23 and 10 53 for the frequency and the amplitude respectively the corresponding relative errors of the present model are 19 06 and 31 58 the cfd simulation is better than the present model this is because in the present model the in line viv is neglected while the cfd simulation has considered the in line viv for the whole pipe fig 5 c plots the root mean square rms displacements it can be seen that the results of the present model are in reasonable agreement with those of the experiment and cfd simulations huang 2011 wang and xiao 2016 all of the response curves show that the second mode of the pipe dominates this viv when the present model is compared to the prediction model of meng et al 2017a which also neglects the in line viv the results in fig 6 show that they are in better agreement the results of the present model and meng both have some discrepancies with respect to the experimental results of song et al 2016 the main dimensional parameters of the experiment are listed in table 2 from figs 5 and 6 it can be known that the present model is reliable to simulate the vibration amplitude frequency and dominating mode of viv of flexible pipes in the cross flow direction 4 3 influence of the circular frequency ω since the present model can reliably predict viv the influence from the internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe is going to be analysed because of multi phase flows the total fluid density inside the pipe may fluctuate with different circular frequency ω different amplitude ε and different initial condition the influence of the circular frequency ω on the pipe viv is investigated at first the dimensionless parameters of the pipe system are taken as β 1 0 11 β 2 0 2 v 1 6 f n ap ξ 1 c g 0 ε 1 0 and θ 0 the circular frequency ω is calculated from 2 to 85 with an increment of 0 1 as for the external fluid flow the flow velocity is selected as v 2 ω 1 2πst ω 2 2πst and ω 1 ω 2 4πst where the viv is locked in the first mode of the pipe the second mode and the transition between them referred as non lock in respectively the dynamic responses of the pipe are calculated and the influence of the circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω is analysed for different viv cases 4 3 1 the first mode viv when the external flow velocity v 2 is close to ω 1 2πst the first mode of the pipe would be locked in by the viv because the vortex shedding frequency is close to the first mode natural frequency of the pipe system the dynamic responses of the pipe at the first mode viv for different circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω are simulated the rms displacements and dominant frequencies f dom at the middle point of the pipe are plotted in fig 7 fig 7 a shows that as the circular frequency ω increases the rms displacements of the pipe increase at the parametric resonances of ω ω 1 2 2ω 1 3 ω 1 2ω 1 and ω 1 ω 2 these displacements become larger for larger value of λ i max by referring to fig 3 however when the circular frequency ω is close to ω 2 ω 1 and ω 3 ω 1 the rms displacements are decreased these regions are corresponded to the stable regions of the pipe in fig 3 fig 7 b demonstrates that the dominant frequencies of the pipe will generally decrease increase and then decrease when the circular frequency ω is close to the regions where the rms displacements of the pipe are changed as shown in fig 7 a when the circular frequency ω is close to other parametric resonances like ω ω 2 2ω 2 and ω 2 ω 3 2 fig 7 shows that the rms displacements and dominant frequencies are almost not changed this might be because the pipe would be less affected by the internal variable density fluid in these resonances moreover the external nonlinear fluid damping could limit the vibrations of the pipe in general it can be found from fig 7 that the displacements and frequencies of the pipe would largely change when the first mode natural frequency ω 1 is excited to more clearly understand the dynamic responses of the pipe demonstrated in fig 7 seven different cases are chosen they are for the pipe conveying constant density fluid and variable density fluid at ω 50 ω 1 2ω 1 ω 1 ω 2 ω 2 ω 1 and ω 3 ω 1 the space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses of the pipe are plotted in fig 8 when the internal fluid density is a constant the space time varying displacements of the pipe are plotted in figs 8 a 1 this vibration is uniform and periodic and it is dominated by the first mode of the pipe chaplin et al 2005 thorsen et al 2016 the associated spectra are plotted in figs 8 a 2 there is only one response frequency in the frequency domain it is 1 042 in cycles per dimensionless second which is close to the first mode natural frequency of the pipe system as 2π 1 042 6 55 and ω 1 6 62 the pipe modal responses are plotted in figs 8 a 3 with the rms values it can be seen that the first mode of the pipe contributes most to this vibration when the internal fluid density fluctuates and the fluctuating circular frequency ω is in the non changing regions in fig 7 a as an example ω 50 the pipe space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses are plotted in fig 8 b these figures are quite similar to those of the pipe conveying constant density fluid as shown in fig 8 a therefore it can be known that when the circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω varies in the non changing regions in fig 7 a the first mode viv of the pipe is seldom affected by the internal variable density fluid when the circular frequency ω varies around the simple parametric resonances of ω 1 2 2ω 1 3 ω 1 and 2ω 1 the cases of ω ω 1 and ω 2ω 1 are selected from fig 7 and the dynamic responses are plotted in fig 8 c and d respectively in these resonance conditions the first mode of the pipe would be excited by the internal varying fluid density and it would contribute to the vibration of the pipe as shown in figs 8 c 3 and d 3 where the rms values of the first modal response are increased when compared with figs 8 a 3 in different simple parametric resonances the vibrations of the pipe may be different since the vibration in figs 8 c 1 is asymmetric whereas that in figs 8 d 1 is symmetric for the vibration frequencies the cases of ω ω 1 and ω 2ω 1 are almost the same as plotted in figs 8 c 2 and d 2 due to the contribution from the first mode excited by the internal varying fluid density the pipe vibration amplitudes are increased and the dominant frequencies are changed as shown in fig 7 in the combination resonance of ω ω 1 ω 2 the first and second modes of the pipe are excited by the internal varying fluid density and they contribute to the vibration of the pipe as shown in figs 8 e 3 where the rms values of them are increased as the second mode also takes part in the vibration the space time varying displacements of the pipe become non uniform as plotted in figs 8 e 1 fig 8 e 2 shows that there are two response frequencies 1 055 and 5 186 2π 5 186 32 58 which are close to the first mode and the second mode natural frequencies of the pipe system respectively the former is associated with only one peak along the pipe while the latter is associated with two peaks along the pipe when the circular frequency ω varies around ω 2 ω 1 figs 8 f 3 demonstrates that the first and second modes of the pipe are excited comparing with figs 8 a 3 it can be found that the rms value of the first mode is decreased whereas that of the second mode is increased this reflects that there is a competition between these two modes trim et al 2005 wu et al 2012 the competition may be the reason for the decrease of the rms displacements of the pipe and the fluctuation of the dominant frequencies plotted in fig 7 figs 8 f 1 shows that the pipe space time varying displacements are non uniform in figs 8 f 2 there are two response frequencies which are similar to those in figs 8 e 2 for the case of ω ω 1 ω 2 when ω ω 3 ω 1 figs 8 g 3 shows that the first and third modes of the pipe are excited and they compete with each other in the vibration as a result the rms displacements of the pipe are decreased and the dominant frequencies are changed as shown in fig 7 in figs 8 g 1 the space time varying displacements of the pipe become non uniform figs 8 g 2 shows that there are two response frequencies in this vibration they are 1 042 and 12 07 2π 12 07 75 84 which are close to the first mode and the third mode natural frequencies of the pipe system respectively the second response frequency has three peaks along the pipe 4 3 2 the second mode viv when the external flow velocity v 2 increases to ω 2 2πst the second mode of the pipe is locked in by the viv the rms displacements and dominant frequencies of the pipe at ξ 0 25 which may present the largest vibration amplitude are calculated and plotted in fig 9 fig 9 a shows that as the circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω increases the rms displacements of the pipe increase at the parametric resonances of ω ω 2 ω 1 ω 2 and 2ω 2 and decrease in the vicinities of ω 2 ω 1 and ω 3 ω 2 the dominant frequencies in fig 9 b show that the frequencies increase slightly when the circular frequency ω is small or around ω 2 ω 3 ω 2 and 2ω 2 from fig 9 it can be found that the second mode viv of the pipe would be significantly affected by the internal variable density fluid when the second mode natural frequency ω 2 is involved when comparing fig 7 with fig 9 it can be seen that the vibration amplitudes of the pipe at the first mode viv are much larger than those at the second mode viv the influences from the internal and external fluid flows could cause this in fig 7 the increases of the amplitudes are associated with larger values of the maximum eigenvalue of the state transition matrix λ i max as shown in fig 3 so that the pipe would be more strongly affected by the internal varying fluid density in addition the external nonlinear fluid damping in the second mode viv is larger than that in the first mode viv as the external flow velocity is increased the vibrations of the pipe would be more limited to clearly show the dynamic responses of the pipe seven different cases are selected from fig 9 they are associated with the constant density fluid and variable density fluid when the circular frequency ω is taken as 10 ω 2 ω 1 ω 2 ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 ω 2 and 2ω 2 the space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses of the pipe are plotted in fig 10 in figs 10 a 1 it can be seen that when the pipe transports constant density fluid the vibration is uniform and periodic the second mode of the pipe dominates this vibration in the amplitude spectra of figs 10 a 2 there is only one response frequency f dom 5 149 and it has two peaks along the pipe the modal responses in figs 10 a 3 show that the first three modes of the pipe mainly contribute to this vibration the second mode does the most as it has the largest rms value when the circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω varies in the non changing regions in fig 9 a e g ω 10 fig 10 b show that the space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses are very similar to those of the pipe conveying constant density fluid as plotted in fig 10 a therefore the influence of the internal variable density fluid on the second mode viv of the pipe is very small when the circular frequency ω is changed in the non changing regions in fig 9 a when the circular frequency ω increases to ω 2 ω 1 the pipe space time varying displacements become non uniform and aperiodic as shown in figs 10 c 1 this might be because the first and second modes of the pipe are excited by the internal varying fluid density and they participate in this vibration as shown in figs 10 c 3 when comparing figs 10 c 3 with figs 10 a 3 the competition between these two excited modes can be found as the rms value of the first modal response is increased whereas that of the second modal response is decreased this competition is the reason for the decrease of the rms displacements of the pipe as plotted in fig 9 a figs 10 c 2 shows that there are two response frequencies in this vibration one is 1 208 and the other is 5 149 at the simple parametric resonance of ω ω 2 figs 10 d 1 shows that the pipe vibration is non uniform but it presents a periodic characteristic this vibration has only one response frequency 5 149 as shown in figs 10 d 2 fig 10 d 3 compared with figs 10 a 3 shows that the rms value of the second modal response is increased that means the contribution from the second mode of the pipe is larger in this vibration the rms value of the first modal response is also increased the reason for this may be that the case of ω ω 2 is also in the vicinity of ω ω 1 ω 2 as shown in fig 9 a when ω ω 2 the combination resonance of ω ω 1 ω 2 is also excited then the first mode of the pipe contributes more to this vibration when the circular frequency ω is next to the combination resonance of ω 1 ω 2 the first and second modes of the pipe are excited by the internal varying fluid density both of them participate in the viv of the pipe as shown in figs 10 e 3 fig 10 e 1 shows that the pipe vibration is non uniform and aperiodic in figs 10 e 2 there are mainly two response frequencies in this vibration which are similar to those in figs 10 c 2 as the circular frequency ω is further increased to ω 3 ω 2 figs 10 f 3 shows that the rms values of the first and third modal responses are increased while that of the second modal response is decreased this reflects that the first and third modes of the pipe contribute more to this vibration and they would compete with the dominating second mode the reason for this may be that the case of ω ω 3 ω 2 is next to ω ω 1 ω 2 as shown in fig 9 a when ω ω 3 ω 2 the combination resonance of ω ω 1 ω 2 could also be excited the competition between these excited modes may make the pipe rms displacements to decrease as plotted in fig 9 a and the viv responses to become non uniform and aperiodic as shown in figs 10 f 1 fig 10 f 2 shows that this vibration consists of three response frequencies i e 1 589 5 149 and 11 95 which are close to the first three mode natural frequencies of the pipe system respectively when ω 2ω 1 figs 10 g 1 shows that the space time varying displacements of the pipe are uniform and periodic the reason for this may be that only the second mode of the pipe is excited by the internal varying fluid density and this mode is consistent with the mode excited by the external viv as shown in figs 10 g 3 fig 10 g 2 shows that there is only one response frequency f dom 5 149 in this vibration 4 3 3 non lock in viv the external flow velocity v 2 may change in some circumstances the vortex shedding frequency is away from the natural frequencies of the pipe system and the viv is not locked in to analyse the influence from the circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω on the non lock in viv of the pipe the external flow velocity is taken as v 2 ω 1 ω 2 4πst which is between the first and second modes of the pipe that could be locked in the point at ξ 0 5 of the pipe is selected to demonstrate the rms displacements and dominant frequencies of non lock in viv affected by the circular frequency ω the results are plotted in fig 11 when the viv is not locked in the vibration displacements of the pipe are very small as shown in fig 11 a the rms displacement of the pipe for constant density fluid at ξ 0 5 is 0 023 for the pipe conveying variable density fluid the rms displacements are increased when the circular frequency ω varies around ω 1 2ω 1 ω 2 ω 1 and 57 9 the dominant frequencies of the pipe conveying variable density fluid are almost the same as that of the pipe conveying constant density fluid except in the neighborhood of ω 2ω 1 as shown in fig 11 b around ω 2ω 1 the dominant frequencies for variable density fluid are decreased similarly to further demonstrate the vibrations of the pipe six different cases are chosen from fig 11 they are the cases for the pipe conveying constant density fluid and variable density fluid at ω 50 ω 1 2ω 1 ω 2 ω 1 and 57 9 the space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses are plotted in fig 12 figs 12 a 1 and a 3 show that the vibration of the pipe conveying constant density fluid is still dominated by the first mode but the vibration amplitude is very small from figs 12 a 2 it can be seen that there is only one response frequency 2 866 which is away from the first and second mode natural frequencies of the pipe system when the internal fluid density fluctuates in the non changing regions in fig 11 a the case of ω 50 can be taken as an example and the dynamic response is plotted in fig 12 b when comparing fig 12 b with fig 12 a it can be seen that the space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses are almost the same so the influence of the internal variable density fluid on the non lock in viv of the pipe is very small in this case in the simple parametric resonances of ω ω 1 and ω 2ω 1 the first mode of the pipe is excited by the internal varying fluid density and it contributes to the vibrations of the pipe as shown in figs 12 c 3 and d 3 respectively in which the rms values of the first modal responses are both increased the pipe vibrations in figs 12 c 1 and d 1 are non uniform and periodic for a long range of time the vibration amplitudes are increased figs 12 c 2 and d 2 show that these vibrations consist of two frequencies one is 0 955 and the other is around 2 9 when ω 2ω 1 the first frequency is larger than the second frequency and it becomes the dominant frequency this is the reason for the decrease of the dominant frequencies of pipe as plotted in fig 11 b in the vicinity of ω 2 ω 1 figs 12 e 1 shows that the space time varying displacements of the pipe are non uniform and periodic the pipe vibration has two response frequencies as shown in figs 12 e 2 when comparing figs 12 e 3 with figs 12 a 3 it can be seen that the rms values of the first two modal responses are increased that means the first two modes of the pipe are excited by the internal varying fluid density and they contribute to the vibration when the circular frequency ω is close to 57 9 figs 12 f 1 shows that the pipe response is non uniform and periodic in figs 12 f 2 it can be seen that there are two response frequencies in this vibration one is 2 866 and the other is 12 08 the second frequency corresponds to the third mode natural frequency of the pipe system figs 12 f 3 shows that the rms values of the first and third modal responses are increased meaning that the first and third modes of the pipe are excited by the internal varying fluid density and they contribute to this vibration for this case the circular frequency ω may be linked with ω 3 ω 1 and the non lock in viv make this condition to occur earlier from the above analyses it can be known that when the viv is locked in different modes or not locked in the dynamic responses of the pipe affected by the circular frequency of the internal fluid density are different the external nonlinear fluid damping may cause some effect on this as the circular frequency of the internal fluid density increases the pipe vibration amplitudes would increase or decrease for the viv locked in the first mode or the second mode as shown in figs 7 and 9 respectively while for the non lock in viv the vibration amplitudes are generally increased as shown in fig 11 furthermore the conditions for the increases or decreases of these vibration amplitudes are different for different viv cases in general when the viv dominating mode is excited by the internal varying fluid density the viv of the pipe would be strongly affected by the internal variable density fluid 4 4 influence of the fluctuation amplitude ε the fluid flow inside the pipe may contain different types of fluids the total fluid density may fluctuate with different amplitudes ε which may cause some effect on the viv of the pipe in order to analyse this effect the first mode viv can be typically considered as shown in fig 7 when the circular frequency of the internal fluid density varies the pipe dynamic responses are different for different cases therefore seven representative cases are selected they are for the pipe conveying constant density fluid and variable density fluid at ω 50 ω 1 2ω 1 ω 1 ω 2 ω 2 ω 1 and ω 3 ω 1 for these cases the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density ε is calculated from 0 to 1 with an increment of 0 02 the initial phase angle θ is set as 0 the rms displacements and dominant frequencies of the pipe ξ 0 5 are plotted in fig 13 as the fluctuation amplitude ε increases fig 13 a shows that the rms displacements of the pipe have different changing trends for different cases in the case of ω 50 the rms displacements are approximately unchanged and consistent with that of the constant density fluid case this reflects that the variation of ε has little influence on the viv of the pipe in this case in the parametric resonances of ω ω 1 2ω 1 and ω 1 ω 2 the rms displacements are increased when the fluctuation amplitude ε is sufficiently large the increasing trends of ω ω 1 and ω 2ω 1 are larger than that of ω ω 1 ω 2 on the contrary the pipe rms displacements at ω ω 2 ω 1 and ω ω 3 ω 1 are steadily decreasing as the fluctuation amplitude ε increases overall it can be known that when the fluid density inside the pipe fluctuates with a larger amplitude the viv of the pipe would be more significantly affected the pipe dominant frequencies are plotted in fig 13 b it shows that as the fluctuation amplitude ε increases the frequencies decrease for the cases of ω ω 1 and ω 2ω 1 and increase for the case of ω ω 1 ω 2 for the other cases the dominant frequencies of the pipe are little changed and they are almost consistent with that of the constant density fluid case to clearly show the dynamic responses of the pipe affected by the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density three cases of circular frequency ω 2ω 1 ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 ω 1 and two values of ε 0 2 and 0 8 are selected from fig 13 the pipe space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses are plotted in fig 14 when ω 2ω 1 as the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density ε increases figs 14 a 1 14 b 1 and 8 d 1 show that pipe vibration amplitude increases largely the vibration frequency is slightly decreased as shown in figs 14 a 2 14 b 2 and 8 d 2 for the modal responses figs 14 a 3 14 b 3 and 8 d 3 show that the rms value of the first mode is increased while those values for the other higher modes are still very small and nearly not changed in the case of ω ω 1 ω 2 with the increase of the fluctuation amplitude ε the internal varying fluid density could cause more effect on the pipe system through parametric excitation figs 14 c 3 14 d 3 and 8 e 3 show that the rms values of the first and second modal responses are increased this indicates that the first and second modes of the pipe would contribute more to the vibration as a result the pipe responses become more non uniform as shown in figs 14 c 1 14 d 1 and 8 e 1 the vibration amplitude is also increased in the frequency domain figs 14 c 2 14 d 2 and 8 e 2 show that the response frequencies are slightly changed but the amplitudes of them are increased when ω ω 3 ω 1 the first and third modes of the pipe are excited by the internal varying fluid density as shown in figs 14 e 3 14 f 3 and 8 g 3 with the increase of the fluctuation amplitude ε the rms value of the first modal response is decreased whereas that of the third modal response is increased this means that the competition between these two excited modes becomes stronger figs 14 e 1 14 f 1 and 8 g 1 show that the responses of the pipe become more non uniform in addition figs 14 e 2 14 f 2 and 8 g 2 show that as the fluctuation amplitude ε increases the amplitude of the first response frequency is decreased while that of the second response frequency is increased 4 5 influence of the initial phase angle θ the variable density fluid travelling in the flexible pipe may have different initial conditions in the present model the initial conditions are simulated with an initial phase angle θ to analyse the influence from the initial conditions of the internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe the initial phase angle θ is calculated from 0 to 2π with an increment of 0 04π the pipe rms displacements and dominant frequencies at ξ 0 5 are plotted in fig 15 in which the first mode viv and seven different cases are considered the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density is taken as ε 1 0 fig 15 a shows that as the initial phase angle θ increases the rms displacements of the pipe remain constants for those cases considered the pipe dominant frequencies have the same characteristics as shown in fig 15 b this means that the viv of the pipe would be seldom affected by the initial conditions of the internal variable density fluid for brevity the space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses of the pipe for different initial phase angles θ are not plotted here because they are almost the same 5 conclusions the flexible pipes are often used to transport fluid flows like water oil and gas because of multi phase flows the total fluid density inside the pipe may fluctuate with time and space moreover the pipes may undergo vortex induced vibrations when it is subjected to an external incoming fluid flow in this paper a flexible pipe conveying variable density fluid and simultaneously subjected to viv is mathematically modelled and analysed the internal variable density fluid is simulated with a mathematical model which satisfies the conservation law of fluid mass the external vortex induced lift force is modelled with a classical van der pol wake oscillator based on the principle of hamilton the governing equations for the motion of the pipe are derived the parametric excitation on the pipe from the internal varying fluid density is analysed at first then the external viv is taken into account and the influence from the internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe is further investigated some conclusions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 when the pipe conveys variable density fluid it is parametrically excited with the floquet theory the parametric resonances are determined including simple parametric resonances and combination resonances as the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density increases the pipe system would become more unstable due to parametric resonances for a larger value of the maximum eigenvalue of the state transition matrix the pipe would be more strongly affected by the internal variable density fluid 2 when the pipe is excited by the internal variable density fluid and the external viv its dynamic responses would significantly change when the viv dominating mode is excited by the internal varying fluid density due to the contributions and competitions from the excited modes the rms displacements of the pipe would increase or decrease the space time varying displacements would become non uniform or aperiodic some additional response frequencies would appear and the dominant frequencies would change 3 with the increase of the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density the influence of the internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe would become more obvious 4 the dynamic responses of the pipe would be seldom affected by the initial conditions of the internal variable density fluid in this paper the variation of the internal fluid density is considered and modelled with a mathematical model its influence on the viv of the pipe is numerically simulated and analysed some experiments or cfd simulations need to be performed in the future to further study the viv of flexible pipes affected by the internal variable density fluid or even more complex multi phase flows in order to gain a better understanding about this complex internal and external fluid structure interactions acknowledgment this research was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51679167 and 51479135 
22780,in this paper a flexible pipe conveying variable density fluid and simultaneously undergoing vortex induced vibrations viv is mathematically simulated and analysed resulting from multi phase flows the total fluid density inside the pipe may fluctuate temporally and spatially this variable density fluid is simulated with a mathematical model which obeys the conservation law of fluid mass for the external viv the lift force caused by vortices shedding is modelled with a classic van der pol wake oscillator based on the principle of hamilton the governing equations for the vibration of the pipe are derived when only considering the fluctuation of the internal fluid density the pipe is parametrically excited the parametric resonances are determined with the floquet theory after this the external viv is taken into account and the influence from the internal varying fluid density on the viv of the pipe is analysed in detail when the internal fluid density fluctuates with different circular frequency the vibrations of the pipe would become non uniform or aperiodic the root mean square displacement would increase or decrease with the increase of the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density these phenomena would become more obvious nevertheless the initial phase angle of the internal fluid density standing for the initial condition has seldom effect on the viv of the pipe keywords variable density fluid parametric excitation vortex induced vibrations internal and external fluid structure interactions 1 introduction the flexible pipes undergoing vortex induced vibrations viv can be found in many engineering components such as heat exchangers water suppliers marine risers and submarine pipelines these pipes are often used to transport fluid flows like water oil and gas the fluid flow inside the pipe may contain several types of fluids or impurities as a result the total fluid density may be unsteady and non homogenous along the pipe when the density of the internal fluid flow varies with time and space the viv of the pipe may become more complicated which needs further investigations blevins 1990 wu et al 2012 paı doussis 2014 as a typical fluid structure interaction the viv of flexible pipes have been extensively studied for several decades as comprehensively reviewed by sarpkaya 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 and wu et al 2012 when a pipe is subjected to an incoming fluid flow some vortices are shedding from the pipe alternately in the wake flow when the frequency of vortex shedding is close to one of the natural frequencies of the pipe the viv lock in or synchronization would occur the pipe would vibrate with large amplitudes resulting in severe structural fatigue damage or even failure williamson and govardhan 2004 to gain a thorough understanding about viv a large number of experiments have been performed with short elastically mounted rigid cylinders or long flexible model pipes in uniform sheared and stepped flows lehn 2003 trim et al 2005 gabbai and benaroya 2005 gao et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 xu et al 2017 2018 to simulate and predict viv the methods of computational fluid dynamics cfd huang et al 2011 wang and xiao 2016 have been employed moreover some semi empirical tools such as vivana shear7 and wake oscillator models sarpkaya 2004 chaplin et al 2005 facchinetti et al 2004 have also been developed recently thorsen et al 2016 proposed a new semi empirical model that can predict viv of flexible pipes in oscillating flows when only considering the fluid flow conveyed by pipes there is another fluid structure interaction which has also been widely investigated for many decades paı doussis 2014 li et al 2015 the internal fluid flow can add coriolis and centrifugal forces to the outside pipe for a simply supported pipe it would lose its stability and become buckling when the velocity of the internal fluid flow is sufficiently high paı doussis 2014 the fluid conveying pipe may also subject to viv from the external fluid flow the marine risers can be taken as an example in this circumstance the internal and external fluid structure interactions should be both considered guo and lou 2008 conducted a series of experiments to investigate the influence of the internal fluid flow on a model riser that was undergoing viv the experimental results demonstrated that as the internal flow velocity increases the riser s vibration amplitude would increase while the vibration frequency would decrease chen et al 2012 simulated a fluid conveying pipe subjected to viv in linearly sheared flows by utilizing cfd techniques they found that the vibration amplitude frequency and dominating mode of the pipe would be significantly affected by the fluid flow inside the pipe dai et al 2013 theoretically analysed the viv of a flexible pipe conveying fluid the velocity of the internal fluid flow was increased from the subcritical regime to the supercritical regime some complex dynamics of the pipe were found like chaotic oscillations subsequently the influences from the internal varying flow velocity dai et al 2014 and the top end fluctuating tension he et al 2017 on the viv of the pipe have been investigated recently meng et al 2017a 2017b carried out theoretical studies for a simply supported pipe and a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid and simultaneously undergoing viv up to now according to the authors best knowledge the fluid flow inside viv pipes is usually considered as a single phase flow the fluid density is a constant however when the pipe transports multi phase flows or the internal fluid flow contains impurities such as solid particles the total fluid density may change temporally and spatially along the pipe patel and seyed 1989 utilized a mathematical function to describe the variation of the fluid density of multi phase flows which were conveyed by flexible pipes ortega et al 2012 2013 employed the lagrangian slug tracking model to simulate a slug flow travelling in lazy wave and catenary risers respectively montoya hernández et al 2014 used a pseudo single phase flow to describe multi phase flows which contain water oil and gas chatjigeorgiou 2017 numerically studied the vibrations of catenary pipelines under the actions from the top harmonic motions and the internal slug flows these studies indicated that the dynamics of the pipe would be significantly affected by the internal fluid flow when the fluid density varies as for the viv of flexible pipes however there are still lacking of researches in the literature that have considered the variation of the internal fluid density therefore the main objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe this paper is organized as follows in section 2 a mathematical model for a flexible pipe conveying variable density fluid and simultaneously subjected to viv is established in section 3 the parametric excitation on the pipe caused by the internal varying fluid density is investigated then the influence from the internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe is further simulated and analysed in section 4 some conclusions of this paper are summarized in the last section 5 2 mathematical model as schematically shown in fig 1 a vertical flexible pipe conveying fluid and exposed to an external fluid flow is considered the internal and external fluids of the pipe are both assumed as incompressible the external fluid density ρ ex is constant while the internal fluid density ρ in x t may fluctuate with time t and space x since the pipe conveys multi phase flows the pipe is simply supported at both ends with a total length of l at the top end a pretension f n is given at the bottom end a cartesian coordinate system is built to describe the motion of the pipe the x and y axes are in the vertical and horizontal directions respectively the z axis is perpendicular to them and parallels with the velocity of the external fluid flow u 2 1 equations of the internal variable density fluid the pipe transports multi phase flows from the bottom to the top the total fluid density inside the pipe may vary temporally and spatially the varying fluid density could be simulated with a mathematical function which includes a constant component superposed a fluctuating component patel and seyed 1989 bai

density fluid conveyed by pipes satisfies the conservation law of fluid mass as confirmed by bai et al 2018 utilizing integral formulas it could also provide reasonable simulations for multi phase flows especially for the slug flows 2 2 equations of the external vortex induced forces when the external fluid flow passes the pipe with velocity u as shown in fig 1 some vortices are released from the pipe alternately and periodically which causes hydrodynamic forces acting on the pipe blevins 1990 these vortex induced forces f ex can be divided into a lift force f l and a drag force f d ogink

2 for a stationary circular cylinder 2 3 governing equations of the pipe motion since the pipe is continuous and flexible the governing equations for the motion of the pipe can be derived with the hamilton s principle paı doussis 2014 according to this principle the total kinetic energy e k potential energy e p and non conservative work w of the pipe system are integrated as 6 t 1 t 2 δ e k e p δ w d t 0 the total kinetic energy e k consists of kinetic energies from the internal fluid flow e k in the pipe structure e k p and the external fluid added mass e k ex they are written as 7 e k e k

are written as 15 y x 0 2 y x 2 x 0 y x l 2 y x 2 x l 0 by substituting eqs 7 14 into eq 6 and applying the hamilton s variation technique the governing equation for the motion of the pipe can be

the density of the internal fluid flow varies that means the pipe is parametrically excited by the internal varying fluid density nayfeh and mook 1995 kuiper et al 2008 in this section the parametric excitation is analysed and some parametric resonances are determined 3 1 solution method to investigate the parametric excitation on the pipe system the external vortex induced forces are neglected the governing equation of pipe motion is reduced to 18 β 1 1 ε c o s k ξ ω τ θ 2 η τ 2 2 v 1 2 η τ ξ v 1 2 2 η ξ 2 1 c a β 2 2 η τ 2 ξ 1 β 2 1 β 1 1 ε c o s k ξ ω τ θ g d ξ f n a p ξ 1 2 η ξ 2 β 2 1 β

displacement of the pipe is expressed as 19 η i 1 n ϕ i ξ e i τ in which ϕ i ξ is the modal function of the pipe which can be taken as ϕ i ξ s i n i π ξ for a simply supported pipe e i is the corresponding generalized coordinate and it is also denoted as the modal response or the modal weight factor trim et al 2005 n is the number of modal functions accounted by substituting eq 19 into eq 18 multiplying each term with ϕ j ξ s i n j π ξ and integrating from 0 to 1 with respect to ξ eq 18 is discretized and it can be expressed in a matrix form 20 m m 2 e τ 2 c c e τ k k e 0 in which e is the displacement vector of the modal responses m c and k are the time independent matrices of mass damping and stiffness of the system respectively whereas m c and k are the corresponding time

the pipe system are important for analysing the parametric excitation and the viv after solving the standard eigenvalue problem of eq 21 the complex frequencies of the pipe system are obtained the real parts of the complex frequencies stand for the natural frequencies the imaginary parts are the oscillating damping païdoussis 2014 as an example the dimensionless parameters of a fluid conveying pipe are taken as β 1 0 11 and f n ap ξ 1 c g 0 which are given by païdoussis 2014 in order to compare with the results of païdoussis 2014 the external fluid added mass and the internal varying fluid density are ignored with β 2 0 and ε 0 respectively in the present model the first ten modal functions are selected i e n 10 and the complex frequencies of the pipe are calculated the comparison results are plotted in the argand diagram of fig 2 the results from païdoussis 2014 have been modified in this figure because of different dimensionless quantities and variables fig 2 shows that the results of the present model agree well with the results obtained by païdoussis 2014 although there are some discrepancies these discrepancies might be generated by calculation errors from the truncation of the modal functions because eq 18 is discretized with the galerkin s method and for more modal functions accounted the calculation results would be more accuracy and the discrepancies would be smaller but the computing resources would be larger in fig 2 it can be known that when n 10 the discrepancies are acceptable with the increase of the internal fluid flow velocity v 1 the natural frequencies of the pipe system re ω are decreasing when v 1 increases to 3π the critical velocity the first mode natural frequency reduces to zero and a pitchfork bifurcation of the pipe would occur up to 6π the second mode natural frequency also reduces to zero when the fluid density inside the pipe fluctuates with time and space the instantaneous complex frequencies of the pipe system are calculated and plotted in fig 2 the variation of the internal fluid density is typically considered with ε 0 5 ω ω 1 v 1 6 k ω v 1 ω 1 6 and θ 0 where ω 1 is the first mode natural frequency of the pipe conveying constant density fluid ε 0 at v 1 6 fig 2 illustrates that as the dimensionless time τ increases the instantaneous complex frequencies are cycling in the argand diagram reflecting that the natural frequencies and damping of the pipe system are changing periodically with time this is reasonable because the internal fluid density is assumed as a periodic function of time as given in eq 1 3 3 parametric resonances the pipe is parametrically excited by the internal variable density fluid in parametric resonances the pipe would become unstable and vibrate with large amplitudes which is dangerous and should be avoided nayfeh and mook 1995 kuiper et al 2008 the floquet theory is employed to distinguish the stable and unstable regions of the pipe system nayfeh and mook 1995 paı doussis 2014 eq 21 is numerically integrated over a period of time t 2π ω for 2n times and for each time i i 1 2 2n the initial conditions of γ 0 are set as γ j i 1 and γ j i 0 j 1 2 2n where γ j is the element j of γ the system state transition matrix φ t is constructed as 22 φ t γ 1 t γ 2 t γ 2 n t where γ i t i 1 2 2n are the integration results at the end of the period the stability of the pipe is determined by considering the eigenvalues λ i i 1 2 2n of φ t if at least one of them has an absolute value larger than one λ i 1 the system is unstable to show the stability of the pipe system the dimensionless parameters are taken as v 1 6 β 1 0 11 β 2 0 2 f n ap ξ 1 c g 0 and θ 0 in which the external fluid added mass is considered the circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω is increased from 0 to 85 with an increment of 0 01 meanwhile the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density ε is increased from 0 to 1 with an increment of 0 02 nearly 8501 51 points have been calculated the stability diagram of the pipe is plotted in fig 3 the maximum eigenvalue of the state transition matrix λ i max is calculated for each point the colored areas represent the unstable regions since λ i max 1 while the white areas are the stable regions because of λ i max 1 the first three mode natural frequencies of the pipe are ω 1 6 62 ω 2 32 72 and ω 3 75 85 for constant density fluid at v 1 6 the unstable regions in fig 3 can be classified into simple parametric resonances ω ω 1 2 2ω 1 3 ω 1 2ω 1 ω 2 2ω 2 and ω 3 and combination resonances ω ω 1 ω 2 2 ω 1 ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 2 ω 2 ω 3 2 2 ω 1 ω 2 and ω 1 ω 3 nayfeh and mook 1995 paı doussis 2014 with the increase of the fluctuation amplitude ε the unstable regions generally become wider and the value of λ i max increases especially for the case of ω 2ω 1 the unstable regions are different for different resonance conditions as shown in fig 3 a possible reason for this is that the wave number of the internal fluid density k is changed with the circular frequency ω via k ω v 1 as the circular frequency ω increases the wave number k is also increased and the fluid density becomes more non uniform to further demonstrate the stability of the pipe system the dynamic responses of the pipe can be calculated by solving eq 21 with the fourth order runge kutta method the initial calculation conditions are set as e i 1 0 10 4 and de i dτ 0 i 1 2 10 six different cases are selected from fig 3 namely ω 10 ω 1 2ω 1 2ω 2 ω 1 ω 2 and ω 1 ω 3 2 they are represented for the stable regions simple parametric resonances and combination resonances the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density is chosen as ε 0 8 the first five modal responses are plotted in fig 4 to clearly show the modes of the pipe being excited for different cases the case of ω 10 is taken as an example for the stable regions fig 4 a shows that the modal responses e i i 1 2 3 4 and 5 of the pipe almost remain constant after the initial perturbation in the unstable regions however the vibration amplitudes of the excited modal responses are exponentially increased with time as shown in fig 4 b f in the simple parametric resonances fig 4 b d show that only one mode is excited and its vibration amplitude increases when ω ω 1 fig 4 b and ω 2ω 1 fig 4 c the first mode is excited and the amplitude of the first modal response e 1 increases with time at ω ω 2 fig 4 d only the amplitude of the second modal response e 2 increases with time in the combination resonances as shown in fig 4 e and f two modes of the pipe are excited and the amplitudes of them are both exponentially increasing with time in the case of ω ω 1 ω 2 fig 4 e shows that the first and second modes of the pipe are excited and the vibration amplitudes of them are increased with time when ω ω 1 ω 3 2 the amplitudes of the first and third modal responses are increased with time as shown in fig 4 f the modal responses plotted in fig 4 could confirm the parametric resonances of the pipe system in fig 3 which are determined with the floquet theory furthermore fig 4 demonstrates that the vibration amplitudes of the excited modal responses increase faster as the maximum eigenvalue of the state transition matrix λ i max increases this indicates that for a larger maximum eigenvalue λ i max the stability of the pipe system would be more seriously affected by internal variable density fluid 4 impacts of internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe in the above section a flexible pipe conveying variable density fluid is analysed the parametric excitation on the pipe is investigated and some parametric resonances are distinguished in this section the external incoming fluid flow is also taken into account and the vortex induced vibrations are considered the influence of the internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe is further analysed 4 1 solution methods when the internal and external fluid flows are simultaneously considered the governing equations of the pipe eq 17 can be solved with the runge kutta method combined with central difference formulas kuiper et al 2008 the pipe is equally divided into a number of segments and connected by nodes with the central difference formulas the governing equations are discretized into a set of ordinary differential equations for the connected nodes then these equations are solved with the fourth order runge kutta method in the time domain in order to get stable and convergent solutions a large number of segments 100 and a sufficiently small time increment δτ 1 0 10 5 are employed the initial calculation conditions are set as η η τ q τ 0 and q 2 for every connected node once the dynamic responses of the pipe are obtained the vibration frequencies can be got through the fast fourier transform technique additionally the modes of the pipe participating in the vibrations are identified with the modal analysis method as utilized by trim et al 2005 4 2 viv model validation to validate the effectiveness of the present model for simulating viv the viv experiment performed by exxonmobil lehn 2003 at the marintek is chosen for comparison in the experiment a vertical flexible pipe rotated around a central column to create uniform incoming flows the main properties of the experiment as well as the dimensionless parameters are listed in table 1 the pipe structural damping is very small when compared with the external fluid damping lehn 2003 wang and xiao 2016 hence it is neglected in the present model the viv results from the experiment cfd simulations huang 2011 wang and xiao 2016 and the present model are compared in fig 5 fig 5 a shows that the steady state response displacements of the pipe at x l 0 22 predicted by the present model agree with the results from the experiment and the cfd simulation wang and xiao 2016 the associated amplitude spectra are plotted in fig 5 b it can be found that the relative errors of the results from the cfd simulation with respect to the experimental results are 12 23 and 10 53 for the frequency and the amplitude respectively the corresponding relative errors of the present model are 19 06 and 31 58 the cfd simulation is better than the present model this is because in the present model the in line viv is neglected while the cfd simulation has considered the in line viv for the whole pipe fig 5 c plots the root mean square rms displacements it can be seen that the results of the present model are in reasonable agreement with those of the experiment and cfd simulations huang 2011 wang and xiao 2016 all of the response curves show that the second mode of the pipe dominates this viv when the present model is compared to the prediction model of meng et al 2017a which also neglects the in line viv the results in fig 6 show that they are in better agreement the results of the present model and meng both have some discrepancies with respect to the experimental results of song et al 2016 the main dimensional parameters of the experiment are listed in table 2 from figs 5 and 6 it can be known that the present model is reliable to simulate the vibration amplitude frequency and dominating mode of viv of flexible pipes in the cross flow direction 4 3 influence of the circular frequency ω since the present model can reliably predict viv the influence from the internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe is going to be analysed because of multi phase flows the total fluid density inside the pipe may fluctuate with different circular frequency ω different amplitude ε and different initial condition the influence of the circular frequency ω on the pipe viv is investigated at first the dimensionless parameters of the pipe system are taken as β 1 0 11 β 2 0 2 v 1 6 f n ap ξ 1 c g 0 ε 1 0 and θ 0 the circular frequency ω is calculated from 2 to 85 with an increment of 0 1 as for the external fluid flow the flow velocity is selected as v 2 ω 1 2πst ω 2 2πst and ω 1 ω 2 4πst where the viv is locked in the first mode of the pipe the second mode and the transition between them referred as non lock in respectively the dynamic responses of the pipe are calculated and the influence of the circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω is analysed for different viv cases 4 3 1 the first mode viv when the external flow velocity v 2 is close to ω 1 2πst the first mode of the pipe would be locked in by the viv because the vortex shedding frequency is close to the first mode natural frequency of the pipe system the dynamic responses of the pipe at the first mode viv for different circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω are simulated the rms displacements and dominant frequencies f dom at the middle point of the pipe are plotted in fig 7 fig 7 a shows that as the circular frequency ω increases the rms displacements of the pipe increase at the parametric resonances of ω ω 1 2 2ω 1 3 ω 1 2ω 1 and ω 1 ω 2 these displacements become larger for larger value of λ i max by referring to fig 3 however when the circular frequency ω is close to ω 2 ω 1 and ω 3 ω 1 the rms displacements are decreased these regions are corresponded to the stable regions of the pipe in fig 3 fig 7 b demonstrates that the dominant frequencies of the pipe will generally decrease increase and then decrease when the circular frequency ω is close to the regions where the rms displacements of the pipe are changed as shown in fig 7 a when the circular frequency ω is close to other parametric resonances like ω ω 2 2ω 2 and ω 2 ω 3 2 fig 7 shows that the rms displacements and dominant frequencies are almost not changed this might be because the pipe would be less affected by the internal variable density fluid in these resonances moreover the external nonlinear fluid damping could limit the vibrations of the pipe in general it can be found from fig 7 that the displacements and frequencies of the pipe would largely change when the first mode natural frequency ω 1 is excited to more clearly understand the dynamic responses of the pipe demonstrated in fig 7 seven different cases are chosen they are for the pipe conveying constant density fluid and variable density fluid at ω 50 ω 1 2ω 1 ω 1 ω 2 ω 2 ω 1 and ω 3 ω 1 the space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses of the pipe are plotted in fig 8 when the internal fluid density is a constant the space time varying displacements of the pipe are plotted in figs 8 a 1 this vibration is uniform and periodic and it is dominated by the first mode of the pipe chaplin et al 2005 thorsen et al 2016 the associated spectra are plotted in figs 8 a 2 there is only one response frequency in the frequency domain it is 1 042 in cycles per dimensionless second which is close to the first mode natural frequency of the pipe system as 2π 1 042 6 55 and ω 1 6 62 the pipe modal responses are plotted in figs 8 a 3 with the rms values it can be seen that the first mode of the pipe contributes most to this vibration when the internal fluid density fluctuates and the fluctuating circular frequency ω is in the non changing regions in fig 7 a as an example ω 50 the pipe space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses are plotted in fig 8 b these figures are quite similar to those of the pipe conveying constant density fluid as shown in fig 8 a therefore it can be known that when the circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω varies in the non changing regions in fig 7 a the first mode viv of the pipe is seldom affected by the internal variable density fluid when the circular frequency ω varies around the simple parametric resonances of ω 1 2 2ω 1 3 ω 1 and 2ω 1 the cases of ω ω 1 and ω 2ω 1 are selected from fig 7 and the dynamic responses are plotted in fig 8 c and d respectively in these resonance conditions the first mode of the pipe would be excited by the internal varying fluid density and it would contribute to the vibration of the pipe as shown in figs 8 c 3 and d 3 where the rms values of the first modal response are increased when compared with figs 8 a 3 in different simple parametric resonances the vibrations of the pipe may be different since the vibration in figs 8 c 1 is asymmetric whereas that in figs 8 d 1 is symmetric for the vibration frequencies the cases of ω ω 1 and ω 2ω 1 are almost the same as plotted in figs 8 c 2 and d 2 due to the contribution from the first mode excited by the internal varying fluid density the pipe vibration amplitudes are increased and the dominant frequencies are changed as shown in fig 7 in the combination resonance of ω ω 1 ω 2 the first and second modes of the pipe are excited by the internal varying fluid density and they contribute to the vibration of the pipe as shown in figs 8 e 3 where the rms values of them are increased as the second mode also takes part in the vibration the space time varying displacements of the pipe become non uniform as plotted in figs 8 e 1 fig 8 e 2 shows that there are two response frequencies 1 055 and 5 186 2π 5 186 32 58 which are close to the first mode and the second mode natural frequencies of the pipe system respectively the former is associated with only one peak along the pipe while the latter is associated with two peaks along the pipe when the circular frequency ω varies around ω 2 ω 1 figs 8 f 3 demonstrates that the first and second modes of the pipe are excited comparing with figs 8 a 3 it can be found that the rms value of the first mode is decreased whereas that of the second mode is increased this reflects that there is a competition between these two modes trim et al 2005 wu et al 2012 the competition may be the reason for the decrease of the rms displacements of the pipe and the fluctuation of the dominant frequencies plotted in fig 7 figs 8 f 1 shows that the pipe space time varying displacements are non uniform in figs 8 f 2 there are two response frequencies which are similar to those in figs 8 e 2 for the case of ω ω 1 ω 2 when ω ω 3 ω 1 figs 8 g 3 shows that the first and third modes of the pipe are excited and they compete with each other in the vibration as a result the rms displacements of the pipe are decreased and the dominant frequencies are changed as shown in fig 7 in figs 8 g 1 the space time varying displacements of the pipe become non uniform figs 8 g 2 shows that there are two response frequencies in this vibration they are 1 042 and 12 07 2π 12 07 75 84 which are close to the first mode and the third mode natural frequencies of the pipe system respectively the second response frequency has three peaks along the pipe 4 3 2 the second mode viv when the external flow velocity v 2 increases to ω 2 2πst the second mode of the pipe is locked in by the viv the rms displacements and dominant frequencies of the pipe at ξ 0 25 which may present the largest vibration amplitude are calculated and plotted in fig 9 fig 9 a shows that as the circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω increases the rms displacements of the pipe increase at the parametric resonances of ω ω 2 ω 1 ω 2 and 2ω 2 and decrease in the vicinities of ω 2 ω 1 and ω 3 ω 2 the dominant frequencies in fig 9 b show that the frequencies increase slightly when the circular frequency ω is small or around ω 2 ω 3 ω 2 and 2ω 2 from fig 9 it can be found that the second mode viv of the pipe would be significantly affected by the internal variable density fluid when the second mode natural frequency ω 2 is involved when comparing fig 7 with fig 9 it can be seen that the vibration amplitudes of the pipe at the first mode viv are much larger than those at the second mode viv the influences from the internal and external fluid flows could cause this in fig 7 the increases of the amplitudes are associated with larger values of the maximum eigenvalue of the state transition matrix λ i max as shown in fig 3 so that the pipe would be more strongly affected by the internal varying fluid density in addition the external nonlinear fluid damping in the second mode viv is larger than that in the first mode viv as the external flow velocity is increased the vibrations of the pipe would be more limited to clearly show the dynamic responses of the pipe seven different cases are selected from fig 9 they are associated with the constant density fluid and variable density fluid when the circular frequency ω is taken as 10 ω 2 ω 1 ω 2 ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 ω 2 and 2ω 2 the space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses of the pipe are plotted in fig 10 in figs 10 a 1 it can be seen that when the pipe transports constant density fluid the vibration is uniform and periodic the second mode of the pipe dominates this vibration in the amplitude spectra of figs 10 a 2 there is only one response frequency f dom 5 149 and it has two peaks along the pipe the modal responses in figs 10 a 3 show that the first three modes of the pipe mainly contribute to this vibration the second mode does the most as it has the largest rms value when the circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω varies in the non changing regions in fig 9 a e g ω 10 fig 10 b show that the space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses are very similar to those of the pipe conveying constant density fluid as plotted in fig 10 a therefore the influence of the internal variable density fluid on the second mode viv of the pipe is very small when the circular frequency ω is changed in the non changing regions in fig 9 a when the circular frequency ω increases to ω 2 ω 1 the pipe space time varying displacements become non uniform and aperiodic as shown in figs 10 c 1 this might be because the first and second modes of the pipe are excited by the internal varying fluid density and they participate in this vibration as shown in figs 10 c 3 when comparing figs 10 c 3 with figs 10 a 3 the competition between these two excited modes can be found as the rms value of the first modal response is increased whereas that of the second modal response is decreased this competition is the reason for the decrease of the rms displacements of the pipe as plotted in fig 9 a figs 10 c 2 shows that there are two response frequencies in this vibration one is 1 208 and the other is 5 149 at the simple parametric resonance of ω ω 2 figs 10 d 1 shows that the pipe vibration is non uniform but it presents a periodic characteristic this vibration has only one response frequency 5 149 as shown in figs 10 d 2 fig 10 d 3 compared with figs 10 a 3 shows that the rms value of the second modal response is increased that means the contribution from the second mode of the pipe is larger in this vibration the rms value of the first modal response is also increased the reason for this may be that the case of ω ω 2 is also in the vicinity of ω ω 1 ω 2 as shown in fig 9 a when ω ω 2 the combination resonance of ω ω 1 ω 2 is also excited then the first mode of the pipe contributes more to this vibration when the circular frequency ω is next to the combination resonance of ω 1 ω 2 the first and second modes of the pipe are excited by the internal varying fluid density both of them participate in the viv of the pipe as shown in figs 10 e 3 fig 10 e 1 shows that the pipe vibration is non uniform and aperiodic in figs 10 e 2 there are mainly two response frequencies in this vibration which are similar to those in figs 10 c 2 as the circular frequency ω is further increased to ω 3 ω 2 figs 10 f 3 shows that the rms values of the first and third modal responses are increased while that of the second modal response is decreased this reflects that the first and third modes of the pipe contribute more to this vibration and they would compete with the dominating second mode the reason for this may be that the case of ω ω 3 ω 2 is next to ω ω 1 ω 2 as shown in fig 9 a when ω ω 3 ω 2 the combination resonance of ω ω 1 ω 2 could also be excited the competition between these excited modes may make the pipe rms displacements to decrease as plotted in fig 9 a and the viv responses to become non uniform and aperiodic as shown in figs 10 f 1 fig 10 f 2 shows that this vibration consists of three response frequencies i e 1 589 5 149 and 11 95 which are close to the first three mode natural frequencies of the pipe system respectively when ω 2ω 1 figs 10 g 1 shows that the space time varying displacements of the pipe are uniform and periodic the reason for this may be that only the second mode of the pipe is excited by the internal varying fluid density and this mode is consistent with the mode excited by the external viv as shown in figs 10 g 3 fig 10 g 2 shows that there is only one response frequency f dom 5 149 in this vibration 4 3 3 non lock in viv the external flow velocity v 2 may change in some circumstances the vortex shedding frequency is away from the natural frequencies of the pipe system and the viv is not locked in to analyse the influence from the circular frequency of the internal fluid density ω on the non lock in viv of the pipe the external flow velocity is taken as v 2 ω 1 ω 2 4πst which is between the first and second modes of the pipe that could be locked in the point at ξ 0 5 of the pipe is selected to demonstrate the rms displacements and dominant frequencies of non lock in viv affected by the circular frequency ω the results are plotted in fig 11 when the viv is not locked in the vibration displacements of the pipe are very small as shown in fig 11 a the rms displacement of the pipe for constant density fluid at ξ 0 5 is 0 023 for the pipe conveying variable density fluid the rms displacements are increased when the circular frequency ω varies around ω 1 2ω 1 ω 2 ω 1 and 57 9 the dominant frequencies of the pipe conveying variable density fluid are almost the same as that of the pipe conveying constant density fluid except in the neighborhood of ω 2ω 1 as shown in fig 11 b around ω 2ω 1 the dominant frequencies for variable density fluid are decreased similarly to further demonstrate the vibrations of the pipe six different cases are chosen from fig 11 they are the cases for the pipe conveying constant density fluid and variable density fluid at ω 50 ω 1 2ω 1 ω 2 ω 1 and 57 9 the space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses are plotted in fig 12 figs 12 a 1 and a 3 show that the vibration of the pipe conveying constant density fluid is still dominated by the first mode but the vibration amplitude is very small from figs 12 a 2 it can be seen that there is only one response frequency 2 866 which is away from the first and second mode natural frequencies of the pipe system when the internal fluid density fluctuates in the non changing regions in fig 11 a the case of ω 50 can be taken as an example and the dynamic response is plotted in fig 12 b when comparing fig 12 b with fig 12 a it can be seen that the space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses are almost the same so the influence of the internal variable density fluid on the non lock in viv of the pipe is very small in this case in the simple parametric resonances of ω ω 1 and ω 2ω 1 the first mode of the pipe is excited by the internal varying fluid density and it contributes to the vibrations of the pipe as shown in figs 12 c 3 and d 3 respectively in which the rms values of the first modal responses are both increased the pipe vibrations in figs 12 c 1 and d 1 are non uniform and periodic for a long range of time the vibration amplitudes are increased figs 12 c 2 and d 2 show that these vibrations consist of two frequencies one is 0 955 and the other is around 2 9 when ω 2ω 1 the first frequency is larger than the second frequency and it becomes the dominant frequency this is the reason for the decrease of the dominant frequencies of pipe as plotted in fig 11 b in the vicinity of ω 2 ω 1 figs 12 e 1 shows that the space time varying displacements of the pipe are non uniform and periodic the pipe vibration has two response frequencies as shown in figs 12 e 2 when comparing figs 12 e 3 with figs 12 a 3 it can be seen that the rms values of the first two modal responses are increased that means the first two modes of the pipe are excited by the internal varying fluid density and they contribute to the vibration when the circular frequency ω is close to 57 9 figs 12 f 1 shows that the pipe response is non uniform and periodic in figs 12 f 2 it can be seen that there are two response frequencies in this vibration one is 2 866 and the other is 12 08 the second frequency corresponds to the third mode natural frequency of the pipe system figs 12 f 3 shows that the rms values of the first and third modal responses are increased meaning that the first and third modes of the pipe are excited by the internal varying fluid density and they contribute to this vibration for this case the circular frequency ω may be linked with ω 3 ω 1 and the non lock in viv make this condition to occur earlier from the above analyses it can be known that when the viv is locked in different modes or not locked in the dynamic responses of the pipe affected by the circular frequency of the internal fluid density are different the external nonlinear fluid damping may cause some effect on this as the circular frequency of the internal fluid density increases the pipe vibration amplitudes would increase or decrease for the viv locked in the first mode or the second mode as shown in figs 7 and 9 respectively while for the non lock in viv the vibration amplitudes are generally increased as shown in fig 11 furthermore the conditions for the increases or decreases of these vibration amplitudes are different for different viv cases in general when the viv dominating mode is excited by the internal varying fluid density the viv of the pipe would be strongly affected by the internal variable density fluid 4 4 influence of the fluctuation amplitude ε the fluid flow inside the pipe may contain different types of fluids the total fluid density may fluctuate with different amplitudes ε which may cause some effect on the viv of the pipe in order to analyse this effect the first mode viv can be typically considered as shown in fig 7 when the circular frequency of the internal fluid density varies the pipe dynamic responses are different for different cases therefore seven representative cases are selected they are for the pipe conveying constant density fluid and variable density fluid at ω 50 ω 1 2ω 1 ω 1 ω 2 ω 2 ω 1 and ω 3 ω 1 for these cases the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density ε is calculated from 0 to 1 with an increment of 0 02 the initial phase angle θ is set as 0 the rms displacements and dominant frequencies of the pipe ξ 0 5 are plotted in fig 13 as the fluctuation amplitude ε increases fig 13 a shows that the rms displacements of the pipe have different changing trends for different cases in the case of ω 50 the rms displacements are approximately unchanged and consistent with that of the constant density fluid case this reflects that the variation of ε has little influence on the viv of the pipe in this case in the parametric resonances of ω ω 1 2ω 1 and ω 1 ω 2 the rms displacements are increased when the fluctuation amplitude ε is sufficiently large the increasing trends of ω ω 1 and ω 2ω 1 are larger than that of ω ω 1 ω 2 on the contrary the pipe rms displacements at ω ω 2 ω 1 and ω ω 3 ω 1 are steadily decreasing as the fluctuation amplitude ε increases overall it can be known that when the fluid density inside the pipe fluctuates with a larger amplitude the viv of the pipe would be more significantly affected the pipe dominant frequencies are plotted in fig 13 b it shows that as the fluctuation amplitude ε increases the frequencies decrease for the cases of ω ω 1 and ω 2ω 1 and increase for the case of ω ω 1 ω 2 for the other cases the dominant frequencies of the pipe are little changed and they are almost consistent with that of the constant density fluid case to clearly show the dynamic responses of the pipe affected by the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density three cases of circular frequency ω 2ω 1 ω 1 ω 2 and ω 3 ω 1 and two values of ε 0 2 and 0 8 are selected from fig 13 the pipe space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses are plotted in fig 14 when ω 2ω 1 as the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density ε increases figs 14 a 1 14 b 1 and 8 d 1 show that pipe vibration amplitude increases largely the vibration frequency is slightly decreased as shown in figs 14 a 2 14 b 2 and 8 d 2 for the modal responses figs 14 a 3 14 b 3 and 8 d 3 show that the rms value of the first mode is increased while those values for the other higher modes are still very small and nearly not changed in the case of ω ω 1 ω 2 with the increase of the fluctuation amplitude ε the internal varying fluid density could cause more effect on the pipe system through parametric excitation figs 14 c 3 14 d 3 and 8 e 3 show that the rms values of the first and second modal responses are increased this indicates that the first and second modes of the pipe would contribute more to the vibration as a result the pipe responses become more non uniform as shown in figs 14 c 1 14 d 1 and 8 e 1 the vibration amplitude is also increased in the frequency domain figs 14 c 2 14 d 2 and 8 e 2 show that the response frequencies are slightly changed but the amplitudes of them are increased when ω ω 3 ω 1 the first and third modes of the pipe are excited by the internal varying fluid density as shown in figs 14 e 3 14 f 3 and 8 g 3 with the increase of the fluctuation amplitude ε the rms value of the first modal response is decreased whereas that of the third modal response is increased this means that the competition between these two excited modes becomes stronger figs 14 e 1 14 f 1 and 8 g 1 show that the responses of the pipe become more non uniform in addition figs 14 e 2 14 f 2 and 8 g 2 show that as the fluctuation amplitude ε increases the amplitude of the first response frequency is decreased while that of the second response frequency is increased 4 5 influence of the initial phase angle θ the variable density fluid travelling in the flexible pipe may have different initial conditions in the present model the initial conditions are simulated with an initial phase angle θ to analyse the influence from the initial conditions of the internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe the initial phase angle θ is calculated from 0 to 2π with an increment of 0 04π the pipe rms displacements and dominant frequencies at ξ 0 5 are plotted in fig 15 in which the first mode viv and seven different cases are considered the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density is taken as ε 1 0 fig 15 a shows that as the initial phase angle θ increases the rms displacements of the pipe remain constants for those cases considered the pipe dominant frequencies have the same characteristics as shown in fig 15 b this means that the viv of the pipe would be seldom affected by the initial conditions of the internal variable density fluid for brevity the space time varying displacements vibration frequencies and modal responses of the pipe for different initial phase angles θ are not plotted here because they are almost the same 5 conclusions the flexible pipes are often used to transport fluid flows like water oil and gas because of multi phase flows the total fluid density inside the pipe may fluctuate with time and space moreover the pipes may undergo vortex induced vibrations when it is subjected to an external incoming fluid flow in this paper a flexible pipe conveying variable density fluid and simultaneously subjected to viv is mathematically modelled and analysed the internal variable density fluid is simulated with a mathematical model which satisfies the conservation law of fluid mass the external vortex induced lift force is modelled with a classical van der pol wake oscillator based on the principle of hamilton the governing equations for the motion of the pipe are derived the parametric excitation on the pipe from the internal varying fluid density is analysed at first then the external viv is taken into account and the influence from the internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe is further investigated some conclusions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 when the pipe conveys variable density fluid it is parametrically excited with the floquet theory the parametric resonances are determined including simple parametric resonances and combination resonances as the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density increases the pipe system would become more unstable due to parametric resonances for a larger value of the maximum eigenvalue of the state transition matrix the pipe would be more strongly affected by the internal variable density fluid 2 when the pipe is excited by the internal variable density fluid and the external viv its dynamic responses would significantly change when the viv dominating mode is excited by the internal varying fluid density due to the contributions and competitions from the excited modes the rms displacements of the pipe would increase or decrease the space time varying displacements would become non uniform or aperiodic some additional response frequencies would appear and the dominant frequencies would change 3 with the increase of the fluctuation amplitude of the internal fluid density the influence of the internal variable density fluid on the viv of the pipe would become more obvious 4 the dynamic responses of the pipe would be seldom affected by the initial conditions of the internal variable density fluid in this paper the variation of the internal fluid density is considered and modelled with a mathematical model its influence on the viv of the pipe is numerically simulated and analysed some experiments or cfd simulations need to be performed in the future to further study the viv of flexible pipes affected by the internal variable density fluid or even more complex multi phase flows in order to gain a better understanding about this complex internal and external fluid structure interactions acknowledgment this research was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51679167 and 51479135 
22781,wave energy converters wecs capable of extracting power in multiple degrees of freedom require a special attention from control engineers as the control problem becomes multivariable involving highly coupled dynamics of the plant taking the three tether submerged buoy as an example of a multi degree of freedom wec this paper presents three main steps that should be taken during control system development firstly an understanding of the system dynamics its rigid body modes of vibration and input output controllability is built using the singular value decomposition approach then a causal close to optimal controller developed for the single tether heaving wec is extended to the multivariable control problem demonstrating a significant increase in the power output as compared to the simple spring damper approach at the final stage technical requirements imposed by this controller on the power take off pto machinery are investigated showing that in order to achieve a 15 improvement in power absorption compared to a quasi standard spring damper control the amount of reactive power should be increased by 50 forcing one pto unit to operate as an actuator all the time keywords multivariable control power take off three tether wec wave energy converter 1 introduction the power production of an oscillating wave energy converter is directly dependent on its hydrodynamic properties and its interaction with an incoming wave front the latter is determined by the control system design which defines whether the buoy passively follows waves or is actively controlled to harvest more energy therefore a properly designed control system of the wec can increase the productivity several times hals et al 2011 in comparison to a passive control load the majority of proposed control algorithms developed for wecs are for systems that operate in one degree of freedom and are considered as single input single output siso systems e g hardy et al 2016 ding et al 2016 faedo et al 2017 however more energy can be harvested when several degrees of freedom are involved and coupled to the power take off unit falnes 2002a it is generally assumed that any siso controller can be easily extended and applied to the multivariable wec which is true when there is an independent control effort over each mode of oscillation as shown in zou et al 2017 abdelkhalik et al 2017 korde et al 2017 in the case when the pto system has an operational space different from the wave induced motion of the wec e g nemos gmbhs 2017 all degrees of freedom become coupled through the pto and mooring system such wecs require more complex multiple input multiple output mimo control algorithms which take into account interactions in the system dynamics regardless of whether the converter operates in one or several degrees of freedom its control is generally considered as an optimisation problem with the objective to maximise power generation subject to displacement and or load force constraints ringwood et al 2014 however the design of the wec is not only driven by the maximisation of the energy production but takes into consideration the cost of the delivered electricity accounting for the capital and operational expenditures of the system therefore improved performance of the wec from an advanced control law is almost always associated with a more complex design of the power take off machinery for example the model predictive control outperforms other controllers in terms of the absorbed power but it requires the highest peak to average ratio of the power flowing through the pto hals et al 2011 therefore recently more attention has been brought to the practical side of the development and implementation of the wec control systems sandia national laboratories wilson et al 2016 coe et al 2017 have performed extensive research on the assessment of the most common control strategies where the comparison has been done not only in terms of the power output but also involving other performance indices related to the pto capacity requirements the results have demonstrated that pto specifications such as the required energy storage the maximum slew rate of the load force etc significantly vary depending on the control strategy furthermore the implemented controller should account for practical limitations of the power take off as demonstrated by genest et al 2014 nie et al 2016 where the transmission energy losses and efficiency of the machinery are included in the formulation of the control law therefore at the early stage of the wec development the pto machinery should be designed according to the requirements imposed by the selected control strategy and if not possible the controller should take into account technical constraints of the system the current paper addresses two research questions i how to modify the siso controller for the wec that operates with multiple degrees of freedom and ii what challenges may arise when it is required to implement the close to optimal controller in practice the description of the converter its numerical model and the controllability analysis are presented in section 2 the design of the high and low level control loops and the performance of the suggested control strategy are shown in section 3 the possibility of practical application of optimal control and associated specifications and requirements for the power take off machinery are discussed in section 4 2 wave energy converter 2 1 system description the wec considered in this study is a fully submerged disk like buoy connected to three power take off units by means of the flexible tethers as shown in fig 1 such configuration of the pto allows the extraction of power from surge heave and pitch motions simultaneously all parameters and dimensions of the converter see table 1 have been selected such that the cost of electricity is minimised considering that the pto is capable of generating a force proportional to the tether displacement and velocity spring damper control 2 2 dynamic model this wec has six degrees of freedom so its motion can be described by the position vector x r 6 1 x 1 surge x 2 sway x 3 heave x 4 roll x 5 pitch x 6 yaw in the reference cartesian coordinate frame o x y z the buoy is connected to three tethers that are represented by the a vector of tether length variables q l 1 l 2 l 3 t the kinematic relationship between the buoy velocity x and the rate of change of the tether length has a form q j 1 x x where j 1 x r 3 6 is the inverse kinematic jacobian which is a function of the buoy current position sergiienko et al 2018 2 3 full dynamics the motion of the three tether wec can be described by the following equation 1 m x f e x c f r a d f v i s c f b u o y f t e n s where f e x c is the wave excitation force vector f r a d is the wave radiation force vector modelled as 2 f r a d a x 0 t k r a d t τ x τ d τ a x f r where a is the matrix with infinite frequency added mass coefficients and k r a d t is a retardation function and f r is replaced by the state space model using the marine system simulator toolbox developed by perez and fossen 2009 3 p r a r p r b r x 4 f r c r p r here p r r 36 1 is an auxiliary vector without any physical meaning for details see sergiienko et al 2017 a r b r and c r are the state space matrices the frequency dependent coefficients of the excitation and radiation forces are obtained using wamit lee 1995 f v i s c is a viscous damping force given by 5 f v i s c 1 2 ρ c d a d x x where c d and are the matrices of the drag coefficients and the cross section areas of the buoy perpendicular to the direction of motion respectively drag coefficients are taken as c d x c d y 0 7 c d z 1 28 and c d x z 0 22 these values were calculated from the numerical wave tank experiments rafiee and fievez 2015 for similar buoy geometry f b u o y is the buoyancy force 6 0 0 m w m b g 0 0 0 t where m w is the mass of the displaced water and m b is the mass of the wec f t e n s is the generalised tether force in the cartesian coordinate frame o x y z 7 f t e n s j t f t j t f t 0 f u and the vector of tether forces f t r 3 1 is a superposition of the initial tension in the tethers that counteracts the buoyancy force and of the control forces exerted on the buoy from the pto machinery also the tethers are assumed to be flexible and they can become slack which is modelled as f t i min f t 0 i f u i 0 the presence of the viscous drag term f v i s c and generalised tether force f t e n s makes system 1 nonlinear with respect to x and f u therefore for the control system development equation 1 should be represented in a state space form and therefore linearised 2 4 linearised state space model the approximation of the viscous damping force by its linear analogue is done using a lorenz linearisation approach suggested by folley 2016 thus f v i s c b v x where the diagonal elements of the linearised damping matrix b v r 6 6 are obtained using the iteration procedure described by bacelli et al 2013 for the wec detailed in table 1 this method gives b v 1 b v 2 2 8 10 5 n s m b v 3 1 9 10 5 n s m and b v 4 b v 5 2 10 7 n s rad nonlinearities in the generalised tether force are associated with the inverse kinematic jacobian which is position dependent so the approximated tether force is 8 f t e n s k t x j 0 t f u where k t can be found in scruggs et al 2013 and j 0 1 j 1 x 0 is the inverse kinematic jacobian at the nominal position of the buoy x 0 0 6 1 as a result the linearised state space model of the wec can be written as 9 x x x p r 0 6 6 i 6 6 0 6 36 m a 1 k t m a 1 b v m a 1 c r 0 36 6 b r a r x x p r 0 6 6 m a 1 0 36 6 f e x c j 0 t f u a wec x b wec u y x 0 6 6 i 6 6 0 6 36 x c wec x and the transfer function that corresponds to this model is 10 g s c wec s i a wec 1 b wec the nonlinear model in equation 1 is used to assess the controller performance while the controller design is based on the linearised model in equation 9 2 4 1 implementation the time domain simulations are implemented in matlab simulink with a time step of 0 01 s using the ode45 solver where the power assessment is required simulation time is set to 300 t p seconds while the first 15 t p are not taken into account due to the transient effects t p is the peak period of the modelled irregular wave 2 5 controllability the converter shown in fig 1 belongs to the class of underactuated mechanisms as it has six degrees of freedom dof but only three independent control inputs non square plant in order to identify what dofs can be controlled and quantify interactions in this mimo system the transfer function of the wec g j ω r 6 3 should be decomposed using singular value decomposition svd 11 g j ω u σ v h where u r 6 6 and v r 3 3 are the singular vectors that form orthonormal bases for the output and input space correspondingly and σ r 6 3 is a diagonal matrix with three non negative singular values σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 singular vectors u correspond to the six rigid body modes of vibration not to be confused with hydrodynamic modes each of which has its own natural frequency and mode shape fu and he 2001 in other words vibration modes can be explained as follows the motion of the wec is usually described using conventional rigid body modes or dofs such as surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw however these dofs are not independent in the three tether wec but are coupled i hydrodynamically due to the cylindrical shape of the buoy and ii through inclined mooring lines coupled dofs that oscillate with the same natural frequency form a mode of vibration ding et al 2019 the graphical representation of the mode shapes that correspond to u i i 1 6 are shown in fig 2 since the system has three control inputs only the first three modes out of the six namely u 1 u 2 and u 3 can be actively controlled by the power take off machinery it can be seen that both output modes u 1 and u 4 involve buoy motion in surge and pitch but i u 1 has a lower resonant frequency than u 4 the incoming wave will excite the buoy motion in either mode u 1 or u 4 depending on which resonant frequency is closer to the wave frequency ii surge and pitch modes are included in u 1 and u 4 with different phases and amplitudes while u 1 is dominated by surge motion u 4 is dominated by pitch moreover surge and pitch modes are in phase in u 1 and have opposite phases in u 4 iii u 1 is controllable while u 4 is not u 4 can be excited by the incident wave but the pto machinery has no effect on this mode another important information obtained from the svd is related to the singular values σ j j 1 3 in control theory singular values are used to show the output directions in which the system inputs are most effective skogestad and postlethwaite 2007 and to identify any controllability problems in the plant the frequency dependent singular values of the wec which correspond to the controllable modes u i i 1 3 are demonstrated in fig 12 it is clear from the plot that in the frequency range of 0 5 0 75 rad s wave period 8 12 s the coupled surge pitch u 1 and sway roll u 2 modes have singular values an order of magnitude higher than these for heaving mode u 3 this implies that less effort is required to control the buoy in surge and sway than in heave at this range of frequencies moreover if the ratio between the maximum and minimum singular values condition number is larger than 10 inverse based controllers may be sensitive to unstructured input uncertainty which is undesirable for practical applications skogestad and postlethwaite 2007 another measure which is widely used to identify control properties of the plant is the relative gain array rga g λ g g g 1 t where denotes the hadamard product element by element multiplication the rga is mostly used to determine an effective input output pairing for use in the control design and to indicate outputs with poor controllability so if the sum of the elements in a row of rga is small 1 then the corresponding output cannot be controlled the rga matrix of the three tether wec is λ g r 6 3 where six rows represent the wec dofs outputs and three columns correspond to the three control inputs through the tethers in order to demonstrate the controllability property of each dof the rga matrix of the plant is calculated over the range of frequencies λ g ω and row sums that correspond to these dofs are shown in fig 3 b as a result relatively large rga elements 0 5 indicate that the pto system has a strong control authority in surge sway and heave but poor controllability over pitch and roll values are 0 5 however it should be noted that this analysis has been performed for the nominal position of the buoy x 0 0 6 1 and the control property of this wec is subject to the buoy orientation 3 controller design and performance in this section the simple but effective velocity tracking controller developed by fusco and ringwood 2013 is extended to the multivariable system as shown in fig 4 the control structure has two major loops i a high level loop sets the reference desired velocity of the buoy and ii a low level loop provides the required machinery power take off force to achieve this velocity 3 1 high level control the main objective of the high level controller is to set the reference buoy velocity x ref having measured or estimated the wave excitation force f e x c the controller does not require any predictions of the excitation force only the current value should be provided in kracht et al 2015 an observer has been designed to estimate the excitation force of a floating device based on the real time measurements of its position velocity acceleration and control force in this study it is assumed that the current value of the wave excitation force is ideally estimated f e x c t f e x c ideal t at each time step 3 1 1 surge pitch compromise according to the linear potential theory the optimal velocity of the wec that is able to absorb power from several degrees of freedom should satisfy the following equation falnes 2002a 12 b ω x ˆ opt ω 1 2 f ˆ e x c ω where the hat symbol ˆ denotes the complex amplitude b ω r 6 6 is the matrix of radiation damping coefficients x ˆ opt ω r 6 1 is the vector of optimal velocity and f ˆ e x c ω r 6 1 is the excitation force vector if b ω is non singular then equation 12 has a unique solution x ˆ opt ω 1 2 b 1 ω f ˆ e x c ω however b 1 ω does not exist for the axisymmetric body if surge and pitch are involved in power absorption and equation 12 cannot be solved simultaneously for x ˆ 1 opt and x ˆ 5 opt therefore if one of the velocities is known the other one can be found from the following equation 13 b 11 b 15 b 51 b 55 x ˆ 1 x ˆ 5 1 2 f ˆ e x c 1 f ˆ e x c 5 for instance for the known value of the pitch velocity x ˆ 5 the optimal buoy velocity in surge can be calculated as in falnes 2002b 14 x ˆ 1 opt f ˆ e x c 5 2 b 55 x ˆ 5 2 b 51 f ˆ e x c 1 2 b 15 x ˆ 5 2 b 11 and vice versa so according to equation 14 the requirement that the buoy velocity should be in phase with the excitation force does not apply if both surge and pitch modes are involved in power generation for the number of cases considered in this paper it is found that f ˆ e x c 1 2 b 15 x ˆ 5 and the coupling between surge and pitch is neglected in the design of the controller in addition due to the presence of the viscous damping force the formulation of the optimal buoy velocity is modified as in fusco and ringwood 2013 15 x ˆ 1 opt f ˆ e x c 1 2 b 11 b v 1 x ˆ 3 opt f ˆ e x c 3 2 b 33 b v 3 where b v 1 and b v 3 are linearised damping coefficients in surge and heave modes respectively 3 1 2 causality assumption the simple and effective controller is based on the assumption that the wave excitation force has a narrow bandwidth which allows one to eliminate the complexity of the noncausal wec control problem thus the excitation force can be represented as a harmonic process with one dominant frequency as justified in fusco and ringwood 2013 16 f e x c i t f e x c i t cos ω i t t ϕ i t where f e x c i t ω i t and ϕ i t are the time variant amplitude frequency and phase of the excitation force respectively this assumption allows the reference velocity of the wec in each hydrodynamic mode i to be set as 17 x i ref t f e x c i t 2 b i i ω i b v i where the estimated frequency ω i is obtained in real time using the extended kalman filter ekf fusco and ringwood 2010 for each hydrodynamic mode i separately and the corresponding value of b i i ω i is set using gain scheduling the unique feature of the fully submerged wecs is that they act as a bandpass filter being excited by the ocean waves in a limited range of wave frequencies therefore the dominant frequency of the excitation force is different from the peak frequency of the incoming wave front the bandpass characteristics of the disk like wec considered in this study are shown in fig 5 a for the irregular wave of h s 1 m and t p 14 s s η ω corresponds to the bretschneider wave spectrum the specialist committee on waves 2002 h f e η ω shows the magnitude of the transfer function from the wave elevation η to the heave excitation force and s f e ω s η ω h f e η ω 2 demonstrates the resultant spectrum of the wave excitation force so despite the fact that the incident waves have a peak frequency ω p η 0 45 rad s 14 s the peak excitation forces occur at a frequency of 0 6 rad s 10 5 s ω corresponds to the value estimated by the ekf the bandpass effect of the submerged wec is clearly demonstrated in fig 5b where the horizontal axis shows to the peak wave period of the sea states of h s 1 m and the vertical axis shows the corresponding dominant period in the excitation force signal thus for all the sea states with 9 s t p 17 s the buoy oscillations in heave will be dominated by a period of 10 s 3 2 low level control as shown in section 2 3 the three tether wec with a buoy shape considered in this study is a bad candidate for the inverse based controllers due to the large condition number at the frequency range of interest therefore as opposed to the internal model approach implemented in fusco and ringwood 2013 sergiienko et al 2017 it was decided to use the svd controller for the tracking control loop see fig 4 this controller is proven to be robust skogestad and postlethwaite 2007 and allows one to decouple the control problem of the multivariable system 18 c s v 0 k s u 0 t where v 0 and u 0 are obtained from the singular value decomposition of g 0 u 0 σ 0 v 0 t g 0 is a real approximation of g j ω 0 at a given frequency ω 0 and k s k s σ 0 1 this controller only requires the design of k s which is chosen as a simple pi controller k s k p k i s in this study ω 0 0 63 rad s k p 5 and k i 0 3 3 controller performance with the control structure defined the performance of the svd based velocity tracking controller was investigated in terms of the reference tracking and power absorption properties 3 3 1 tracking as demonstrated in fig 6 a and b the buoy velocity in both heave and surge has the same phase as the corresponding wave excitation force as the pitch mode is not taken into account in the current controller design it does not satisfy the phase optimality condition which is shown in fig 6c therefore the buoy oscillations in pitch have a negative impact on the power production that is demonstrated in fig 6d the power converted from each hydrodynamic mode j surge heave and pitch is calculated as the difference between excitation power radiated power and viscous losses p j p e x c j p r a d j p v i s c j as a result the power losses associated with the buoy motion in pitch constitute approximately 15 of the total amount of absorbed power 3 3 2 comparison with a spring damper control strategy the performance of the proposed controller is compared with the commonly implemented spring damper control sdc strategy where the load force for the latter is defined as f u i t k p t o δ l i t b p t o δ l i t i 1 3 the control parameters k p t o and b p t o are optimised to maximise power output for each sea state using an exhaustive search the efficiency of both controllers is presented in fig 7 for the range of sea states using bretschneider wave spectra the chosen svd based velocity tracking controller vtc is capable of increasing the power output of the three tether wec by up to 40 for t p 8 s while for the wave periods of t p 8 s the spring damper controller demonstrates slightly better results this is mainly due to the linearisation of the svd controller around ω 0 t 0 10 s frequency 3 3 3 sensitivity to the wave force estimation wec control systems aim to keep the buoy velocity in phase with the wave force modelling uncertainties and input output disturbances may introduce errors in the reference and tracking loops leading to a significant degradation of the converter efficiency o sullivan and lightbody 2017 for the controller shown in fig 4 the main sources of modelling errors and their effect on the buoy performance are listed in table 2 firstly the current value of the excitation force f e x c t is estimated using the extended kalman filter which is based on the available model of the wec any uncertainties in the wec model could lead to the inaccurate estimation of the wave force both amplitude and phase as in kracht et al 2015 which in turn could lead to errors in setting the reference buoy velocity then the estimated excitation force is passed to the reference point generator equation 17 which uses the hydrodynamic damping b i i ω and linearised viscous damping b v i coefficients uncertainties in determining these values may introduce an error in setting the correct amplitude of the buoy velocity the last known modelling error is associated with the design of a velocity tracking control loop in particular inaccuracy in setting k s and σ 0 values may lead to the tracking errors of the control system this in turn may lead to the discrepancy between the desired reference and actual measured amplitude and phase of the buoy velocity in this study it has been assumed that the perfect estimation of the wave excitation force is available and the results presented in fig 7 demonstrate the maximum capability of the velocity tracking controller for the three tether wec however the information provided by the observer plays an essential role in this control strategy and it is important to understand the effect of imperfect wave force estimation on the power output of the wec the sensitivity of the controller to the phase and amplitude errors of the estimated wave force is presented in fig 8 to generate these results it has been assumed that the force value used by the reference point generator has a time delay f e x c t f e x c ideal t τ and the wave force amplitude error is modelled separately as f e x c t 1 ε f e x c ideal t as expected the accurate estimation of the wave force phase is very important and the time delays of 0 3 0 7 s may result in a power reduction of 20 however the system is more robust to the amplitude errors where uncertainties of 50 in the estimation of the excitation force amplitude lead to a decrease in the generated power by only 20 as a result it should be realised that no matter how robust the velocity tracking loop is the reference point generator is of greater importance and to provide an accurate estimation of the wave forces it requires a high fidelity model of the plant 4 considerations on the practical application of the optimal control the svd based velocity tracking control provides a significant increase in power absorption of the wec however this efficiency comes at a cost of the pto machinery since its specifications such as the peak force slew rate energy storage etc directly depend on the implemented control law this section will specify what requirements the power take off should meet in order to accommodate the close to optimal control strategy for the three tether wec 4 1 equivalent spring damper control the spring damper controller is usually designed to operate on the sea state basis while the velocity tracking is a wave by wave control strategy thus the question arises assuming that the pto can only operate as a spring damper system is it possible to implement the velocity tracking control on such machinery using time varying parameters k p t o t and b p t o t the results obtained for the regular wave of h w 1 m and t w 10 s are shown in fig 9 where the required control force for each pto unit of the three tether wec is calculated based on the vtc and then equivalent spring damper parameters are estimated using the least squares method 19 k p t o i e q t δ l i t b p t o i e q t δ l i t f u i v t c t i 1 2 3 the analysis is done assuming that the wave propagates along the x axis β 0 making the first tether aligned with an incoming wave front refer to fig 1 the results imply that i in order to implement optimal control on the three tether wec all pto units should have different settings k p t o 1 e q k p t o 2 3 e q and b p t o 1 e q b p t o 2 3 e q ii the pto attached to the first tether should act as an actuator not generating any power which is indicated by the negative value of the damping b p t o 1 e q 0 these findings are shown more clearly in fig 10 for the range of irregular waves of h s 1 m the contribution of each power take off unit to the total power output of the three tether wec is shown for two different control strategies velocity tracking fig 10b and spring damper fig 10a power factor is calculated as the ratio of the power absorbed by one pto to the total power absorbed by all three pto systems p i p i in the case of the spring damper control considered here all tethers have the same settings of the stiffness and damping and these parameters are positive definite as a result all ptos contribute to the power output however the first unit generates much less energy than the other two as shown in fig 10a this is opposed to the velocity tracking control which requires the first pto to act as an actuator across all sea states while the power to the grid is delivered by the second and third ptos similar observations have been reported in scruggs et al 2013 for the optimal causal control of the floating three tether wec moreover this principle is also used in nemos gmbhs 2017 wave energy converter where one leg is actuating the buoy motion according to the prescribed trajectory 4 2 wave direction the results shown in section 4 1 cover the scenario when the first tether is aligned with the wave propagation however the operational behaviour of each pto unit whether it operates as a generator or as an actuator is highly dependent on the direction of the incoming wave the effect of the wave angle β on the power factor of each pto is demonstrated in fig 11 a for two different sea states thus the operational behaviour of each pto changes when waves come from the opposite direction β 180 the first unit starts delivering power to the grid while the second and third ptos serve as wec actuators also it is interesting that for some wave angles e g β 60 a single pto needs to generate more power power factor 1 than the net power produced by the wec unlike the spring damper controller the velocity tracking control strategy is highly sensitive to the incident wave direction as illustrated in fig 11a therefore its performance in multidirectional waves can deteriorate significantly from the theoretical maximum subject to the directional spreading of the incoming wave as a result the three tether wec may benefit from the velocity tracking controller if installed close to the shore where the mean wave direction is highly predictable and the directional spreading does not exceed 10 20 4 3 tether arrangement the arrangement of tethers including their inclination angles and attachment points affect the power take off capability of this wec as already mentioned in section 2 1 the choice of the converter geometry and other parameters has been driven by minimisation of the levelised cost of electricity provided that the spring damper control is implemented therefore it is possible that the design of this wec in particular the tether arrangement does not meet the requirements of the velocity tracking controller the effect of the tether angle α on the power factor of each pto is demonstrated in fig 11b for the sea state of h s 1 m and t p 12 s it is clear that to be able to implement the velocity tracking control on the three tether wec and to avoid the situation when one of the ptos is working as an actuator the tether angle should be reduced to approximately 25 this can be explained by the fact that tethers and the pto are trying to provide the required optimal motion of the buoy and if the tether arrangement does not allow to achieve this trajectory with all ptos generating power then the optimal control pushes one or several pto units to actuate the wec instead of harvesting power more clearly the importance of the tether arrangement on the implementation of the optimal control can be shown by an example of the three tether wec with a different shape of the buoy vertical cylinder with a radius of 3 8 m height of 11 4 m submergence depth of 3 75 m and water depth of 50 m the new wec and the power factors of its ptos are demonstrated in fig 12 for one sea state of h s 1 m and t p 12 s it is obvious that for the tether angle close to 58 60 all three ptos are generating useful power while for the angles 55 the second and third ptos are actuating the buoy motion power factor is 0 however for larger tether angles the situation is completely opposite and to achieve an optimal trajectory of the buoy the first pto behaves as an actuator whereas the second and third deliver electricity to the grid it is important to note that only an axisymmetric arrangement of tethers is considered in this case study all tethers have the same inclination angle to the vertical while the possibility of other arrangements should be further investigated from a controllability point of view as a result the arrangement of tethers should be considered as an integral part of the control strategy and if it is not possible to install them according to the requirements then the design of the pto system should be modified appropriately 4 4 metrics in order to implement a particular control strategy for the wec the pto machinery should meet certain requirements the analysis of the two control strategies is completed assuming a deployment site of albany western australia with a wave climate shown in fig 13 the quantities used to assess pto specifications are adopted from wilson et al 2016 and indicated in table 3 values in bold are calculated assuming that all tethers are connected to the shared power take off machinery p t i 1 3 p i t while values for individual power take off systems correspond to the case when each tether is driving a separate isolated pto unit average net power for one sea state is calculated as p 1 t t p t d t assuming a 100 efficiency of the actuator average reactive input power is estimated as p i n 1 t t p i n t d t where p i n t p t p t 0 the average stored energy is found as e 1 n i 1 n e i where the energy stored for each cycle is calculated by integrating the reactive power between two consecutive zero crossings e i t 2 i 1 t 2 i p i n t d t a more detailed explanation of notations can be found in fig 14 the average annual values reported in table 3 are obtained taking into account the scatter diagram of wave statistics from fig 13 as a result the average annual power production for the velocity tracking control is 15 higher than that for the spring damper strategy however the negative value of the average net power for the pto 1 confirms that this machinery should be designed to actuate the wec all the time the amount of energy required to provide the reactive power flow without using power from external sources is shown as average stored energy when all three pto units have independent circuits e g hydraulic the vtc strategy involves much higher energy storage for each machinery especially for pto 1 however it is more beneficial to design shared machinery where power can flow between three pto systems e g inside the buoy as this scenario allows the velocity tracking controller to be implemented to the three tether wec with a reduction in energy storage costs as compared to the spring damper control 1257 6 kj vs 2393 3 kj 5 conclusion the svd based velocity tracking control has been applied to the submerged multi degree of freedom wec this controller is causal robust and achieves the optimal amplitude and phase between the buoy velocity and the excitation force in both heave and surge modes the analysis of the controller sensitivity has revealed that while the low level control loop is robust the high level reference point generator requires a high fidelity model of the wec in order to satisfy the optimal phasing condition the performance of the proposed controller has been compared with a quasi standard spring damper approach where a 15 increase in power production is achieved for the deployment site considered it has been found that the velocity tracking control implemented on the three tether converter requires one of the pto units to operate as an actuator all the time however this drawback can be compensated by the shared power take off machinery across all the tethers acknowledgement this research has been supported by the australian government research training program scholarship the authors would like to thank dr ashkan rafiee for providing the parameters of the wec and the discussions of the results also the assistance of dr giorgio bacelli in calculating the power production measures is gratefully acknowledged 
22781,wave energy converters wecs capable of extracting power in multiple degrees of freedom require a special attention from control engineers as the control problem becomes multivariable involving highly coupled dynamics of the plant taking the three tether submerged buoy as an example of a multi degree of freedom wec this paper presents three main steps that should be taken during control system development firstly an understanding of the system dynamics its rigid body modes of vibration and input output controllability is built using the singular value decomposition approach then a causal close to optimal controller developed for the single tether heaving wec is extended to the multivariable control problem demonstrating a significant increase in the power output as compared to the simple spring damper approach at the final stage technical requirements imposed by this controller on the power take off pto machinery are investigated showing that in order to achieve a 15 improvement in power absorption compared to a quasi standard spring damper control the amount of reactive power should be increased by 50 forcing one pto unit to operate as an actuator all the time keywords multivariable control power take off three tether wec wave energy converter 1 introduction the power production of an oscillating wave energy converter is directly dependent on its hydrodynamic properties and its interaction with an incoming wave front the latter is determined by the control system design which defines whether the buoy passively follows waves or is actively controlled to harvest more energy therefore a properly designed control system of the wec can increase the productivity several times hals et al 2011 in comparison to a passive control load the majority of proposed control algorithms developed for wecs are for systems that operate in one degree of freedom and are considered as single input single output siso systems e g hardy et al 2016 ding et al 2016 faedo et al 2017 however more energy can be harvested when several degrees of freedom are involved and coupled to the power take off unit falnes 2002a it is generally assumed that any siso controller can be easily extended and applied to the multivariable wec which is true when there is an independent control effort over each mode of oscillation as shown in zou et al 2017 abdelkhalik et al 2017 korde et al 2017 in the case when the pto system has an operational space different from the wave induced motion of the wec e g nemos gmbhs 2017 all degrees of freedom become coupled through the pto and mooring system such wecs require more complex multiple input multiple output mimo control algorithms which take into account interactions in the system dynamics regardless of whether the converter operates in one or several degrees of freedom its control is generally considered as an optimisation problem with the objective to maximise power generation subject to displacement and or load force constraints ringwood et al 2014 however the design of the wec is not only driven by the maximisation of the energy production but takes into consideration the cost of the delivered electricity accounting for the capital and operational expenditures of the system therefore improved performance of the wec from an advanced control law is almost always associated with a more complex design of the power take off machinery for example the model predictive control outperforms other controllers in terms of the absorbed power but it requires the highest peak to average ratio of the power flowing through the pto hals et al 2011 therefore recently more attention has been brought to the practical side of the development and implementation of the wec control systems sandia national laboratories wilson et al 2016 coe et al 2017 have performed extensive research on the assessment of the most common control strategies where the comparison has been done not only in terms of the power output but also involving other performance indices related to the pto capacity requirements the results have demonstrated that pto specifications such as the required energy storage the maximum slew rate of the load force etc significantly vary depending on the control strategy furthermore the implemented controller should account for practical limitations of the power take off as demonstrated by genest et al 2014 nie et al 2016 where the transmission energy losses and efficiency of the machinery are included in the formulation of the control law therefore at the early stage of the wec development the pto machinery should be designed according to the requirements imposed by the selected control strategy and if not possible the controller should take into account technical constraints of the system the current paper addresses two research questions i how to modify the siso controller for the wec that operates with multiple degrees of freedom and ii what challenges may arise when it is required to implement the close to optimal controller in practice the description of the converter its numerical model and the controllability analysis are presented in section 2 the design of the high and low level control loops and the performance of the suggested control strategy are shown in section 3 the possibility of practical application of optimal control and associated specifications and requirements for the power take off machinery are discussed in section 4 2 wave energy converter 2 1 system description the wec considered in this study is a fully submerged disk like buoy connected to three power take off units by means of the flexible tethers as shown in fig 1 such configuration of the pto allows the extraction of power from surge heave and pitch motions simultaneously all parameters and dimensions of the converter see table 1 have been selected such that the cost of electricity is minimised considering that the pto is capable of generating a force proportional to the tether displacement and velocity spring damper control 2 2 dynamic model this wec has six degrees of freedom so its motion can be described by the position vector x r 6 1 x 1 surge x 2 sway x 3 heave x 4 roll x 5 pitch x 6 yaw in the reference cartesian coordinate frame o x y z the buoy is connected to three tethers that are represented by the a vector of tether length variables q l 1 l 2 l 3 t the kinematic relationship between the buoy velocity x and the rate of change of the tether length has a form q j 1 x x where j 1 x r 3 6 is the inverse kinematic jacobian which is a function of the buoy current position sergiienko et al 2018 2 3 full dynamics the motion of the three tether wec can be described by the following equation 1 m x f e x c f r a d f v i s c f b u o y f t e n s where f e x c is the wave excitation force vector f r a d is the wave radiation force vector modelled as 2 f r a d a x 0 t k r a d t τ x τ d τ a x f r where a is the matrix with infinite frequency added mass coefficients and k r a d t is a retardation function and f r is replaced by the state space model using the marine system simulator toolbox developed by perez and fossen 2009 3 p r a r p r b r x 4 f r c r p r here p r r 36 1 is an auxiliary vector without any physical meaning for details see sergiienko et al 2017 a r b r and c r are the state space matrices the frequency dependent coefficients of the excitation and radiation forces are obtained using wamit lee 1995 f v i s c is a viscous damping force given by 5 f v i s c 1 2 ρ c d a d x x where c d and are the matrices of the drag coefficients and the cross section areas of the buoy perpendicular to the direction of motion respectively drag coefficients are taken as c d x c d y 0 7 c d z 1 28 and c d x z 0 22 these values were calculated from the numerical wave tank experiments rafiee and fievez 2015 for similar buoy geometry f b u o y is the buoyancy force 6 0 0 m w m b g 0 0 0 t where m w is the mass of the displaced water and m b is the mass of the wec f t e n s is the generalised tether force in the cartesian coordinate frame o x y z 7 f t e n s j t f t j t f t 0 f u and the vector of tether forces f t r 3 1 is a superposition of the initial tension in the tethers that counteracts the buoyancy force and of the control forces exerted on the buoy from the pto machinery also the tethers are assumed to be flexible and they can become slack which is modelled as f t i min f t 0 i f u i 0 the presence of the viscous drag term f v i s c and generalised tether force f t e n s makes system 1 nonlinear with respect to x and f u therefore for the control system development equation 1 should be represented in a state space form and therefore linearised 2 4 linearised state space model the approximation of the viscous damping force by its linear analogue is done using a lorenz linearisation approach suggested by folley 2016 thus f v i s c b v x where the diagonal elements of the linearised damping matrix b v r 6 6 are obtained using the iteration procedure described by bacelli et al 2013 for the wec detailed in table 1 this method gives b v 1 b v 2 2 8 10 5 n s m b v 3 1 9 10 5 n s m and b v 4 b v 5 2 10 7 n s rad nonlinearities in the generalised tether force are associated with the inverse kinematic jacobian which is position dependent so the approximated tether force is 8 f t e n s k t x j 0 t f u where k t can be found in scruggs et al 2013 and j 0 1 j 1 x 0 is the inverse kinematic jacobian at the nominal position of the buoy x 0 0 6 1 as a result the linearised state space model of the wec can be written as 9 x x x p r 0 6 6 i 6 6 0 6 36 m a 1 k t m a 1 b v m a 1 c r 0 36 6 b r a r x x p r 0 6 6 m a 1 0 36 6 f e x c j 0 t f u a wec x b wec u y x 0 6 6 i 6 6 0 6 36 x c wec x and the transfer function that corresponds to this model is 10 g s c wec s i a wec 1 b wec the nonlinear model in equation 1 is used to assess the controller performance while the controller design is based on the linearised model in equation 9 2 4 1 implementation the time domain simulations are implemented in matlab simulink with a time step of 0 01 s using the ode45 solver where the power assessment is required simulation time is set to 300 t p seconds while the first 15 t p are not taken into account due to the transient effects t p is the peak period of the modelled irregular wave 2 5 controllability the converter shown in fig 1 belongs to the class of underactuated mechanisms as it has six degrees of freedom dof but only three independent control inputs non square plant in order to identify what dofs can be controlled and quantify interactions in this mimo system the transfer function of the wec g j ω r 6 3 should be decomposed using singular value decomposition svd 11 g j ω u σ v h where u r 6 6 and v r 3 3 are the singular vectors that form orthonormal bases for the output and input space correspondingly and σ r 6 3 is a diagonal matrix with three non negative singular values σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 singular vectors u correspond to the six rigid body modes of vibration not to be confused with hydrodynamic modes each of which has its own natural frequency and mode shape fu and he 2001 in other words vibration modes can be explained as follows the motion of the wec is usually described using conventional rigid body modes or dofs such as surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw however these dofs are not independent in the three tether wec but are coupled i hydrodynamically due to the cylindrical shape of the buoy and ii through inclined mooring lines coupled dofs that oscillate with the same natural frequency form a mode of vibration ding et al 2019 the graphical representation of the mode shapes that correspond to u i i 1 6 are shown in fig 2 since the system has three control inputs only the first three modes out of the six namely u 1 u 2 and u 3 can be actively controlled by the power take off machinery it can be seen that both output modes u 1 and u 4 involve buoy motion in surge and pitch but i u 1 has a lower resonant frequency than u 4 the incoming wave will excite the buoy motion in either mode u 1 or u 4 depending on which resonant frequency is closer to the wave frequency ii surge and pitch modes are included in u 1 and u 4 with different phases and amplitudes while u 1 is dominated by surge motion u 4 is dominated by pitch moreover surge and pitch modes are in phase in u 1 and have opposite phases in u 4 iii u 1 is controllable while u 4 is not u 4 can be excited by the incident wave but the pto machinery has no effect on this mode another important information obtained from the svd is related to the singular values σ j j 1 3 in control theory singular values are used to show the output directions in which the system inputs are most effective skogestad and postlethwaite 2007 and to identify any controllability problems in the plant the frequency dependent singular values of the wec which correspond to the controllable modes u i i 1 3 are demonstrated in fig 12 it is clear from the plot that in the frequency range of 0 5 0 75 rad s wave period 8 12 s the coupled surge pitch u 1 and sway roll u 2 modes have singular values an order of magnitude higher than these for heaving mode u 3 this implies that less effort is required to control the buoy in surge and sway than in heave at this range of frequencies moreover if the ratio between the maximum and minimum singular values condition number is larger than 10 inverse based controllers may be sensitive to unstructured input uncertainty which is undesirable for practical applications skogestad and postlethwaite 2007 another measure which is widely used to identify control properties of the plant is the relative gain array rga g λ g g g 1 t where denotes the hadamard product element by element multiplication the rga is mostly used to determine an effective input output pairing for use in the control design and to indicate outputs with poor controllability so if the sum of the elements in a row of rga is small 1 then the corresponding output cannot be controlled the rga matrix of the three tether wec is λ g r 6 3 where six rows represent the wec dofs outputs and three columns correspond to the three control inputs through the tethers in order to demonstrate the controllability property of each dof the rga matrix of the plant is calculated over the range of frequencies λ g ω and row sums that correspond to these dofs are shown in fig 3 b as a result relatively large rga elements 0 5 indicate that the pto system has a strong control authority in surge sway and heave but poor controllability over pitch and roll values are 0 5 however it should be noted that this analysis has been performed for the nominal position of the buoy x 0 0 6 1 and the control property of this wec is subject to the buoy orientation 3 controller design and performance in this section the simple but effective velocity tracking controller developed by fusco and ringwood 2013 is extended to the multivariable system as shown in fig 4 the control structure has two major loops i a high level loop sets the reference desired velocity of the buoy and ii a low level loop provides the required machinery power take off force to achieve this velocity 3 1 high level control the main objective of the high level controller is to set the reference buoy velocity x ref having measured or estimated the wave excitation force f e x c the controller does not require any predictions of the excitation force only the current value should be provided in kracht et al 2015 an observer has been designed to estimate the excitation force of a floating device based on the real time measurements of its position velocity acceleration and control force in this study it is assumed that the current value of the wave excitation force is ideally estimated f e x c t f e x c ideal t at each time step 3 1 1 surge pitch compromise according to the linear potential theory the optimal velocity of the wec that is able to absorb power from several degrees of freedom should satisfy the following equation falnes 2002a 12 b ω x ˆ opt ω 1 2 f ˆ e x c ω where the hat symbol ˆ denotes the complex amplitude b ω r 6 6 is the matrix of radiation damping coefficients x ˆ opt ω r 6 1 is the vector of optimal velocity and f ˆ e x c ω r 6 1 is the excitation force vector if b ω is non singular then equation 12 has a unique solution x ˆ opt ω 1 2 b 1 ω f ˆ e x c ω however b 1 ω does not exist for the axisymmetric body if surge and pitch are involved in power absorption and equation 12 cannot be solved simultaneously for x ˆ 1 opt and x ˆ 5 opt therefore if one of the velocities is known the other one can be found from the following equation 13 b 11 b 15 b 51 b 55 x ˆ 1 x ˆ 5 1 2 f ˆ e x c 1 f ˆ e x c 5 for instance for the known value of the pitch velocity x ˆ 5 the optimal buoy velocity in surge can be calculated as in falnes 2002b 14 x ˆ 1 opt f ˆ e x c 5 2 b 55 x ˆ 5 2 b 51 f ˆ e x c 1 2 b 15 x ˆ 5 2 b 11 and vice versa so according to equation 14 the requirement that the buoy velocity should be in phase with the excitation force does not apply if both surge and pitch modes are involved in power generation for the number of cases considered in this paper it is found that f ˆ e x c 1 2 b 15 x ˆ 5 and the coupling between surge and pitch is neglected in the design of the controller in addition due to the presence of the viscous damping force the formulation of the optimal buoy velocity is modified as in fusco and ringwood 2013 15 x ˆ 1 opt f ˆ e x c 1 2 b 11 b v 1 x ˆ 3 opt f ˆ e x c 3 2 b 33 b v 3 where b v 1 and b v 3 are linearised damping coefficients in surge and heave modes respectively 3 1 2 causality assumption the simple and effective controller is based on the assumption that the wave excitation force has a narrow bandwidth which allows one to eliminate the complexity of the noncausal wec control problem thus the excitation force can be represented as a harmonic process with one dominant frequency as justified in fusco and ringwood 2013 16 f e x c i t f e x c i t cos ω i t t ϕ i t where f e x c i t ω i t and ϕ i t are the time variant amplitude frequency and phase of the excitation force respectively this assumption allows the reference velocity of the wec in each hydrodynamic mode i to be set as 17 x i ref t f e x c i t 2 b i i ω i b v i where the estimated frequency ω i is obtained in real time using the extended kalman filter ekf fusco and ringwood 2010 for each hydrodynamic mode i separately and the corresponding value of b i i ω i is set using gain scheduling the unique feature of the fully submerged wecs is that they act as a bandpass filter being excited by the ocean waves in a limited range of wave frequencies therefore the dominant frequency of the excitation force is different from the peak frequency of the incoming wave front the bandpass characteristics of the disk like wec considered in this study are shown in fig 5 a for the irregular wave of h s 1 m and t p 14 s s η ω corresponds to the bretschneider wave spectrum the specialist committee on waves 2002 h f e η ω shows the magnitude of the transfer function from the wave elevation η to the heave excitation force and s f e ω s η ω h f e η ω 2 demonstrates the resultant spectrum of the wave excitation force so despite the fact that the incident waves have a peak frequency ω p η 0 45 rad s 14 s the peak excitation forces occur at a frequency of 0 6 rad s 10 5 s ω corresponds to the value estimated by the ekf the bandpass effect of the submerged wec is clearly demonstrated in fig 5b where the horizontal axis shows to the peak wave period of the sea states of h s 1 m and the vertical axis shows the corresponding dominant period in the excitation force signal thus for all the sea states with 9 s t p 17 s the buoy oscillations in heave will be dominated by a period of 10 s 3 2 low level control as shown in section 2 3 the three tether wec with a buoy shape considered in this study is a bad candidate for the inverse based controllers due to the large condition number at the frequency range of interest therefore as opposed to the internal model approach implemented in fusco and ringwood 2013 sergiienko et al 2017 it was decided to use the svd controller for the tracking control loop see fig 4 this controller is proven to be robust skogestad and postlethwaite 2007 and allows one to decouple the control problem of the multivariable system 18 c s v 0 k s u 0 t where v 0 and u 0 are obtained from the singular value decomposition of g 0 u 0 σ 0 v 0 t g 0 is a real approximation of g j ω 0 at a given frequency ω 0 and k s k s σ 0 1 this controller only requires the design of k s which is chosen as a simple pi controller k s k p k i s in this study ω 0 0 63 rad s k p 5 and k i 0 3 3 controller performance with the control structure defined the performance of the svd based velocity tracking controller was investigated in terms of the reference tracking and power absorption properties 3 3 1 tracking as demonstrated in fig 6 a and b the buoy velocity in both heave and surge has the same phase as the corresponding wave excitation force as the pitch mode is not taken into account in the current controller design it does not satisfy the phase optimality condition which is shown in fig 6c therefore the buoy oscillations in pitch have a negative impact on the power production that is demonstrated in fig 6d the power converted from each hydrodynamic mode j surge heave and pitch is calculated as the difference between excitation power radiated power and viscous losses p j p e x c j p r a d j p v i s c j as a result the power losses associated with the buoy motion in pitch constitute approximately 15 of the total amount of absorbed power 3 3 2 comparison with a spring damper control strategy the performance of the proposed controller is compared with the commonly implemented spring damper control sdc strategy where the load force for the latter is defined as f u i t k p t o δ l i t b p t o δ l i t i 1 3 the control parameters k p t o and b p t o are optimised to maximise power output for each sea state using an exhaustive search the efficiency of both controllers is presented in fig 7 for the range of sea states using bretschneider wave spectra the chosen svd based velocity tracking controller vtc is capable of increasing the power output of the three tether wec by up to 40 for t p 8 s while for the wave periods of t p 8 s the spring damper controller demonstrates slightly better results this is mainly due to the linearisation of the svd controller around ω 0 t 0 10 s frequency 3 3 3 sensitivity to the wave force estimation wec control systems aim to keep the buoy velocity in phase with the wave force modelling uncertainties and input output disturbances may introduce errors in the reference and tracking loops leading to a significant degradation of the converter efficiency o sullivan and lightbody 2017 for the controller shown in fig 4 the main sources of modelling errors and their effect on the buoy performance are listed in table 2 firstly the current value of the excitation force f e x c t is estimated using the extended kalman filter which is based on the available model of the wec any uncertainties in the wec model could lead to the inaccurate estimation of the wave force both amplitude and phase as in kracht et al 2015 which in turn could lead to errors in setting the reference buoy velocity then the estimated excitation force is passed to the reference point generator equation 17 which uses the hydrodynamic damping b i i ω and linearised viscous damping b v i coefficients uncertainties in determining these values may introduce an error in setting the correct amplitude of the buoy velocity the last known modelling error is associated with the design of a velocity tracking control loop in particular inaccuracy in setting k s and σ 0 values may lead to the tracking errors of the control system this in turn may lead to the discrepancy between the desired reference and actual measured amplitude and phase of the buoy velocity in this study it has been assumed that the perfect estimation of the wave excitation force is available and the results presented in fig 7 demonstrate the maximum capability of the velocity tracking controller for the three tether wec however the information provided by the observer plays an essential role in this control strategy and it is important to understand the effect of imperfect wave force estimation on the power output of the wec the sensitivity of the controller to the phase and amplitude errors of the estimated wave force is presented in fig 8 to generate these results it has been assumed that the force value used by the reference point generator has a time delay f e x c t f e x c ideal t τ and the wave force amplitude error is modelled separately as f e x c t 1 ε f e x c ideal t as expected the accurate estimation of the wave force phase is very important and the time delays of 0 3 0 7 s may result in a power reduction of 20 however the system is more robust to the amplitude errors where uncertainties of 50 in the estimation of the excitation force amplitude lead to a decrease in the generated power by only 20 as a result it should be realised that no matter how robust the velocity tracking loop is the reference point generator is of greater importance and to provide an accurate estimation of the wave forces it requires a high fidelity model of the plant 4 considerations on the practical application of the optimal control the svd based velocity tracking control provides a significant increase in power absorption of the wec however this efficiency comes at a cost of the pto machinery since its specifications such as the peak force slew rate energy storage etc directly depend on the implemented control law this section will specify what requirements the power take off should meet in order to accommodate the close to optimal control strategy for the three tether wec 4 1 equivalent spring damper control the spring damper controller is usually designed to operate on the sea state basis while the velocity tracking is a wave by wave control strategy thus the question arises assuming that the pto can only operate as a spring damper system is it possible to implement the velocity tracking control on such machinery using time varying parameters k p t o t and b p t o t the results obtained for the regular wave of h w 1 m and t w 10 s are shown in fig 9 where the required control force for each pto unit of the three tether wec is calculated based on the vtc and then equivalent spring damper parameters are estimated using the least squares method 19 k p t o i e q t δ l i t b p t o i e q t δ l i t f u i v t c t i 1 2 3 the analysis is done assuming that the wave propagates along the x axis β 0 making the first tether aligned with an incoming wave front refer to fig 1 the results imply that i in order to implement optimal control on the three tether wec all pto units should have different settings k p t o 1 e q k p t o 2 3 e q and b p t o 1 e q b p t o 2 3 e q ii the pto attached to the first tether should act as an actuator not generating any power which is indicated by the negative value of the damping b p t o 1 e q 0 these findings are shown more clearly in fig 10 for the range of irregular waves of h s 1 m the contribution of each power take off unit to the total power output of the three tether wec is shown for two different control strategies velocity tracking fig 10b and spring damper fig 10a power factor is calculated as the ratio of the power absorbed by one pto to the total power absorbed by all three pto systems p i p i in the case of the spring damper control considered here all tethers have the same settings of the stiffness and damping and these parameters are positive definite as a result all ptos contribute to the power output however the first unit generates much less energy than the other two as shown in fig 10a this is opposed to the velocity tracking control which requires the first pto to act as an actuator across all sea states while the power to the grid is delivered by the second and third ptos similar observations have been reported in scruggs et al 2013 for the optimal causal control of the floating three tether wec moreover this principle is also used in nemos gmbhs 2017 wave energy converter where one leg is actuating the buoy motion according to the prescribed trajectory 4 2 wave direction the results shown in section 4 1 cover the scenario when the first tether is aligned with the wave propagation however the operational behaviour of each pto unit whether it operates as a generator or as an actuator is highly dependent on the direction of the incoming wave the effect of the wave angle β on the power factor of each pto is demonstrated in fig 11 a for two different sea states thus the operational behaviour of each pto changes when waves come from the opposite direction β 180 the first unit starts delivering power to the grid while the second and third ptos serve as wec actuators also it is interesting that for some wave angles e g β 60 a single pto needs to generate more power power factor 1 than the net power produced by the wec unlike the spring damper controller the velocity tracking control strategy is highly sensitive to the incident wave direction as illustrated in fig 11a therefore its performance in multidirectional waves can deteriorate significantly from the theoretical maximum subject to the directional spreading of the incoming wave as a result the three tether wec may benefit from the velocity tracking controller if installed close to the shore where the mean wave direction is highly predictable and the directional spreading does not exceed 10 20 4 3 tether arrangement the arrangement of tethers including their inclination angles and attachment points affect the power take off capability of this wec as already mentioned in section 2 1 the choice of the converter geometry and other parameters has been driven by minimisation of the levelised cost of electricity provided that the spring damper control is implemented therefore it is possible that the design of this wec in particular the tether arrangement does not meet the requirements of the velocity tracking controller the effect of the tether angle α on the power factor of each pto is demonstrated in fig 11b for the sea state of h s 1 m and t p 12 s it is clear that to be able to implement the velocity tracking control on the three tether wec and to avoid the situation when one of the ptos is working as an actuator the tether angle should be reduced to approximately 25 this can be explained by the fact that tethers and the pto are trying to provide the required optimal motion of the buoy and if the tether arrangement does not allow to achieve this trajectory with all ptos generating power then the optimal control pushes one or several pto units to actuate the wec instead of harvesting power more clearly the importance of the tether arrangement on the implementation of the optimal control can be shown by an example of the three tether wec with a different shape of the buoy vertical cylinder with a radius of 3 8 m height of 11 4 m submergence depth of 3 75 m and water depth of 50 m the new wec and the power factors of its ptos are demonstrated in fig 12 for one sea state of h s 1 m and t p 12 s it is obvious that for the tether angle close to 58 60 all three ptos are generating useful power while for the angles 55 the second and third ptos are actuating the buoy motion power factor is 0 however for larger tether angles the situation is completely opposite and to achieve an optimal trajectory of the buoy the first pto behaves as an actuator whereas the second and third deliver electricity to the grid it is important to note that only an axisymmetric arrangement of tethers is considered in this case study all tethers have the same inclination angle to the vertical while the possibility of other arrangements should be further investigated from a controllability point of view as a result the arrangement of tethers should be considered as an integral part of the control strategy and if it is not possible to install them according to the requirements then the design of the pto system should be modified appropriately 4 4 metrics in order to implement a particular control strategy for the wec the pto machinery should meet certain requirements the analysis of the two control strategies is completed assuming a deployment site of albany western australia with a wave climate shown in fig 13 the quantities used to assess pto specifications are adopted from wilson et al 2016 and indicated in table 3 values in bold are calculated assuming that all tethers are connected to the shared power take off machinery p t i 1 3 p i t while values for individual power take off systems correspond to the case when each tether is driving a separate isolated pto unit average net power for one sea state is calculated as p 1 t t p t d t assuming a 100 efficiency of the actuator average reactive input power is estimated as p i n 1 t t p i n t d t where p i n t p t p t 0 the average stored energy is found as e 1 n i 1 n e i where the energy stored for each cycle is calculated by integrating the reactive power between two consecutive zero crossings e i t 2 i 1 t 2 i p i n t d t a more detailed explanation of notations can be found in fig 14 the average annual values reported in table 3 are obtained taking into account the scatter diagram of wave statistics from fig 13 as a result the average annual power production for the velocity tracking control is 15 higher than that for the spring damper strategy however the negative value of the average net power for the pto 1 confirms that this machinery should be designed to actuate the wec all the time the amount of energy required to provide the reactive power flow without using power from external sources is shown as average stored energy when all three pto units have independent circuits e g hydraulic the vtc strategy involves much higher energy storage for each machinery especially for pto 1 however it is more beneficial to design shared machinery where power can flow between three pto systems e g inside the buoy as this scenario allows the velocity tracking controller to be implemented to the three tether wec with a reduction in energy storage costs as compared to the spring damper control 1257 6 kj vs 2393 3 kj 5 conclusion the svd based velocity tracking control has been applied to the submerged multi degree of freedom wec this controller is causal robust and achieves the optimal amplitude and phase between the buoy velocity and the excitation force in both heave and surge modes the analysis of the controller sensitivity has revealed that while the low level control loop is robust the high level reference point generator requires a high fidelity model of the wec in order to satisfy the optimal phasing condition the performance of the proposed controller has been compared with a quasi standard spring damper approach where a 15 increase in power production is achieved for the deployment site considered it has been found that the velocity tracking control implemented on the three tether converter requires one of the pto units to operate as an actuator all the time however this drawback can be compensated by the shared power take off machinery across all the tethers acknowledgement this research has been supported by the australian government research training program scholarship the authors would like to thank dr ashkan rafiee for providing the parameters of the wec and the discussions of the results also the assistance of dr giorgio bacelli in calculating the power production measures is gratefully acknowledged 
22782,challenges associated with dynamically installed anchors dias include prediction of anchor embedment depth and subsequent pullout performance under chain loading numerical analyses on the behaviour of dias require advanced modelling methods that can deal with a hydrodynamic aspects during the free fall in water b large soil deformations with high strain rate effects during the dynamic penetration c post installation consolidation d pullout performances considering installation and anchor chain effect this paper divides the behaviour of dias into three stages including anchor free fall in water stage 1 anchor dynamic penetration in soil stage 2 and anchor pullout under operational loadings stage 3 and gives an overview of numerical advancements on the analysis of dias at each stage by illustrating typical numerical results and comparisons between various methods the advantages and limitations of the numerical modelling methods are highlighted the advantage of the finite volume method fvm based on computational fluid dynamics is its capability in the full simulation of an anchor dynamic installation in water followed by in soil stages 1 and 2 however the stress induced anisotropy of the soil cannot be captured by the fvm the finite element fe method especially the large deformation finite element ldfe method is preferable to analyse stages 2 and 3 the effects of soil properties on the performance of dias can be quantified by the ldfe method in terms of strain rate strain softening pore pressure and drag force keywords dynamically installed anchors clays dynamic installation pullout numerical modelling methods offshore engineering 1 introduction the move of offshore oil and gas developments beyond the immediate continental shelf into deeper waters and untested environments has necessitated the development of cost effective and reliable anchoring solutions the most recent generation of anchoring solution dynamically installed anchors dias has been identified as the most cost effective and promising concept for mooring floating facilities in deep water clayey sediments they are also being increasingly considered in shallow waters for temporary mooring of floating facilities and for mooring floating wind turbines and wave energy converters in recent years the dia geometries have evolved broadly into two categories torpedo and omni max dias the torpedo dias are rocket shaped typically consist of a long shaft with the loading point or padeye attached at the top and may feature up to 4 relatively small fins at the trailing edge brandão et al 2006 lieng et al 2010 the omni max dias feature three large fins with intermittent discontinuity to accommodate a loading arm near the tip of the anchor shelton 2007 zimmerman et al 2009 nie and shelton 2011 a dia attached to a mooring chain is released from a specified drop height h d of 30 150 m above the seabed this allows the anchor to gain velocity as it falls freely through the water column before impacting the seafloor and embedding into the sediments up to 3 0 times the anchor length this whole installation process only takes a few seconds after it is released brandão et al 2006 zimmerman et al 2009 the mooring chain is then lifted up from the seafloor and attached to the floating facility at the sea surface 1 1 operational stages of dias the installation and pullout of dias are illustrated in fig 1 which can be divided into three main stages a stage 1 anchor free fall in water b stage 2 anchor dynamic penetration in soil and c stage 3 anchor pullout under operational loadings in stage 1 two main hydrodynamic characteristics of the anchor need attention a drag coefficient and b directional stability the hydrodynamic drag force which is dependent on the anchor drag coefficient working with the anchor gravity dictates the anchor impact velocity v i at the seabed the impact velocity increases with increasing anchor drop height h d until it reaches its limit termed terminal velocity v t since the anchor embedment depth in the seabed soil increases with increasing anchor impact velocity the anchor terminal velocity can result in a maximum anchor embedment in the seabed however with increasing anchor drop height the anchor directional stability reduces i e anchor is falling non vertically hence the anchor may diverge from the target installation point and arrive at the seabed with a significant tilting angle consequently depending on the tilting tolerance the anchor may need to be recovered and reinstalled fernandes et al 2011 in stage 2 the anchor penetrates into the seabed with the kinetic energy obtained during the anchor free fall in water the prediction of the anchor embedment depth in the seabed soil is complicated by two aspects at its entrance point at the mudline a the very high strain rate up to 25 s 1 at the soil anchor interface at high impact velocity and b the possible entrainment of a boundary layer of water adjacent to the anchor o loughlin et al 2009 randolph et al 2011 hossain et al 2015 in addition the soil adjacent to the anchor becomes considerably disturbed and significant excess pore water pressures are accumulated around the anchor and they both influence the subsequent anchor penetration resistance hence anchor embedment depth and pullout capacity richardson et al 2009 kim and hossain 2016 after the completion of installation a set up period is allowed for the disturbed soil to reconsolidate and the excess pore water pressure to dissipate the anchor pullout capacity generally increases with time in the set up period for instance a finless torpedo anchor with 0 76 m diameter 12 m length and 240 kn weight was installed in the campos basin the tip embedment depth was 20 m the lateral capacity of the anchor after a ten day set up period was 2 75 times the capacity from immediate pullout after installation medeiros 2002 in stage 3 the mooring chains are attached to the floating facility transmitting monotonic or cyclic loading to the anchors through the anchor padeye several studies have demonstrated that the lowered padeye position may allow the anchor to embed further i e diving under pullout loading gaudin et al 2013 tian et al 2014a liu et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 kim and hossain 2017 if the anchor is embedded in a sufficient depth during installation and the padeye is located at a proper position the anchor may be able to dive under operational loadings this can be more promising where the mooring chain angle at the mudline to the horizontal θ 0 in fig 1b is relatively low 1 2 aim of the paper this paper first briefly summarises the progress of physical modelling on the performance of dias in all three stages stage 1 anchor free fall in water stage 2 anchor dynamic penetration in soil and stage 3 anchor pullout under operational loadings the anchor behaviours and soil flow mechanisms observed in model tests are noted the paper then systematically reports an overview of the advanced numerical modelling methods to analyse and predict the performance of dias in water and in soil the main aim is to provide some insights into the advanced analysis methods developed by various research groups the advantages and limitations of each method are highlighted by comparing the results from various numerical methods 2 overview of physical modelling for each operation stage of dias for stage 1 anchor free fall process in water has been recorded by dropping anchors in a water tank or column and capturing the motion by a high speed video camera or a mini motion tracking device e g hasanloo et al 2012 liu et al 2018a captured images by high speed cameras have led to measure the anchor terminal velocity which was used to calculate the drag coefficient the motion tracking device consisting of a tri axis mems micro electromechanical systems accelerometer and a three component gyroscope was adopted to record the anchor acceleration and angular velocity based on which the anchor fall history and tilt from the original vertical direction were determined for the torpedo dias with simple shape the drag coefficient was about 0 67 0 7 o beirne et al 2017 while for the omni max dias with more complex shape the drag coefficient was 0 87 liu et al 2018a liu et al 2018a showed that the tilt angle from the shaft of the omni max dias to the vertical direction increased monotonously with increasing fall distance indicating that the anchor directional stability was relatively low this has necessitated to carry out numerical simulations for determining the locations of the hydrodynamic centre and gravity centre of the anchor which were used to character the anchor directional stability triantafyllou and hover 2003 for stage 2 the physical process during dynamic installation of dias or projectiles have been captured through testing in transparent soils e g chen et al 2014 due to the opacity of natural soils and difficulty of half anchor testing against a window the images were captured by a camera and subsequently quantified by particle image velocimetry in natural soils centrifuge tests have been undertaken to assess anchor impact velocity at the soil surface and embedment depth in the soil body for various drop heights e g o loughlin et al 2004 2013 hossain et al 2014 2015 o beirne et al 2015a chang et al 2019a by adopting a high speed camera the soil response and hole closure condition above the torpedo anchors was examined o beirne et al 2015a recently the model anchors have been instrumented with a mems accelerometer that yielded information in regards to anchor velocity embedment depth and orientation verticality e g hossain et al 2015 chang et al 2019a han et al 2019 based on the variation of anchor velocity along the penetration depth the strain rate behaviour of the soil adjacent to the installing anchor and the drag force of the soil acting on the anchor were highlighted it was quantified that water entrainment at the anchor soil interface has led to about 13 increase in anchor installation depth regardless to reveal the evolution of soil failure mechanisms with the progress of an anchor installation and to capture detail soil anchor interaction numerical simulations were necessary for stage 3 during loading anchor trajectory along with diving potential has been tracked through i half anchor testing against a window han and liu 2017 liu et al 2018b ii anchor testing in transparent soils shelton 2007 and iii anchor instrumented with mems testing in natural soils e g chang et al 2019a for the former the motion mechanisms of the anchor and connected chain were illustrated and the failure envelopes of studless chain and rope have been proposed and established han and liu 2017 liu et al 2018b for the latter the mems accelerometer yielded data in terms of anchor location with the final position being identified by post test dissection of the soil sample capacity under monotonic and cyclic loadings have been measured and vertical horizontal failure envelopes have been established e g hossain et al 2014 2015 chang et al 2019a 2019b the omni max and fish dias were aligned perpendicular to the loading direction at the padeye during keying leading to an improved capacity liu et al 2018b chang et al 2019a 2019b compared to the torpedo dias the motion mechanism of the omni max dias was more complex the loss of embedment and diving potential of the omni max dias during keying were affect by a number of factors including loading angle at the padeye padeye offset ratio and fin thickness a parametric numerical investigation varying the key parameters systematically was therefore necessary 3 advanced numrical modelling methods for each operation stage of dias among various numerical modelling methods four advanced approaches have been used widely in research and in industry for the analysis of dias these include a finite volume method fvm based on computational fluid dynamics cfd b arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale c remeshing and interpolation technique with small strain ritss d coupled lagrangian eulerian cel approach extensive theoretical formulations and background information about these numerical methods can be found in raie 2009 and wang et al 2015 which are not repeated here instead some insights into each approach are provided by assessing its potential applicability to dias at different stages the corresponding advantages and limitations of each approach are discussed 3 1 anchor free fall in water stage 1 to simulate the anchor free fall in water the fvm has been used by most researchers with the commercial packages of fluent raie 2009 soh et al 2017 liu and zhang 2017a liu et al 2019 and ansys cfx silva 2010 most of the analyses have been conducted by fixing the anchor in space and allowing the water to flow passing the anchor upwards this was to reduce the computational cost this modelling method was referred to as a steady state regime the drag coefficient and directional stability of dias have been investigated by raie 2009 silva 2010 soh et al 2017 and liu et al 2019 by varying the tip angle aspect ratio rear angle diameter ratio and water properties they concluded that i for the drag coefficient of the anchor the most influential factor was the aspect ratio of the anchor and the influence can be as high as 47 and ii for the directional stability of the anchor the geometry of the anchor fins and the location of the anchor mass centroid became important fig 2 a the directional stability of the omni max anchor was explored by liu et al 2019 the hydrodynamic centre of the anchor was determined and the directional stability of the anchor was deduced based on the relative position of the hydrodynamic centre and gravity centre of the anchor the dia free fall in water was also simulated using the fvm by releasing a torpedo anchor in water with zero initial velocity raie 2009 in this simulation the flow parameters such as velocity and pressure fields were obtained in each time step based on the pressure field the resistance force on the anchor was determined at impacting the seabed 41 of the total resistance force was contributed by the drag force including 29 by pressure drag and 12 by friction drag the model was also adopted by liu and zhang 2017a to simulate the free fall performance of omni max anchors in water the anchor directional stability was deteriorated due to the asymmetrical design of the loading arm for instance with a drop height of h d 62 m the anchor tilting angle from the vertical direction α in was 2 2 and 5 9 for anchors with the loading arm in line with one pair of fins case a in fig 2b and between two pairs of fins case b in fig 2b respectively in summary the fvm has the capacity to simulate the free fall dropping of dias in water in addition even when the anchor velocity becomes high no cavitation is induced at the front edge of the anchor as the entire process lasts only a few seconds however further advancements are required such as validation against field data in particular the anchor free fall analysis should be carried out with an attached mooring chain at its padeye which may affect the stability of the anchor lieng et al 2000 3 2 dynamic penetration in soil stage 2 for the anchor dynamic penetration into the seabed soil one of the key challenges is how to accurately model the large soil deformations not only in a non homogeneous soil deposit but also considering the instantaneous soil strength changes due to the high strain rate and excess pore pressure induced by anchor penetration both large deformation finite element ldfe and fvm analyses have been conducted in ldfe analysis the commonly used approaches by various researchers include ale ritss and cel in this section applications of these approaches are discussed based on the stress conditions applied in their analysis i e effective stress and total stress analysis in all cases the anchor dynamic installation was modelled from the soil surface with an impact velocity v i 3 2 1 effective stress analysis for dia penetration 3 2 1 1 ale approach the ale approach is based on the operator split technique proposed by benson 1989 and tailored to geotechnical applications by nazem et al 2006 the mesh distortion was eliminated by optimising the location of grid nodes without altering the topology or global degrees of freedom of the mesh with pore water pressure convections and permeability updates the ale method was extended to solve large strain consolidation problems nazem et al 2008 recently the ale method was used to analyse penetration problems sheng et al 2009 nazem et al 2012 moavenian et al 2016 including the penetration of torpedo anchors sabetamal et al 2013 2014 2016 in the analysis with the ale approach sabetamal et al 2016 the nonlinear behaviour of the soil was captured by the modified cam clay mcc model allowing the incorporation of shear induced pore water pressures during the anchor penetration the effect of strain rate was accounted for by a semi logarithmic function einav and randolph 2005 as eq 1 listed in table 1 and linking to over consolidation ratio without softening effect the anchor soil contact formulation was based on a mortar segment to segment scheme significantly reducing the numerical oscillations for very soft viscous clay the effect of the inertial drag force eq 2 in table 1 was also incorporated into the ale model a finless torpedo anchor falling freely into a saturated soil layer was studied sabetamal et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 the advantage of this effective stress based approach is that it can capture the anchor velocity fig 4 a and evolution of excess pore water pressure fig 4b along the penetration depth the effect of strain rate parameter λ and drag force can also be quantified as shown in fig 4 the anchor embedment depth reduces with increasing rate dependency λ and considering drag force f wd emphasising the necessity of the consideration another advantage is the capturing of the dissipation of excess pore water pressure during the set up period after the completion of installation fig 5 it shows that a degree of consolidation of 90 for elements within a radial distance of 1d of the anchor tip was achieved within 51 82 days after the installation 3 2 1 2 ritss approach the ritss was proposed by hu and randolph 1998 and extended to three dimensional conditions by yu et al 2008 and wang et al 2010 it is essentially a form of h adaptive finite element method with small strain lagrangian calculations in each incremental step and interpolation of stresses and material properties from the old mesh to the new mesh tian et al 2014b presented an alternative development of the ritss method which avoids the effort of coding specialist remeshing and mapping solution subroutines the ritss was commonly used to analyse static or low speed problems randolph et al 2008 wang et al 2015 recently it was extended from static to dynamic analysis wang et al 2013 as demonstrated by chang et al 2017 the ritss method is able to perform an effective stress analysis of dias dynamically penetrating in soil capturing the excess pore water pressure the effective stress analysis was achieved by total stress analysis with the soil skeleton s effective stress strain matrix and the pore water stiffness being defined respectively allowing for capturing excess pore water pressure an elasto viscoplastic soil model evp mcc established on the basis of the overstress theory and the mcc model was used to describe the rate dependent behaviour of the soil by the overstress theory of perzyna 1966 the total strain rate was divided into an elastic and a viscoplastic component the elastic component was assumed to be time independent with a similar way to the mcc model while the viscoplastic component was time dependent to reflect the strain rate effect as eq 3 listed in table 1 the frictional formulation at the soil anchor interface adopted the coulomb friction law thus far a finless torpedo anchor dynamically penetrating into a normally consolidated clay was studied by chang et al 2017 as shown in fig 6 typical results in terms of anchor tip embedment depth and excess pore water pressure are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively from fig 7 the achieved tip embedment depth using the evp mcc rate dependent model lies close to the measured embedment richardson 2008 while that using the rate independent mcc model is 20 2 deeper from fig 8 it can be seen that the maximum excess pore water pressure appears around the anchor tip and then expands radially at the end of installation the positive excess pore water pressure extends over a zone with a radial extension of 4 2d from the anchor centre axis 3 2 1 3 cel approach the cel method was first proposed by noh 1964 and developed by benson 1992 and benson and okazawa 2004 to overcome the disadvantages of the pure lagrangian and eulerian methods in the cel analysis a traditional lagrangian phase is followed by an eulerian or transport phase benson 1992 dassault systèmes 2012 in the lagrangian phase the element nodes are temporarily fixed within the material resulting in the elements deform with the material in the eulerian phase the state variables are mapped to the fixed eulerian mesh the cel approach uses an explicit time integration scheme which is conditionally stable in contrast to the ale and ritss approaches the cel approach supports multiple materials including voids in a single element the flow of eulerian material among different meshes is tracked by computing its eulerian volume fraction the cel method has been implemented in the software abaqus dassault systèmes 2012 and adopted to solve geotechnical problems with large deformations qiu et al 2011 tho et al 2013 hu et al 2014 liu et al 2014c dutta et al 2015 zhao and liu 2015 using the cel approach liu et al 2014b simulated dynamic installation of a finless torpedo anchor in soil which was modelled as a rate independent mohr coulomb mc material in their study the effective stress framework was established by specifying the components of the effective stress constitutive matrix and an equivalent bulk modulus of the pore fluid this allows for capturing excess pore water pressure however the pore pressure dissipation after the anchor installation cannot be simulated by the cel approach where a coupled flow lagrangian analysis is needed yi et al 2014 3 2 2 discussion on the effective stress analysis approaches in the current ritss approach the ideally undrained conditions are assumed for the simulation of anchor penetration it means the dissipation of excess pore water pressure cannot be simulated however both the development of excess pore water pressure during the anchor penetration and the subsequent dissipation during set up can be captured by the ale approach the ritss and ale analyses have been carried out under a two dimensional axisymmetric condition the real geometric shapes of 4 fin torpedo and omni max dias can therefore not be simulated the cel approach is well suited to solve geotechnical problems with structures of complex geometries however the simulation of pore pressure dissipation after the anchor penetration cannot be performed by the cel approach in addition in the cel approach a very fine soil mesh e g minimum element size 0 01 0 02d kim et al 2015a was necessary to capture the anchor soil contact accurately therefore compared to the number of elements used in the lagrangian based approaches the number of elements in soil was more than tripled with very fine mesh used along the trajectory of the anchor 3 2 3 total stress analysis for dia penetration using the cel approach total stress analyses on the dynamic penetration of dias have been performed by kim and hossain 2015 kim et al 2015a 2015b liu et al 2016a in these works finless and 4 fin torpedo anchors and omni max anchors have been considered a modified tresca soil model was adopted allowing for the effects of strain rate and strain softening the herschel bulkley h b model herschel and bulkley 1926 was used to reflect the strain rate effect while the einav randolph model einav and randolph 2005 was adopted to consider the softening effect eq 4 in table 1 there are two different methods for considering the frictional forces between soil and anchor a general contact method b reaction force method kim et al 2015a 2015b and kim and hossain 2015 suggested a general contact method using a general contact algorithm in abaqus dassault systèmes 2012 in this algorithm the soil anchor interface property was specified by a total stress coulomb friction law with a limiting shear stress τ max along the anchor soil interface the value of the limiting interface friction must be set prior to the analysis before the value of the adjacent soil strength is known to overcome this difficulty for each case the limiting interface friction was determined by 1 simulating anchor penetration with frictionless contact 2 obtaining the final anchor tip penetration depth and calculating s u ref at that depth and 3 setting τ max equal to an interface friction ratio or adhesion factor α times the calculated s u ref at the final tip depth from frictionless contact with α taken as the inverse soil sensitivity 1 s t typical results for a 4 fin torpedo anchor are shown in fig 9 the anchor embedment depth accounting for the effects of strain rate and strain softening is lower than that for ideal tresca soil although the strain rate dependency is partly compensated by the softening liu et al 2016a proposed a reaction force method to overcome the limitations of the general contact method both drag force eq 5 in table 1 and frictional resistance eq 6 in table 1 were incorporated by applying vertically upward concentrated forces on the anchor the effects of strain rate and strain softening were considered within the frictional resistance fig 10a illustrates the effect of hydrodynamic drag force on reducing embedment depth fig 10 b displays the effect of frictional resistance i e adhesion factor α demonstrating greater effect on a torpedo anchor than an omni max anchor due to larger contact surface area 3 2 4 comparison between general contact method and reaction force method measured data from field trials on torpedo anchors brandão et al 2006 and omni max anchors zimmerman et al 2009 have been well simulated by the general contact model kim et al 2015b kim and hossain 2015 and the reaction force model liu et al 2016a the parameters used in the analyses are listed in table 2 direct comparisons show that the embedment depth from the reaction force method is slightly lower than that of the general contact method see fig 11 the differences between these two methods arise from 1 hydrodynamic drag force and 2 anchor soil contact surface e g it was assumed to be equal to the total surface area of the anchor in the reaction force method however although there are little differences both methods have shown the capability and accuracy in assessing the embedment depth during dynamic installation of dias in non homogeneous clay 3 2 5 fvm analysis the dynamic penetration of dias in soil can also be simulated using the fvm raie and tassoulas 2009 simulated the dynamic penetration of a finless torpedo anchor using the cfd computer program fluent fluent 2008 liu and zhang 2017b performed a three dimensional fvm simulation of dynamic installation of omni max anchors using the software ansys cfx ansys 2016 in both of these two fvm analyses the soil was modelled as a viscous fluid and its dynamic property was captured using the herschel bulkley h b model with the h b model the effect of soil strain rate can be considered by specifying the yield shear stress and the expression of the viscosity consistency due to the limitation of the cfd software only no slip and free slip anchor soil interfaces are available which correspond to the soil moving together with the anchor and no frictional force acting on the anchor liu and zhang 2018 developed a thin layer element model to consider the finite slip interaction the soil strength in the thin layer element can be set up based on the friction between the object and its surrounding soil the key advantage of the fvm is its capability of simulating the full installation process of dias from the release point to the final embedment depth including the transition of anchor from water to soil raie and tassoulas 2009 han et al 2019 for instance in han et al 2019 the omni max anchor was allowed to release both in water and air before impacting the seabed the drag force provided by water and soil therefore can be estimated the results indicated that the drag coefficient in soil is approximately 0 55 which is relatively lower than that of 0 87 in water in addition compared to the cel method the computational efficiency of the fvm is higher by using a subdomain technique in the vicinity of the object hawlader et al 2015 liu and zhang 2017b although the fvm provides the pressure and shear stress in soil the stress at any point of the soil equals to the pressure at that point independent of the direction that means the vertical and horizontal stresses on soil elements are assumed be identical which is an unrealistic assumption for soil sabetamal et al 2013 3 2 6 benchmark test medeiros 2002 reported installation of a full scale finless torpedo anchor in campos basin offshore brazil the site consisted of soft normally consolidated clay with strength increasing linearly with depth as s u ref 5 2z kpa the anchor shaft was 0 762 m in diameter 12 m length and with a 60 conical tip and had a dry weight of w d 400 kn the anchor was released from a drop height of 30 m above the seafloor the achieved impact velocity was v i 22 m s and tip embedment depth d e t 29 m this field installation was selected as a benchmark case to assess the performance of each method at predicting anchor embedment depth four calculations were carried out using the ale ritss and cel methods and the results were compared with that from the fvm and measured field data details of each calculation are listed in table 3 the velocity penetration profiles from all calculation are illustrated in fig 12 for all profiles the anchor consistently accelerates slightly in the early stage of penetration and then decelerates asymptotically approaching the final embedment depth the computed embedment depths are just 2 1 9 7 deeper than the achieved embedment depth in the field this confirms that although the mechanisms of the ale ritss cel and fvm are somewhat or essentially different a reasonable prediction can be obtained with representative input parameters for each method 3 3 pullout performance of dias under monotonic chain loading stage 3 after the completion of installation and a set up period the mooring chains are attached to the floating facility transmitting monotonic or cyclic loading to the anchors the mooring chain angle at the mudline θ 0 varies with the mooring type catenary taut leg and tension leg initially the chain in soil remains nearly vertical after the dynamic installation during pullout loading the chain cuts through the soil and transfers load to the anchor the installed embedded anchor is then keyed into position to provide required holding capacity for operations with the potential to dive deeper during keying or operation with omni max anchors there is also a possibility to be pulled out of the seabed depending on the padeye location and the chain pullout angle θ 0 at the mudline see fig 1b in any case the chain angle at the padeye θ a evolves during the pullout process the whole process can be quasi static as opposed to dynamic for installation in this section the numerical approaches to analyse the anchor behaviour under monotonic chain pullout loading are reviewed and the anchor behaviours are summarised note that the following analyses are all under total stress analysis 3 3 1 installation effect on pullout capacity most previous numerical investigations on the pullout capacity of dias have been either limited to small strain analyses lieng et al 2000 de sousa et al 2011 liu et al 2016b or pre embedded anchors or wished in place in the ideal tresca soil ignoring the influence of anchor installation wang and o loughlin 2014 o beirne et al 2015b recently kim and hossain 2016 carried out a series of ldfe analyses using the cel approach to explore the installation effect on the pullout capacity integrated dynamic installation followed by immediate instantaneous monotonic pullout simulations were undertaken on torpedo anchors for this quasi static monotonic pullout a semi logarithmic function eq 1 listed in table 1 einav and randolph 2005 was adopted to reflect the strain rate and softening effect in the clay soil model the anchor pullout at various angles at the padeye θ a i e without considering the mooring chain was simulated by applying an inclined displacement rather than an inclined force the ultimate pullout capacities at various θ a were obtained with the consideration of the soil disturbance from its installation phase fig 13 illustrates the effects of installation methods i e dynamic and quasi static installation on anchor pullout capacity the quasi static installation produced higher vertical pullout capacity than the dynamic installation due to the lower soil disturbance adjacent to the quasi static installed anchor this effect reduced to minimal for lower pullout angles θ a 3 3 2 keying and diving behaviours of omni max anchors the omni max anchor was designed by shifting the padeye towards its tip at round 2 3 of the anchor length for better keying and potential diving in soil upon pullout loading see fig 1b the keying and diving characteristics of omni max anchors have been assessed through ldfe analyses without and with considering the attached mooring chain 3 3 2 1 anchor keying without anchor chain effect using the ritss approach the keying and diving behaviours of omni max anchors were investigated by liu et al 2014a 2016b in their analysis the tresca soil model was used without considering strain rate and softening effects the omni max anchor geometry was somewhat simplified in the 3d space two different pullout loading angles at the padeye θ a 22 5 and 30 were investigated by controlling padeye displacement kim and hossain 2017 carried out 3d analyses using the cel approach a modified tresca soil model was adopted allowing for the effects of strain rate and strain softening following einav randolph s model einav and randolph 2005 it should be noted that a load control instead of displacement control at the padeye was adopted to obtain the apparent anchor trajectory in addition the simulation was fully integrated taking into account the disturbed soil conditions during the anchor installation as described in section 3 3 1 typical results presented in fig 14 show that the anchor pullout capacity increases as the anchor dives deeper the diving tendency is strongly dependent on the padeye offset ratio see fig 15 a and the loading angle tian et al 2015 kim and hossain 2017 after a parametric study the relationship between the stabilised anchor travelling angle and the padeye offset ratio is suggested as shown in fig 15b it shows that the anchor behaviour will change from diving to pulling out if the loading angle increases or the padeye offset ratio decreases kim and hossain 2017 recommended that the anchor diving will be ensured if the padeye offset ratio is in the range of 0 25 0 53 and the loading angle is θ a 45 3 3 2 2 anchor keying with anchor chain effect the interaction between the anchor and the chain at the padeye can be quantified by the load t a and the loading angle θ a at the padeye it was critical to assess the chain behaviour accurately during the anchor keying since the values of t a and θ a change during keying which has a significant effect on the diving potential of omni max anchors zhao and liu 2016 due to the soil normal and tangential resistances on the chain the chain exhibits a reverse catenary profile in the seabed resulting in that the loading angle at the padeye is higher than that at the mudline the loading angle at the padeye is unknown and depends on the chain diameter soil strength characterisation loading angle at the mudline and so forth liu et al 2018b the chain effect on the performance of omni max anchors was investigated by zhao and liu 2016 and zhao et al 2016 using the cel approach the von mises soil model was used without considering strain rate and softening effects the mooring line was divided into two parts one is constructed by link connector element to simulate the mooring line embedded in soil and the other was constructed by beam connector element to simulate the mooring line submerged in water fig 16 the link element maintains a constant distance between two cylindrical units and each cylindrical unit can rotate freely in all directions while the beam element is a rigid straight line representing the chain in water fig 17 illustrates the anchor trajectory and the anchor chain profiles during the pullout the embedded anchor chain forms a reverse catenary shape which leads to the variation of the loading angle at the padeye θ a in the range of 16 9 36 4 however the incorporation of the anchor chain in the analysis zhao and liu 2016 makes the simulation computationally expensive e g 2 weeks for the pullout case of v d 0 5 m s with two 2 9 ghz intel xeon e5 2690 processors 16 cores and 32 threads and 32 gb ram the numerical stability of the cel method was ensured by introducing a critical time increment δt critical the value of δt critical can be approximately estimated by l min c d where l min is the minimum element dimension in eulerian meshes and c d is the dilatational wave speed of the material a slight decrease of δt critical increases the computational time significantly since the chain has a small diameter and a long length i e much longer that the anchor width a small value of l min or δt critical and massive number of soil elements to ensure accuracy were resulted and hence a very costly computing time to overcome this shortcoming zhao et al 2016 introduced an anchor chain equation neubecker and randolph 1995 eq 7 listed in table 1 in the analysis this eliminated the anchor chain elements and increased the computation efficiency the chain equation was incorporated into the cel analysis by a user subroutine allowing the loading angle at the padeye to be varied during the pullout fig 18 compares anchor trajectory and pullout capacity both chain modelling methods by using chain elements and by using the chain equation produced very similar anchor trajectories however the computation time was reduced by up to 62 when the anchor chain equation was used 4 performance of different numerical methods and future works the performance of various numerical methods is discussed for three different stages of dias stage 1 anchor free fall in water stage 2 anchor dynamic penetration in soil and stage 3 anchor pullout performance under monotonic chain loading 1 stage 1 the fvm is capable of capturing the dynamic properties of water including incompressibility viscous property and flow pattern in fvm analysis water pressure drag force and anchor motion can be monitored at each penetration velocity currently the fvm is regarded as the most appropriate way to simulate the dynamic penetration of dias in water further investigations are required e g connecting a mooring chain which may affect the stability of the anchor with the falling anchor 2 stage 2 among all the ldfe approaches only the ale approach sabetamal et al 2016 is able to perform a fully coupled analysis including the penetration process and the post installation reconsolidation in the ritss and cel approaches the effective stress and the pore water pressure during anchor penetration can be calculated by assuming undrained conditions and a specified soil model liu et al 2014b chang et al 2017 the cel approach is also capable of performing a total stress analysis incorporating the effects of strain rate and strain softening via an empirical formula there are two ways to deal with the anchor soil interface friction i e general contact method and reaction force method through a comparison between these two methods it is found that the friction frame adopted by the reaction force method has slightly larger effect on the embedment depth than that by the general contact method this is attributed due to the fact that 1 the anchor soil contact surface is assumed to be equal to the total surface area of the anchor and 2 the effects of strain rate and stain softening on the frictional resistance is incorporated the current cel approach in abaqus is only available for 3d modelling however the cel approach can accommodate the boundary value problems with more complex 3d geometries which has yet been a challenge for the ale and ritss approaches wang et al 2015 the full simulation of an anchor dynamic installation in water followed by in soil as is the case in the field cannot be simulated using the cel ale or ritss approach the fvm is capable of this complete simulation raie 2009 however in the fvm analysis the stress at any point of the material equals to the pressure at that point independent of the direction that means the vertical and horizontal stresses on soil elements are assumed to be identical which is an unrealistic assumption for soil sabetamal et al 2016 as such further works need to be done for the complete simulation 3 stage 3 the effect of dynamic installation on the pullout capacity of dias has been investigated by kim and hossain 2016 using the cel approach however the mobilised pore water pressure and the set up effects were not considered a fully coupled formulation needs to be developed for simulating the post installation reconsolidation during a set up period and the subsequent monotonic or cyclic pullout the keying and diving of omni max anchors were simulated by the cel approach it was shown that the inclusion of a chain instead of using an equation has a minimal effect there are some problems to be solved first the cel approach provides only the coulomb frictional contact between the anchor and the soil allowing a limiting shear stress τ max to be specified the value of τ max cannot vary with time and space in the analysis however during the keying diving and pullout of the anchor in the normally consolidated clay the frictional resistance varies with anchor embedment depth second it is computationally expensive to simulate the keying and diving of omni max anchors because the required pullout distance is long more than 2l a which necessitates a wider computational domain how to improve the computational efficiency is a future challenge finally an integrated and complete simulation of a dia for installation and pullout is a challenge this requires the complete simulation of an anchor in a series of actions encountered in the field 1 anchor installation in water 2 anchor installation in soil 3 set up in soil and 4 anchor pullout by chain in soil all the features of applicable numerical methods for dias are summarised in table 4 5 concluding remarks the installation of dynamically installed anchors dias and their performance under operational loadings involve large movements during installation dias experience large penetration through the water column and into the seabed for a dia penetrating into the seabed numerical analysis requires techniques that allow for i simulating soil behaviours under large strains with high strain rate i e dynamic effect ii tracking soil movements i e large deformation and its properties and iii updating soil strength changes based on cumulative shear strains i e clay remoulding for a dia under operational loadings it can be treated as a quasi static problem but involves cyclic loading which incurs two opposite effects on the soil strength soil strength degradation due to remoulding and the reverse due to consolidation the numerical analysis becomes even more complex when the mooring chain is simulated this paper provides an overview of numerical advancements on the numerical analysis of dias in clay including anchor free fall in water stage 1 anchor dynamic penetration in soil stage 2 and anchor pullout performance under monotonic chain loading stage 3 the considered soil constitutive models and soil anchor interface contact have been discussed the ability of capturing high strain rate effect and excess pore water pressure during dynamic installation and dissipation of excess pore water pressure during set up have been highlighted of particular interest was the effect of considering chain on the pullout performance the advantages and limitations of each numerical approach for simulating each stage have been noted overall for this complicated problem an excellent and very promising progress has been made over the last decade for numerical simulation of each stage soil constitutive models have been extended keeping the number of parameters as low as possible and successfully incorporated in the large deformation analysis frameworks time consumption per analysis has also been reduced by using the chain equation to reflect chain effects the next challenges include i simulating the complete anchor installation process in water and soil and performance under set up and operational loadings using a single numerical framework package ii applying operational loads through a mooring chain instead of at the padeye allowing quantification of the contribution of chain soil interaction on the anchor capacity and iii carrying out simulation under operational cyclic loading acknowledgments the research presented here was undertaken with support from the australian research council through the

22782,challenges associated with dynamically installed anchors dias include prediction of anchor embedment depth and subsequent pullout performance under chain loading numerical analyses on the behaviour of dias require advanced modelling methods that can deal with a hydrodynamic aspects during the free fall in water b large soil deformations with high strain rate effects during the dynamic penetration c post installation consolidation d pullout performances considering installation and anchor chain effect this paper divides the behaviour of dias into three stages including anchor free fall in water stage 1 anchor dynamic penetration in soil stage 2 and anchor pullout under operational loadings stage 3 and gives an overview of numerical advancements on the analysis of dias at each stage by illustrating typical numerical results and comparisons between various methods the advantages and limitations of the numerical modelling methods are highlighted the advantage of the finite volume method fvm based on computational fluid dynamics is its capability in the full simulation of an anchor dynamic installation in water followed by in soil stages 1 and 2 however the stress induced anisotropy of the soil cannot be captured by the fvm the finite element fe method especially the large deformation finite element ldfe method is preferable to analyse stages 2 and 3 the effects of soil properties on the performance of dias can be quantified by the ldfe method in terms of strain rate strain softening pore pressure and drag force keywords dynamically installed anchors clays dynamic installation pullout numerical modelling methods offshore engineering 1 introduction the move of offshore oil and gas developments beyond the immediate continental shelf into deeper waters and untested environments has necessitated the development of cost effective and reliable anchoring solutions the most recent generation of anchoring solution dynamically installed anchors dias has been identified as the most cost effective and promising concept for mooring floating facilities in deep water clayey sediments they are also being increasingly considered in shallow waters for temporary mooring of floating facilities and for mooring floating wind turbines and wave energy converters in recent years the dia geometries have evolved broadly into two categories torpedo and omni max dias the torpedo dias are rocket shaped typically consist of a long shaft with the loading point or padeye attached at the top and may feature up to 4 relatively small fins at the trailing edge brandão et al 2006 lieng et al 2010 the omni max dias feature three large fins with intermittent discontinuity to accommodate a loading arm near the tip of the anchor shelton 2007 zimmerman et al 2009 nie and shelton 2011 a dia attached to a mooring chain is released from a specified drop height h d of 30 150 m above the seabed this allows the anchor to gain velocity as it falls freely through the water column before impacting the seafloor and embedding into the sediments up to 3 0 times the anchor length this whole installation process only takes a few seconds after it is released brandão et al 2006 zimmerman et al 2009 the mooring chain is then lifted up from the seafloor and attached to the floating facility at the sea surface 1 1 operational stages of dias the installation and pullout of dias are illustrated in fig 1 which can be divided into three main stages a stage 1 anchor free fall in water b stage 2 anchor dynamic penetration in soil and c stage 3 anchor pullout under operational loadings in stage 1 two main hydrodynamic characteristics of the anchor need attention a drag coefficient and b directional stability the hydrodynamic drag force which is dependent on the anchor drag coefficient working with the anchor gravity dictates the anchor impact velocity v i at the seabed the impact velocity increases with increasing anchor drop height h d until it reaches its limit termed terminal velocity v t since the anchor embedment depth in the seabed soil increases with increasing anchor impact velocity the anchor terminal velocity can result in a maximum anchor embedment in the seabed however with increasing anchor drop height the anchor directional stability reduces i e anchor is falling non vertically hence the anchor may diverge from the target installation point and arrive at the seabed with a significant tilting angle consequently depending on the tilting tolerance the anchor may need to be recovered and reinstalled fernandes et al 2011 in stage 2 the anchor penetrates into the seabed with the kinetic energy obtained during the anchor free fall in water the prediction of the anchor embedment depth in the seabed soil is complicated by two aspects at its entrance point at the mudline a the very high strain rate up to 25 s 1 at the soil anchor interface at high impact velocity and b the possible entrainment of a boundary layer of water adjacent to the anchor o loughlin et al 2009 randolph et al 2011 hossain et al 2015 in addition the soil adjacent to the anchor becomes considerably disturbed and significant excess pore water pressures are accumulated around the anchor and they both influence the subsequent anchor penetration resistance hence anchor embedment depth and pullout capacity richardson et al 2009 kim and hossain 2016 after the completion of installation a set up period is allowed for the disturbed soil to reconsolidate and the excess pore water pressure to dissipate the anchor pullout capacity generally increases with time in the set up period for instance a finless torpedo anchor with 0 76 m diameter 12 m length and 240 kn weight was installed in the campos basin the tip embedment depth was 20 m the lateral capacity of the anchor after a ten day set up period was 2 75 times the capacity from immediate pullout after installation medeiros 2002 in stage 3 the mooring chains are attached to the floating facility transmitting monotonic or cyclic loading to the anchors through the anchor padeye several studies have demonstrated that the lowered padeye position may allow the anchor to embed further i e diving under pullout loading gaudin et al 2013 tian et al 2014a liu et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 kim and hossain 2017 if the anchor is embedded in a sufficient depth during installation and the padeye is located at a proper position the anchor may be able to dive under operational loadings this can be more promising where the mooring chain angle at the mudline to the horizontal θ 0 in fig 1b is relatively low 1 2 aim of the paper this paper first briefly summarises the progress of physical modelling on the performance of dias in all three stages stage 1 anchor free fall in water stage 2 anchor dynamic penetration in soil and stage 3 anchor pullout under operational loadings the anchor behaviours and soil flow mechanisms observed in model tests are noted the paper then systematically reports an overview of the advanced numerical modelling methods to analyse and predict the performance of dias in water and in soil the main aim is to provide some insights into the advanced analysis methods developed by various research groups the advantages and limitations of each method are highlighted by comparing the results from various numerical methods 2 overview of physical modelling for each operation stage of dias for stage 1 anchor free fall process in water has been recorded by dropping anchors in a water tank or column and capturing the motion by a high speed video camera or a mini motion tracking device e g hasanloo et al 2012 liu et al 2018a captured images by high speed cameras have led to measure the anchor terminal velocity which was used to calculate the drag coefficient the motion tracking device consisting of a tri axis mems micro electromechanical systems accelerometer and a three component gyroscope was adopted to record the anchor acceleration and angular velocity based on which the anchor fall history and tilt from the original vertical direction were determined for the torpedo dias with simple shape the drag coefficient was about 0 67 0 7 o beirne et al 2017 while for the omni max dias with more complex shape the drag coefficient was 0 87 liu et al 2018a liu et al 2018a showed that the tilt angle from the shaft of the omni max dias to the vertical direction increased monotonously with increasing fall distance indicating that the anchor directional stability was relatively low this has necessitated to carry out numerical simulations for determining the locations of the hydrodynamic centre and gravity centre of the anchor which were used to character the anchor directional stability triantafyllou and hover 2003 for stage 2 the physical process during dynamic installation of dias or projectiles have been captured through testing in transparent soils e g chen et al 2014 due to the opacity of natural soils and difficulty of half anchor testing against a window the images were captured by a camera and subsequently quantified by particle image velocimetry in natural soils centrifuge tests have been undertaken to assess anchor impact velocity at the soil surface and embedment depth in the soil body for various drop heights e g o loughlin et al 2004 2013 hossain et al 2014 2015 o beirne et al 2015a chang et al 2019a by adopting a high speed camera the soil response and hole closure condition above the torpedo anchors was examined o beirne et al 2015a recently the model anchors have been instrumented with a mems accelerometer that yielded information in regards to anchor velocity embedment depth and orientation verticality e g hossain et al 2015 chang et al 2019a han et al 2019 based on the variation of anchor velocity along the penetration depth the strain rate behaviour of the soil adjacent to the installing anchor and the drag force of the soil acting on the anchor were highlighted it was quantified that water entrainment at the anchor soil interface has led to about 13 increase in anchor installation depth regardless to reveal the evolution of soil failure mechanisms with the progress of an anchor installation and to capture detail soil anchor interaction numerical simulations were necessary for stage 3 during loading anchor trajectory along with diving potential has been tracked through i half anchor testing against a window han and liu 2017 liu et al 2018b ii anchor testing in transparent soils shelton 2007 and iii anchor instrumented with mems testing in natural soils e g chang et al 2019a for the former the motion mechanisms of the anchor and connected chain were illustrated and the failure envelopes of studless chain and rope have been proposed and established han and liu 2017 liu et al 2018b for the latter the mems accelerometer yielded data in terms of anchor location with the final position being identified by post test dissection of the soil sample capacity under monotonic and cyclic loadings have been measured and vertical horizontal failure envelopes have been established e g hossain et al 2014 2015 chang et al 2019a 2019b the omni max and fish dias were aligned perpendicular to the loading direction at the padeye during keying leading to an improved capacity liu et al 2018b chang et al 2019a 2019b compared to the torpedo dias the motion mechanism of the omni max dias was more complex the loss of embedment and diving potential of the omni max dias during keying were affect by a number of factors including loading angle at the padeye padeye offset ratio and fin thickness a parametric numerical investigation varying the key parameters systematically was therefore necessary 3 advanced numrical modelling methods for each operation stage of dias among various numerical modelling methods four advanced approaches have been used widely in research and in industry for the analysis of dias these include a finite volume method fvm based on computational fluid dynamics cfd b arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale c remeshing and interpolation technique with small strain ritss d coupled lagrangian eulerian cel approach extensive theoretical formulations and background information about these numerical methods can be found in raie 2009 and wang et al 2015 which are not repeated here instead some insights into each approach are provided by assessing its potential applicability to dias at different stages the corresponding advantages and limitations of each approach are discussed 3 1 anchor free fall in water stage 1 to simulate the anchor free fall in water the fvm has been used by most researchers with the commercial packages of fluent raie 2009 soh et al 2017 liu and zhang 2017a liu et al 2019 and ansys cfx silva 2010 most of the analyses have been conducted by fixing the anchor in space and allowing the water to flow passing the anchor upwards this was to reduce the computational cost this modelling method was referred to as a steady state regime the drag coefficient and directional stability of dias have been investigated by raie 2009 silva 2010 soh et al 2017 and liu et al 2019 by varying the tip angle aspect ratio rear angle diameter ratio and water properties they concluded that i for the drag coefficient of the anchor the most influential factor was the aspect ratio of the anchor and the influence can be as high as 47 and ii for the directional stability of the anchor the geometry of the anchor fins and the location of the anchor mass centroid became important fig 2 a the directional stability of the omni max anchor was explored by liu et al 2019 the hydrodynamic centre of the anchor was determined and the directional stability of the anchor was deduced based on the relative position of the hydrodynamic centre and gravity centre of the anchor the dia free fall in water was also simulated using the fvm by releasing a torpedo anchor in water with zero initial velocity raie 2009 in this simulation the flow parameters such as velocity and pressure fields were obtained in each time step based on the pressure field the resistance force on the anchor was determined at impacting the seabed 41 of the total resistance force was contributed by the drag force including 29 by pressure drag and 12 by friction drag the model was also adopted by liu and zhang 2017a to simulate the free fall performance of omni max anchors in water the anchor directional stability was deteriorated due to the asymmetrical design of the loading arm for instance with a drop height of h d 62 m the anchor tilting angle from the vertical direction α in was 2 2 and 5 9 for anchors with the loading arm in line with one pair of fins case a in fig 2b and between two pairs of fins case b in fig 2b respectively in summary the fvm has the capacity to simulate the free fall dropping of dias in water in addition even when the anchor velocity becomes high no cavitation is induced at the front edge of the anchor as the entire process lasts only a few seconds however further advancements are required such as validation against field data in particular the anchor free fall analysis should be carried out with an attached mooring chain at its padeye which may affect the stability of the anchor lieng et al 2000 3 2 dynamic penetration in soil stage 2 for the anchor dynamic penetration into the seabed soil one of the key challenges is how to accurately model the large soil deformations not only in a non homogeneous soil deposit but also considering the instantaneous soil strength changes due to the high strain rate and excess pore pressure induced by anchor penetration both large deformation finite element ldfe and fvm analyses have been conducted in ldfe analysis the commonly used approaches by various researchers include ale ritss and cel in this section applications of these approaches are discussed based on the stress conditions applied in their analysis i e effective stress and total stress analysis in all cases the anchor dynamic installation was modelled from the soil surface with an impact velocity v i 3 2 1 effective stress analysis for dia penetration 3 2 1 1 ale approach the ale approach is based on the operator split technique proposed by benson 1989 and tailored to geotechnical applications by nazem et al 2006 the mesh distortion was eliminated by optimising the location of grid nodes without altering the topology or global degrees of freedom of the mesh with pore water pressure convections and permeability updates the ale method was extended to solve large strain consolidation problems nazem et al 2008 recently the ale method was used to analyse penetration problems sheng et al 2009 nazem et al 2012 moavenian et al 2016 including the penetration of torpedo anchors sabetamal et al 2013 2014 2016 in the analysis with the ale approach sabetamal et al 2016 the nonlinear behaviour of the soil was captured by the modified cam clay mcc model allowing the incorporation of shear induced pore water pressures during the anchor penetration the effect of strain rate was accounted for by a semi logarithmic function einav and randolph 2005 as eq 1 listed in table 1 and linking to over consolidation ratio without softening effect the anchor soil contact formulation was based on a mortar segment to segment scheme significantly reducing the numerical oscillations for very soft viscous clay the effect of the inertial drag force eq 2 in table 1 was also incorporated into the ale model a finless torpedo anchor falling freely into a saturated soil layer was studied sabetamal et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 the advantage of this effective stress based approach is that it can capture the anchor velocity fig 4 a and evolution of excess pore water pressure fig 4b along the penetration depth the effect of strain rate parameter λ and drag force can also be quantified as shown in fig 4 the anchor embedment depth reduces with increasing rate dependency λ and considering drag force f wd emphasising the necessity of the consideration another advantage is the capturing of the dissipation of excess pore water pressure during the set up period after the completion of installation fig 5 it shows that a degree of consolidation of 90 for elements within a radial distance of 1d of the anchor tip was achieved within 51 82 days after the installation 3 2 1 2 ritss approach the ritss was proposed by hu and randolph 1998 and extended to three dimensional conditions by yu et al 2008 and wang et al 2010 it is essentially a form of h adaptive finite element method with small strain lagrangian calculations in each incremental step and interpolation of stresses and material properties from the old mesh to the new mesh tian et al 2014b presented an alternative development of the ritss method which avoids the effort of coding specialist remeshing and mapping solution subroutines the ritss was commonly used to analyse static or low speed problems randolph et al 2008 wang et al 2015 recently it was extended from static to dynamic analysis wang et al 2013 as demonstrated by chang et al 2017 the ritss method is able to perform an effective stress analysis of dias dynamically penetrating in soil capturing the excess pore water pressure the effective stress analysis was achieved by total stress analysis with the soil skeleton s effective stress strain matrix and the pore water stiffness being defined respectively allowing for capturing excess pore water pressure an elasto viscoplastic soil model evp mcc established on the basis of the overstress theory and the mcc model was used to describe the rate dependent behaviour of the soil by the overstress theory of perzyna 1966 the total strain rate was divided into an elastic and a viscoplastic component the elastic component was assumed to be time independent with a similar way to the mcc model while the viscoplastic component was time dependent to reflect the strain rate effect as eq 3 listed in table 1 the frictional formulation at the soil anchor interface adopted the coulomb friction law thus far a finless torpedo anchor dynamically penetrating into a normally consolidated clay was studied by chang et al 2017 as shown in fig 6 typical results in terms of anchor tip embedment depth and excess pore water pressure are shown in figs 7 and 8 respectively from fig 7 the achieved tip embedment depth using the evp mcc rate dependent model lies close to the measured embedment richardson 2008 while that using the rate independent mcc model is 20 2 deeper from fig 8 it can be seen that the maximum excess pore water pressure appears around the anchor tip and then expands radially at the end of installation the positive excess pore water pressure extends over a zone with a radial extension of 4 2d from the anchor centre axis 3 2 1 3 cel approach the cel method was first proposed by noh 1964 and developed by benson 1992 and benson and okazawa 2004 to overcome the disadvantages of the pure lagrangian and eulerian methods in the cel analysis a traditional lagrangian phase is followed by an eulerian or transport phase benson 1992 dassault systèmes 2012 in the lagrangian phase the element nodes are temporarily fixed within the material resulting in the elements deform with the material in the eulerian phase the state variables are mapped to the fixed eulerian mesh the cel approach uses an explicit time integration scheme which is conditionally stable in contrast to the ale and ritss approaches the cel approach supports multiple materials including voids in a single element the flow of eulerian material among different meshes is tracked by computing its eulerian volume fraction the cel method has been implemented in the software abaqus dassault systèmes 2012 and adopted to solve geotechnical problems with large deformations qiu et al 2011 tho et al 2013 hu et al 2014 liu et al 2014c dutta et al 2015 zhao and liu 2015 using the cel approach liu et al 2014b simulated dynamic installation of a finless torpedo anchor in soil which was modelled as a rate independent mohr coulomb mc material in their study the effective stress framework was established by specifying the components of the effective stress constitutive matrix and an equivalent bulk modulus of the pore fluid this allows for capturing excess pore water pressure however the pore pressure dissipation after the anchor installation cannot be simulated by the cel approach where a coupled flow lagrangian analysis is needed yi et al 2014 3 2 2 discussion on the effective stress analysis approaches in the current ritss approach the ideally undrained conditions are assumed for the simulation of anchor penetration it means the dissipation of excess pore water pressure cannot be simulated however both the development of excess pore water pressure during the anchor penetration and the subsequent dissipation during set up can be captured by the ale approach the ritss and ale analyses have been carried out under a two dimensional axisymmetric condition the real geometric shapes of 4 fin torpedo and omni max dias can therefore not be simulated the cel approach is well suited to solve geotechnical problems with structures of complex geometries however the simulation of pore pressure dissipation after the anchor penetration cannot be performed by the cel approach in addition in the cel approach a very fine soil mesh e g minimum element size 0 01 0 02d kim et al 2015a was necessary to capture the anchor soil contact accurately therefore compared to the number of elements used in the lagrangian based approaches the number of elements in soil was more than tripled with very fine mesh used along the trajectory of the anchor 3 2 3 total stress analysis for dia penetration using the cel approach total stress analyses on the dynamic penetration of dias have been performed by kim and hossain 2015 kim et al 2015a 2015b liu et al 2016a in these works finless and 4 fin torpedo anchors and omni max anchors have been considered a modified tresca soil model was adopted allowing for the effects of strain rate and strain softening the herschel bulkley h b model herschel and bulkley 1926 was used to reflect the strain rate effect while the einav randolph model einav and randolph 2005 was adopted to consider the softening effect eq 4 in table 1 there are two different methods for considering the frictional forces between soil and anchor a general contact method b reaction force method kim et al 2015a 2015b and kim and hossain 2015 suggested a general contact method using a general contact algorithm in abaqus dassault systèmes 2012 in this algorithm the soil anchor interface property was specified by a total stress coulomb friction law with a limiting shear stress τ max along the anchor soil interface the value of the limiting interface friction must be set prior to the analysis before the value of the adjacent soil strength is known to overcome this difficulty for each case the limiting interface friction was determined by 1 simulating anchor penetration with frictionless contact 2 obtaining the final anchor tip penetration depth and calculating s u ref at that depth and 3 setting τ max equal to an interface friction ratio or adhesion factor α times the calculated s u ref at the final tip depth from frictionless contact with α taken as the inverse soil sensitivity 1 s t typical results for a 4 fin torpedo anchor are shown in fig 9 the anchor embedment depth accounting for the effects of strain rate and strain softening is lower than that for ideal tresca soil although the strain rate dependency is partly compensated by the softening liu et al 2016a proposed a reaction force method to overcome the limitations of the general contact method both drag force eq 5 in table 1 and frictional resistance eq 6 in table 1 were incorporated by applying vertically upward concentrated forces on the anchor the effects of strain rate and strain softening were considered within the frictional resistance fig 10a illustrates the effect of hydrodynamic drag force on reducing embedment depth fig 10 b displays the effect of frictional resistance i e adhesion factor α demonstrating greater effect on a torpedo anchor than an omni max anchor due to larger contact surface area 3 2 4 comparison between general contact method and reaction force method measured data from field trials on torpedo anchors brandão et al 2006 and omni max anchors zimmerman et al 2009 have been well simulated by the general contact model kim et al 2015b kim and hossain 2015 and the reaction force model liu et al 2016a the parameters used in the analyses are listed in table 2 direct comparisons show that the embedment depth from the reaction force method is slightly lower than that of the general contact method see fig 11 the differences between these two methods arise from 1 hydrodynamic drag force and 2 anchor soil contact surface e g it was assumed to be equal to the total surface area of the anchor in the reaction force method however although there are little differences both methods have shown the capability and accuracy in assessing the embedment depth during dynamic installation of dias in non homogeneous clay 3 2 5 fvm analysis the dynamic penetration of dias in soil can also be simulated using the fvm raie and tassoulas 2009 simulated the dynamic penetration of a finless torpedo anchor using the cfd computer program fluent fluent 2008 liu and zhang 2017b performed a three dimensional fvm simulation of dynamic installation of omni max anchors using the software ansys cfx ansys 2016 in both of these two fvm analyses the soil was modelled as a viscous fluid and its dynamic property was captured using the herschel bulkley h b model with the h b model the effect of soil strain rate can be considered by specifying the yield shear stress and the expression of the viscosity consistency due to the limitation of the cfd software only no slip and free slip anchor soil interfaces are available which correspond to the soil moving together with the anchor and no frictional force acting on the anchor liu and zhang 2018 developed a thin layer element model to consider the finite slip interaction the soil strength in the thin layer element can be set up based on the friction between the object and its surrounding soil the key advantage of the fvm is its capability of simulating the full installation process of dias from the release point to the final embedment depth including the transition of anchor from water to soil raie and tassoulas 2009 han et al 2019 for instance in han et al 2019 the omni max anchor was allowed to release both in water and air before impacting the seabed the drag force provided by water and soil therefore can be estimated the results indicated that the drag coefficient in soil is approximately 0 55 which is relatively lower than that of 0 87 in water in addition compared to the cel method the computational efficiency of the fvm is higher by using a subdomain technique in the vicinity of the object hawlader et al 2015 liu and zhang 2017b although the fvm provides the pressure and shear stress in soil the stress at any point of the soil equals to the pressure at that point independent of the direction that means the vertical and horizontal stresses on soil elements are assumed be identical which is an unrealistic assumption for soil sabetamal et al 2013 3 2 6 benchmark test medeiros 2002 reported installation of a full scale finless torpedo anchor in campos basin offshore brazil the site consisted of soft normally consolidated clay with strength increasing linearly with depth as s u ref 5 2z kpa the anchor shaft was 0 762 m in diameter 12 m length and with a 60 conical tip and had a dry weight of w d 400 kn the anchor was released from a drop height of 30 m above the seafloor the achieved impact velocity was v i 22 m s and tip embedment depth d e t 29 m this field installation was selected as a benchmark case to assess the performance of each method at predicting anchor embedment depth four calculations were carried out using the ale ritss and cel methods and the results were compared with that from the fvm and measured field data details of each calculation are listed in table 3 the velocity penetration profiles from all calculation are illustrated in fig 12 for all profiles the anchor consistently accelerates slightly in the early stage of penetration and then decelerates asymptotically approaching the final embedment depth the computed embedment depths are just 2 1 9 7 deeper than the achieved embedment depth in the field this confirms that although the mechanisms of the ale ritss cel and fvm are somewhat or essentially different a reasonable prediction can be obtained with representative input parameters for each method 3 3 pullout performance of dias under monotonic chain loading stage 3 after the completion of installation and a set up period the mooring chains are attached to the floating facility transmitting monotonic or cyclic loading to the anchors the mooring chain angle at the mudline θ 0 varies with the mooring type catenary taut leg and tension leg initially the chain in soil remains nearly vertical after the dynamic installation during pullout loading the chain cuts through the soil and transfers load to the anchor the installed embedded anchor is then keyed into position to provide required holding capacity for operations with the potential to dive deeper during keying or operation with omni max anchors there is also a possibility to be pulled out of the seabed depending on the padeye location and the chain pullout angle θ 0 at the mudline see fig 1b in any case the chain angle at the padeye θ a evolves during the pullout process the whole process can be quasi static as opposed to dynamic for installation in this section the numerical approaches to analyse the anchor behaviour under monotonic chain pullout loading are reviewed and the anchor behaviours are summarised note that the following analyses are all under total stress analysis 3 3 1 installation effect on pullout capacity most previous numerical investigations on the pullout capacity of dias have been either limited to small strain analyses lieng et al 2000 de sousa et al 2011 liu et al 2016b or pre embedded anchors or wished in place in the ideal tresca soil ignoring the influence of anchor installation wang and o loughlin 2014 o beirne et al 2015b recently kim and hossain 2016 carried out a series of ldfe analyses using the cel approach to explore the installation effect on the pullout capacity integrated dynamic installation followed by immediate instantaneous monotonic pullout simulations were undertaken on torpedo anchors for this quasi static monotonic pullout a semi logarithmic function eq 1 listed in table 1 einav and randolph 2005 was adopted to reflect the strain rate and softening effect in the clay soil model the anchor pullout at various angles at the padeye θ a i e without considering the mooring chain was simulated by applying an inclined displacement rather than an inclined force the ultimate pullout capacities at various θ a were obtained with the consideration of the soil disturbance from its installation phase fig 13 illustrates the effects of installation methods i e dynamic and quasi static installation on anchor pullout capacity the quasi static installation produced higher vertical pullout capacity than the dynamic installation due to the lower soil disturbance adjacent to the quasi static installed anchor this effect reduced to minimal for lower pullout angles θ a 3 3 2 keying and diving behaviours of omni max anchors the omni max anchor was designed by shifting the padeye towards its tip at round 2 3 of the anchor length for better keying and potential diving in soil upon pullout loading see fig 1b the keying and diving characteristics of omni max anchors have been assessed through ldfe analyses without and with considering the attached mooring chain 3 3 2 1 anchor keying without anchor chain effect using the ritss approach the keying and diving behaviours of omni max anchors were investigated by liu et al 2014a 2016b in their analysis the tresca soil model was used without considering strain rate and softening effects the omni max anchor geometry was somewhat simplified in the 3d space two different pullout loading angles at the padeye θ a 22 5 and 30 were investigated by controlling padeye displacement kim and hossain 2017 carried out 3d analyses using the cel approach a modified tresca soil model was adopted allowing for the effects of strain rate and strain softening following einav randolph s model einav and randolph 2005 it should be noted that a load control instead of displacement control at the padeye was adopted to obtain the apparent anchor trajectory in addition the simulation was fully integrated taking into account the disturbed soil conditions during the anchor installation as described in section 3 3 1 typical results presented in fig 14 show that the anchor pullout capacity increases as the anchor dives deeper the diving tendency is strongly dependent on the padeye offset ratio see fig 15 a and the loading angle tian et al 2015 kim and hossain 2017 after a parametric study the relationship between the stabilised anchor travelling angle and the padeye offset ratio is suggested as shown in fig 15b it shows that the anchor behaviour will change from diving to pulling out if the loading angle increases or the padeye offset ratio decreases kim and hossain 2017 recommended that the anchor diving will be ensured if the padeye offset ratio is in the range of 0 25 0 53 and the loading angle is θ a 45 3 3 2 2 anchor keying with anchor chain effect the interaction between the anchor and the chain at the padeye can be quantified by the load t a and the loading angle θ a at the padeye it was critical to assess the chain behaviour accurately during the anchor keying since the values of t a and θ a change during keying which has a significant effect on the diving potential of omni max anchors zhao and liu 2016 due to the soil normal and tangential resistances on the chain the chain exhibits a reverse catenary profile in the seabed resulting in that the loading angle at the padeye is higher than that at the mudline the loading angle at the padeye is unknown and depends on the chain diameter soil strength characterisation loading angle at the mudline and so forth liu et al 2018b the chain effect on the performance of omni max anchors was investigated by zhao and liu 2016 and zhao et al 2016 using the cel approach the von mises soil model was used without considering strain rate and softening effects the mooring line was divided into two parts one is constructed by link connector element to simulate the mooring line embedded in soil and the other was constructed by beam connector element to simulate the mooring line submerged in water fig 16 the link element maintains a constant distance between two cylindrical units and each cylindrical unit can rotate freely in all directions while the beam element is a rigid straight line representing the chain in water fig 17 illustrates the anchor trajectory and the anchor chain profiles during the pullout the embedded anchor chain forms a reverse catenary shape which leads to the variation of the loading angle at the padeye θ a in the range of 16 9 36 4 however the incorporation of the anchor chain in the analysis zhao and liu 2016 makes the simulation computationally expensive e g 2 weeks for the pullout case of v d 0 5 m s with two 2 9 ghz intel xeon e5 2690 processors 16 cores and 32 threads and 32 gb ram the numerical stability of the cel method was ensured by introducing a critical time increment δt critical the value of δt critical can be approximately estimated by l min c d where l min is the minimum element dimension in eulerian meshes and c d is the dilatational wave speed of the material a slight decrease of δt critical increases the computational time significantly since the chain has a small diameter and a long length i e much longer that the anchor width a small value of l min or δt critical and massive number of soil elements to ensure accuracy were resulted and hence a very costly computing time to overcome this shortcoming zhao et al 2016 introduced an anchor chain equation neubecker and randolph 1995 eq 7 listed in table 1 in the analysis this eliminated the anchor chain elements and increased the computation efficiency the chain equation was incorporated into the cel analysis by a user subroutine allowing the loading angle at the padeye to be varied during the pullout fig 18 compares anchor trajectory and pullout capacity both chain modelling methods by using chain elements and by using the chain equation produced very similar anchor trajectories however the computation time was reduced by up to 62 when the anchor chain equation was used 4 performance of different numerical methods and future works the performance of various numerical methods is discussed for three different stages of dias stage 1 anchor free fall in water stage 2 anchor dynamic penetration in soil and stage 3 anchor pullout performance under monotonic chain loading 1 stage 1 the fvm is capable of capturing the dynamic properties of water including incompressibility viscous property and flow pattern in fvm analysis water pressure drag force and anchor motion can be monitored at each penetration velocity currently the fvm is regarded as the most appropriate way to simulate the dynamic penetration of dias in water further investigations are required e g connecting a mooring chain which may affect the stability of the anchor with the falling anchor 2 stage 2 among all the ldfe approaches only the ale approach sabetamal et al 2016 is able to perform a fully coupled analysis including the penetration process and the post installation reconsolidation in the ritss and cel approaches the effective stress and the pore water pressure during anchor penetration can be calculated by assuming undrained conditions and a specified soil model liu et al 2014b chang et al 2017 the cel approach is also capable of performing a total stress analysis incorporating the effects of strain rate and strain softening via an empirical formula there are two ways to deal with the anchor soil interface friction i e general contact method and reaction force method through a comparison between these two methods it is found that the friction frame adopted by the reaction force method has slightly larger effect on the embedment depth than that by the general contact method this is attributed due to the fact that 1 the anchor soil contact surface is assumed to be equal to the total surface area of the anchor and 2 the effects of strain rate and stain softening on the frictional resistance is incorporated the current cel approach in abaqus is only available for 3d modelling however the cel approach can accommodate the boundary value problems with more complex 3d geometries which has yet been a challenge for the ale and ritss approaches wang et al 2015 the full simulation of an anchor dynamic installation in water followed by in soil as is the case in the field cannot be simulated using the cel ale or ritss approach the fvm is capable of this complete simulation raie 2009 however in the fvm analysis the stress at any point of the material equals to the pressure at that point independent of the direction that means the vertical and horizontal stresses on soil elements are assumed to be identical which is an unrealistic assumption for soil sabetamal et al 2016 as such further works need to be done for the complete simulation 3 stage 3 the effect of dynamic installation on the pullout capacity of dias has been investigated by kim and hossain 2016 using the cel approach however the mobilised pore water pressure and the set up effects were not considered a fully coupled formulation needs to be developed for simulating the post installation reconsolidation during a set up period and the subsequent monotonic or cyclic pullout the keying and diving of omni max anchors were simulated by the cel approach it was shown that the inclusion of a chain instead of using an equation has a minimal effect there are some problems to be solved first the cel approach provides only the coulomb frictional contact between the anchor and the soil allowing a limiting shear stress τ max to be specified the value of τ max cannot vary with time and space in the analysis however during the keying diving and pullout of the anchor in the normally consolidated clay the frictional resistance varies with anchor embedment depth second it is computationally expensive to simulate the keying and diving of omni max anchors because the required pullout distance is long more than 2l a which necessitates a wider computational domain how to improve the computational efficiency is a future challenge finally an integrated and complete simulation of a dia for installation and pullout is a challenge this requires the complete simulation of an anchor in a series of actions encountered in the field 1 anchor installation in water 2 anchor installation in soil 3 set up in soil and 4 anchor pullout by chain in soil all the features of applicable numerical methods for dias are summarised in table 4 5 concluding remarks the installation of dynamically installed anchors dias and their performance under operational loadings involve large movements during installation dias experience large penetration through the water column and into the seabed for a dia penetrating into the seabed numerical analysis requires techniques that allow for i simulating soil behaviours under large strains with high strain rate i e dynamic effect ii tracking soil movements i e large deformation and its properties and iii updating soil strength changes based on cumulative shear strains i e clay remoulding for a dia under operational loadings it can be treated as a quasi static problem but involves cyclic loading which incurs two opposite effects on the soil strength soil strength degradation due to remoulding and the reverse due to consolidation the numerical analysis becomes even more complex when the mooring chain is simulated this paper provides an overview of numerical advancements on the numerical analysis of dias in clay including anchor free fall in water stage 1 anchor dynamic penetration in soil stage 2 and anchor pullout performance under monotonic chain loading stage 3 the considered soil constitutive models and soil anchor interface contact have been discussed the ability of capturing high strain rate effect and excess pore water pressure during dynamic installation and dissipation of excess pore water pressure during set up have been highlighted of particular interest was the effect of considering chain on the pullout performance the advantages and limitations of each numerical approach for simulating each stage have been noted overall for this complicated problem an excellent and very promising progress has been made over the last decade for numerical simulation of each stage soil constitutive models have been extended keeping the number of parameters as low as possible and successfully incorporated in the large deformation analysis frameworks time consumption per analysis has also been reduced by using the chain equation to reflect chain effects the next challenges include i simulating the complete anchor installation process in water and soil and performance under set up and operational loadings using a single numerical framework package ii applying operational loads through a mooring chain instead of at the padeye allowing quantification of the contribution of chain soil interaction on the anchor capacity and iii carrying out simulation under operational cyclic loading acknowledgments the research presented here was undertaken with support from the australian research council through the

22783,iron ore fines iof which is a bulk mineral cargo exhibits an inherent high level of risk during marine transportation due to its potential to liquefy with nine marine accidents since 2007 being directly linked to the shifting of iof cargoes which resulted in the deaths of twenty nine seafarers the danger for shippers is indisputable this study aims to review the behaviour of iof during marine transportation by analysing the factors that lead to geotechnical related failures it suggests that due to suffusion caused by the dynamic motions of the vessel the top layer of a cargo of iof may end up containing a large percentage of fine grained particles this would seemingly result in a weak zone near the surface with the possibility of being fully saturated and therefore increasing the potential for liquefaction or reducing the factor of safety against a slope type failure the study will also analyse and discuss the reasons behind the past and recent listing and capsizing incidents involving bulk mineral carriers the final outcome of this study will be the proposal of some possible solutions that may be implemented and recommendations for further studies in order to reduce the likelihood of cargo shift occurring keywords iron ore fines iof bulk carrier cargo shift liquefaction slope failure cargo sloshing 1 introduction the marine transportation of iof cargoes has proven to contain a high level of risk with the stability of the cargo playing a vital role in recent decades many ships carrying iof have listed or capsized resulting in significant loss of life as well as financial and economic losses munro and mohajerani 2015 2016a 2016b 2017c 2017a 2017b the leading cause of these marine accidents has been attributed to cargo liquefaction which has resulted in the cargo shifting in the hold and ultimately causing ship instability further failure methods including flow type failures and slope stability failures of the cargoes as well as structural damage caused by over stressing have all been explored as possible causes of some of the recent marine accidents which reiterates the need to understand the risks of carrying iof as detailed in section 2 nine cargo shift incidents involving iof have occurred since 2007 with twenty nine seafarers losing their lives in many of the accidents the vessels were seen to be listing which in some cases resulted in the vessel capsizing an example of which can be seen in fig 1 the listing of these vessels was generally determined to have been caused by a shift in the mineral cargoes being transported whereby the cargo accumulated on one side offsetting the ships balance by creating an overturning moment with respect to buoyancy the hong kong special administrative region 2015 with many studies having been conducted to investigate the liquefaction behaviour and potential of iof the failure mechanism has had broad exposure many other mineral cargoes such as nickel ore and bauxite have experienced liquefaction failures during marine transportation healey 2013 world maritime news 2015a the interest in bulk mineral cargo liquefaction for its potential to cause vessel instability dates back as far as 1977 where green and hughes 1977 described the potential for what appears to be a relatively dry granular material to develop into an unstable fluid mass with such a heavy focus on liquefaction other modes of failure have had limited investigation munro and mohajerani 2017c recently evaluated the slope stability of iof during its marine voyage however they did not consider the stability of the slope among the properties of the iof change this review however determines how the changes in the iof properties can adversely affect the geotechnical failure modes such as liquefaction and slope type failure it also analyses the potential for each failure mode to develop which is critical in preventing the shift of iof cargoes cargo sloshing which has not been investigated or discussed in previous literature can also lead to a cargo shift when a suspended slurry that is primarily made up of water and dense iof soil particles sloshes around in the cargo hold it can behave in a similar way to that of a liquefied portion of the mass zhang et al 2017 liquids or liquefied gasses undergoing marine transportation exhibit this sloshing behaviour but typically are confined by minimising the surface area or utilising baffles within the cargo holds fleissner et al 2010 it should also be noted that sloshing of a bulk mineral cargo entails some degree of viscosity zou et al 2018 showed that viscosity can effectively dissipate the kinetic energy of sloshing and reduce the sloshing induced loads as higher viscosity liquefied cargoes applied less pressure to the sidewalls in unison with the natural ship motions this sloshing force can impact against the vessel walls increasing the degree of rotation experienced during rolling and pitching zhang et al 2016 this could create a pendulum type effect up until the point where the vessel develops a list that cannot be corrected using available means such as ballast the existing guidelines outlined in the international maritime solid bulk cargoes imsbc code characterise iof as having the potential to liquefy international maritime organisation 2018a as such restrictions on the maximum moisture content are imposed based on the transportable moisture limit tml this tml infers a maximum moisture content that the iof can contain and if shipped below the tml is said to be unable to liquefy with the effects of moisture migration locations within the cargo may experience very high moisture contents when compared to the initial conditions munro and mohajerani 2018 in reference to the guidelines within the imsbc code these locations would subsequently exceed the tml and be acknowledged as potentially liquefiable not only do iof cargoes have the potential to become inhomogeneous during their marine voyages many iof cargoes have vastly different material properties due to the geological strata from which they were extracted this is discussed further in section 5 linking these two points it is difficult to classify cargoes of iof and to assume that the behaviour is the same for all variations and at all stages in the journey 1 1 objective the main objective of this study is to explore the behaviour of iron ore fines iof during marine transportation and under the dynamic loading that a cargo can be expected to experience at sea the study will also detail the reasons behind the past and recent listing and capsizing incidents involving bulk mineral carriers that were deemed to have been caused by cargo liquefaction or other modes of failures causing cargo shift in particular this paper will explore liquefaction of iof detailing the material parameters and typical behaviour that leads to the occurrence of liquefaction other modes of failure that may occur such as slope failure will also be explored and the significance in terms of ship stability will be critically analysed with the cargo possibly becoming inhomogeneous during voyages it is important to understand how this will affect the potential for a cargo shift this study will explore the potential changes in an iof mass explaining how it can occur and the potential consequences the final outcome of this paper will be the proposal of solutions that may be implemented and recommendations for further studies in order to reduce the likelihood of cargo shift occurring and to further ascertain the behaviour of bulk mineral cargoes during marine transportation 1 2 methodology a literature review has been carried out to combine the recent studies and outcomes of previous research papers this information has been used to summarise past efforts to explore the causes of cargo liquefaction and the behaviour of bulk mineral cargoes under the dynamic loading expected during marine transportation with the information available gaps in research have become evident and recommendations for further studies have been made the understanding gained through the literature review has also provided a foundation to propose solutions to reduce the likelihood of cargo shift mechanisms 2 recent marine accidents attributed to cargo shift involving bulk mineral carriers it is well known and highly publicised that the carriage of potentially liquefiable materials contains a high level of risk this is evident from the number of incidents involving cargo shifting from the years 1988 2015 which totalled twenty three as reported by munro and mohajerani 2017a this number in 2016 and 2017 has since increased by three with the loss of the bulk mineral carriers bao jiang 88 emerald star and stellar daisy hancock 2016 maritime executive 2017 maritime injury center 2017 the incidents reported by munro and mohajerani 2017a that occurred between 1988 and 2015 and including the most recent years 2016 and 2017 resulted in a total loss of life of 171 a stark comparison can be made in that out of these twenty six incidents and 171 deaths a respective nine incidents and twenty nine deaths involved the carriage of iof the number of incidents and corresponding deaths between 1988 and 2017 involving a cargo shift is presented in fig 2 and fig 3 a brief summary of each incident is presented in table a1 of appendix a as seen in fig 2 the number of incidents whereby vessels have either listed or capsized due to a cargo shift has somewhat increased in regularity since 2005 with only three incident free years out of the past thirteen and an average of 1 7 incidents occurring per year since 2005 iof has been the cargo being transported in six incidents out of the past thirteen prior to 2005 only four years dating back to 1988 had reported cargo shift incidents however this figure may in fact be higher due to the unavailability of information and available technology in those years to document and report the incidents or because this phenomenon was not investigated and or the cause potentially misidentified in respect of the number of incidents fig 3 shows that 141 seafarers have lost their lives since 2005 with incidents involving the transportation of iof totalling twenty nine deaths iof incidents resulting in death have occurred in 2009 2011 and 2017 protection and indemnity p i clubs such as the london p i club and the uk p i club have released various bulletins and cautions to their members in relation to past incidents and recent events including those that could potentially have caused dangerous loading conditions of the mineral cargoes one in particular released in 2008 following two separate events in 2007 stated that recent rains in indian ports may have caused excessive moisture content in stockpiles of iof and that certifications in relation to the moisture content received from indian agencies had questionable accuracy london p and i club 2008 the following year in 2009 a further two incidents regarding the cargo shift of iof loaded from indian ports were reported marine buzz 2009a couttie 2009 with previous warnings unable to prevent the accidents from occurring with the imsbc code being made available for voluntary use on 1 january 2009 and officially enforced on 1 january 2011 international maritime organisation 2008 regulations regarding the safe carriage and testing of bulk mineral cargoes has become more stringent than in earlier years iof was omitted from the imscb code until temporary reclassification as a liquefiable cargo or group a cargo was sent out by the imo in the circular dsc 1 circ 66 rev 1 in october 2012 international maritime organisation 2012 and following verification the amendments were made permanent in the release of the 2015 imsbc code international maritime organisation 2015 as seen in figs 2 and 3 although the imsbc code has been implemented mandatorily since 2011 cargo shift related incidents are not reducing the same can be said specifically for iof with three incidents occurring in the years following the reclassification of the material in 2012 as liquefiable the new regulations regarding the determination of the tml and the loading unloading and stowage of bulk mineral cargoes has been aimed at controlling the liquefaction potential and general stability of the cargo during its voyage to date these controls have not been able to reduce cargo shift incidents and it is clear that further research into the behaviour of bulk mineral cargoes during marine transport is required with potential physical solutions as discussed in section 7 1 being more likely to prevent cargo shift from occurring and having a positive impact on the number of incidents we observe as evidenced from a number of the incident reports is the likeness between the factors contributing to the resulting cargo shift in many instances rough sea and weather conditions were reported likely resulting in an increase in the amplitude and duration of the dynamic loading on the vessel thereby increasing the potential for liquefaction and producing larger angles of heel and a consequent increase in the likelihood of slope failure nayfeh and khdeir 1986 these factors were seen to contribute to the foundering of the m v bright ruby on 21 november 2011 when the vessel capsized after being battered by high waves and strong winds thereby leading to possible liquefaction of her iof cargo safety4sea 2011 maritime connector 2011 in another incident several large waves struck the vessel alam manis resulting in the shift of the nickel ore cargo the consequences of which generated a fourteen degree starboard list hancock 2015 world maritime news 2015b although liquefaction was reported to be the suspected cause of the cargo shift it is possible that the finite number of large waves resulted in an increase in the angle of heel to such a degree that the internal shear resistance of the material was overcome resulting in a significant portion of the cargo shifting this is somewhat confirmed by the fact that the vessel did not list any further and was only limited to a specific degree of list to one side an expected characteristic of a slope type failure in such scenarios where rough sea and weather conditions are encountered the risk of cargo shift is likely to increase under these extreme but not uncommon sea states other than the pre emptive measures taken during loading controlling the behaviour of a stowed cargo is near impossible and could be better solved through the implementation of physical elements that aid in providing slope stability prevention of liquefaction or further cargo containment restrictions imposed on cargo characteristics could also assist in maintaining cargo stability but should be expected to have less effectiveness due to the variability in factors such as loading techniques and transport routes and conditions beyond the uncontrollable factors such as weather other incidents involved inadequate documentation of moisture content whereby the cargo was loaded in conditions that exceeded the tml five of the twenty six incidents presented in table a1 of appendix a were proven to have had cargoes loaded in excess of the tml australian transport safety bureau 2000 the hong kong special administrative region 2005 couttie 2009 marine buzz 2009b hancock 2013 healey 2013 intermanager 2013 the hong kong special administrative region 2015 whilst a further four incidents involved cargoes expected to have been loaded in excess of their tml marine buzz 2009a press trust of india 2009 couttie 2010b shipwreck log 2010 maritime bulletin 2012 couttie 2013 the economist 2013 this highlights that some of the cargo shift incidents could potentially have been avoided had the correct procedures been followed however it should be noted that even if the appropriate regulations were followed a cargo shift may still have occurred as was the case for incidents where all regulations were proven to have been followed excluding the incidents suspected or proven to have not followed regulatory requirements seventeen of the twenty six incidents which includes six out of the nine iof related incidents still stand as having followed all the guidelines although kept below the tml these cargoes still exhibited cargo shift it is noted that by investigating these incidents it is evident that the behaviour of mineral cargoes during marine transportation was is and will continue to be hard to predict although the danger of carrying these cargoes that may potentially shift has become more widespread the increased awareness has not reduced the number of incidents and the problem still exists within the bulk mineral cargo trade 3 cause of ship instability during a voyage bulk carriers are subject to loading from both waves and wind causing rolling and pitching motions chen et al 2018 as presented in fig 4 the pitching is an upward and downward motion of the bow and stern whilst the rolling is an oscillation about the longitudinal axis through the vessels centre of gravity barrass and derrett 2006 the pitching and rolling effects leads to induced moments on the vessel which is translated to the cargo in the hold in the form of cyclic loading kim et al 2007 the cyclic loading can cause an array of different failure modes including liquefaction or slope failure of the iof cargo or may lead to dynamic separation of the soil and water particles and result in areas of weakness ura et al 1984 liquefaction slope failure or any other mode of failure that causes cargo shift has the ability to cause ship instability there are two forces that act on a vessel in order to keep it stable as defined by basic ship hydrostatics the downwards force of the vessel s weight depicted as w in fig 5 a and the upward buoyancy force applied by the sea in reaction to the displacement of water by the vessel depicted as fb in fig 5 a the centre of buoyancy is depicted as b in fig 5 whilst the centre of gravity is depicted as g in fig 5 a the buoyance force initially acts through the metacentre of the ship depicted as m in fig 5 biran and pulido 2013 to cause listing or capsizing the centre of gravity must be above the vessel s metacentre this is explained by taking the moment about the metacentre which reveals an overturning moment depicted as mo in fig 5 will cause the vessel to uncontrollably roll about its axis until a new equilibrium point can be established rawson and tupper 2001 when the reverse happens and the centre of gravity is below the metacentre the outcome is a righting moment depicted as mr in fig 5 bringing the vessel back towards equilibrium cargo is initially evenly distributed within the holds of a vessel ensuring the centre of gravity remains below the metacentre but if the cargo shifts an overturning moment can result and the vessel will begin to list and possibly capsize munro and mohajerani 2017c efforts to restore the stability of a vessel can involve the movement of ballast typically water about the vessel in an attempt to move the centre of gravity back below the metacentre however moving ballast quickly enough in response to listing or having enough ballast available in reserve to provide sufficient restoring moment may not be adequate the dynamic stability of a vessel can be greatly impacted by sudden cargo shifting that results in a heeling moment the response of a vessel to such a sudden heeling moment depends on various factors including wave direction wave frequency position of the wave on the ship at the time of the applied moment travel speed and the magnitude of the heeling moment acanfora and cirillo 2017 for a constant magnitude of heeling moment the worst case scenario occurs when the wave frequency is close to the natural roll frequency of the ship which is shown in fig 6 note the wave frequencies closest to the natural roll frequency are 0 628 and 0 571 in such a case acanfora and cirillo 2017 showed that the greatest dynamic rolling amplitude is achieved and that parametric rolling resonance can develop as the difference between wave frequency and natural roll frequency becomes greater the transient rolling response is typically less variable and the amplitude is closer to the static rolling angle asghari et al 2007 showed that as the magnitude of the heeling moment increases both the static rolling angle and the amplitude become greater combining these two observations a sudden cargo shift which would result in a heeling moment can cause a vessel to experience high amplitudes of rolling before the static rolling angle is reached if the heeling moment caused by the cargo shift is sufficiently large enough even without considering the amplitude of the rolling response the static rolling angle may be enough to cause vessel instability even if the static rolling angle caused by a shift in the cargo is not enough to cause the vessel to become unstable the wave frequency among other factors may be enough to cause sufficiently large dynamic rolling amplitudes during the rolling response that would see the vessel become unstable both liquefaction and sloshing cargo shift mechanisms would result in an almost constant heeling moment and a response similar to that in fig 6 would be expected the same can t be said for a shift in a cargo caused by a slope type failure which would instead result in an instantaneous heeling moment or a pulse heeling moment as depicted in fig 7 comparing figs 6 and 7 for the same wave frequency the maximum rolling angle amplitude is above 40 for a constant heeling moment and less than 30 for the pulse heeling moment the static rolling angle also returns to zero a certain period of time after the pulse heeling moment is applied or in another sense the rolling caused by a slope type failure of a cargo will eventually return to its initial state assuming the vessel remains stable although a slope type failure follows this behaviour this does not necessarily mean that the impact on dynamic stability is less critical when compared to cargo shift caused by liquefaction for instance a slope type failure may concern a large portion of the cargo mass whereas liquefaction may only concern a small portion towards the top surface this would result in a disparity between the heeling moments with the slope type failure having a larger magnitude and as shown by asghari et al 2007 may lead to a larger amplitude of rolling angle with this being said a comparatively smaller heeling moment caused by liquefaction or cargo sloshing can still have a great deal of effect on the vessel s dynamic stability countermeasures to prevent a vessel from becoming unstable reduces the risk of capsizing due to instability and ideally can eliminate the problem altogether without the shift in cargo causing a vessel to become unstable many if not all of the reported cargo shift incidents might have been prevented although residual efforts to correct ship instability have proven to be effective many factors that need to be taken into consideration this involves the time of identification and the time of response as well as the required action to best correct or prevent ship instability the problem should be identified as early as possible but even so there may be no physical means to counteract the effects of cargo shift in addition to vessel stability structural failure caused by overstressing particularly through the sloshing of cargo may lead to a vessel sinking this has not been explored in detail however this needs to be acknowledged as a potential factor that can have catastrophic consequences 4 understanding the imsbc code the imsbc code which replaced the former code of safe practice for solid bulk cargoes bc code has the primary aim to facilitate the safe stowage and shipment of solid bulk cargoes by providing information on the dangers associated with the shipment of certain types of solid bulk cargoes and instructions on the procedures to be adopted when the shipment of solid bulk cargoes is contemplated international maritime organisation 2018b the imsbc code was made available for voluntary use on 1 january 2009 and has been implemented on a mandatory basis since 1 january 2011 international maritime organisation 2008 iof was originally omitted from the imsbc code until temporary reclassification as a liquefiable cargo was sent out by the imo in the circular dsc 1 circ 66 rev 1 in october 2012 international maritime organisation 2012 and was officially reclassified in an amendment to the 2015 imsbc code international maritime organisation 2015 the imsbc code includes information relating to the bulk mineral cargoes referenced in this study including that for iof the information includes general loading carriage and unloading precautions section 2 trimming procedures section 5 methods for determining the angle of repose section 6 and appendix 2 of the imsbc code and information on cargoes that may liquefy including the test procedures for those cargoes and their individual schedules sections 7 and 8 as well as appendices 1 and 2 of the imsbc code international maritime organisation 2015 the imsbc code provides a detailed guide to bulk mineral cargo handlers and also contains enforceable regulations that must be followed in order to maintain safety during loading carriage and unloading the imsbc code separates bulk mineral cargoes into three groups group a group b and group c the international maritime organisation 2015 describes these groups as follows group a comprises those that may liquefy if shipped at a moisture content in excess of their transportable moisture limit tml group b are those that possess a chemical hazard that could give rise to a dangerous situation on a ship and group c are those that are neither liable to liquefy group a nor possess a chemical hazard group b each bulk mineral cargo has been assessed as to its potential dangers and as listed in their individual schedules has been assigned to one of the three aforementioned groups the group designation relates to specific regulations and procedures that need to be adhered to in order to safely load carry and unload the cargo it also outlines the responsibilities of shippers in relation to handling the cargo and explicitly defines the risks for example iof is classified as a group a cargo and handling must therefore follow the regulations and procedures for a liquefiable material cargoes that have the potential to liquefy fall under group a and must adhere to the regulations set out in section 7 of the imsbc code this section aims to make shippers aware of the risks of carrying a cargo that may liquefy outlines the responsibilities of the shipper in respect of safe handling and discusses the precautions that can be taken to minimize the risk of liquefaction it is noted that section 7 states that if a cargo ship is specially constructed to confine a bulk mineral cargo thereby preventing a possible shift the regulations required to transport a group a cargo need not be followed international maritime organisation 2015 an important regulation in the imsbc code is the requirement that bulk mineral cargoes classified as group a undergo tml testing the tml is defined as the maximum moisture content at which a group a cargo can be considered safe to load on a vessel without being at risk of liquefying during transport international maritime organisation 2015 in order to determine the tml of iof a test referred to as the modified proctor fagerberg test must be performed on a sample of the cargo the tml is the moisture content corresponding to the point on a compaction curve at 80 degree of saturation other test methods used to determine the tml of other types of bulk mineral cargoes include the standard proctor fagerberg test the flow table test and the penetration test all test methods are described in detail in appendix 2 of the imsbc code prior to loading a group a cargo the appropriate documentation regarding the tml and the actual moisture content should be made available under no circumstance should a group a cargo be loaded with moisture content exceeding the tml additionally if the master of the vessel believes the moisture content of the cargo is in excess of the tml verification of the certificates can be requested the master may refuse to sail if the proper documentation is not provided other important regulations involve the trimming of the cargo and the determination of the angle of repose the trimming of a cargo involves levelling of the surface which helps in preventing slope failure and can also aid in distributing stresses induced by the cargo mass ivanov and kokarakis 2010 section 5 of the imsbc code outlines the requirements for cargo trimming but states that the cargo should be trimmed reasonably level as necessary to minimize risk further slope stability regulations regard the angle of repose which is the angle at which the cargo slope will fail and hence slide due to the shear resistance of the failure plane being exceeded carrigy 1970 section 6 of the imsbc code recommends 2 test methods to determine the angle of repose for the cargo the tilting box method and the shipboard test method both methods are explained in detail in appendix 2 of the imsbc code specific to iof the imsbc code includes an individual schedule that details the characteristics hazards precautions carriage requirements and loading unloading procedures the imsbc codes definition of iof is iron ore containing both 10 or more of fine particles less than 1 mm d10 1 mm and 50 or more of particles less than 10 mm d50 10 mm international maritime organisation 2015 the imsbc code also states that even if the above criteria for an iron ore material is met the cargo may be classified as iron ore a group c cargo if the goethite content is 35 or more by mass and the appropriate declaration is received goethite is a hydrated iron oxide formed from the dissolution of ferrihydrite that forms fibrous crystals and tends to absorb free water within the pores of the cargo schwertmann and cornell 2007 for this reason the imsbc code accounts for the absorption of the pore water in iof cargoes and at 35 goethite content is said to be at no risk of liquefying further characteristics of iof can be found in table 1 5 material properties of iron ore fines the characteristics of iof vary with geographical location due to the underlying differences in the geological properties of the mined iron ore and in the processing and refinement procedures throughout this process the properties of the iof can change most notably the geotechnical properties it is for this reason that the prediction and assumptions concerning the iof properties are difficult and possibly inaccurate this section is not intended to provide a universal range of material properties but instead to provide some typical values from varying locations this highlights the variability in the properties of iof how such variability affects the behaviour and what factors lead to this disparity iron ore is a natural raw material typically a brown red colour which is mined around the world the australian mines atlas 2015a states that most iron ores mined today comprise the iron oxide minerals hematite fe2o3 70 fe goethite fe2o3s h2o 63 fe limonite a mixture of hydrated iron oxides up to 60 fe and magnetite fe3o4 72 fe mined iron ore is processed to allow its use in the iron steel making industry processing firstly involves crushing and screening to separate the ore into fines 6 3 mm particle size and lump 6 3 31 5 mm particle size bureau of infrastructure transport and regional economics 2014 brazil is host to five of the largest iron ore mines in the world with australia and south africa contributing to the next six duddu 2014 serra sul s11d an iron ore mine located in carajas brazil owned by vale has claimed the title of the world s largest iron ore mine since its expansion in 2016 topf 2016 the 14 3 billion mine complex boasts some of the largest production of iof in the world other contributors to the production of iof are india canada norway and the usa with 317 million spent on iron ore exploration in australia during 2016 department of industry innovation and science 2015 many mine sites have been developed across the country to extract this valuable mineral resource a map of the major operating iron ore mines in australia as of 2015 is shown in fig 8 much of the iron ore mined in australia makes its way overseas to countries such as china and japan for refining department of industry innovation and science 2015 in appendix b a number of material properties for iof have been presented table b1 of appendix b shows the material properties of the iof samples from various countries which were found during a study conducted by van paassen et al 2013 although it can be seen that the material properties of the iof vary between countries it should be noted that the material properties could also vary within each country depending on the location this was confirmed in a study by munro and mohajerani 2015 in which the samples taken from different mining locations in australia showed significant ranges in each of the physical properties the results from this study are presented in table b2 of appendix b and as seen the minimum and maximum values for certain material properties of the iof varies significantly with such variations particularly in the particle size distribution and tml to predict the behaviour of iof for all scenarios is questionable in fact the iof mined in some locations may not present a liquefiable risk particularly where the gravel content is high the opposite can be said where the soil gradation is closer to the liquefiable range determined by ishihara 1993 for which the iof would have a high potential for liquefaction the material properties of the iof also affect the potential for the cargo mass to change during marine transportation this includes the extent to which the cargo can compact and the possibility for moisture migration with these factors taken into consideration it is not appropriate to treat all iof cargoes alike 6 possible failure modes although liquefaction of iof is the leading recognised mode of failure that has been the suspected cause of the incidents described in section 2 other modes of failures may exist the cause of each failure mechanism depends on a variety of factors with many relating to the particle size distribution and moisture content the varying failure modes generally occur at specific stages of the journey when the required conditions are met 6 1 liquefaction liquefaction is a phenomenon that is quite basically explained as the transformation of a granular material from a once solid state into a liquid state as a result of increased pore pressure and a consequent drop in effective stress jia 2018 the cause of the increase in pore pressure is the tendency of granular materials to contract when subject to cyclic shear stresses sen 2009 an increase in pore pressure to a point at which the effective stress reduces significantly leads to a reduction in shearing resistance and stiffness and a development of large strains such that a granular material will begin to flow like a viscous fluid ishihara 1993 in a saturated state the relatively fast application of cyclic shearing on a granular material induced by ship motion can cause an assumed partly undrained or near undrained condition independent of the boundary conditions applied to the mass di prisco and wood 2012 the same undrained condition can be achieved when the soil permeability is so low that the pore water cannot drain at a rate that allows the pore water pressure to be dissipated blight 2013 when a loose to medium dense dry granular material is subject to cyclic shearing the soil particles can drop into inter particle voids as seen in fig 9 a however when the granular material is saturated the pore water must first drain before the mass can undergo a volume change when the rate of loading of an applied cyclic shear force is such that the pore water has no time to dissipate or when the soil permeability is minimal then an undrained response with no volume change occurs as seen in fig 9 b sen 2009 when the soil particles in a granular mass attempt to rearrange into a more tightly packed unit under cyclic loading or in low permeability soils they compress the pore water in the voids liquefaction of soils during earthquakes 1985 since the pore water is unable to be dispersed elsewhere in the mass the compression of the soil particles on the pore water creates a build up of excess pore water pressure seed et al 1976 the initial compaction of the granular mass plays a vital role in the ability of the mass to undergo volume change loosely compacted granular materials in comparison to tightly compacted granular materials have significantly higher void ratios which allow for higher levels of volume change sağlam 2015 the long lasting assumption of liquefaction occurring primarily when the granular material is fully saturated has recently been put to rest laboratory tests and recent studies have shown that intergranular stress of unsaturated sands with an initial degree of saturation in the moderate to high range can be reduced to very low levels during cyclic loading liu and muraleetharan 2012 unno et al 2008 suggested that the liquefaction of an unsaturated granular soil generally depends on the particle size distribution of the soil skeleton the density the initial degree of saturation the initial confining pressure and the initial pore pressure the most significant observation made by liu and xu 2013 during undrained cyclic shearing tests of unsaturated samples of sand was that with a decrease in the degree of saturation the required amount of loading cycles to cause liquefaction increased however with low degrees of saturation the samples could not be brought to a liquefiable state liu and xu 2013 also showed that a soil specimen with high relative density could also liquefy under very small shearing strains as the strain softening of the soil reduced the shearing resistance to a steady state the simple equation for the effective stress of an unsaturated soil proposed by bishop and blight 1963 is shown in eq 1 while matric suction is defined in eq 2 1 σ σ u a χ u a u w 2 ψ u a u w where u a p o r e a i r p r e s s u r e u w p o r e w a t e r p r e s s u r e σ t o t a

various proposed definitions presented by a number of researchers these have typically been developed based on the material type from eq 1 it was assumed by unno et al 2008 that liquefaction of an unsaturated granular material would occur when both the pore air and water pressure were equal to the initial confining pressure this state also corresponds to a matric suction of zero the volume change between the pore air at initial and final liquefaction states making use of boyle charles law for an ideal gas established eq 3 3 u a 0 v a 0 σ 0 v a 0 δ v a where u a 0 i n i t i a l p o r e a

the change in pore air volume and as explained by unno et al 2008 also corresponds to the required void ratio change e 0 e l i q to cause liquefaction if it is assumed that the soil and water particles are incompressible hence eq 3 can be rewritten as in eqs 4 and 5 4 e 0 e l i q 1 s r 0 100 1 u a 0 σ 0 e 0 5 e l i q u a 0 σ 0 s r 0 100 u a 0 σ 0 s r 0 100 e 0 where e 0 i n i t i a l v o i

testing conducted by unno et al 2008 proved that when the void ratio after applied cyclic shear reached the void ratio to cause liquefaction estimated using the relationship above liquefaction would typically ensue this is presented in fig 10 iof is a granular material containing 10 or more of fine particles less than 1 mm and 50 or more of particles less than 10 mm international maritime organisation 2015 limited to a tml corresponding to 80 degree of saturation iof is initially unsaturated applying the theory as previously discussed the iof mass would need to undergo changes in void ratio or moisture content in order to reach a liquefiable state bian and shahrour 2009 under ship motions and engine vibrations the iof cargo may undergo a process of compaction and soil rearrangement ju et al 2018 as the inter particle voids reduce in size the degree of saturation increases gallipoli et al 2003 and the soil permeability decreases schanz 2007 as these properties change so does the capacity for the pore pressure to rise potentially reaching the state of zero effective stress khalili et al 2004 nuth and laloui 2008 to develop the properties that allow for a liquefaction failure to occur it was shown by liu and xu 2013 that the initial conditions may not prevent liquefaction from occurring but instead would increase the number of cyclic load cycles and or the magnitude of the cyclic loading needed to produce the conditions at liquefaction ship motions can cause the migration of water particles as the pore pressure under the cyclic loading is dissipated williams and chen 2016 the ability for moisture migration largely depends upon the permeability and as iof typically has good drainage properties moisture migration will occur this can be confirmed with the effects of moisture migration seen in fig 13 where moisture has accumulated at the surface of an iof cargo when the moisture is expelled from the voids in the iof the finer grained soil particles can be carried by the seepage forces forming the internal erosion process known as suffusion chang et al 2014 in a study conducted by munro and mohajerani 2018 it was observed that suffusion effects had caused portions of samples of iof to increase in moisture content as well as in terms of the percentage of finer particles in some cases the moisture content post suffusion had reached levels in excess of the tml also giving the potential for certain locations to become fully saturated munro and mohajerani 2018 also noted that the migration of soil and water particles was typically towards the surface of the iof samples however if the iof had low density then migration towards the base was also observed the locations from where the moisture and finer particles have migrated from would be left with a lower moisture content and a larger void ratio not only would these locations have a lower liquefaction potential due to the decreased moisture content yoshimi et al 1989 but they would also have an increased liquefaction resistance due to the increase in void size allowing for pore water pressure to be dissipated more readily yilmaz and mollamahmutoglu 2009 in comparison an area of iof such as the surface which experiences increased moisture and finer particle size distribution could become highly susceptible to liquefaction with relatively large quantities of surface water observed in some iof cargoes jonas 2010b there is not only the potential for these locations to accumulate the migrated water particles to the point where the tml is exceeded but there is a possibility that a state of near full saturation can be achieved if the iof were to form a saturated layer at the surface the theory of dynamic liquefaction of a saturated soil would ensue a layer such as this at the surface would have a significant risk of liquefaction due to the relatively low density and the low confining pressure seed and lee 1966 furthermore the finer particles that migrate to this location could reduce the permeability thereby allowing for pore water pressure to increase under the cyclic loading due to the inability for the pressure to dissipate sen 2009 in the study conducted by munro and mohajerani 2018 which replicated a scale model analysis for behaviour of iof during marine transportation a change in the particle size distribution of a sample of iof was observed for a layer at the surface but no significant variation was seen in the middle and bottom layers as seen in fig 11 the top layer of the iof had increased in the percentage of particles between 75 μm and 2 mm this change in particle size distribution has a significant influence on the permeability of the iof with the introduction of the finer particles likely to have restricted the ease with which water can pass through the voids even if full saturation is not achieved as a result of suffusion the moisture content could exceed the tml in this location and the initial classification of the iof would be obsolete the increased moisture content would raise the degree of saturation and as shown earlier by liu and xu 2013 the required cyclic load amplitude and number of load cycles to cause liquefaction would reduce when compared to a drier iof cargo once again due to the surface of an iof cargo being of a much looser nature than near the base there is a greater ability for the soil particles to undergo compaction nicolas et al 2000 coupling the increased degree of saturation the reduced permeability due to migration of finer particles and the relatively loose packing this portion of the iof could exhibit the properties required for liquefaction to occur 6 2 slope failure slope failure occurs when the shear resistance of a slip plane is overcome by an applied shear force resulting in shear failure of the slope budhu 2011 three types of slip plane in a cargo mass in the hold of a ship can lead to slope failure each with distinctly different characteristics these three types of slope failure have been set out by munro and mohajerani 2017c as follows the first type of slope failure is known as sliding en masse which involves the entire cargo mass sliding along the cargo hold interface as a result of applied external forces the second and third types of slope failure both involve the internal shear strength of the cargo being exceeded by the resultant stresses applied internally and externally or in other words where internal equilibrium is overcome duncan et al 2014 this may be along either an infinite parallel slip plane translational slope failure or a circular slip plane rotational slope failure both forming the second and third types of slope failure as previously mentioned fig 12 shows each type of slope failure that can occur in the hold highlighting the slip plane that leads to sliding of the failure mass a variety of factors can lead to the slope failure of a mineral cargo most of which are also relevant to that of any natural or engineered slope including embankments and fills zaretskii et al 1980 these factors can form a process of shear stress increase and or decrease in shear strength which result in a reduction of the factor of safety of the slope and in the worst case can cause a once stable slope to fail due to the lack of shear resistance budhu 2011 das and sivakugan 2015 the factors that can cause an increase in the shear stress or a decrease in the shear strength of the cargo are summarized in table 2 below during marine transportation an iof cargo will be subject to cyclic loading as induced by the ship motions kim et al 2007 explained further in sections 3 and 6 1 following similar conditions that lead to liquefaction the iof cargo can sustain a build up of pore air and water pressure due to the inability to dissipate seed et al 1976 the pore pressure accumulates over time due to varying cyclic loading magnitudes and cycle durations eseller bayat et al 2013a 2013b leading to volumetric compression strains that keep pore air and water compressed between the voids in soil particles byrne 1991 as pore pressure accumulates the effective stress will reduce and similarly so will the shear strength abramson et al 2002 budhu 2011 duncan et al 2014 jia 2018 over the length of a bulk carrier s journey with such a reduction in shear strength a cargo of iof can become susceptible to slope failure iof cargoes will begin with an initial factor of safety against slope failure of more than 1 but the recommended factor of safety is typically more than 1 5 as generally accepted in geotechnical applications das and sivakugan 2015 from the beginning of the journey the cyclic loading can lead to a build up of pore pressure or may first require a change in the soil particle structure due to the unsaturated nature of iof blight 2013 di prisco and wood 2012 as soon as the pore pressure begins to accumulate and effective stress begins to reduce the shear strength and hence the factor of safety against slope failure may begin to reduce islam and gnanendran 2013 factors such as suffusion and soil structure rearrangement due to consolidation or deformation which can lead to changes to the properties of iof such as the soil gradation and relative density could have the potential to create comparatively weak and strong zones at different locations in the iof mass mitchell and solymar 1984 xiao and shwiyhat 2012 consolidation or deformation of the iof mass will typically create a time dependent increase in the shear strength as the mass densifies mitchell and solymar 1984 however some deformations can rapidly loosen the material and trigger flow slides particularly in the presence of an undrained material that is subjected to moisture migration wang and sassa 2003 in comparing with deformations suffusion can instead leave one zone with a higher shear strength and reduce that of another zone due to the migration of soil and water particles under the applied cyclic loading ke and takahashi 2014 suffusion results in an accumulation of the finer particles that have been carried by the water chang et al 2014 which in the iof mass would be towards the top surface as clearly seen with the large amounts of surface water shown in fig 13 the accumulation of fine particles at the surface along with the free surface water effect which is discussed further in section 6 3 can create a very weak top layer that is more susceptible to slope failure than under the initial conditions this is in part due to the high percentage of fine grained material that lacks shear strength and to the saturated nature that allows excess pore water pressure to build up both of which fuel the potential for slope failure terzaghi et al 1996 although suffusion can cause a weak top layer it can result in a stronger bottom layer as the voids left during suffusion allow larger particles to rearrange more tightly during settlement indraratna et al 2011 wan and fell 2008 the reduced moisture content in this zone also reduces the potential for pore water pressure build up many concerns for liquefaction and even recently described cargo liquefaction incidents involving iof could instead be focused on the potential for slope failure before excess pore pressure can reach the critical value that will see liquefaction failure occur it is possible that slope failure will first be the critical failure mode due to the reduction in shear strength if the shear strength was to be reduced below that of the applied shear stress slope failure would ensue in fact at an earlier stage than what would be expected for liquefaction in some instances the large heels experienced during rough sea conditions would exacerbate the potential for slope failure as was the case for the vessel alam manis which was struck by several large waves before listing hancock 2015 world maritime news 2015b liquefaction is more likely to be the cause of failure when excess pore pressure accumulates rapidly such that slope failure is consequently bypassed alarcon guzman et al 1988 there is also the potential for slope failure at a certain stage in the journey and liquefaction failure at a later stage or liquefaction may even be triggered as a result of a slope failure 6 3 cargo sloshing other than the typical forms of failure in soil mechanics namely slope and liquefaction failures a more exclusive cargo shift mechanism termed cargo sloshing has the potential to cause ship instability it is not uncommon to observe saturated layers either at the base or on the top of iof cargoes due to suffusion and as seen in fig 13 a free surface layer of water can develop this free surface layer of water which can contain various quantities of suspended fine soil particles is free to slosh around in the cargo hold as the ship oscillates and can create a slurry at the top of the cargo mass similar to that of a liquefied soil zhang et al 2017 the slurry can be formed through erosion where the sloshing motion of the free surface water dislodges the soil particles at the surface and destabilizes a portion of the top layer morgan 2009 the cause of the moisture and high percentage of fines that tends to accumulate on the top surface of mineral cargoes including that of iof is attributed to suffusion from other parts of the mass munro and mohajerani 2017b suffusion has been discussed in both sections 6 1 and 6 2 but specifically for cargo sloshing involves the migration of soil and water particles to the top surface through internal erosion processes due to the applied cyclic load caused by ship motions chang et al 2014 dallo et al 2013 the suffusion that proceeds in mineral cargoes during marine transportation is similar to the process of segregation that occurs in wet concrete and other granular materials where moisture and lightweight particles accumulate at the surface during vibration procedures ahmad and smalley 1973 safawi et al 2004 the resultant change to the soil phase relation after suffusion at a certain location in the mass illustrated in fig 14 and fig 15 is a typical loss of water and fine grained particles to another location in the mass ke and takahashi 2014 fig 14 shows the change in soil phase relation at a location where particles migrate away from which is typically towards the base of the mineral cargo mass fig 15 shows the change in soil phase relation at a location where particles from elsewhere in the mass tend to migrate to typically towards the surface this figure also shows that after suffusion a location such as the top surface can become fully saturated and filled with a larger percentage of fines what is not shown however is that the top surface can exceed full saturation at which point a free surface of water begins accumulating on top of the mineral cargo mass the accumulated surface water as previously mentioned can erode the top surface of a mineral cargo mass such as iof and create a suspended slurry which zhang et al 2017 described as acting like a liquefied soil as such a certain portion of the top layer of the iof mass will begin acting like a liquid sloshing from side to side in the hold munro and mohajerani 2016b as a slurry at the surface is likely to be less viscous during cargo sloshing than a portion of cargo would be during liquefaction due to the greater moisture content the wave height of the sloshing fluid and the impact on the sidewalls would be greater assuming the same volume zou et al 2018 since bulk carriers are not designed to accommodate liquid cargo motions the side to side sloshing can eventually cause a vessel to list beyond a point that is naturally recoverable jonas 2010a or may lead to structural overstressing resulting in failure this may require a particular volume of slurry to accumulate or a number of sloshing cycles before the vessel is destabilized or the stresses are large enough to cause structural failure after the initial list is developed and retained the slurry will have accumulated on one side of the vessel and as a result further cargo sloshing will be minimal it is hence unlikely that cargo sloshing alone can cause a vessel to capsize instead the likely saturation and change in particle size distribution of the top layer of the iof cargo as a result of suffusion will increase the risk of slope and liquefaction failure modes these modes of failure are more likely to have a detrimental effect on vessel stability thereby resulting in the vessel capsizing 7 discussion the review conducted generally examined each potential cargo shift mechanism that could lead to a vessel listing or capsizing the review into liquefaction considered the liquefaction potential of an unsaturated iof cargo for liquefaction to occur an increase in excess pore air and water pressure is required it was determined that for this build up in pore pressure a change in the void ratio would be required before the unsaturated mass could come to a state where the pore air and water would begin carrying the stresses recent studies that have been conducted involving the cyclic triaxial testing of granular materials have shown that a sandy soil of low initial relative density could liquefy for a degree of saturation as low as 50 as the initial relative density was increased the degree of saturation for which liquefaction was observed increased another procedure that was examined was the change in moisture distribution in the mass with moisture migrating from one location to another which has been observed during marine voyages there is the potential for a certain portion of the iof mass to become fully saturated for this portion of the mass and under the cyclic loading applied by ship motions pore water pressure could begin building up and the effective stress would reduce following the theory of any normal fully saturated soil the permeability of the iof may also need to reduce in this location before the pore water would be unable to dissipate suffusion was determined to be a possible factor in both increasing the degree of saturation and reducing the permeability this is due to the finer grained particles and the water particles being transported typically towards the surface and creating a weak top layer as the top layer becomes saturated and the permeability reduces due to finer grained particles blocking and creating smaller voids the layer can become highly susceptible to liquefaction in some instances not only does the increase in the excess pore pressure lead to liquefaction occurring when the shear strength is reduced to zero but it can reduce the shear strength to a value where an applied shear stress can cause a slope type failure in this scenario it is proposed that in some cases shear resistance would not be able to be reduced rapidly enough to cause liquefaction before a slope type failure occurred with an applied cyclic shear excess pore air and water pressure may build up and reduce the shear strength although not reaching the extent to cause liquefaction however this residual shear strength as a result of the excess pore pressure could reduce the factor of safety against a slope type failure it was also discussed that a similar suffusion effect as explained prior could create a weak top layer made up of finer grained particles and of a typically fully saturated nature the weak top layer in itself would have a lower shear strength than the initial mass of iof and the lower portion where water and fine particles had migrated from would likely have become very strong the initial factor of safety against slope type failure could be compromised with the changes in the iof mass with the unexpected weak layer unable to resist the applied shear stresses a further cargo shift mechanism termed cargo sloshing in this study was explored for its potential to develop and cause vessel instability once again with the effects of suffusion the top surface of the iof can become saturated to the point where a free surface of water develops the finer soil particles that also migrate to the surface during suffusion are likely to cause a weak top layer as the free surface water sloshes around on the surface it can cause erosion of the underlying iof dislodging the soil particles and creating a suspended slurry over time this condition can worsen and the mass of the suspended slurry can increase this slurry as it sloshes side to side in the cargo hold would impact against the sides of the vessel and exacerbate the vessel s motion this would seemingly increase the rotation about the vessel axis with each cycle of rolling and pitching and could eventually reach the point where a list is developed it was recognised that although the cargo sloshing could cause vessel instability it is unlikely that it can directly cause capsizing in fact the cargo sloshing would subside once the initial list is developed upon the initial list developing the angle of repose could cause the slope of the iof cargo to become unstable this would lead to further cargo accumulating on one side of the ship thereby worsening the list and possibly causing complete capsizing the changes in iof cargoes is equally matched by the variations observed in the material properties between the iof mined in differing locations the study uncovered a significant variation in the physical properties of iof not only by country but by mine the physical properties of iof from various mines in australia were seen to differ between significantly large ranges one property observed to change in most cases was the particle size distribution which is known to be a highly important factor that affects the liquefaction potential of soils for such variations in the material properties of iof emphasis was put on the inability to predict the behaviour of all iof cargoes it was also noted that not only do these variations put some iof cargoes at a greater risk of liquefying but they may also mean that some cargoes are in fact not liquefiable this would render the classification of all iof cargoes as obsolete as some cargoes could behave similar to a group c cargo as outlined in the imsbc code 7 1 discussion on potential solutions moisture content plays a direct role in the ability of an iof cargo to liquefy limiting the moisture content to a level that would see the probability of liquefaction become almost completely negligible for example to a 50 degree of saturation or lower is the ideal solution however it is not a practical solution when considering the ability of industrial measures to reduce and maintain the moisture content it would be extremely costly and time consuming to attempt to reduce an iof cargo to such low levels of degree of saturation it would also be difficult to prevent the ingress of moisture which would see an increase in the degree of saturation with iof stockpiles in many asian countries being exposed to monsoonal rains and these weather events wreaking havoc during loading and stowage of the cargoes controlling and assuring the moisture content during the various stages of transportation would be impractical as such the implementation of other measures particularly by physical means should become the focus of the studies to find the best practice solution with this being said and with the key issues that have been discussed in section 6 for the various modes of geotechnical failure some possible solutions to prevent cargo shift have been included below a brief description of the main concepts has also been included however this is only to introduce the background theory and is not intended to explain the finer details of the ideas 7 1 1 vertical layering of geomembrane sheets suffusion can lead to the transportation of water and fine iof particles which typically occurs towards the surface as discussed in section 6 this can result in elevated levels of the degree of saturation and alter the particle size distribution at localized positions in the cargo with an increase in the degree of saturation and a higher percentage of fine grained particles the mass becomes more susceptible to various geotechnical failures including slope type failures and liquefaction thus one solution is to prevent the migration of water and iof particles that can lead to the dangerous physical alterations of the iof cargo such prevention can help control the cargo behaviour during marine transportation and eliminate the likelihood of the cargo developing the required characteristics that will see a liquefaction or slope type failure occur one method that could be implemented to achieve this is the inclusion of layers of geomembrane sheets the geomembrane sheets could be placed at appropriate vertical intervals so as to effectively separate the cargo into layers acting as a barrier to control the migration of the water and iof particles restricting moisture migration could keep the degree of saturation to tolerable levels in each layer effectively preventing the build up of pore pressure and hence the development of liquefaction the fine iof particles that are normally carried during moisture migration will also be trapped by the geomembrane which could help control the particle size distribution and eliminate the development of weak fine grained layers that are susceptible to both slope type failures and liquefaction the surface water observed in many iof cargoes is unlikely to be seen if geomembrane sheets were to be installed highlighting the obvious impact that this method would have in preventing the physical alterations that can lead to the increased probability of geotechnical failures that cause cargo shift the geomembrane sheets that would be located at the regular vertical intervals could be attached to built in roller systems thus allowing the effective placement and removal that is needed to ensure efficient shipping operations geomembrane sheets can be re used and can be easily adapted into the placement and extraction procedures one concern in using this method is that particular layers may still liquefy but with this being kept to the scale of an individual layer it would have less impact on vessel stability than what a normal large liquefied portion of the whole cargo would have a conceptual sketch of the arrangement of geomembrane sheets has been provided in fig 16 the cargo dimensions shown are for a typical capesize vessel many types of geomembrane exist with the likes of plasticized poly vinyl chloride pvc p and high density polyethylene hdpe geomembranes becoming a popular method in civil engineering due to being financially attractive shukla and yin 2014 geomembranes are typically used to separate materials that should not be allowed to mix as a reinforcement and as a fluid tight separation membrane between fluids in a reservoir and in the subsoil see fig 17 or to prevent seepage through soils van santvoort 1994 geomembranes are generally thin and flexible having low permeability such that the flow of a fluid is restricted and limited to the characteristic leakage of the individual geomembrane giroud and bonaparte 1989 the particle sizes that permeate through geomembranes depend on the design but for a geomembrane designed to prevent the flow of water finer soil particles would not be able to penetrate through the barrier ingold 2013 as such the vertical layering of geomembranes in an iof cargo would prevent the migration of water to almost negligible levels and could completely restrict the migration of the fine iof particles 7 1 2 regularly spaced vertical wick drains the aforementioned suffusion effects and the consequential outcomes could also be avoided through the installation of vertical wick drains at regularly spaced intervals the wick drains would provide drainage paths intercepting the water that would normally be migrating to other locations in the mass this method similar to the application of geomembrane sheets would help control the localized degree of saturation via the removal of the migrating water at the same time the fine iof particles that are carried during suffusion would no longer accumulate at a single location such as the surface as much of the normal migration towards the surface would now be a short distance towards the wick drains the water that is removed can also help reduce the overall moisture content of the cargo with the cyclic ship motions likely to provide an environment that will allow the wick drains to operate more effectively than under static conditions another major concern is the development of excess pore pressures in the iof cargo with this leading to reduced shear strength and a potential liquefaction failure as excess pore pressure develops the vertical wick drains would provide a means of dissipation hence preventing strength reduction and liquefaction a potential downfall is that the addition of vertical wick drains could make extraction of the iof troublesome with the wick drains being closely spaced it may be difficult to manoeuvre machinery around the wick drains and lead to longer extraction times the space needed for the machinery to operate could also limit the allowable spacing of wick drains such that the wick drains would not operate effectively enough to satisfactorily prevent geotechnical failures that lead to cargo shift investigations need to be conducted to determine not only if this solution can work but if the wick drains could be spaced far enough apart that typical shipping operations are not greatly affected a conceptual sketch of the arrangement of vertical wick drains has been provided in fig 18 the cargo dimensions shown are for a typical capesize vessel vertical wick drains also known as prefabricated vertical drains pvds are typically made up of a plastic drainage channel that is wrapped in a geotextile with the geotextile allowing the water to pass through but preventing soil particles entering and clogging up the drain santi et al 2001 vertical wick drains have served multiple civil engineering purposes with the main focus being to improve ground conditions a specific form of ground improvement that vertical wick drains have been used for is liquefaction mitigation during earthquakes the vertical wick drains provide a considerably shorter drainage path for pore water and during earthquakes will provide a relief of the excess pore water pressure such that strength reduction and liquefaction are prevented mitchell 2008 the application of vertical wick drains also allows for accelerated consolidation which results in densification indraratna et al 2012 densification alone can increase the shear strength of granular materials and also reduce the liquefaction potential mitchell and solymar 1984 in applying this to an iof cargo the vertical wick drains would allow for the dissipation of excess pore pressure hence preventing both strength reduction and liquefaction from occurring the iof could also undergo accelerated densification to provide further geotechnical benefits engineered solutions such as these are not exclusive to iof indeed they could be applied when carrying other bulk mineral cargoes such as nickel ore or bauxite this would suggest that many bulk carriers can be fitted with the necessary equipment and be used for all operations it would also fast track the investigative procedures that need to be undertaken to find the appropriate solutions and allow for implementation in the near future a change to bulk mineral transportation that would improve the safety and efficiency whilst not causing significant impact to travel times would surely be welcomed by the shipping industry 8 conclusion the objective of this study was to explore the behaviour of iof cargoes during marine transportation an array of different soil mechanics theories can be applied to a bulk mineral cargo such as iof each giving rise to potential failure mechanisms that need to be carefully considered when carrying such a cargo the nature of marine transportation can directly alter the physical properties of the cargo and affect the potential for geotechnical failures such as liquefaction and slope type failure it is important to assess not only the initial potential for these geotechnical failures but the potential as the properties of the iof are altered during a marine voyage right up until the point of potential failure the failures lead to the cargo shifting which in most cases is detrimental to the vessel s stability with an investigation into the recent marine accidents that have involved cargo shift brief case studies for each incident were prepared as seen in appendix a various sources were used including transport accident reports filed by transport safety bureaus marine accident logs and media reports these brief case studies are intended to investigate the potential failure modes that lead to the cargo shift and to reproduce the moments in the build up to the vessels listing or capsizing also seen from these marine accidents is that the trend of iof related incidents has not declined even with the implementation of the group a cargo classification in the imsbc code this classification was intended to prevent further iof related accidents through controlling the ability of the cargo to shift however the accident trend since its inception in 2011 has continued at the same rate proving a challenge for the bulk mineral cargo industry the stark observation is that between 1988 and 2017 twenty nine people have lost their lives in nine separate iof related accidents it has become evident that the iof properties are changing during marine transportation from the beginning of the marine voyage ship motions are causing an alteration in the iof properties with time after a certain period of time has passed localized portions of the iof mass are becoming largely variant in comparison to the initial loading conditions with suffusion leading to the migration of water and finer grained soil particles which are being transported typically towards the surface a potentially weak fully saturated layer is being created this portion of the mass can become susceptible to liquefaction and slope type failures but as discussed throughout this study the free surface water can also erode the top surface of the cargo and lead to cargo sloshing prior to this review the impact of cargo sloshing has not been investigated nor has the development of a cargo slurry at the surface been recognised it is recommended that cargo sloshing be examined as a potential cargo shift mechanism one of which may cause vessel instability it has been recognised in this study that cargo sloshing may not be able to cause capsizing but certainly has the potential to cause some degree of vessel instability with an increase in excess pore pressure a review was completed to determine whether the residual shear strength could in fact cause a slope type failure before a state of liquefaction was achieved as the excess pore pressure reduces the effective stress a consequential reduction in shear strength to near zero can lead to liquefaction occurring however if the shear strength is not reduced to zero rapidly enough there is potential that a slope type failure would ensue before liquefaction the nature of marine transportation or more importantly the ship motion induced stresses apply relatively low stress amplitudes that vary with sea conditions unlike earthquake or blast induced stresses the wave motions tend to create more drawn out cycles of loading the resulting pore pressure build up would therefore occur much slower than what would be expected during an earthquake giving rise to the potential for a slope type failure rather than liquefaction it should also be mentioned that with the changes in iof properties discussed in this review that similar bulk mineral cargoes can undergo the same processes with other mineral cargoes such as bauxite being classed as group c cargoes there is potential that the same adverse effects described in this study can cause the cargoes to exhibit behaviours similar to that of a group a cargo 8 1 recommendations concluding this review of the literature it is recommended that laboratory tests be conducted to observe the changes that occur within the iof this is best conducted through appropriate scale models that can replicate the stowage environment and shipping motions in particular it is recommended that the change in particle size distribution moisture content and pore air and water pressure be observed at localized positions in the mass the affect these changes have on the potential for geotechnical failures such as liquefaction and slope type failures should be critically analysed a review should also be conducted to determine if a slope type failure will occur before a liquefaction state can be reached as the material properties of iof vary by mined location a study should be conducted to observe the various material properties for the differing iof this could provide a better understanding of the factors that influence the potential for each geotechnical failure and could also uncover further classifications that would put certain iof cargoes in a non liquefiable range furthermore an investigation into the development of cargo sloshing and its impact on ship stability could help determine whether this is a potential cargo shift mechanism that needs addressing with classification alone unlikely to be able to prevent a geotechnical failure that leads to cargo shift more focus should be placed on finding an engineered solution that can reduce such risks potential solutions have been included in the discussion in section 7 1 appendix a table a1 bulk carrier incidents from 1988 to 2017 involving suspected cargo shift table a1 incident number

were described as rough with the vessel rolling and pitching heavily in the south easterly swell it was later found that the cargo was loaded with excessive moisture content due to the availability of water ingress during stockpiling it was further noted that the seller had not provided relevant data pertaining to the cargo s moisture content no lives were lost in the incident and the ship did not

173 nautical miles east of sri lanka weather conditions in the lead up to the listing were described as fine with moderate sea and south westerly winds after acknowledging the situation the master

with all 23 crewmen rescued on 20 may 2005 about 49 h after the initial listing the ship finally sank the probable cause of the listing was thought to be liquefaction of the fluorspar cargo the moisture content of the cargo was tested to be 9 8 higher than the company s cargo safety manual for loading bulk cargo that may liquefy which stipulated 8 moisture limit however this was not certified it is also likely that further ingress of rain water during unloading of other cargoes caused the fluorspar to reach a higher level of moisture content the hong kong special administrative

rejected by another vessel but no reason for the rejection was made available the directorate general of shipping investigated the sinking and concluded that the cause was liquefaction due to

cargo capsized on 30 august 2009 crew were stuck on the ship for 5 h before all were rescued safely conflicting reports suggest two possible scenarios led to the ship capsizing the first was suggested by crew who claimed a leak had developed in the engine compartment leading to the ship taking on water and becoming unstable another suggested by experts claims that the iron ore fines liquefied during the poor weather conditions resulting in the cargo shifting in the hold and causing the ship to become unstable the two scenarios are variably different and the true series of events is unclear the incident occurred during the monsoon season where sea conditions and winds were described as rough these conditions could have potentially caused cargo shift although it is widely known that cargo shift can occur under light winds and seas as the probable cause is unclear and crew and expert opinions clash this incident should not be regarded as an accident caused by cargo shift fairplay 2010

right whilst still anchored at port crew were evacuated from the ship but the chief engineer stayed aboard in an attempt to correct the list the ship eventually capsized with the chief engineer still on board his body recovered several days later the captain of the ship objected to having the iron ore fines cargo loaded as it was brought to his attention that the cargo contained excess moisture content his objection was turned down by the vessel s agent sea trans private limited and the cargo was loaded anyway it was later discovered that the captain forged insurance papers to anchor in paradip port and transport the iron ore fines to china the listing was believed to be caused by liquefaction of the iron ore fines cargo although a hole had opened up in the ships body potentially caused by overstressing if the hole had recently opened up it may have been caused by cargo shift resulting in overstressing but is likely to be completely unrelated whether the hole already existed

corrective action failed and the list worsened to 10 within 10 min of first developing a list the ship had capsized 13 of the crewmen lost their lives the ship had encountered bad weather with

attempts to correct the list and prevent free surface effect of the cargo by use of pumps and bilges as well as by sailing into the wind the ship remained unstable it was believed that the ship sunk the same day as emergency calls from the ships emergency response team were not answered the ship had seemingly capsized before being able to send out a distress signal the cause of the listing and eventual capsizing was with profound evidence due to the free surface slurry in the holds cargo liquefaction 22 seafarers lost their lives in the incident which was believed to have occurred so

prior to loading shown a moisture content of 30 8 higher than the tml of 30 25 although the cargo was exposed to heavy rainfalls after loading and most likely had a moisture content higher than that

cargo capsized on 21 november 2011 15 crewmen were saved whilst 6 others lost their lives the cause of the capsizing is relatively unclear but it is known the ship was battered with high waves and strong winds it was expected that liquefaction of the cargo played a role in the capsizing but some reports suggest mechanical failure and the rough sea conditions were the factors leading to the ship sinking it is unlikely that rough sea conditions alone would cause the ship to capsize and it could be reasonably predicted that the cargo shifted in the hold under these conditions as a result it is

jackets and life boats to be lowered and prepared for use no distress signal was sent out although the emergency equipment on board should have automatically sent out a signal the survivor reported that the sinking occurred very quickly and that capsizing of the vessel occurred within 2 h of first listing the weather conditions were bad with strong winds and rough seas likely to have caused liquefaction of the cargo the rapid sinking of the vessel is once again a characteristic of many nickel ore related incidents and is enough to suggest that liquefaction or any form of cargo shift was

listing further deteriorated to more than 90 in less than 2 h and eventually caused the vessel to capsize all crew managed to evacuate the vessel prior to sinking investigation into the incident revealed the nickel ore cargo was loaded with moisture content exceeding the tml and that safety shipboard procedures for loading and carriage of nickel ore were not followed furthermore liquefaction of the cargo had occurred in all of the cargo holds whilst the vessel experienced rolling at anchorage and sliding of the cargo would have occurred when a strong wave battered the ship this was further exacerbated by the approaching severe typhoon utor which hit the vessel with strong winds and waves as a result of poor sheltering choice the crew also mistakenly pumped water into the wrong ballast tank when trying to correct the list causing further instability of the ship the overall outcome of the investigation showed that highly inadequate handling procedures and overall ship

rains had affected stockpiles of bauxite including those in kuantan where the cargo was loaded this had made the stockpiles very wet and could have meant the bauxite cargo was subject to a high

shift caused the vessel to list at 14 to starboard the crew of 21 were evacuated safely onto a tug but 1 man later died from a heart attack possibly caused by stress the vessel was blown ashore and grounded it is likely the cargo shift was due to slope failure and not liquefaction as the large waves would have caused a significant heel and shear force such that the slope became unstable the bulk carrier was not lost but was damaged in the incident due to the man passing away from a heart attack after the event had occurred this death should not be attributed to the cargo shift incident

survivor also insisted that the cargo was normal before the ship sunk the incident as it occurred so rapidly was believed to have been caused by liquefaction of the cargo experts suggested that the cargo shifted in the hold and ultimately led to the ship s instability however evidence provided by survivors and the text received prior to sinking creates conflicting scenarios there is a possibility that the cargo liquefaction caused the cargo to slosh in the hold creating large dynamic forces on the hull of the ship and possibly overstressing the steel this may have resulted in the hull cracking and explain why the ship was taking on water as a result of the conflicting factors that led to the sinking of stellar daisy this incident should be investigated further to determine the

22783,iron ore fines iof which is a bulk mineral cargo exhibits an inherent high level of risk during marine transportation due to its potential to liquefy with nine marine accidents since 2007 being directly linked to the shifting of iof cargoes which resulted in the deaths of twenty nine seafarers the danger for shippers is indisputable this study aims to review the behaviour of iof during marine transportation by analysing the factors that lead to geotechnical related failures it suggests that due to suffusion caused by the dynamic motions of the vessel the top layer of a cargo of iof may end up containing a large percentage of fine grained particles this would seemingly result in a weak zone near the surface with the possibility of being fully saturated and therefore increasing the potential for liquefaction or reducing the factor of safety against a slope type failure the study will also analyse and discuss the reasons behind the past and recent listing and capsizing incidents involving bulk mineral carriers the final outcome of this study will be the proposal of some possible solutions that may be implemented and recommendations for further studies in order to reduce the likelihood of cargo shift occurring keywords iron ore fines iof bulk carrier cargo shift liquefaction slope failure cargo sloshing 1 introduction the marine transportation of iof cargoes has proven to contain a high level of risk with the stability of the cargo playing a vital role in recent decades many ships carrying iof have listed or capsized resulting in significant loss of life as well as financial and economic losses munro and mohajerani 2015 2016a 2016b 2017c 2017a 2017b the leading cause of these marine accidents has been attributed to cargo liquefaction which has resulted in the cargo shifting in the hold and ultimately causing ship instability further failure methods including flow type failures and slope stability failures of the cargoes as well as structural damage caused by over stressing have all been explored as possible causes of some of the recent marine accidents which reiterates the need to understand the risks of carrying iof as detailed in section 2 nine cargo shift incidents involving iof have occurred since 2007 with twenty nine seafarers losing their lives in many of the accidents the vessels were seen to be listing which in some cases resulted in the vessel capsizing an example of which can be seen in fig 1 the listing of these vessels was generally determined to have been caused by a shift in the mineral cargoes being transported whereby the cargo accumulated on one side offsetting the ships balance by creating an overturning moment with respect to buoyancy the hong kong special administrative region 2015 with many studies having been conducted to investigate the liquefaction behaviour and potential of iof the failure mechanism has had broad exposure many other mineral cargoes such as nickel ore and bauxite have experienced liquefaction failures during marine transportation healey 2013 world maritime news 2015a the interest in bulk mineral cargo liquefaction for its potential to cause vessel instability dates back as far as 1977 where green and hughes 1977 described the potential for what appears to be a relatively dry granular material to develop into an unstable fluid mass with such a heavy focus on liquefaction other modes of failure have had limited investigation munro and mohajerani 2017c recently evaluated the slope stability of iof during its marine voyage however they did not consider the stability of the slope among the properties of the iof change this review however determines how the changes in the iof properties can adversely affect the geotechnical failure modes such as liquefaction and slope type failure it also analyses the potential for each failure mode to develop which is critical in preventing the shift of iof cargoes cargo sloshing which has not been investigated or discussed in previous literature can also lead to a cargo shift when a suspended slurry that is primarily made up of water and dense iof soil particles sloshes around in the cargo hold it can behave in a similar way to that of a liquefied portion of the mass zhang et al 2017 liquids or liquefied gasses undergoing marine transportation exhibit this sloshing behaviour but typically are confined by minimising the surface area or utilising baffles within the cargo holds fleissner et al 2010 it should also be noted that sloshing of a bulk mineral cargo entails some degree of viscosity zou et al 2018 showed that viscosity can effectively dissipate the kinetic energy of sloshing and reduce the sloshing induced loads as higher viscosity liquefied cargoes applied less pressure to the sidewalls in unison with the natural ship motions this sloshing force can impact against the vessel walls increasing the degree of rotation experienced during rolling and pitching zhang et al 2016 this could create a pendulum type effect up until the point where the vessel develops a list that cannot be corrected using available means such as ballast the existing guidelines outlined in the international maritime solid bulk cargoes imsbc code characterise iof as having the potential to liquefy international maritime organisation 2018a as such restrictions on the maximum moisture content are imposed based on the transportable moisture limit tml this tml infers a maximum moisture content that the iof can contain and if shipped below the tml is said to be unable to liquefy with the effects of moisture migration locations within the cargo may experience very high moisture contents when compared to the initial conditions munro and mohajerani 2018 in reference to the guidelines within the imsbc code these locations would subsequently exceed the tml and be acknowledged as potentially liquefiable not only do iof cargoes have the potential to become inhomogeneous during their marine voyages many iof cargoes have vastly different material properties due to the geological strata from which they were extracted this is discussed further in section 5 linking these two points it is difficult to classify cargoes of iof and to assume that the behaviour is the same for all variations and at all stages in the journey 1 1 objective the main objective of this study is to explore the behaviour of iron ore fines iof during marine transportation and under the dynamic loading that a cargo can be expected to experience at sea the study will also detail the reasons behind the past and recent listing and capsizing incidents involving bulk mineral carriers that were deemed to have been caused by cargo liquefaction or other modes of failures causing cargo shift in particular this paper will explore liquefaction of iof detailing the material parameters and typical behaviour that leads to the occurrence of liquefaction other modes of failure that may occur such as slope failure will also be explored and the significance in terms of ship stability will be critically analysed with the cargo possibly becoming inhomogeneous during voyages it is important to understand how this will affect the potential for a cargo shift this study will explore the potential changes in an iof mass explaining how it can occur and the potential consequences the final outcome of this paper will be the proposal of solutions that may be implemented and recommendations for further studies in order to reduce the likelihood of cargo shift occurring and to further ascertain the behaviour of bulk mineral cargoes during marine transportation 1 2 methodology a literature review has been carried out to combine the recent studies and outcomes of previous research papers this information has been used to summarise past efforts to explore the causes of cargo liquefaction and the behaviour of bulk mineral cargoes under the dynamic loading expected during marine transportation with the information available gaps in research have become evident and recommendations for further studies have been made the understanding gained through the literature review has also provided a foundation to propose solutions to reduce the likelihood of cargo shift mechanisms 2 recent marine accidents attributed to cargo shift involving bulk mineral carriers it is well known and highly publicised that the carriage of potentially liquefiable materials contains a high level of risk this is evident from the number of incidents involving cargo shifting from the years 1988 2015 which totalled twenty three as reported by munro and mohajerani 2017a this number in 2016 and 2017 has since increased by three with the loss of the bulk mineral carriers bao jiang 88 emerald star and stellar daisy hancock 2016 maritime executive 2017 maritime injury center 2017 the incidents reported by munro and mohajerani 2017a that occurred between 1988 and 2015 and including the most recent years 2016 and 2017 resulted in a total loss of life of 171 a stark comparison can be made in that out of these twenty six incidents and 171 deaths a respective nine incidents and twenty nine deaths involved the carriage of iof the number of incidents and corresponding deaths between 1988 and 2017 involving a cargo shift is presented in fig 2 and fig 3 a brief summary of each incident is presented in table a1 of appendix a as seen in fig 2 the number of incidents whereby vessels have either listed or capsized due to a cargo shift has somewhat increased in regularity since 2005 with only three incident free years out of the past thirteen and an average of 1 7 incidents occurring per year since 2005 iof has been the cargo being transported in six incidents out of the past thirteen prior to 2005 only four years dating back to 1988 had reported cargo shift incidents however this figure may in fact be higher due to the unavailability of information and available technology in those years to document and report the incidents or because this phenomenon was not investigated and or the cause potentially misidentified in respect of the number of incidents fig 3 shows that 141 seafarers have lost their lives since 2005 with incidents involving the transportation of iof totalling twenty nine deaths iof incidents resulting in death have occurred in 2009 2011 and 2017 protection and indemnity p i clubs such as the london p i club and the uk p i club have released various bulletins and cautions to their members in relation to past incidents and recent events including those that could potentially have caused dangerous loading conditions of the mineral cargoes one in particular released in 2008 following two separate events in 2007 stated that recent rains in indian ports may have caused excessive moisture content in stockpiles of iof and that certifications in relation to the moisture content received from indian agencies had questionable accuracy london p and i club 2008 the following year in 2009 a further two incidents regarding the cargo shift of iof loaded from indian ports were reported marine buzz 2009a couttie 2009 with previous warnings unable to prevent the accidents from occurring with the imsbc code being made available for voluntary use on 1 january 2009 and officially enforced on 1 january 2011 international maritime organisation 2008 regulations regarding the safe carriage and testing of bulk mineral cargoes has become more stringent than in earlier years iof was omitted from the imscb code until temporary reclassification as a liquefiable cargo or group a cargo was sent out by the imo in the circular dsc 1 circ 66 rev 1 in october 2012 international maritime organisation 2012 and following verification the amendments were made permanent in the release of the 2015 imsbc code international maritime organisation 2015 as seen in figs 2 and 3 although the imsbc code has been implemented mandatorily since 2011 cargo shift related incidents are not reducing the same can be said specifically for iof with three incidents occurring in the years following the reclassification of the material in 2012 as liquefiable the new regulations regarding the determination of the tml and the loading unloading and stowage of bulk mineral cargoes has been aimed at controlling the liquefaction potential and general stability of the cargo during its voyage to date these controls have not been able to reduce cargo shift incidents and it is clear that further research into the behaviour of bulk mineral cargoes during marine transport is required with potential physical solutions as discussed in section 7 1 being more likely to prevent cargo shift from occurring and having a positive impact on the number of incidents we observe as evidenced from a number of the incident reports is the likeness between the factors contributing to the resulting cargo shift in many instances rough sea and weather conditions were reported likely resulting in an increase in the amplitude and duration of the dynamic loading on the vessel thereby increasing the potential for liquefaction and producing larger angles of heel and a consequent increase in the likelihood of slope failure nayfeh and khdeir 1986 these factors were seen to contribute to the foundering of the m v bright ruby on 21 november 2011 when the vessel capsized after being battered by high waves and strong winds thereby leading to possible liquefaction of her iof cargo safety4sea 2011 maritime connector 2011 in another incident several large waves struck the vessel alam manis resulting in the shift of the nickel ore cargo the consequences of which generated a fourteen degree starboard list hancock 2015 world maritime news 2015b although liquefaction was reported to be the suspected cause of the cargo shift it is possible that the finite number of large waves resulted in an increase in the angle of heel to such a degree that the internal shear resistance of the material was overcome resulting in a significant portion of the cargo shifting this is somewhat confirmed by the fact that the vessel did not list any further and was only limited to a specific degree of list to one side an expected characteristic of a slope type failure in such scenarios where rough sea and weather conditions are encountered the risk of cargo shift is likely to increase under these extreme but not uncommon sea states other than the pre emptive measures taken during loading controlling the behaviour of a stowed cargo is near impossible and could be better solved through the implementation of physical elements that aid in providing slope stability prevention of liquefaction or further cargo containment restrictions imposed on cargo characteristics could also assist in maintaining cargo stability but should be expected to have less effectiveness due to the variability in factors such as loading techniques and transport routes and conditions beyond the uncontrollable factors such as weather other incidents involved inadequate documentation of moisture content whereby the cargo was loaded in conditions that exceeded the tml five of the twenty six incidents presented in table a1 of appendix a were proven to have had cargoes loaded in excess of the tml australian transport safety bureau 2000 the hong kong special administrative region 2005 couttie 2009 marine buzz 2009b hancock 2013 healey 2013 intermanager 2013 the hong kong special administrative region 2015 whilst a further four incidents involved cargoes

that some of the cargo shift incidents could potentially have been avoided had the correct procedures been followed however it should be noted that even if the appropriate regulations were followed a cargo shift may still have occurred as was the case for incidents where all regulations were proven to have been followed excluding the incidents suspected or proven to have not followed regulatory requirements seventeen of the twenty six incidents which includes six out of the nine iof related incidents still stand as having followed all the guidelines although kept below the tml these cargoes still exhibited cargo shift it is noted that by investigating these incidents it is evident that the behaviour of mineral cargoes during marine transportation was is and will continue to be hard to predict although the danger of carrying these cargoes that may potentially shift has become more widespread the increased awareness has not reduced the number of incidents and the problem still exists within the bulk mineral cargo trade 3 cause of ship instability during a voyage bulk carriers are subject to loading from both waves and wind causing rolling and pitching motions chen et al 2018 as presented in fig 4 the pitching is an upward and downward motion of the bow and stern whilst the rolling is an oscillation about the longitudinal axis through the vessels centre of gravity barrass and derrett 2006 the pitching and rolling effects leads to induced moments on the vessel which is translated to the cargo in the hold in the form of cyclic loading kim et al 2007 the cyclic loading can cause an array of different failure modes including liquefaction or slope failure of the iof cargo or may lead to dynamic separation of the soil and water particles and result in areas of weakness ura et al 1984 liquefaction slope failure or any other mode of failure that causes cargo shift has the ability to cause ship instability there are two forces that act on a vessel in order to keep it stable as defined by basic ship hydrostatics the downwards force of the vessel s weight depicted as w in fig 5 a and the upward buoyancy force applied by the sea in reaction to the displacement of water by the vessel depicted as fb in fig 5 a the centre of buoyancy is depicted as b in fig 5 whilst the centre of gravity is depicted as g in fig 5 a the buoyance force initially acts through the metacentre of the ship depicted as m in fig 5 biran and pulido 2013 to cause listing or capsizing the centre of gravity must be above the vessel s metacentre this is explained by taking the moment about the metacentre which reveals an overturning moment depicted as mo in fig 5 will cause the vessel to uncontrollably roll about its axis until a new equilibrium point can be established rawson and tupper 2001 when the reverse happens and the centre of gravity is below the metacentre the outcome is a righting moment depicted as mr in fig 5 bringing the vessel back towards equilibrium cargo is initially evenly distributed within the holds of a vessel ensuring the centre of gravity remains below the metacentre but if the cargo shifts an overturning moment can result and the vessel will begin to list and possibly capsize munro and mohajerani 2017c efforts to restore the stability of a vessel can involve the movement of ballast typically water about the vessel in an attempt to move the centre of gravity back below the metacentre however moving ballast quickly enough in response to listing or having enough ballast available in reserve to provide sufficient restoring moment may not be adequate the dynamic stability of a vessel can be greatly impacted by sudden cargo shifting that results in a heeling moment the response of a vessel to such a sudden heeling moment depends on various factors including wave direction wave frequency position of the wave on the ship at the time of the applied moment travel speed and the magnitude of the heeling moment acanfora and cirillo 2017 for a constant magnitude of heeling moment the worst case scenario occurs when the wave frequency is close to the natural roll frequency of the ship which is shown in fig 6 note the wave frequencies closest to the natural roll frequency are 0 628 and 0 571 in such a case acanfora and cirillo 2017 showed that the greatest dynamic rolling amplitude is achieved and that parametric rolling resonance can develop as the difference between wave frequency and natural roll frequency becomes greater the transient rolling response is typically less variable and the amplitude is closer to the static rolling angle asghari et al 2007 showed that as the magnitude of the heeling moment increases both the static rolling angle and the amplitude become greater combining these two observations a sudden cargo shift which would result in a heeling moment can cause a vessel to experience high amplitudes of rolling before the static rolling angle is reached if the heeling moment caused by the cargo shift is sufficiently large enough even without considering the amplitude of the rolling response the static rolling angle may be enough to cause vessel instability even if the static rolling angle caused by a shift in the cargo is not enough to cause the vessel to become unstable the wave frequency among other factors may be enough to cause sufficiently large dynamic rolling amplitudes during the rolling response that would see the vessel become unstable both liquefaction and sloshing cargo shift mechanisms would result in an almost constant heeling moment and a response similar to that in fig 6 would be expected the same can t be said for a shift in a cargo caused by a slope type failure which would instead result in an instantaneous heeling moment or a pulse heeling moment as depicted in fig 7 comparing figs 6 and 7 for the same wave frequency the maximum rolling angle amplitude is above 40 for a constant heeling moment and less than 30 for the pulse heeling moment the static rolling angle also returns to zero a certain period of time after the pulse heeling moment is applied or in another sense the rolling caused by a slope type failure of a cargo will eventually return to its initial state assuming the vessel remains stable although a slope type failure follows this behaviour this does not necessarily mean that the impact on dynamic stability is less critical when compared to cargo shift caused by liquefaction for instance a slope type failure may concern a large portion of the cargo mass whereas liquefaction may only concern a small portion towards the top surface this would result in a disparity between the heeling moments with the slope type failure having a larger magnitude and as shown by asghari et al 2007 may lead to a larger amplitude of rolling angle with this being said a comparatively smaller heeling moment caused by liquefaction or cargo sloshing can still have a great deal of effect on the vessel s dynamic stability countermeasures to prevent a vessel from becoming unstable reduces the risk of capsizing due to instability and ideally can eliminate the problem altogether without the shift in cargo causing a vessel to become unstable many if not all of the reported cargo shift incidents might have been prevented although residual efforts to correct ship instability have proven to be effective many factors that need to be taken into consideration this involves the time of identification and the time of response as well as the required action to best correct or prevent ship instability the problem should be identified as early as possible but even so there may be no physical means to counteract the effects of cargo shift in addition to vessel stability structural failure caused by overstressing particularly through the sloshing of cargo may lead to a vessel sinking this has not been explored in detail however this needs to be acknowledged as a potential factor that can have catastrophic consequences 4 understanding the imsbc code the imsbc code which replaced the former code of safe practice for solid bulk cargoes bc code has the primary aim to facilitate the safe stowage and shipment of solid bulk cargoes by providing information on the dangers associated with the shipment of certain types of solid bulk cargoes and instructions on the procedures to be adopted when the shipment of solid bulk cargoes is contemplated international maritime organisation 2018b the imsbc code was made available for voluntary use on 1 january 2009 and has been implemented on a mandatory basis since 1 january 2011 international maritime organisation 2008 iof was originally omitted from the imsbc code until temporary reclassification as a liquefiable cargo was sent out by the imo in the circular dsc 1 circ 66 rev 1 in october 2012 international maritime organisation 2012 and was officially reclassified in an amendment to the 2015 imsbc code international maritime organisation 2015 the imsbc code includes information relating to the bulk mineral cargoes referenced in this study including that for iof the information includes general loading carriage and unloading precautions section 2 trimming procedures section 5 methods for determining the angle of repose section 6 and appendix 2 of the imsbc code and information on cargoes that may liquefy including the test procedures for those cargoes and their individual schedules sections 7 and 8 as well as appendices 1 and 2 of the imsbc code international maritime organisation 2015 the imsbc code provides a detailed guide to bulk mineral cargo handlers and also contains enforceable regulations that must be followed in order to maintain safety during loading carriage and unloading the imsbc code separates bulk mineral cargoes into three groups group a group b and group c the international maritime organisation 2015 describes these groups as follows group a comprises those that may liquefy if shipped at a moisture content in excess of their transportable moisture limit tml group b are those that possess a chemical hazard that could give rise to a dangerous situation on a ship and group c are those that are neither liable to liquefy group a nor possess a chemical hazard group b each bulk mineral cargo has been assessed as to its potential dangers and as listed in their individual schedules has been assigned to one of the three aforementioned groups the group designation relates to specific regulations and procedures that need to be adhered to in order to safely load carry and unload the cargo it also outlines the responsibilities of shippers in relation to handling the cargo and explicitly defines the risks for example iof is classified as a group a cargo and handling must therefore follow the regulations and procedures for a liquefiable material cargoes that have the potential to liquefy fall under group a and must adhere to the regulations set out in section 7 of the imsbc code this section aims to make shippers aware of the risks of carrying a cargo that may liquefy outlines the responsibilities of the shipper in respect of safe handling and discusses the precautions that can be taken to minimize the risk of liquefaction it is noted that section 7 states that if a cargo ship is specially constructed to confine a bulk mineral cargo thereby preventing a possible shift the regulations required to transport a group a cargo need not be followed international maritime organisation 2015 an important regulation in the imsbc code is the requirement that bulk mineral cargoes classified as group a undergo tml testing the tml is defined as the maximum moisture content at which a group a cargo can be considered safe to load on a vessel without being at risk of liquefying during transport international maritime organisation 2015 in order to determine the tml of iof a test referred to as the modified proctor fagerberg test must be performed on a sample of the cargo the tml is the moisture content corresponding to the point on a compaction curve at 80 degree of saturation other test methods used to determine the tml of other types of bulk mineral cargoes include the standard proctor fagerberg test the flow table test and the penetration test all test methods are described in detail in appendix 2 of the imsbc code prior to loading a group a cargo the appropriate documentation regarding the tml and the actual moisture content should be made available under no circumstance should a group a cargo be loaded with moisture content exceeding the tml additionally if the master of the vessel believes the moisture content of the cargo is in excess of the tml verification of the certificates can be requested the master may refuse to sail if the proper documentation is not provided other important regulations involve the trimming of the cargo and the determination of the angle of repose the trimming of a cargo involves levelling of the surface which helps in preventing slope failure and can also aid in distributing stresses induced by the cargo mass ivanov and kokarakis 2010 section 5 of the imsbc code outlines the requirements for cargo trimming but states that the cargo should be trimmed reasonably level as necessary to minimize risk further slope stability regulations regard the angle of repose which is the angle at which the cargo slope will fail and hence slide due to the shear resistance of the failure plane being exceeded carrigy 1970 section 6 of the imsbc code recommends 2 test methods to determine the angle of repose for the cargo the tilting box method and the shipboard test method both methods are explained in detail in appendix 2 of the imsbc code specific to iof the imsbc code includes an individual schedule that details the characteristics hazards precautions carriage requirements and loading unloading procedures the imsbc codes definition of iof is iron ore containing both 10 or more of fine particles less than 1 mm d10 1 mm and 50 or more of particles less than 10 mm d50 10 mm international maritime organisation 2015 the imsbc code also states that even if the above criteria for an iron ore material is met the cargo may be classified as iron ore a group c cargo if the goethite content is 35 or more by mass and the appropriate declaration is received goethite is a hydrated iron oxide formed from the dissolution of ferrihydrite that forms fibrous crystals and tends to absorb free water within the pores of the cargo schwertmann and cornell 2007 for this reason the imsbc code accounts for the absorption of the pore water in iof cargoes and at 35 goethite content is said to be at no risk of liquefying further characteristics of iof can be found in table 1 5 material properties of iron ore fines the characteristics of iof vary with geographical location due to the underlying differences in the geological properties of the mined iron ore and in the processing and refinement procedures throughout this process the properties of the iof can change most notably the geotechnical properties it is for this reason that the prediction and assumptions concerning the iof properties are difficult and possibly inaccurate this section is not intended to provide a universal range of material properties but instead to provide some typical values from varying locations this highlights the variability in the properties of iof how such variability affects the behaviour and what factors lead to this disparity iron ore is a natural raw material typically a brown red colour which is mined around the world the australian mines atlas 2015a states that most iron ores mined today comprise the iron oxide minerals hematite fe2o3 70 fe goethite fe2o3s h2o 63 fe limonite a mixture of hydrated iron oxides up to 60 fe and magnetite fe3o4 72 fe mined iron ore is processed to allow its use in the iron steel making industry processing firstly involves crushing and screening to separate the ore into fines 6 3 mm particle size and lump 6 3 31 5 mm particle size bureau of infrastructure transport and regional economics 2014 brazil is host to five of the largest iron ore mines in the world with australia and south africa contributing to the next six duddu 2014 serra sul s11d an iron ore mine located in carajas brazil owned by vale has claimed the title of the world s largest iron ore mine since its expansion in 2016 topf 2016 the 14 3 billion mine complex boasts some of the largest production of iof in the world other contributors to the production of iof are india canada norway and the usa with 317 million spent on iron ore exploration in australia during 2016 department of industry innovation and science 2015 many mine sites have been developed across the country to extract this valuable mineral resource a map of the major operating iron ore mines in australia as of 2015 is shown in fig 8 much of the iron ore mined in australia makes its way overseas to countries such as china and japan for refining department of industry innovation and science 2015 in appendix b a number of material properties for iof have been presented table b1 of appendix b shows the material properties of the iof samples from various countries which were found during a study conducted by van paassen et al 2013 although it can be seen that the material properties of the iof vary between countries it should be noted that the material properties could also vary within each country depending on the location this was confirmed in a study by munro and mohajerani 2015 in which the samples taken from different mining locations in australia showed significant ranges in each of the physical properties the results from this study are presented in table b2 of appendix b and as seen the minimum and maximum values for certain material properties of the iof varies significantly with such variations particularly in the particle size distribution and tml to predict the behaviour of iof for all scenarios is questionable in fact the iof mined in some locations may not present a liquefiable risk particularly where the gravel content is high the opposite can be said where the soil gradation is closer to the liquefiable range determined by ishihara 1993 for which the iof would have a high potential for liquefaction the material properties of the iof also affect the potential for the cargo mass to change during marine transportation this includes the extent to which the cargo can compact and the possibility for moisture migration with these factors taken into consideration it is not appropriate to treat all iof cargoes alike 6 possible failure modes although liquefaction of iof is the leading recognised mode of failure that has been the suspected cause of the incidents described in section 2 other modes of failures may exist the cause of each failure mechanism depends on a variety of factors with many relating to the particle size distribution and moisture content the varying failure modes generally occur at specific stages of the journey when the required conditions are met 6 1 liquefaction liquefaction is a phenomenon that is quite basically explained as the transformation of a granular material from a once solid state into a liquid state as a result of increased pore pressure and a consequent drop in effective stress jia 2018 the cause of the increase in pore pressure is the tendency of granular materials to contract when subject to cyclic shear stresses sen 2009 an increase in pore pressure to a point at which the effective stress reduces significantly leads to a reduction in shearing resistance and stiffness and a development of large strains such that a granular material will begin to flow like a viscous fluid ishihara 1993 in a saturated state the relatively fast application of cyclic shearing on a granular material induced by ship motion can cause an assumed partly undrained or near undrained condition independent of the boundary conditions applied to the mass di prisco and wood 2012 the same undrained condition can be achieved when the soil permeability is so low that the pore water cannot drain at a rate that allows the pore water pressure to be dissipated blight 2013 when a loose to medium dense dry granular material is subject to cyclic shearing the soil particles can drop into inter particle voids as seen in fig 9 a however when the granular material is saturated the pore water must first drain before the mass can undergo a volume change when the rate of loading of an applied cyclic shear force is such that the pore water has no time to dissipate or when the soil permeability is minimal then an undrained response with no volume change occurs as seen in fig 9 b sen 2009 when the soil particles in a granular mass attempt to rearrange into a more tightly packed unit under cyclic loading or in low permeability soils they compress the pore water in the voids liquefaction of soils during earthquakes 1985 since the pore water is unable to be dispersed elsewhere in the mass the compression of the soil particles on the pore water creates a build up of excess pore water pressure seed et al 1976 the initial compaction of the granular mass plays a vital role in the ability of the mass to undergo volume change loosely compacted granular materials in comparison to tightly compacted granular materials have significantly higher void ratios which allow for higher levels of volume change sağlam 2015 the long lasting assumption of liquefaction occurring primarily when the granular material is fully saturated has recently been put to rest laboratory tests and recent studies have shown that intergranular stress of unsaturated sands with an initial degree of saturation in the moderate to high range can be reduced to very low levels during cyclic loading liu and muraleetharan 2012 unno et al 2008 suggested that the liquefaction of an unsaturated granular soil generally depends on the particle size distribution of the soil skeleton the density the initial degree of saturation the initial confining pressure and the initial pore pressure the most significant observation made by liu and xu 2013 during undrained cyclic shearing tests of unsaturated samples of sand was that with a decrease in the degree of saturation the required amount of loading cycles to cause liquefaction increased however with low degrees of saturation the samples could not be brought to a liquefiable state liu and xu 2013 also showed that a soil specimen with high relative density could also liquefy under very small shearing strains as the strain softening of the soil reduced the shearing resistance to a steady state the simple equation for the effective stress of an unsaturated soil proposed by bishop and blight 1963 is shown in eq 1 while matric suction is defined in eq 2 1 σ σ u a χ u a u w 2 ψ u a u w where u a p o r e a i r p r e s s u r e u w p o r e w a t e r p r e s s u r e σ t o t a

various proposed definitions presented by a number of researchers these have typically been developed based on the material type from eq 1 it was assumed by unno et al 2008 that liquefaction of an unsaturated granular material would occur when both the pore air and water pressure were equal to the initial confining pressure this state also corresponds to a matric suction of zero the volume change between the pore air at initial and final liquefaction states making use of boyle charles law for an ideal gas established eq 3 3 u a 0 v a 0 σ 0 v a 0 δ v a where u a 0 i n i t i a l p o r e a i r p r e s s u r e v a 0 i n i t i a l p o r e a i r v o l u m e σ 0 i n i t i a l t o t a l p r i n c i p a l s t r e s s δ v a c h a n g e i n p o r e a i r v o l u m e δ v a above corresponds to the change in pore air volume and as explained by unno et al 2008 also corresponds to the required void ratio change e 0 e l i q to cause liquefaction if it is assumed that the soil and water particles are incompressible hence eq 3 can be rewritten as in eqs 4 and 5 4 e 0 e l i q 1 s r 0 100 1 u a 0 σ 0 e 0 5 e l i q u a 0 σ 0 s r 0 100 u a 0 σ 0 s r 0 100 e 0 where e 0 i n i t i a l v o i

testing conducted by unno et al 2008 proved that when the void ratio after applied cyclic shear reached the void ratio to cause liquefaction estimated using the relationship above liquefaction would typically ensue this is presented in fig 10 iof is a granular material containing 10 or more of fine particles less than 1 mm and 50 or more of particles less than 10 mm international maritime organisation 2015 limited to a tml corresponding to 80 degree of saturation iof is initially unsaturated applying the theory as previously discussed the iof mass would need to undergo changes in void ratio or moisture content in order to reach a liquefiable state bian and shahrour 2009 under ship motions and engine vibrations the iof cargo may undergo a process of compaction and soil rearrangement ju et al 2018 as the inter particle voids reduce in size the degree of saturation increases gallipoli et al 2003 and the soil permeability decreases schanz 2007 as these properties change so does the capacity for the pore pressure to rise potentially reaching the state of zero effective stress khalili et al 2004 nuth and laloui 2008 to develop the properties that allow for a liquefaction failure to occur it was shown by liu and xu 2013 that the initial conditions may not prevent liquefaction from occurring but instead would increase the number of cyclic load cycles and or the magnitude of the cyclic loading needed to produce the conditions at liquefaction ship motions can cause the migration of water particles as the pore pressure under the cyclic loading is dissipated williams and chen 2016 the ability for moisture migration largely depends upon the permeability and as iof typically has good drainage properties moisture migration will occur this can be confirmed with the effects of moisture migration seen in fig 13 where moisture has accumulated at the surface of an iof cargo when the moisture is expelled from the voids in the iof the finer grained soil particles can be carried by the seepage forces forming the internal erosion process known as suffusion chang et al 2014 in a study conducted by munro and mohajerani 2018 it was observed that suffusion effects had caused portions of samples of iof to increase in moisture content as well as in terms of the percentage of finer particles in some cases the moisture content post suffusion had reached levels in excess of the tml also giving the potential for certain locations to become fully saturated munro and mohajerani 2018 also noted that the migration of soil and water particles was typically towards the surface of the iof samples however if the iof had low density then migration towards the base was also observed the locations from where the moisture and finer particles have migrated from would be left with a lower moisture content and a larger void ratio not only would these locations have a lower liquefaction potential due to the decreased moisture content yoshimi et al 1989 but they would also have an increased liquefaction resistance due to the increase in void size allowing for pore water pressure to be dissipated more readily yilmaz and mollamahmutoglu 2009 in comparison an area of iof such as the surface which experiences increased moisture and finer particle size distribution could become highly susceptible to liquefaction with relatively large quantities of surface water observed in some iof cargoes jonas 2010b there is not only the potential for these locations to accumulate the migrated water particles to the point where the tml is exceeded but there is a possibility that a state of near full saturation can be achieved if the iof were to form a saturated layer at the surface the theory of dynamic liquefaction of a saturated soil would ensue a layer such as this at the surface would have a significant risk of liquefaction due to the relatively low density and the low confining pressure seed and lee 1966 furthermore the finer particles that migrate to this location could reduce the permeability thereby allowing for pore water pressure to increase under the cyclic loading due to the inability for the pressure to dissipate sen 2009 in the study conducted by munro and mohajerani 2018 which replicated a scale model analysis for behaviour of iof during marine transportation a change in the particle size distribution of a sample of iof was observed for a layer at the surface but no significant variation was seen in the middle and bottom layers as seen in fig 11 the top layer of the iof had increased in the percentage of particles between 75 μm and 2 mm this change in particle size distribution has a significant influence on the permeability of the iof with the introduction of the finer particles likely to have restricted the ease with which water can pass through the voids even if full saturation is not achieved as a result of suffusion the moisture content could exceed the tml in this location and the initial classification of the iof would be obsolete the increased moisture content would raise the degree of saturation and as shown earlier by liu and xu 2013 the required cyclic load amplitude and number of load cycles to cause liquefaction would reduce when compared to a drier iof cargo once again due to the surface of an iof cargo being of a much looser nature than near the base there is a greater ability for the soil particles to undergo compaction nicolas et al 2000 coupling the increased degree of saturation the reduced permeability due to migration of finer particles and the relatively loose packing this portion of the iof could exhibit the properties required for liquefaction to occur 6 2 slope failure slope failure occurs when the shear resistance of a slip plane is overcome by an applied shear force resulting in shear failure of the slope budhu 2011 three types of slip plane in a cargo mass in the hold of a ship can lead to slope failure each with distinctly different characteristics these three types of slope failure have been set out by munro and mohajerani 2017c as follows the first type of slope failure is known as sliding en masse which involves the entire cargo mass sliding along the cargo hold interface as a result of applied external forces the second and third types of slope failure both involve the internal shear strength of the cargo being exceeded by the resultant stresses applied internally and externally or in other words where internal equilibrium is overcome duncan et al 2014 this may be along either an infinite parallel slip plane translational slope failure or a circular slip plane rotational slope failure both forming the second and third types of slope failure as previously mentioned fig 12 shows each type of slope failure that can occur in the hold highlighting the slip plane that leads to sliding of the failure mass a variety of factors can lead to the slope failure of a mineral cargo most of which are also relevant to that of any natural or engineered slope including embankments and fills zaretskii et al 1980 these factors can form a process of shear stress increase and or decrease in shear strength which result in a reduction of the factor of safety of the slope and in the worst case can cause a once stable slope to fail due to the lack of shear resistance budhu 2011 das and sivakugan 2015 the factors that can cause an increase in the shear stress or a decrease in the shear strength of the cargo are summarized in table 2 below during marine transportation an iof cargo will be subject to cyclic loading as induced by the ship motions kim et al 2007 explained further in sections 3 and 6 1 following similar conditions that lead to liquefaction the iof cargo can sustain a build up of pore air and water pressure due to the inability to dissipate seed et al 1976 the pore pressure accumulates over time due to varying cyclic loading magnitudes and cycle durations eseller bayat et al 2013a 2013b leading to volumetric compression strains that keep pore air and water compressed between the voids in soil particles byrne 1991 as pore pressure accumulates the effective stress will reduce and similarly so will the shear strength abramson et al 2002 budhu 2011 duncan et al 2014 jia 2018 over the length of a bulk carrier s journey with such a reduction in shear strength a cargo of iof can become susceptible to slope failure iof cargoes will begin with an initial factor of safety against slope failure of more than 1 but the recommended factor of safety is typically more than 1 5 as generally accepted in geotechnical applications das and sivakugan 2015 from the beginning of the journey the cyclic loading can lead to a build up of pore pressure or may first require a change in the soil particle structure due to the unsaturated nature of iof blight 2013 di prisco and wood 2012 as soon as the pore pressure begins to accumulate and effective stress begins to reduce the shear strength and hence the factor of safety against slope failure may begin to reduce islam and gnanendran 2013 factors such as suffusion and soil structure rearrangement due to consolidation or deformation which can lead to changes to the properties of iof such as the soil gradation and relative density could have the potential to create comparatively weak and strong zones at different locations in the iof mass mitchell and solymar 1984 xiao and shwiyhat 2012 consolidation or deformation of the iof mass will typically create a time dependent increase in the shear strength as the mass densifies mitchell and solymar 1984 however some deformations can rapidly loosen the material and trigger flow slides particularly in the presence of an undrained material that is subjected to moisture migration wang and sassa 2003 in comparing with deformations suffusion can instead leave one zone with a higher shear strength and reduce that of another zone due to the migration of soil and water particles under the applied cyclic loading ke and takahashi 2014 suffusion results in an accumulation of the finer particles that have been carried by the water chang et al 2014 which in the iof mass would be towards the top surface as clearly seen with the large amounts of surface water shown in fig 13 the accumulation of fine particles at the surface along with the free surface water effect which is discussed further in section 6 3 can create a very weak top layer that is more susceptible to slope failure than under the initial conditions this is in part due to the high percentage of fine grained material that lacks shear strength and to the saturated nature that allows excess pore water pressure to build up both of which fuel the potential for slope failure terzaghi et al 1996 although suffusion can cause a weak top layer it can result in a stronger bottom layer as the voids left during suffusion allow larger particles to rearrange more tightly during settlement indraratna et al 2011 wan and fell 2008 the reduced moisture content in this zone also reduces the potential for pore water pressure build up many concerns for liquefaction and even recently described cargo liquefaction incidents involving iof could instead be focused on the potential for slope failure before excess pore pressure can reach the critical value that will see liquefaction failure occur it is possible that slope failure will first be the critical failure mode due to the reduction in shear strength if the shear strength was to be reduced below that of the applied shear stress slope failure would ensue in fact at an earlier stage than what would be expected for liquefaction in some instances the large heels experienced during rough sea conditions would exacerbate the potential for slope failure as was the case for the vessel alam manis which was struck by several large waves before listing hancock 2015 world maritime news 2015b liquefaction is more likely to be the cause of failure when excess pore pressure accumulates rapidly such that slope failure is consequently bypassed alarcon guzman et al 1988 there is also the potential for slope failure at a certain stage in the journey and liquefaction failure at a later stage or liquefaction may even be triggered as a result of a slope failure 6 3 cargo sloshing other than the typical forms of failure in soil mechanics namely slope and liquefaction failures a more exclusive cargo shift mechanism termed cargo sloshing has the potential to cause ship instability it is not uncommon to observe saturated layers either at the base or on the top of iof cargoes due to suffusion and as seen in fig 13 a free surface layer of water can develop this free surface layer of water which can contain various quantities of suspended fine soil particles is free to slosh around in the cargo hold as the ship oscillates and can create a slurry at the top of the cargo mass similar to that of a liquefied soil zhang et al 2017 the slurry can be formed through erosion where the sloshing motion of the free surface water dislodges the soil particles at the surface and destabilizes a portion of the top layer morgan 2009 the cause of the moisture and high percentage of fines that tends to accumulate on the top surface of mineral cargoes including that of iof is attributed to suffusion from other parts of the mass munro and mohajerani 2017b suffusion has been discussed in both sections 6 1 and 6 2 but specifically for cargo sloshing involves the migration of soil and water particles to the top surface through internal erosion processes due to the applied cyclic load caused by ship motions chang et al 2014 dallo et al 2013 the suffusion that proceeds in mineral cargoes during marine transportation is similar to the process of segregation that occurs in wet concrete and other granular materials where moisture and lightweight particles accumulate at the surface during vibration procedures ahmad and smalley 1973 safawi et al 2004 the resultant change to the soil phase relation after suffusion at a certain location in the mass illustrated in fig 14 and fig 15 is a typical loss of water and fine grained particles to another location in the mass ke and takahashi 2014 fig 14 shows the change in soil phase relation at a location where particles migrate away from which is typically towards the base of the mineral cargo mass fig 15 shows the change in soil phase relation at a location where particles from elsewhere in the mass tend to migrate to typically towards the surface this figure also shows that after suffusion a location such as the top surface can become fully saturated and filled with a larger percentage of fines what is not shown however is that the top surface can exceed full saturation at which point a free surface of water begins accumulating on top of the mineral cargo mass the accumulated surface water as previously mentioned can erode the top surface of a mineral cargo mass such as iof and create a suspended slurry which zhang et al 2017 described as acting like a liquefied soil as such a certain portion of the top layer of the iof mass will begin acting like a liquid sloshing from side to side in the hold munro and mohajerani 2016b as a slurry at the surface is likely to be less viscous during cargo sloshing than a portion of cargo would be during liquefaction due to the greater moisture content the wave height of the sloshing fluid and the impact on the sidewalls would be greater assuming the same volume zou et al 2018 since bulk carriers are not designed to accommodate liquid cargo motions the side to side sloshing can eventually cause a vessel to list beyond a point that is naturally recoverable jonas 2010a or may lead to structural overstressing resulting in failure this may require a particular volume of slurry to accumulate or a number of sloshing cycles before the vessel is destabilized or the stresses are large enough to cause structural failure after the initial list is developed and retained the slurry will have accumulated on one side of the vessel and as a result further cargo sloshing will be minimal it is hence unlikely that cargo sloshing alone can cause a vessel to capsize instead the likely saturation and change in particle size distribution of the top layer of the iof cargo as a result of suffusion will increase the risk of slope and liquefaction failure modes these modes of failure are more likely to have a detrimental effect on vessel stability thereby resulting in the vessel capsizing 7 discussion the review conducted generally examined each potential cargo shift mechanism that could lead to a vessel listing or capsizing the review into liquefaction considered the liquefaction potential of an unsaturated iof cargo for liquefaction to occur an increase in excess pore air and water pressure is required it was determined that for this build up in pore pressure a change in the void ratio would be required before the unsaturated mass could come to a state where the pore air and water would begin carrying the stresses recent studies that have been conducted involving the cyclic triaxial testing of granular materials have shown that a sandy soil of low initial relative density could liquefy for a degree of saturation as low as 50 as the initial relative density was increased the degree of saturation for which liquefaction was observed increased another procedure that was examined was the change in moisture distribution in the mass with moisture migrating from one location to another which has been observed during marine voyages there is the potential for a certain portion of the iof mass to become fully saturated for this portion of the mass and under the cyclic loading applied by ship motions pore water pressure could begin building up and the effective stress would reduce following the theory of any normal fully saturated soil the permeability of the iof may also need to reduce in this location before the pore water would be unable to dissipate suffusion was determined to be a possible factor in both increasing the degree of saturation and reducing the permeability this is due to the finer grained particles and the water particles being transported typically towards the surface and creating a weak top layer as the top layer becomes saturated and the permeability reduces due to finer grained particles blocking and creating smaller voids the layer can become highly susceptible to liquefaction in some instances not only does the increase in the excess pore pressure lead to liquefaction occurring when the shear strength is reduced to zero but it can reduce the shear strength to a value where an applied shear stress can cause a slope type failure in this scenario it is proposed that in some cases shear resistance would not be able to be reduced rapidly enough to cause liquefaction before a slope type failure occurred with an applied cyclic shear excess pore air and water pressure may build up and reduce the shear strength although not reaching the extent to cause liquefaction however this residual shear strength as a result of the excess pore pressure could reduce the factor of safety against a slope type failure it was also discussed that a similar suffusion effect as explained prior could create a weak top layer made up of finer grained particles and of a typically fully saturated nature the weak top layer in itself would have a lower shear strength than the initial mass of iof and the lower portion where water and fine particles had migrated from would likely have become very strong the initial factor of safety against slope type failure could be compromised with the changes in the iof mass with the unexpected weak layer unable to resist the applied shear stresses a further cargo shift mechanism termed cargo sloshing in this study was explored for its potential to develop and cause vessel instability once again with the effects of suffusion the top surface of the iof can become saturated to the point where a free surface of water develops the finer soil particles that also migrate to the surface during suffusion are likely to cause a weak top layer as the free surface water sloshes around on the surface it can cause erosion of the underlying iof dislodging the soil particles and creating a suspended slurry over time this condition can worsen and the mass of the suspended slurry can increase this slurry as it sloshes side to side in the cargo hold would impact against the sides of the vessel and exacerbate the vessel s motion this would seemingly increase the rotation about the vessel axis with each cycle of rolling and pitching and could eventually reach the point where a list is developed it was recognised that although the cargo sloshing could cause vessel instability it is unlikely that it can directly cause capsizing in fact the cargo sloshing would subside once the initial list is developed upon the initial list developing the angle of repose could cause the slope of the iof cargo to become unstable this would lead to further cargo accumulating on one side of the ship thereby worsening the list and possibly causing complete capsizing the changes in iof cargoes is equally matched by the variations observed in the material properties between the iof mined in differing locations the study uncovered a significant variation in the physical properties of iof not only by country but by mine the physical properties of iof from various mines in australia were seen to differ between significantly large ranges one property observed to change in most cases was the particle size distribution which is known to be a highly important factor that affects the liquefaction potential of soils for such variations in the material properties of iof emphasis was put on the inability to predict the behaviour of all iof cargoes it was also noted that not only do these variations put some iof cargoes at a greater risk of liquefying but they may also mean that some cargoes are in fact not liquefiable this would render the classification of all iof cargoes as obsolete as some cargoes could behave similar to a group c cargo as outlined in the imsbc code 7 1 discussion on potential solutions moisture content plays a direct role in the ability of an iof cargo to liquefy limiting the moisture content to a level that would see the probability of liquefaction become almost completely negligible for example to a 50 degree of saturation or lower is the ideal solution however it is not a practical solution when considering the ability of industrial measures to reduce and maintain the moisture content it would be extremely costly and time consuming to attempt to reduce an iof cargo to such low levels of degree of saturation it would also be difficult to prevent the ingress of moisture which would see an increase in the degree of saturation with iof stockpiles in many asian countries being exposed to monsoonal rains and these weather events wreaking havoc during loading and stowage of the cargoes controlling and assuring the moisture content during the various stages of transportation would be impractical as such the implementation of other measures particularly by physical means should become the focus of the studies to find the best practice solution with this being said and with the key issues that have been discussed in section 6 for the various modes of geotechnical failure some possible solutions to prevent cargo shift have been included below a brief description of the main concepts has also been included however this is only to introduce the background theory and is not intended to explain the finer details of the ideas 7 1 1 vertical layering of geomembrane sheets suffusion can lead to the transportation of water and fine iof particles which typically occurs towards the surface as discussed in section 6 this can result in elevated levels of the degree of saturation and alter the particle size distribution at localized positions in the cargo with an increase in the degree of saturation and a higher percentage of fine grained particles the mass becomes more susceptible to various geotechnical failures including slope type failures and liquefaction thus one solution is to prevent the migration of water and iof particles that can lead to the dangerous physical alterations of the iof cargo such prevention can help control the cargo behaviour during marine transportation and eliminate the likelihood of the cargo developing the required characteristics that will see a liquefaction or slope type failure occur one method that could be implemented to achieve this is the inclusion of layers of geomembrane sheets the geomembrane sheets could be placed at appropriate vertical intervals so as to effectively separate the cargo into layers acting as a barrier to control the migration of the water and iof particles restricting moisture migration could keep the degree of saturation to tolerable levels in each layer effectively preventing the build up of pore pressure and hence the development of liquefaction the fine iof particles that are normally carried during moisture migration will also be trapped by the geomembrane which could help control the particle size distribution and eliminate the development of weak fine grained layers that are susceptible to both slope type failures and liquefaction the surface water observed in many iof cargoes is unlikely to be seen if geomembrane sheets were to be installed highlighting the obvious impact that this method would have in preventing the physical alterations that can lead to the increased probability of geotechnical failures that cause cargo shift the geomembrane sheets that would be located at the regular vertical intervals could be attached to built in roller systems thus allowing the effective placement and removal that is needed to ensure efficient shipping operations geomembrane sheets can be re used and can be easily adapted into the placement and extraction procedures one concern in using this method is that particular layers may still liquefy but with this being kept to the scale of an individual layer it would have less impact on vessel stability than what a normal large liquefied portion of the whole cargo would have a conceptual sketch of the arrangement of geomembrane sheets has been provided in fig 16 the cargo dimensions shown are for a typical capesize vessel many types of geomembrane exist with the likes of plasticized poly vinyl chloride pvc p and high density polyethylene hdpe geomembranes becoming a popular method in civil engineering due to being financially attractive shukla and yin 2014 geomembranes are typically used to separate materials that should not be allowed to mix as a reinforcement and as a fluid tight separation membrane between fluids in a reservoir and in the subsoil see fig 17 or to prevent seepage through soils van santvoort 1994 geomembranes are generally thin and flexible having low permeability such that the flow of a fluid is restricted and limited to the characteristic leakage of the individual geomembrane giroud and bonaparte 1989 the particle sizes that permeate through geomembranes depend on the design but for a geomembrane designed to prevent the flow of water finer soil particles would not be able to penetrate through the barrier ingold 2013 as such the vertical layering of geomembranes in an iof cargo would prevent the migration of water to almost negligible levels and could completely restrict the migration of the fine iof particles 7 1 2 regularly spaced vertical wick drains the aforementioned suffusion effects and the consequential outcomes could also be avoided through the installation of vertical wick drains at regularly spaced intervals the wick drains would provide drainage paths intercepting the water that would normally be migrating to other locations in the mass this method similar to the application of geomembrane sheets would help control the localized degree of saturation via the removal of the migrating water at the same time the fine iof particles that are carried during suffusion would no longer accumulate at a single location such as the surface as much of the normal migration towards the surface would now be a short distance towards the wick drains the water that is removed can also help reduce the overall moisture content of the cargo with the cyclic ship motions likely to provide an environment that will allow the wick drains to operate more effectively than under static conditions another major concern is the development of excess pore pressures in the iof cargo with this leading to reduced shear strength and a potential liquefaction failure as excess pore pressure develops the vertical wick drains would provide a means of dissipation hence preventing strength reduction and liquefaction a potential downfall is that the addition of vertical wick drains could make extraction of the iof troublesome with the wick drains being closely spaced it may be difficult to manoeuvre machinery around the wick drains and lead to longer extraction times the space needed for the machinery to operate could also limit the allowable spacing of wick drains such that the wick drains would not operate effectively enough to satisfactorily prevent geotechnical failures that lead to cargo shift investigations need to be conducted to determine not only if this solution can work but if the wick drains could be spaced far enough apart that typical shipping operations are not greatly affected a conceptual sketch of the arrangement of vertical wick drains has been provided in fig 18 the cargo dimensions shown are for a typical capesize vessel vertical wick drains also known as prefabricated vertical drains pvds are typically made up of a plastic drainage channel that is wrapped in a geotextile with the geotextile allowing the water to pass through but preventing soil particles entering and clogging up the drain santi et al 2001 vertical wick drains have served multiple civil engineering purposes with the main focus being to improve ground conditions a specific form of ground improvement that vertical wick drains have been used for is liquefaction mitigation during earthquakes the vertical wick drains provide a considerably shorter drainage path for pore water and during earthquakes will provide a relief of the excess pore water pressure such that strength reduction and liquefaction are prevented mitchell 2008 the application of vertical wick drains also allows for accelerated consolidation which results in densification indraratna et al 2012 densification alone can increase the shear strength of granular materials and also reduce the liquefaction potential mitchell and solymar 1984 in applying this to an iof cargo the vertical wick drains would allow for the dissipation of excess pore pressure hence preventing both strength reduction and liquefaction from occurring the iof could also undergo accelerated densification to provide further geotechnical benefits engineered solutions such as these are not exclusive to iof indeed they could be applied when carrying other bulk mineral cargoes such as nickel ore or bauxite this would suggest that many bulk carriers can be fitted with the necessary equipment and be used for all operations it would also fast track the investigative procedures that need to be undertaken to find the appropriate solutions and allow for implementation in the near future a change to bulk mineral transportation that would improve the safety and efficiency whilst not causing significant impact to travel times would surely be welcomed by the shipping industry 8 conclusion the objective of this study was to explore the behaviour of iof cargoes during marine transportation an array of different soil mechanics theories can be applied to a bulk mineral cargo such as iof each giving rise to potential failure mechanisms that need to be carefully considered when carrying such a cargo the nature of marine transportation can directly alter the physical properties of the cargo and affect the potential for geotechnical failures such as liquefaction and slope type failure it is important to assess not only the initial potential for these geotechnical failures but the potential as the properties of the iof are altered during a marine voyage right up until the point of potential failure the failures lead to the cargo shifting which in most cases is detrimental to the vessel s stability with an investigation into the recent marine accidents that have involved cargo shift brief case studies for each incident were prepared as seen in appendix a various sources were used including transport accident reports filed by transport safety bureaus marine accident logs and media reports these brief case studies are intended to investigate the potential failure modes that lead to the cargo shift and to reproduce the moments in the build up to the vessels listing or capsizing also seen from these marine accidents is that the trend of iof related incidents has not declined even with the implementation of the group a cargo classification in the imsbc code this classification was intended to prevent further iof related accidents through controlling the ability of the cargo to shift however the accident trend since its inception in 2011 has continued at the same rate proving a challenge for the bulk mineral cargo industry the stark observation is that between 1988 and 2017 twenty nine people have lost their lives in nine separate iof related accidents it has become evident that the iof properties are changing during marine transportation from the beginning of the marine voyage ship motions are causing an alteration in the iof properties with time after a certain period of time has passed localized portions of the iof mass are becoming largely variant in comparison to the initial loading conditions with suffusion leading to the migration of water and finer grained soil particles which are being transported typically towards the surface a potentially weak fully saturated layer is being created this portion of the mass can become susceptible to liquefaction and slope type failures but as discussed throughout this study the free surface water can also erode the top surface of the cargo and lead to cargo sloshing prior to this review the impact of cargo sloshing has not been investigated nor has the development of a cargo slurry at the surface been recognised it is recommended that cargo sloshing be examined as a potential cargo shift mechanism one of which may cause vessel instability it has been recognised in this study that cargo sloshing may not be able to cause capsizing but certainly has the potential to cause some degree of vessel instability with an increase in excess pore pressure a review was completed to determine whether the residual shear strength could in fact cause a slope type failure before a state of liquefaction was achieved as the excess pore pressure reduces the effective stress a consequential reduction in shear strength to near zero can lead to liquefaction occurring however if the shear strength is not reduced to zero rapidly enough there is potential that a slope type failure would ensue before liquefaction the nature of marine transportation or more importantly the ship motion induced stresses apply relatively low stress amplitudes that vary with sea conditions unlike earthquake or blast induced stresses the wave motions tend to create more drawn out cycles of loading the resulting pore pressure build up would therefore occur much slower than what would be expected during an earthquake giving rise to the potential for a slope type failure rather than liquefaction it should also be mentioned that with the changes in iof properties discussed in this review that similar bulk mineral cargoes can undergo the same processes with other mineral cargoes such as bauxite being classed as group c cargoes there is potential that the same adverse effects described in this study can cause the cargoes to exhibit behaviours similar to that of a group a cargo 8 1 recommendations concluding this review of the literature it is recommended that laboratory tests be conducted to observe the changes that occur within the iof this is best conducted through appropriate scale models that can replicate the stowage environment and shipping motions in particular it is recommended that the change in particle size distribution moisture content and pore air and water pressure be observed at localized positions in the mass the affect these changes have on the potential for geotechnical failures such as liquefaction and slope type failures should be critically analysed a review should also be conducted to determine if a slope type failure will occur before a liquefaction state can be reached as the material properties of iof vary by mined location a study should be conducted to observe the various material properties for the differing iof this could provide a better understanding of the factors that influence the potential for each geotechnical failure and could also uncover further classifications that would put certain iof cargoes in a non liquefiable range furthermore an investigation into the development of cargo sloshing and its impact on ship stability could help determine whether this is a potential cargo shift mechanism that needs addressing with classification alone unlikely to be able to prevent a geotechnical failure that leads to cargo shift more focus should be placed on finding an engineered solution that can reduce such risks potential solutions have been included in the discussion in section 7 1 appendix a table a1 bulk carrier incidents from 1988 to 2017 involving suspected cargo shift table a1 incident number

were described as rough with the vessel rolling and pitching heavily in the south easterly swell it was later found that the cargo was loaded with excessive moisture content due to the availability of

with all 23 crewmen rescued on 20 may 2005 about 49 h after the initial listing the ship finally sank the probable cause of the listing was thought to be liquefaction of the fluorspar cargo the moisture content of the cargo was tested to be 9 8 higher than the company s cargo safety manual for loading bulk cargo that may liquefy which stipulated 8 moisture limit however this was not certified it is also likely that further ingress of rain water during unloading of other cargoes caused the fluorspar to reach a higher level of moisture content the hong kong special administrative

cargo capsized on 30 august 2009 crew were stuck on the ship for 5 h before all were rescued safely conflicting reports suggest two possible scenarios led to the ship capsizing the first was suggested by crew who claimed a leak had developed in the engine compartment leading to the ship taking on water and becoming unstable another suggested by experts claims that the iron ore fines liquefied during the poor weather conditions resulting in the cargo shifting in the hold and causing the ship to become unstable the two scenarios are variably different and the true series of events is unclear the incident occurred during the monsoon season where sea conditions and winds were described as rough these conditions could have potentially caused cargo shift although it is widely known that cargo shift can occur under light winds and seas as the probable cause is unclear and crew and expert opinions clash this incident should not be regarded as an accident caused by cargo shift fairplay 2010

on board his body recovered several days later the captain of the ship objected to having the iron ore fines cargo loaded as it was brought to his attention that the cargo contained excess moisture content his objection was turned down by the vessel s agent sea trans private limited and the cargo was loaded anyway it was later discovered that the captain forged insurance papers to anchor in paradip port and transport the iron ore fines to china the listing was believed to be caused by liquefaction of the iron ore fines cargo although a hole had opened up in the ships body potentially caused by overstressing if the hole had recently opened up it may have been caused by cargo shift resulting in overstressing but is likely to be completely unrelated whether the hole already existed

corrective action failed and the list worsened to 10 within 10 min of first developing a list the ship had capsized 13 of the crewmen lost their lives the ship had encountered bad weather with

cargo capsized on 21 november 2011 15 crewmen were saved whilst 6 others lost their lives the cause of the capsizing is relatively unclear but it is known the ship was battered with high waves and strong winds it was expected that liquefaction of the cargo played a role in the capsizing but some reports suggest mechanical failure and the rough sea conditions were the factors leading to the ship sinking it is unlikely that rough sea conditions alone would cause the ship to capsize and it could be reasonably predicted that the cargo shifted in the hold under these conditions as a result it is

that the sinking occurred very quickly and that capsizing of the vessel occurred within 2 h of first listing the weather conditions were bad with strong winds and rough seas likely to have caused

listing further deteriorated to more than 90 in less than 2 h and eventually caused the vessel to capsize all crew managed to evacuate the vessel prior to sinking investigation into the incident revealed the nickel ore cargo was loaded with moisture content exceeding the tml and that safety shipboard procedures for loading and carriage of nickel ore were not followed furthermore liquefaction of the cargo had occurred in all of the cargo holds whilst the vessel experienced rolling at anchorage and sliding of the cargo would have occurred when a strong wave battered the ship this was further exacerbated by the approaching severe typhoon utor which hit the vessel with strong winds and waves as a result of poor sheltering choice the crew also mistakenly pumped water into the wrong ballast tank when trying to correct the list causing further instability of the ship the overall outcome of the investigation showed that highly inadequate handling procedures and overall ship management was conducted an example of this was only one inspection of the cargo being carried out prior to anchoring with condition of the cargo unknown to the crew during anchoring and leading up to

the ship during the rough sea conditions was the likely cause of the cargo shift which eventuated in the ship developing a list and finally capsizing the material properties of the iron ore fines cargo in particular the moisture content were not reported and it is unknown whether excessive moisture content played a part in the cargo shift guptal 2013 21 anna bo nickel ore 4 12 2013 off east coast of luzon philippines 0 the bulk carrier anna bo developed a list due to liquefaction of the nickel ore cargo after inspecting the cargo it was established that it was unsafe to continue the voyage or even be towed to destination as a result the ship sought shelter in lamon bay where the cargo was slowly loaded off and onto barges before the ship could be safely towed to destination the ship did not capsize and no lives were lost details surrounding why the liquefaction occurred are unknown including whether the cargo had excessive moisture content or whether poor weather conditions were encountered voytenko 2013 five oceans salvage 2013 22 bulk jupiter bauxite 2 01 2015 150 nautical miles off the coast of vung tau vietnam 18 bulk jupiter a bulk carrier carrying bauxite cargo capsized off the coast of vung tau vietnam on 2 january 2015 18 crewmen lost their lives whilst the sole survivor the chief cook managed to jump overboard and survived in a statement made by the chief cook the vessel developed a heavy list to starboard in a matter of minutes and shortly after it began sinking the marine safety investigation into the loss of the bulk jupiter uncovered evidence to suggest liquefaction of the cargo led to loss of ship stability although classified as a group c cargo cargoes that do not liquefy or possess a chemical hazard under the imsbc code in some circumstances bauxite has exhibited liquefaction characteristics similar to group a cargoes in a statement made by the britannia p i and the norwegian hull club to its members extremely heavy monsoon rains had affected stockpiles of bauxite including those in kuantan where the cargo was loaded this had made the stockpiles very wet and could have meant the bauxite cargo was subject to a high moisture content this high moisture content would see the bauxite act more like a group a cargo and would be the most likely cause of the liquefaction sea and weather conditions at the time of the incident have not been reported but it can be reasonably assumed that they were not poor hand 2015 world maritime news 2015a 23 alam manis nickel ore 15 07 2015 1 nautical mile off santa lucia near candon city luzon philippines 1 on 17 july 2015 the bulk carrier alam manis suffered cargo shift of her nickel ore cargo in holds number 1 and 2 after being struck by several large waves the cargo shift caused the vessel to list at 14 to starboard the crew of 21 were evacuated safely onto a tug but 1 man later died from a heart attack possibly caused by stress the vessel was blown ashore and grounded it is likely the cargo shift was due to slope failure and not liquefaction as the large waves would have caused a significant heel and shear force such that the slope became unstable the bulk carrier was not lost but was damaged in the incident due to the man passing away from a heart attack after the event had occurred this death should not be attributed to the cargo shift incident hancock 2015 world maritime news 2015b 24 bao jiang 88 iron ore fines 1 03 2016 2 nautical miles off shanghai s yangshan port china 0 bulk carrier bao jiang 88 was carrying iron ore fines cargo when it suffered cargo shift on 1 march 2016 it quickly developed a list and all 12 crew were forced to evacuate onto a life raft the vessel capsized minutes after but all crew managed to escape unharmed the cause of the cargo shift was reportedly due to improper trimming of the cargo which led to slope failure hancock 2016 world maritime news 2016 25 stellar daisy iron ore fines 31 03 2017 2000 nautical miles off montevideo uruguay 22 on 31 march 2017 the bulk carrier stellar daisy capsized killing 22 seafarers the vessel was carrying iron ore fines cargo one of the crew aboard the ship sent a text message to the shipping company stating the vessel was taking on water and listing rapidly it was also reported by one of the survivors that the hull had cracked before the ship went down one survivor also insisted that the cargo was normal before the ship sunk the incident as it occurred so rapidly was believed to have been caused by liquefaction of the cargo experts suggested that the cargo shifted in the hold and ultimately led to the ship s instability however evidence provided by survivors and the text received prior to sinking creates conflicting scenarios there is a possibility that the cargo liquefaction caused the cargo to slosh in the hold creating large dynamic forces on the hull of the ship and possibly overstressing the steel this may have resulted in the hull cracking and explain why the ship was taking on water as a result of the conflicting factors that led to the sinking of stellar daisy this incident should be investigated further to determine the true cause until then this incident may be disregarded as one related to cargo shift maritime executive 2017 hancock 2017 26 emerald star nickel ore 13 10 2017 east of luzon strait philippine sea 11 early on the morning of 13 october 2017 bulk carrier emerald star capsized and sank in the philippine sea killing 11 crewmen the vessel was carrying nickel ore cargo the ship sent out a distress signal due to rough weather brought by a typhoon in the area an incident report has yet to be released but it is believed that cargo liquefaction caused a shift in the cargo resulting in the ship listing and eventually capsizing this can be supported by the nature of the capsizing which occurred within minutes with many similar nickel ore liquefaction related incidents having happened rapidly it is likely that the onset of liquefaction occurred due to the rough sea conditions that were encountered as a result of a nearby typhoon further developments in this story can help define the clear cause of the capsizing of the bulk carrier emerald star maritime injury center 2017 voytenko 2017 world maritime news 2017 appendix b table b1 material properties of different types of iron ore fines

22784,the application of an unsteady viscous flow around a bluff body has covered a wide range of scientific fields this paper reviews the wakes of different cross sectional bluff bodies including circular square triangular and rectangular cylinders the two most prominent parameters e g reynolds number and cylinder geometry that can significantly alter the wake are taken into account the dependence on the two parameters of strouhal number vorticity circulation and efflux angle of vortices in the wake of bluff bodies is investigated the detailed features of the wakes for different bluff body shapes at different reynolds are identified and summarized keywords vortex shedding frequency vorticity von kármán street wake bluff body 1 introduction the flow around a bluff body has many applications in engineering fields such as architecture air ventilation urban structures bridges transmission lines offshore structures marine cables mooring pipelines heat exchangers electronic chips road vehicles and many of them have received considerable attention parkinson 1989 blevins 1990 zdravkovich 1997 cheng and liu 2000 anagnostopoulos and bearman 1992 alam et al 2005 2007 2018 alam and sakamoto 2005 williamson and govardhan 2008 alam and kim 2009 sumner 2010 bearman 2011 gu et al 2012 zhao et al 2013a 2013b stringer et al 2014 taghinia et al 2015 yagmur et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zheng and alam 2017 wang et al 2018 zafar and alam 2018 in most of the cases vortex formation is responsible for the flow induced vibration fiv including vortex induced vibration viv wake induced vibration wiv galloping etc sarpkaya 1979 2004 bearman 1984 williamson and govardhan 2004 alam and meyer 2011 2013 alam and kim 2009 kim et al 2009a 2009b 2018 kim and alam 2015 qin et al 2017 2018 2019 bhatt and alam 2018 when vibration is generated the concerned structure receives energy from the flow in every oscillation cycle the parameters and phenomena defining the fundamental flow characteristics are stagnation separation shear layers vortex shedding circulation vortex pattern vortex formation length wake width shedding frequency etc the shedding frequency is normalized as strouhal number st f d u where f hz is the vortex shedding frequency d m is the diameter or length scale of the bluff body and u m s is the free stream velocity the flow past a bluff body and vortex shedding process have been extensively examined in the literature there are many new applications of bluff body flow such as harnessing hydropower from viv bernitsas and raghavan 2004 bernitsas and raghavan 2007 bernitsas et al 2008 2009 chang et al 2011 raghavan and bernitsas 2011 wu et al 2012 seyed aghazadeh and modarres sadeghi 2015 wu et al 2017 wiv violette et al 2007 derakhshandeh et al 2014a 2014b 2015 derakhshandeh 2015 or flutter derakhshandeh et al 2016 bernitsas and raghavn 2004 and bernitsas et al 2008 conducted water channel tests of an array of circular cylinders and found that the phase lag between the lift force and displacement of the downstream cylinder is strongly connected to the overall work output chang et al 2011 studied the effects on viv of re and surface roughness of a circular cylinder the roughness strip was varied from 20 to 64 measured from the nominal front stagnation point the strip changed the dynamic behaviour of the cylinder suppressing viv for reduced velocity u r 10 while induced galloping for u r 10 raghavan and bernitsas 2011a b found that re effect on viv is more significant than the mass and damping ratios the various applications have motivated us to conduct a critical review of the literature and perform additional investigations to examine the wake of various cross sectional bluff bodies in a wide range of reynolds number re ρ u d μ where ρ kg m3 and μ n s m2 represent the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid respectively though shapes of cylindrical structures vary depending on the applications the structures can be aerodynamically divided into three types based on their cross sectional shapes i continuous and finite curvature structures e g circular and elliptical cylinders where flow separation may oscillate and occur over a segment of the surface depending on the surface condition re etc ii sharp edged structures of an infinitely large curvature e g flat plates square and triangular cylinders where the flow separation point is fixed iii a combination of i and ii such as the d shape cylinder and square cylinders with rounded corners alam et al 2011 for type i the characteristics of the flow are highly dependent on the initial flow conditions re turbulent intensity ti surface roughness etc due to its non stationary nature of the flow separation for category ii however the effect of re is insignificant particularly at high re because the flow separation is fixed at the sharp edges bai and alam 2018 circular and square cylinders are generally chosen as the representative models of categories i and ii respectively because of their relative simplicity and also their most frequent occurrence in engineering a circular cylinder has however received more attention than a square cylinder numerous experimental and numerical investigations have been conducted for the flow over a circular cylinder in the past decades bishop and hasan 1964 roshko 1960 brika and laneville 1999 williamson 1996a b norberg 1987 2003 liaw 2005 kim and choi 2005 accompanied by a limited theoretical analysis result at re 50 the flow around a circular cylinder is laminar and steady with a pair of recirculation bubbles symmetrically generated behind the cylinder laminar vortex shedding occurs at 50 re 200 which results in a von karman vortex street of alternating opposite sign vortices with an increase in re in this regime the vortex formation length drops and the strouhal number increases the cylinder wake changes from two dimensional 2d to three dimensional 3d in a transition re 200 260 williamson 1996a b apart from circular cylinders square cylinders igarashi 1986 sohankar et al 1999 nakamura et al 2001 goldstein et al 1990 chen and liu 1999 alam et al 2002 saha et al 2003 galletti et al 2004 cheng et al 2007 mahir 2009 bai and alam 2018 and rectangular cylinders sheridan et al 1997 shimada and ishihara 1999 2002 mills et al 2003 bentley and mudd 2003 tan et al 2003 2004 liow et al 2006 shadaram et al 2008 have also received attention to some extent in the literature the time mean drag coefficient for a square cylinder is sensitive to re for re 103 while constant for re 103 sohankar 2006 bai and alam 2018 for the flow over a square cylinder at different attack angles yen and yang 2011 found that the strouhal number is dependent on the attack angle the minimum and maximum strouhal numbers occurring at 0 and 15 attack angles respectively the flow over a rectangular cylinder on the other hand behaves differently the cylinder aspect ratio width to thickness significantly influences the strouhal number nakamura et al 1991 ozono et al 1992 tan et al 2003 derakhshandeh and alam 2019 the strouhal number of a rectangular cylinder increases step by step with increasing aspect ratio however less consideration has been given to the flow over triangular cylinders camarri et al 2006 de and dalai 2006 iungo and buresti 2009 farhadi et al 2010 de and dalai 2006 modelled the flow over a triangular cylinder at 10 re 250 they found that when re is increased from 10 to 40 the drag coefficient decreases from 2 75 to 1 50 while st increases reaching a maximum of 0 2 at re 100 farhadi et al 2010 numerically studied the effects of wall and re on heat transfer and drag coefficient of a triangular cylinder when the triangular cylinder approached the wall the vortex shedding weakened and the drag coefficient and heat transfer both declined as discussed earlier a sharp edged cylinder behaves differently from a circular cylinder in terms of wake structure including shear layer interactions vortex formation length wake width strouhal number and heat transfer blevins 1990 de and dalai 2006 sohankar et al 1997 farhadi et al 2010 unlike that for circular cylinders the flow attack angle for sharp edged cylinders plays an important role bearman et al 1987 found that the vibration amplitude of a square cylinder is dependent on the angle of attack the experimental tests conducted by bearman et al 1987 revealed that the lift coefficient for a square cylinder is maximum at an attack angle of 13 depending on turbulence intensity parkinson 1971 concluded that the vibration amplitude in the viv regime is limited to less than 1d for a circular cylinder whereas the galloping vibration amplitude of a square cylinder can increase manyfold fig 1 shows the most classic geometries in a cross flow where the circular square triangular d shaped and rectangular cylinders have the same length scale d it is worth noting that there are only a few studies on the d shaped cylinder in the literature knauss et al 1976 ota et al 1984 hourigan et al 2001 therefore this geometry is not reviewed in details here in addition the most studied model is two dimensional achieved with the cylinder given a sufficiently longer aspect ratio ar l d 7 5 or using end plates where l is the spanwise length of the cylinder for small aspect ratios ar 7 5 the flow becomes three dimensional and the ar needs to be considered as an additional influential parameter along with other geometrical parameters thompson et al 2001 camarri et al 2006 ryan et al 2005 wissink and rodi 2008 the objective of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive review of the flow structure around and vortex dynamics in the wake of circular and sharp edged cylinders in a wide range of re the focus is on the dependence of the wake on re and bluff body shapes some new numerical measurements are also conducted to analyze the vorticity and circulation of vortices for the selected bodies 2 flow around a bluff body the complexity of vortex dynamics increases when the flow regime alters due to the variation in re in this study the emphasis is not to focus on and review all bluff bodies there is nevertheless an attempt to investigate the characteristics and dynamics of wake vortices existing over different fluidic conditions and flow regimes therefore for a wide range of re the effect of following key parameters on the wake of the bluff bodies is investigated i strouhal number ii bluff body cross section iii vorticity and iv circulation in vortices the flow around a circular cylinder has been classified into seven regimes based on visual observation of the flow structures and variation in st with re achenbach and heinecke 1981 this classification is presented in table 1 where the major difference prevailing in the cylinder wake in each flow regime is the transition occurring in the wake and shear layers depending on re as a consequence the transition affects lift and drag forces vortex size vorticity and separation point alam et al 2011 alam 2014 bai and alam 2018 apart from this classification zdravkovich 1997 subdivided the flow regime into more sub regimes highlighting the transition in the boundary and shear layers to gain a better understanding and an ease of reviewing the classification of achenbach and heinecke 1981 is sorted into three main categories group 1 re 300 group 2 300 re 1 4 105 group 3 re 1 4 105 as shown in table 1 there are three reasons for this categorization firstly at re 300 the flow is laminar st escalates with re fig 2 including a discontinuity at re 180 tritton 1959 gerich and eckelmann 1982 williamson 1989 zdravkovich 1996 secondly according to zdravkovich 1997 and norberg 2003 the fluctuating lift force coefficient c lf behaves differently between the three reynolds number ranges regimes following the transition in the shear and boundary layers fig 3 connected to circulation strength of the vortices the c lf plays an important role in generating fiv viv wiv or galloping and in energy conversion bernitsas and raghavn 2004 2008 2009 assi et al 2010 lee et al 2011 ding et al 2013 derakhshandeh et al 2014a 2016 bhatt and alam 2018 thirdly most of relevant investigations have been conducted in these three flow regimes this categorization thus facilitates a comparison of the wake at the three regimes the circulation г is a measure of vortex strength a greater г of vortices corresponds to an increased c lf caro 2012 and a higher amplitude of cylinder displacement providing a higher power coefficient for the viv wiv converters the г is estimated as 1 γ ω d s i 1 n ω i δ x i δ y i in eq 1 ω represents vorticity s 1 and ds m2 is the closed area the г is also linked to the base pressure c pb roshko 1954 the г during vortex shedding has been formulated by bearman and obasaju 1982 as 2 δ γ u d 1 c p b u f d 1 c p b 2 s t evidently г is inversely proportional to st the equation reflects that for bluff bodies with the same c pb d and u a greater г can be achieved by lowering st this behaviour can be managed for instance using a rectangular cylinder at which st alters as a function of c d cross sectional aspect ratio where c is the width of the cylinder further detail will be provided in section 3 2 in the next sections the flows around circular and sharp edged cylinders are compared at three re ranges defined in table 1 while sharp edged cylinders include triangular square and rectangular 3 the wake at laminar flow regime re 300 viscous laminar flows including creeping steady separated and periodic laminar wake flow regimes over different cylinders are paid attention in this section 3 1 circular cylinders at re 300 despite the fact that the circular cylinder is the simplest symmetrical shape without sharp edges the wake of a two dimensional circular cylinder is complex due to the interaction of the boundary layers shear layers and wake a three dimensional small ar cylinder adding an extra length scale to the flow makes the wake more complex williamson 1988 the wake of a circular cylinder therefore can be influenced by both fluidic and structural parameters such as re ar blockage ratio surface roughness and turbulence intensity all these parameters have significant influences on the shear layer and boundary layer transitions separation forces c pb and st mansy et al 1994 kim and choi 2005 bai and alam 2018 altering the kinetic energy of vortices in the wake wind tunnel tests conducted by szepessy and bearman 1992 showed that c lf of a circular cylinder is a function of re and ar for instance they at re 5 104 varied ar from 0 25 to 12 and found that c lf 0 8 at ar 1 decaying to 0 48 at ar 6 7 the degree of the ar influence was dependent on re forces and st are characterized by the parameters describing the vortex street such as vortex formation length and wake width in general a shorter formation length or wider wake width corresponds to a lower st and higher forces and vice versa younis et al 2017 a number of studies on the laminar flow over the chosen geometries have been undertaken e g koopmann 1967 norberg 1987 and thompson et al 1996 table 2 lists some selected experimental and numerical studies the strouhal number or the frequency of the shed vortices is one of the fluidic parameters which can excite the downstream cylinder assi 2009 qin et al 2018 2019 and can directly alter wake dynamics with a view to understanding the characteristics of the vortices in the wake the dependence of the shedding frequency on re viv or wiv needs to be addressed in order to highlight the effect of re on the shedding frequency a typical vortex formation in the wake of a circular cylinder is shown in fig 4 williamson 1996a b the cores of vortices are highlighted by the red spots in the figure and the variation of the red spots demonstrates the alteration of the frequency at different re different longitudinal distances between the cores of vortices this behaviour of vortex shedding was identified by strouhal in the 19th century strouhal 1878cited by zdravkovich 1996 fig 4 also shows that the transverse spacing and the length scale of the vortices are sensitive to re the transverse gap between the cores of negative and positive vortices is approximately regular at re 150 and 300 at 50 re 150 where vortices die out slowly downstream roshko 1954 developed a relationship between re and st as 3 st f d u 0 212 4 5 re later tritton 1959 experimentally demonstrated that this relationship is not suitable enough for velocity estimation through shedding frequency measurement a deviation of about 5 in the velocity frequency profiles was identified tritton therefore modified st re relationship as 4 st a re b c re here the values of constants a b and c are functions of re as shown in table 3 water channel tests performed by tritton 1959 also showed that the behaviour of the generated vortices in the wake of the cylinder at re 70 is always irregular in terms of frequency tritton 1959 similar studies conducted by kiya et al 1980 at 43 re 220 also confirmed that the vortex frequency varies in the wake region when re is close to 70 there is a sudden jump in oblique shedding angle θ which produces an irregular vortices and causes a decrease in the intensity of the velocity fluctuations which probably means the generated vortices in the wake of the cylinder are weaker williamson 1989 found that at re 64 the absolute value of the oblique shedding angle θ of vortices suddenly jumps from 10 to 20 fig 5 this occurs due to the alteration of the vortex shedding frequency in the wake of the cylinder although there is a slight disagreement in the literature about the existence of discontinuity of st at a specific re this scenario has been confirmed by many scholars fig 5 shows that θ at re 100 is highly sensitive to re so is the st 3 2 sharp edged cylinders at re 300 the flow past a non circular cylinder with sharp edges such as triangular square and rectangular cylinders has also received considerable attention in the literature a selected number of studies on the flow around triangular square and rectangular cylinders are presented in table 2 it is noted that the numerical modeling has recently been more popular as compared with the experimental tests nonetheless the laminar flow over the triangular cylinder has not received much attention as compared with that over square and rectangular cylinders galletti et al 2004 de and dalai 2006 kumar de and dalal 2007 srikanth et al 2010 farhadi et al 2010 zeitoun et al 2011 alam and zhou 2013 studies conducted on a triangular cylinder showed that st increases from 0 15 to 0 2 as re increases from 40 to 150 the variation being very similar to that for square and circular cylinders de and dalai 2006 further confirmed by zeitoun et al 2011 as shown in fig 6 for a triangular prism zeitoun et al 2011 empirically formulated the relationship between st and re as follows 5 st 0 2383 5 4026 re comparing eqs 3 and 5 demonstrates that though st varies in a similar fashion with re for both circular and triangular cylinders there is no report of discontinuity in st for triangular cylinder compare figs 2 and 6 laminar flows around circular and square cylinders have been compared by frank et al 1990 the results showed that at 40 re 300 a square cylinder behaves in a very similar way to a circular cylinder in terms of st however the separation points are fixed at the edges of a square but not for a circular cylinder while the separation point for a square cylinder is independent of re 150 that for a circular cylinder varies from 109 to 123 measured from the front stagnation point depending on re frank et al 1990 showed that the separation occurs at the trailing and leading edges of a square cylinder for re 150 and 150 respectively the vortex size becomes larger in the latter re range the change in the size affects the dynamics of the vortices in the wake and influences the imposing pressure and force on the cylinder surface these two features alter the circulation of vortices and consequently changes the kinetic energy of vortices an analysis of vorticity and circulation of vortices is helpful in gaining insight into the wake further two dimensional numerical simulations in laminar flow regime are therefore conducted to have a better understanding and comparison of the wake of circular and sharp edged cylinders where an identical dimension d was chosen for all cylinders the initial conditions and structured meshes were created similar to the previous studies conducted by the authors for the flow around a cylinder at re 200 alam 2016 alam et al 2018 the details of the numerical models and verification of the simulations are therefore not repeated here instantaneous vorticity contours presented in fig 7 show the alternate shedding of vortices as mentioned earlier vortex formation length and wake width are two key factors in defining wake size which are dependent on re for the triangular cylinder the separation occurs from the rear edge and the lateral separation between successive vortices widens with an efflux angle β s 10 19 for the chosen apex angle of 90 the β s is expected to be contingent on the apex angle evaluation of the vorticity in the wake of each bluff body can provide further insight into the wake the dimensionless vorticity in the wake is presented as a function of the downstream distance x d for circular square and triangular cylinders fig 8 the vorticity decays with x d regardless of the cylinder shape while vorticities of the circular and square cylinders are comparable to each other the triangular cylinder engenders much higher vorticity almost doubled at x d 2 compared to the circular or square cylinder higher vorticity in a specific area in the wake means a higher circulation of vortices note that more investigations are required in order to compare the effect of the apex angle on β s and vorticity in the case of a rectangular cylinder the dynamic behaviour of vortices becomes more complicated due to the effect of chord to thickness ratio c d on the flow which is an additional structural parameter further simulations are performed to analyze the effect of c d on vorticity and circulation of the vortices the c d is varied from 2 to 10 at re 200 the domain structured mesh and boundary conditions have been chosen based on the previous study derakhshandeh and alam 2018 2019 fig 9 shows the variation in s t c as a function of c d obtained from the power spectrum of the lift force acting on the cylinder numerical studies of the flow around a rectangular cylinder revealed that s t c is sensitive to c d and increases step by step with an increase in c d for a wide range of re covering laminar to subcritical flow okajima 1982 and stokes and welsh 1986 confirmed the same observation as in fig 9 later ohya et al 1992 identified that the stepwise increase in st is nearly equal to integral multiples of 0 6 the studies conducted by mills et al 2003 showed that st can be formulated as s t c 0 55n where n is an integer number representing the number of vortices crawling on the side surface of the cylinder figs 10 and 11 show the vorticity contours and vorticity magnitude respectively in the wakes of rectangular cylinders it is evident in fig 10 that the cores of the positive and negative vortices are located along the side surfaces of the cylinders and their lateral separation can therefore be widened by increasing the thickness of the cylinder as seen in fig 11 vorticity at a given x d decays with increasing c d the decay is however large between c d 4 and 6 and small at c d 6 10 on the other hand as expected vorticity decreases with x d the decrease is more prominent for c d 2 and 4 although c d 10 for instance corresponds to a maximum s t c a minimum vorticity is produced for this c d the maximum vorticity is generated at c d 2 therefore for a group of cylinders with a constant s t c fig 9 the smallest c d can generate higher vorticity hence stronger circulation 4 wake at subcritical regime 300 re 1 4 105 4 1 circular cylinders at 300 re 1 4 105 when re 300 the velocity fluctuation becomes more irregular and turbulence performs in the separated shear layers while there is still a predominant vortex shedding frequency in the wake of the circular cylinder ong and wallace 1996 ozgoren et al 2011 kiya et al 1980 the st is more or less constant around 0 2 kiya et al 1980 blevins 1990 liang and papadakis 2007 alam and zhou 2008 lin et al 1995 found that the base pressure coefficient reaches a local maximum at re 5000 and large scale vortices perform in the wake of the cylinder this causes an increment in streamwise velocity in the wake of the cylinder unal and rockwell 1987a and 1987b with a higher potential of integrated kinetic energy following the above studies the direct numerical simulation dns and large eddy simulation les conducted by ma et al 2000 confirmed the similar behaviour of the flow structure in the wake of the circular cylinder in the subcritical flow regime the generated vortices are three dimensional williamson 1996a therefore the circulation associated with a shed vortex can be decomposed into x and z components г x and г z respectively it is important noting that the x component is the recirculation at x section in the wake of the cylinder in addition the z component is the initial circulation which is discharged into the wake of the cylinder during a cycle of vortex formation the piv measurements of wu et al 1994 at re 525 showed that г x 0 39 m2 s much smaller than г z 3 5 m2 s this means that the circulation ratio is approximately г x г z 0 11 a similar observation is made from the experimental tests conducted by chyu and rockwell 1996 at re 5000 г x 0 26 m2 s and lin et al 1995 at re 10 000 г x 0 27 m2 s the observations suggest that г x approximately remains constant in the wake of a circular cylinder 4 2 sharp edged cylinders at 300 re 1 4 105 for a triangular cylinder experimental tests by iungo and buresti at re 1 2 105 revealed that st varies with apex angle and ar fig 12 shows the variation in st as a function of both ar and apex angle there is a growth in st from 0 11 to 0 19 with apex angle depending on ar this range of st can be increased up to 0 25 when the apex angle is increased to 90 strouhal number of a square cylinder is less than that of a circular cylinder varying between 0 127 and 0 16 depending on re sohankar et al 2000 tamura and kuwahara 1990 ozgoren 2006 huanga et al 2010 yen and yang 2011 hu et al 2015 bai and alam 2018 this reduction can be even seen for the square cylinders with wavy surfaces lam et al 2012 lin et al 2016 in addition a square cylinder can generate stronger circulation in the wake along with a smaller base pressure sohankar et al 2000 prior to this suzuki et al 1992 found that a blockage can increase the strouhal number up to 0 5 the instantaneous vorticity contours around circular square and triangular cylinders are shown in fig 13 at re 2000 similar to those in the laminar flow regime the cores of the negative and positive vortices are still located in a wider lateral distance for the wake of the triangular cylinder as compared with the square and circular cylinders the efflux angle β s is however smaller here 7 1 for the chosen apex angle 90 it is seen that an increase in re from 200 to 2000 leads to approximately 30 reduction in the efflux angle fig 14 shows vorticity decay with x d for the three cylinders at re 2000 similar to that in the laminar flow regime vorticity decreases with increasing x d for all three cylinders the difference in vorticities between the cylinders is maximum at x d 1 0 with vorticity being two times larger for the triangular cylinder than the circular lyn et al 1995 showed that г x peaks at a longer distance x d 5 8 and 5 9 in the square and rectangular cylinder wakes than in the circular cylinder wake x d 4 3 г z for a square cylinder was found to be 60 higher than that for the circular cylinder lyn et al 1995 this difference is ascribed to a smaller st and a larger size of vortices for the square cylinder compared with the circular cylinder counterparts lyn et al 1995 consequently the maximum of г x г z 0 41 for the square cylinder generated at x d 4 5 5 although fig 15 shows that г x г z slightly varies depending on x d the results show that the г x г z of the square cylinder is approximately four times higher than that reported for the circular cylinder at subcritical flow regime lin et al 1995 lyn et al 1995 showed that the maximum ratio is approximately г x г z 0 3 for a circular cylinder for a wide range of re a summary of selected studies on subcritical flow regime around a cylinder including circular triangular square and rectangular cylinders is shown in table 4 note that the chord to thickness ratio is defined only for the rectangular cylinder 5 wake at critical and supercritical flow regime re 1 4 105 this section compares the wake of the critical and supercritical regimes over circular and sharp edged cylinders some selected studies are shown in table 5 5 1 circular cylinder at very high re bearman 1969 studied the effect of re on st pressure drag and lift forces for a circular cylinder the mean drag coefficient was minimum at re 4 16 105 where st abruptly jumps to a higher value from 0 2 to 0 46 fig 16 power spectrum results showed that vortex shedding frequency covers a broader band at re 5 5 105 while becoming random at re 6 105 roshko 1960 cantwell and coles 1983 due to the discontinuity of st at re 4 16 105 and broad banded st at re 5 5 105 the frequency of vortices is not stable in the wake of the circular cylinder as is vortex dynamics compared with that in the subcritical flow regime the maximum circulation at re 1 4 105 occurs closer to the circular cylinder cantwell and coles 1983 fig 17 shows that the maximum г x г z 0 44 occurs at about x d 3 6 although г x г z decays with x d the maximum г x γ z in this re range is large for the circular cylinder the experimental tests of raghavan and bernitsas 2011a b on viv of a circular cylinder conducted at 2 104 re 6 10 6 groups 2 and 3 in table 1 showed that the vibration amplitude of the cylinder can be increased up to 1 9d even using higher mass ratio for the structure however the current study revealed that there is still a need to study the wiv energy at very high reynolds numbers in particular for non circular cylinder such as triangular cylinders in particular for the triangular the efflux angle of vortices in the wiv phenomenon would be added to the other flow features 5 2 sharp edged cylinders non circular cylinders at re 1 4 105 have received less attention in the literature as compared with the circular cylinders the studies on flow over non circular cylinders can be highlighted here such as nakagawa 1989 camarri et al 2006 triangular cylinder bearman 1965 durão et al 1988 lübcke et al 2001 square cylinder and mannini et al 2010 larose and d auteuil 2006 mannini et al 2011 schewe and larsen 1998 bruno et al 2010 rectangular cylinder it was believed that sharp edged cylinders are insensitive to re due to the fixed flow separation robertson et al 1975 nonetheless schewe and larsen 1998 showed that re has a strong influence on the separated shear layers as a consequence the dynamics of vortices in the wake of the cylinders is influenced by re for triangular prisms re does not influence the wake much but flow incidence angle ar and ti all do the streamwise velocity for a triangular cylinder with ar 0 5 was 20 larger than that with ar 0 9 camarri et al 2006 furthermore st for a triangular cylinder is approximately 0 15 at ar 1 5 reducing to 0 05 at ar 3 3 in particular for non circular cylinder such as a triangular cylinder the efflux angle of vortices in the wiv phenomenon will be added to the other flow features for a rectangular cylinder of c d 5 mannini et al 2011 showed that st is limited between 0 11 and 0 115 which is less than that of a circular cylinder despite the large number of investigations in the literature the wake of a rectangular cylinder needs further research including the dynamic responses of rectangular cylinders of different c d considering the wake dynamics and structural responses of different cross sectional geometries in three selected flow regimes as classified in table 1 the main features of each bluff body are summarized in table 6 apart from the above discussion it is worth noting that the interaction between the cylinder and flow is dependent the cross sectional geometry of the cylinder being a crucial issue in fluid structure interaction phenomena as galloping and or viv depends on the geometry in addition flow control methods and utilizing vortex energy in form of viv wiv galloping and flutter can be taken into account which needs further investigations in the future furthermore due to the lack of studies for triangular cylinders with different apex angle and d shaped cylinder the wake of these bluff bodies would be an additional interest area which might be considered for further investigations 6 conclusions this paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the wakes of the bluff bodies including circular triangular square and rectangular cylinders a wide range of reynolds number is taken into account comprising the laminar subcritical critical and supercritical flow regimes at laminar flow regime around a circular cylinder e g 1 re 300 a shift in the absolute value of oblique shedding angle comes into being particularly at re 64 70 strouhal number is not constant increasing nonlinearly a similar increase in strouhal number is observed for other sharp edged cylinders as well however there is no discontinuity in strouhal number variations for the sharp edged cylinders therefore continuously generated vortices in the wake of the triangular and square cylinders are an advantage and can facilitate the design of the converter as compared with a circular cylinder in addition among the sharp edged cylinders a triangular cylinder can generate stronger vortices among a group of rectangular cylinders with different c d it is found that a smaller c d can produce stronger circulation that is ascribed to the decreased strouhal number and increased magnitude of base pressure at subcritical flow regime 300 re 1 4 105 the maximum ratio of circulation is г x г z 0 41 for a square cylinder and г x г z 0 3 for a circular cylinder in a wide range of re on the other hand a triangular cylinder generates stronger vortices than a circular or square cylinder and can be considered as an efficient bluff body a drastic jump occurs in strouhal number at re 4 16 105 for a circular cylinder furthermore the maximum circulation occurs very close to the circular cylinder in the critical flow regime where the storuhal number again does not vary with re cantwell and coles 1983 apart from this discussion the method of flow control and utilizing vortex energy in form of viv wiv galloping and flutter can be taken into account for further investigations the detailed features of the wakes for different bluff

many applications in engineering fields such as architecture air ventilation urban structures bridges transmission lines offshore structures marine cables mooring pipelines heat exchangers electronic chips road vehicles and many of them have received considerable attention parkinson 1989 blevins 1990 zdravkovich 1997 cheng and liu 2000 anagnostopoulos and bearman 1992 alam et al 2005 2007 2018 alam and sakamoto 2005 williamson and govardhan 2008 alam and kim 2009 sumner 2010 bearman 2011 gu et al 2012 zhao et al 2013a 2013b stringer et al 2014 taghinia et al 2015 yagmur et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zheng and alam 2017 wang et al 2018 zafar and alam 2018 in most of the cases vortex formation is responsible for the flow induced vibration fiv including vortex induced vibration viv wake induced vibration wiv galloping etc sarpkaya 1979 2004 bearman 1984 williamson and govardhan 2004 alam and meyer 2011 2013 alam and kim 2009 kim et al 2009a 2009b 2018 kim and alam 2015 qin et al 2017 2018 2019 bhatt and alam 2018 when vibration is generated the concerned structure receives energy from the flow in every oscillation cycle the parameters and phenomena defining the fundamental flow characteristics are stagnation separation shear layers vortex shedding circulation vortex pattern vortex formation length wake width shedding frequency etc the shedding frequency is normalized as strouhal number st f d u where f hz is the vortex shedding frequency d m is the diameter or length scale of the bluff body and u m s is the free stream velocity the flow past a bluff body and vortex shedding process have been extensively examined in the literature there are many new applications of bluff body flow such as harnessing hydropower from viv bernitsas and raghavan 2004 bernitsas and raghavan 2007 bernitsas et al 2008 2009 chang et al 2011 raghavan and bernitsas 2011 wu et al 2012 seyed aghazadeh and modarres sadeghi 2015 wu et al 2017 wiv violette et al 2007 derakhshandeh et al 2014a 2014b 2015 derakhshandeh 2015 or flutter derakhshandeh et al 2016 bernitsas and raghavn 2004 and bernitsas et al 2008 conducted water channel tests of an array of circular cylinders and found that the phase lag between the lift force and displacement of the downstream cylinder is strongly connected to the overall work output chang et al 2011 studied the effects on viv of re and surface roughness of a circular cylinder the roughness strip was varied from 20 to 64 measured from the nominal front stagnation point the strip changed the dynamic behaviour of the cylinder suppressing viv for reduced velocity u r 10 while induced galloping for u r 10 raghavan and bernitsas 2011a b found that re effect on viv is more significant than the mass and damping ratios the various applications have motivated us to conduct a critical review of the literature and perform additional investigations to examine the wake of various cross sectional bluff bodies in a wide range of reynolds number re ρ u d μ where ρ kg m3 and μ n s m2 represent the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid respectively though shapes of cylindrical structures vary depending on the applications the structures can be aerodynamically divided into three types based on their cross sectional shapes i continuous and finite curvature structures e g circular and elliptical cylinders where flow separation may oscillate and occur over a segment of the surface depending on the surface condition re etc ii sharp edged structures of an infinitely large curvature e g flat plates square and triangular cylinders where the flow separation point is fixed iii a combination of i and ii such as the d shape cylinder and square cylinders with rounded corners alam et al 2011 for type i the characteristics of the flow are highly dependent on the initial flow conditions re turbulent intensity ti surface roughness etc due to its non stationary nature of the flow separation for category ii however the effect of re is insignificant particularly at high re because the flow separation is fixed at the sharp edges bai and alam 2018 circular and square cylinders are generally chosen as the representative models of categories i and ii respectively because of their relative simplicity and also their most frequent occurrence in engineering a circular cylinder has however received more attention than a square cylinder numerous experimental and numerical investigations have been conducted for the flow over a circular cylinder in the past decades bishop and hasan 1964 roshko 1960 brika and laneville 1999 williamson 1996a b norberg 1987 2003 liaw 2005 kim and choi 2005 accompanied by a limited theoretical analysis result at re 50 the flow around a circular cylinder is laminar and steady with a pair of recirculation bubbles symmetrically generated behind the cylinder laminar vortex shedding occurs at 50 re 200 which results in a von karman vortex street of alternating opposite sign vortices with an increase in re in this regime the vortex formation length drops and the strouhal number increases the cylinder wake changes from two dimensional 2d to three dimensional 3d in a transition re 200 260 williamson 1996a b apart from circular cylinders square cylinders igarashi 1986 sohankar et al 1999 nakamura et al 2001 goldstein et al 1990 chen and liu 1999 alam et al 2002 saha et al 2003 galletti et al 2004 cheng et al 2007 mahir 2009 bai and alam 2018 and rectangular cylinders sheridan et al 1997 shimada and ishihara 1999 2002 mills et al 2003 bentley and mudd 2003 tan et al 2003 2004 liow et al 2006 shadaram et al 2008 have also received attention to some extent in the literature the time mean drag coefficient for a square cylinder is sensitive to re for re 103 while constant for re 103 sohankar 2006 bai and alam 2018 for the flow over a square cylinder at different attack angles yen and yang 2011 found that the strouhal number is dependent on the attack angle the minimum and maximum strouhal numbers occurring at 0 and 15 attack angles respectively the flow over a rectangular cylinder on the other hand behaves differently the cylinder aspect ratio width to thickness significantly influences the strouhal number nakamura et al 1991 ozono et al 1992 tan et al 2003 derakhshandeh and alam 2019 the strouhal number of a rectangular cylinder increases step by step with increasing aspect ratio however less consideration has been given to the flow over triangular cylinders camarri et al 2006 de and dalai 2006 iungo and buresti 2009 farhadi et al 2010 de and dalai 2006 modelled the flow over a triangular cylinder at 10 re 250 they found that when re is increased from 10 to 40 the drag coefficient decreases from 2 75 to 1 50 while st increases reaching a maximum of 0 2 at re 100 farhadi et al 2010 numerically studied the effects of wall and re on heat transfer and drag coefficient of a triangular cylinder when the triangular cylinder approached the wall the vortex shedding weakened and the drag coefficient and heat transfer both declined as discussed earlier a sharp edged cylinder behaves differently from a circular cylinder in terms of wake structure including shear layer interactions vortex formation length wake width strouhal number and heat transfer blevins 1990 de and dalai 2006 sohankar et al 1997 farhadi et al 2010 unlike that for circular cylinders the flow attack angle for sharp edged cylinders plays an important role bearman et al 1987 found that the vibration amplitude of a square cylinder is dependent on the angle of attack the experimental tests conducted by bearman et al 1987 revealed that the lift coefficient for a square cylinder is maximum at an attack angle of 13 depending on turbulence intensity parkinson 1971 concluded that the vibration amplitude in the viv regime is limited to less than 1d for a circular cylinder whereas the galloping vibration amplitude of a square cylinder can increase manyfold fig 1 shows the most classic geometries in a cross flow where the circular square triangular d shaped and rectangular cylinders have the same length scale d it is worth noting that there are only a few studies on the d shaped cylinder in the literature knauss et al 1976 ota et al 1984 hourigan et al 2001 therefore this geometry is not reviewed in details here in addition the most studied model is two dimensional achieved with the cylinder given a sufficiently longer aspect ratio ar l d 7 5 or using end plates where l is the spanwise length of the cylinder for small aspect ratios ar 7 5 the flow becomes three dimensional and the ar needs to be considered as an additional influential parameter along with other geometrical parameters thompson et al 2001 camarri et al 2006 ryan et al 2005 wissink and rodi 2008 the objective of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive review of the flow structure around and vortex dynamics in the wake of circular and sharp edged cylinders in a wide range of re the focus is on the dependence of the wake on re and bluff body shapes some new numerical measurements are also conducted to analyze the vorticity and circulation of vortices for the selected bodies 2 flow around a bluff body the complexity of vortex dynamics increases when the flow regime alters due to the variation in re in this study the emphasis is not to focus on and review all bluff bodies there is nevertheless an attempt to investigate the characteristics and dynamics of wake vortices existing over different fluidic conditions and flow regimes therefore for a wide range of re the effect of following key parameters on the wake of the bluff bodies is investigated i strouhal number ii bluff body cross section iii vorticity and iv circulation in vortices the flow around a circular cylinder has been classified into seven regimes based on visual observation of the flow structures and variation in st with re achenbach and heinecke 1981 this classification is presented in table 1 where the major difference prevailing in the cylinder wake in each flow regime is the transition occurring in the wake and shear layers depending on re as a consequence the transition affects lift and drag forces vortex size vorticity and separation point alam et al 2011 alam 2014 bai and alam 2018 apart from this classification zdravkovich 1997 subdivided the flow regime into more sub regimes highlighting the transition in the boundary and shear layers to gain a better understanding and an ease of reviewing the classification of achenbach and heinecke 1981 is sorted into three main categories group 1 re 300 group 2 300 re 1 4 105 group 3 re 1 4 105 as shown in table 1 there are three reasons for this categorization firstly at re 300 the flow is laminar st escalates with re fig 2 including a discontinuity at re 180 tritton 1959 gerich and eckelmann 1982 williamson 1989 zdravkovich 1996 secondly according to zdravkovich 1997 and norberg 2003 the fluctuating lift force coefficient c lf behaves differently between the three reynolds number ranges regimes following the transition in the shear and boundary layers fig 3 connected to circulation strength of the vortices the c lf plays an important role in generating fiv viv wiv or galloping and in energy conversion bernitsas and raghavn 2004 2008 2009 assi et al 2010 lee et al 2011 ding et al 2013 derakhshandeh et al 2014a 2016 bhatt and alam 2018 thirdly most of relevant investigations have been conducted in these three flow regimes this categorization thus facilitates a comparison of the wake at the three regimes the circulation г is a measure of vortex strength a greater г of vortices corresponds to an increased c lf caro 2012 and a higher amplitude of cylinder displacement providing a higher power coefficient for the viv wiv converters the г is estimated as 1 γ ω d s i 1 n ω i δ x i δ y i in eq 1 ω represents vorticity s 1 and ds m2 is the closed area the г is also linked to the base pressure c pb roshko 1954 the г during vortex shedding has been formulated by bearman and obasaju 1982 as 2 δ γ u d 1 c p b u f d 1 c p b 2 s t evidently г is inversely proportional to st the equation reflects that for bluff bodies with the same c pb d and u a greater г can be achieved by lowering st this behaviour can be managed for instance using a rectangular cylinder at which st alters as a function of c d cross sectional aspect ratio where c is the width of the cylinder further detail will be provided in section 3 2 in the next sections the flows around circular and sharp edged cylinders are compared at three re ranges defined in table 1 while sharp edged cylinders include triangular square and rectangular 3 the wake at laminar flow regime re 300 viscous laminar flows including creeping steady separated and periodic laminar wake flow regimes over different cylinders are paid attention in this section 3 1 circular cylinders at re 300 despite the fact that the circular cylinder is the simplest symmetrical shape without sharp edges the wake of a two dimensional circular cylinder is complex due to the interaction of the boundary layers shear layers and wake a three dimensional small ar cylinder adding an extra length scale to the flow makes the wake more complex williamson 1988 the wake of a circular cylinder therefore can be influenced by both fluidic and structural parameters such as re ar blockage ratio surface roughness and turbulence intensity all these parameters have significant influences on the shear layer and boundary layer transitions separation forces c pb and st mansy et al 1994 kim and choi 2005 bai and alam 2018 altering the kinetic energy of vortices in the wake wind tunnel tests conducted by szepessy and bearman 1992 showed that c lf of a circular cylinder is a function of re and ar for instance they at re 5 104 varied ar from 0 25 to 12 and found that c lf 0 8 at ar 1 decaying to 0 48 at ar 6 7 the degree of the ar influence was dependent on re forces and st are characterized by the parameters describing the vortex street such as vortex formation length and wake width in general a shorter formation length or wider wake width corresponds to a lower st and higher forces and vice versa younis et al 2017 a number of studies on the laminar flow over the chosen geometries have been undertaken e g koopmann 1967 norberg 1987 and thompson et al 1996 table 2 lists some selected experimental and numerical studies the strouhal number or the frequency of the shed vortices is one of the fluidic parameters which can excite the downstream cylinder assi 2009 qin et al 2018 2019 and can directly alter wake dynamics with a view to understanding the characteristics of the vortices in the wake the dependence of the shedding frequency on re viv or wiv needs to be addressed in order to highlight the effect of re on the shedding frequency a typical vortex formation in the wake of a circular cylinder is shown in fig 4 williamson 1996a b the cores of vortices are highlighted by the red spots in the figure and the variation of the red spots demonstrates the alteration of the frequency at different re different longitudinal distances between the cores of vortices this behaviour of vortex shedding was identified by strouhal in the 19th century strouhal 1878cited by zdravkovich 1996 fig 4 also shows that the transverse spacing and the length scale of the vortices are sensitive to re the transverse gap between the cores of negative and positive vortices is approximately regular at re 150 and 300 at 50 re 150 where vortices die out slowly downstream roshko 1954 developed a relationship between re and st as 3 st f d u 0 212 4 5 re later tritton 1959 experimentally demonstrated that this relationship is not suitable enough for velocity estimation through shedding frequency measurement a deviation of about 5 in the velocity frequency profiles was identified tritton therefore modified st re relationship as 4 st a re b c re here the values of constants a b and c are functions of re as shown in table 3 water channel tests performed by tritton 1959 also showed that the behaviour of the generated vortices in the wake of the cylinder at re 70 is always irregular in terms of frequency tritton 1959 similar studies conducted by kiya et al 1980 at 43 re 220 also confirmed that the vortex frequency varies in the wake region when re is close to 70 there is a sudden jump in oblique shedding angle θ which produces an irregular vortices and causes a decrease in the intensity of the velocity fluctuations which probably means the generated vortices in the wake of the cylinder are weaker williamson 1989 found that at re 64 the absolute value of the oblique shedding angle θ of vortices suddenly jumps from 10 to 20 fig 5 this occurs due to the alteration of the vortex shedding frequency in the wake of the cylinder although there is a slight disagreement in the literature about the existence of discontinuity of st at a specific re this scenario has been confirmed by many scholars fig 5 shows that θ at re 100 is highly sensitive to re so is the st 3 2 sharp edged cylinders at re 300 the flow past a non circular cylinder with sharp edges such as triangular square and rectangular cylinders has also received considerable attention in the literature a selected number of studies on the flow around triangular square and rectangular cylinders are presented in table 2 it is noted that the numerical modeling has recently been more popular as compared with the experimental tests nonetheless the laminar flow over the triangular cylinder has not received much attention as compared with that over square and rectangular cylinders galletti et al 2004 de and dalai 2006 kumar de and dalal 2007 srikanth et al 2010 farhadi et al 2010 zeitoun et al 2011 alam and zhou 2013 studies conducted on a triangular cylinder showed that st increases from 0 15 to 0 2 as re increases from 40 to 150 the variation being very similar to that for square and circular cylinders de and dalai 2006 further confirmed by zeitoun et al 2011 as shown in fig 6 for a triangular prism zeitoun et al 2011 empirically formulated the relationship between st and re as follows 5 st 0 2383 5 4026 re comparing eqs 3 and 5 demonstrates that though st varies in a similar fashion with re for both circular and triangular cylinders there is no report of discontinuity in st for triangular cylinder compare figs 2 and 6 laminar flows around circular and square cylinders have been compared by frank et al 1990 the results showed that at 40 re 300 a square cylinder behaves in a very similar way to a circular cylinder in terms of st however the separation points are fixed at the edges of a square but not for a circular cylinder while the separation point for a square cylinder is independent of re 150 that for a circular cylinder varies from 109 to 123 measured from the front stagnation point depending on re frank et al 1990 showed that the separation occurs at the trailing and leading edges of a square cylinder for re 150 and 150 respectively the vortex size becomes larger in the latter re range the change in the size affects the dynamics of the vortices in the wake and influences the imposing pressure and force on the cylinder surface these two features alter the circulation of vortices and consequently changes the kinetic energy of vortices an analysis of vorticity and circulation of vortices is helpful in gaining insight into the wake further two dimensional numerical simulations in laminar flow regime are therefore conducted to have a better understanding and comparison of the wake of circular and sharp edged cylinders where an identical dimension d was chosen for all cylinders the initial conditions and structured meshes were created similar to the previous studies conducted by the authors for the flow around a cylinder at re 200 alam 2016 alam et al 2018 the details of the numerical models and verification of the simulations are therefore not repeated here instantaneous vorticity contours presented in fig 7 show the alternate shedding of vortices as mentioned earlier vortex formation length and wake width are two key factors in defining wake size which are dependent on re for the triangular cylinder the separation occurs from the rear edge and the lateral separation between successive vortices widens with an efflux angle β s 10 19 for the chosen apex angle of 90 the β s is expected to be contingent on the apex angle evaluation of the vorticity in the wake of each bluff body can provide further insight into the wake the dimensionless vorticity in the wake is presented as a function of the downstream distance x d for circular square and triangular cylinders fig 8 the vorticity decays with x d regardless of the cylinder shape while vorticities of the circular and square cylinders are comparable to each other the triangular cylinder engenders much higher vorticity almost doubled at x d 2 compared to the circular or square cylinder higher vorticity in a specific area in the wake means a higher circulation of vortices note that more investigations are required in order to compare the effect of the apex angle on β s and vorticity in the case of a rectangular cylinder the dynamic behaviour of vortices becomes more complicated due to the effect of chord to thickness ratio c d on the flow which is an additional structural parameter further simulations are performed to analyze the effect of c d on vorticity and circulation of the vortices the c d is varied from 2 to 10 at re 200 the domain structured mesh and boundary conditions have been chosen based on the previous study derakhshandeh and alam 2018 2019 fig 9 shows the variation in s t c as a function of c d obtained from the power spectrum of the lift force acting on the cylinder numerical studies of the flow around a rectangular cylinder revealed that s t c is sensitive to c d and increases step by step with an increase in c d for a wide range of re covering laminar to subcritical flow okajima 1982 and stokes and welsh 1986 confirmed the same observation as in fig 9 later ohya et al 1992 identified that the stepwise increase in st is nearly equal to integral multiples of 0 6 the studies conducted by mills et al 2003 showed that st can be formulated as s t c 0 55n where n is an integer number representing the number of vortices crawling on the side surface of the cylinder figs 10 and 11 show the vorticity contours and vorticity magnitude respectively in the wakes of rectangular cylinders it is evident in fig 10 that the cores of the positive and negative vortices are located along the side surfaces of the cylinders and their lateral separation can therefore be widened by increasing the thickness of the cylinder as seen in fig 11 vorticity at a given x d decays with increasing c d the decay is however large between c d 4 and 6 and small at c d 6 10 on the other hand as expected vorticity decreases with x d the decrease is more prominent for c d 2 and 4 although c d 10 for instance corresponds to a maximum s t c a minimum vorticity is produced for this c d the maximum vorticity is generated at c d 2 therefore for a group of cylinders with a constant s t c fig 9 the smallest c d can generate higher vorticity hence stronger circulation 4 wake at subcritical regime 300 re 1 4 105 4 1 circular cylinders at 300 re 1 4 105 when re 300 the velocity fluctuation becomes more irregular and turbulence performs in the separated shear layers while there is still a predominant vortex shedding frequency in the wake of the circular cylinder ong and wallace 1996 ozgoren et al 2011 kiya et al 1980 the st is more or less constant around 0 2 kiya et al 1980 blevins 1990 liang and papadakis 2007 alam and zhou 2008 lin et al 1995 found that the base pressure coefficient reaches a local maximum at re 5000 and large scale vortices perform in the wake of the cylinder this causes an increment in streamwise velocity in the wake of the cylinder unal and rockwell 1987a and 1987b with a higher potential of integrated kinetic energy following the above studies the direct numerical simulation dns and large eddy simulation les conducted by ma et al 2000 confirmed the similar behaviour of the flow structure in the wake of the circular cylinder in the subcritical flow regime the generated vortices are three dimensional williamson 1996a therefore the circulation associated with a shed vortex can be decomposed into x and z components г x and г z respectively it is important noting that the x component is the recirculation at x section in the wake of the cylinder in addition the z component is the initial circulation which is discharged into the wake of the cylinder during a cycle of vortex formation the piv measurements of wu et al 1994 at re 525 showed that г x 0 39 m2 s much smaller than г z 3 5 m2 s this means that the circulation ratio is approximately г x г z 0 11 a similar observation is made from the experimental tests conducted by chyu and rockwell 1996 at re 5000 г x 0 26 m2 s and lin et al 1995 at re 10 000 г x 0 27 m2 s the observations suggest that г x approximately remains constant in the wake of a circular cylinder 4 2 sharp edged cylinders at 300 re 1 4 105 for a triangular cylinder experimental tests by iungo and buresti at re 1 2 105 revealed that st varies with apex angle and ar fig 12 shows the variation in st as a function of both ar and apex angle there is a growth in st from 0 11 to 0 19 with apex angle depending on ar this range of st can be increased up to 0 25 when the apex angle is increased to 90 strouhal number of a square cylinder is less than that of a circular cylinder varying between 0 127 and 0 16 depending on re sohankar et al 2000 tamura and kuwahara 1990 ozgoren 2006 huanga et al 2010 yen and yang 2011 hu et al 2015 bai and alam 2018 this reduction can be even seen for the square cylinders with wavy surfaces lam et al 2012 lin et al 2016 in addition a square cylinder can generate stronger circulation in the wake along with a smaller base pressure sohankar et al 2000 prior to this suzuki et al 1992 found that a blockage can increase the strouhal number up to 0 5 the instantaneous vorticity contours around circular square and triangular cylinders are shown in fig 13 at re 2000 similar to those in the laminar flow regime the cores of the negative and positive vortices are still located in a wider lateral distance for the wake of the triangular cylinder as compared with the square and circular cylinders the efflux angle β s is however smaller here 7 1 for the chosen apex angle 90 it is seen that an increase in re from 200 to 2000 leads to approximately 30 reduction in the efflux angle fig 14 shows vorticity decay with x d for the three cylinders at re 2000 similar to that in the laminar flow regime vorticity decreases with increasing x d for all three cylinders the difference in vorticities between the cylinders is maximum at x d 1 0 with vorticity being two times larger for the triangular cylinder than the circular lyn et al 1995 showed that г x peaks at a longer distance x d 5 8 and 5 9 in the square and rectangular cylinder wakes than in the circular cylinder wake x d 4 3 г z for a square cylinder was found to be 60 higher than that for the circular cylinder lyn et al 1995 this difference is ascribed to a smaller st and a larger size of vortices for the square cylinder compared with the circular cylinder counterparts lyn et al 1995 consequently the maximum of г x г z 0 41 for the square cylinder generated at x d 4 5 5 although fig 15 shows that г x г z slightly varies depending on x d the results show that the г x г z of the square cylinder is approximately four times higher than that reported for the circular cylinder at subcritical flow regime lin et al 1995 lyn et al 1995 showed that the maximum ratio is approximately г x г z 0 3 for a circular cylinder for a wide range of re a summary of selected studies on subcritical flow regime around a cylinder including circular triangular square and rectangular cylinders is shown in table 4 note that the chord to thickness ratio is defined only for the rectangular cylinder 5 wake at critical and supercritical flow regime re 1 4 105 this section compares the wake of the critical and supercritical regimes over circular and sharp edged cylinders some selected studies are shown in table 5 5 1 circular cylinder at very high re bearman 1969 studied the effect of re on st pressure drag and lift forces for a circular cylinder the mean drag coefficient was minimum at re 4 16 105 where st abruptly jumps to a higher value from 0 2 to 0 46 fig 16 power spectrum results showed that vortex shedding frequency covers a broader band at re 5 5 105 while becoming random at re 6 105 roshko 1960 cantwell and coles 1983 due to the discontinuity of st at re 4 16 105 and broad banded st at re 5 5 105 the frequency of vortices is not stable in the wake of the circular cylinder as is vortex dynamics compared with that in the subcritical flow regime the maximum circulation at re 1 4 105 occurs closer to the circular cylinder cantwell and coles 1983 fig 17 shows that the maximum г x г z 0 44 occurs at about x d 3 6 although г x г z decays with x d the maximum г x γ z in this re range is large for the circular cylinder the experimental tests of raghavan and bernitsas 2011a b on viv of a circular cylinder conducted at 2 104 re 6 10 6 groups 2 and 3 in table 1 showed that the vibration amplitude of the cylinder can be increased up to 1 9d even using higher mass ratio for the structure however the current study revealed that there is still a need to study the wiv energy at very high reynolds numbers in particular for non circular cylinder such as triangular cylinders in particular for the triangular the efflux angle of vortices in the wiv phenomenon would be added to the other flow features 5 2 sharp edged cylinders non circular cylinders at re 1 4 105 have received less attention in the literature as compared with the circular cylinders the studies on flow over non circular cylinders can be highlighted here such as nakagawa 1989 camarri et al 2006 triangular cylinder bearman 1965 durão et al 1988 lübcke et al 2001 square cylinder and mannini et al 2010 larose and d auteuil 2006 mannini et al 2011 schewe and larsen 1998 bruno et al 2010 rectangular cylinder it was believed that sharp edged cylinders are insensitive to re due to the fixed flow separation robertson et al 1975 nonetheless schewe and larsen 1998 showed that re has a strong influence on the separated shear layers as a consequence the dynamics of vortices in the wake of the cylinders is influenced by re for triangular prisms re does not influence the wake much but flow incidence angle ar and ti all do the streamwise velocity for a triangular cylinder with ar 0 5 was 20 larger than that with ar 0 9 camarri et al 2006 furthermore st for a triangular cylinder is approximately 0 15 at ar 1 5 reducing to 0 05 at ar 3 3 in particular for non circular cylinder such as a triangular cylinder the efflux angle of vortices in the wiv phenomenon will be added to the other flow features for a rectangular cylinder of c d 5 mannini et al 2011 showed that st is limited between 0 11 and 0 115 which is less than that of a circular cylinder despite the large number of investigations in the literature the wake of a rectangular cylinder needs further research including the dynamic responses of rectangular cylinders of different c d considering the wake dynamics and structural responses of different cross sectional geometries in three selected flow regimes as classified in table 1 the main features of each bluff body are summarized in table 6 apart from the above discussion it is worth noting that the interaction between the cylinder and flow is dependent the cross sectional geometry of the cylinder being a crucial issue in fluid structure interaction phenomena as galloping and or viv depends on the geometry in addition flow control methods and utilizing vortex energy in form of viv wiv galloping and flutter can be taken into account which needs further investigations in the future furthermore due to the lack of studies for triangular cylinders with different apex angle and d shaped cylinder the wake of these bluff bodies would be an additional interest area which might be considered for further investigations 6 conclusions this paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the wakes of the bluff bodies including circular triangular square and rectangular cylinders a wide range of reynolds number is taken into account comprising the laminar subcritical critical and supercritical flow regimes at laminar flow regime around a circular cylinder e g 1 re 300 a shift in the absolute value of oblique shedding angle comes into being particularly at re 64 70 strouhal number is not constant increasing nonlinearly a similar increase in strouhal number is observed for other sharp edged cylinders as well however there is no discontinuity in strouhal number variations for the sharp edged cylinders therefore continuously generated vortices in the wake of the triangular and square cylinders are an advantage and can facilitate the design of the converter as compared with a circular cylinder in addition among the sharp edged cylinders a triangular cylinder can generate stronger vortices among a group of rectangular cylinders with different c d it is found that a smaller c d can produce stronger circulation that is ascribed to the decreased strouhal number and increased magnitude of base pressure at subcritical flow regime 300 re 1 4 105 the maximum ratio of circulation is г x г z 0 41 for a square cylinder and г x г z 0 3 for a circular cylinder in a wide range of re on the other hand a triangular cylinder generates stronger vortices than a circular or square cylinder and can be considered as an efficient bluff body a drastic jump occurs in strouhal number at re 4 16 105 for a circular cylinder furthermore the maximum circulation occurs very close to the circular cylinder in the critical flow regime where the storuhal number again does not vary with re cantwell and coles 1983 apart from this discussion the method of flow control and utilizing vortex energy in form of viv wiv galloping and flutter can be taken into account for further investigations the detailed features of the wakes for different bluff body geometries at different reynolds are identified and summarised acknowledgements alam wishes to acknowledge the support given by the national natural science foundation of china through grants
