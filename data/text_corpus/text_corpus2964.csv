14820,the partial nitritation anammox process is a popular process for sidestream nitrogen removal but the process is sensitive to disturbances and requires extensive surveillance and monitoring for optimal performance we followed two parallel sidestream full scale deammonification reactors treating digester centrate for a year with high time resolution of both online sensor data and microbial community as measured by nanopore dna sequencing dna surveillance revealed system disturbances and allowed for detection of process and equipment upsets and it facilitated remediating operational actions surveillance of anammox bacteria ca brocadia revealed unexpected variations and the composition and dynamics of the flanking community indicated causes for occasional process disturbances with poor nitrogen removal monitoring the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob could potentially allow reactor operation with increased dissolved oxygen do yielding higher ammonia conversion while keeping nob in control the use of fast and frequent dna sequencing sampling 3 5 times a week analysed once per week was an important supplement and in many cases superior to

development goal six concerning clean water and sanitation un general assembly 2015 nitrogen is most commonly removed by nitrification denitrification in the activated sludge process but the application of the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is becoming increasingly popular it usually takes place as a sidestream process although there are also reports about inclusion of anammox as a mainstream process primarily in warmer climates cao et al 2018 in the sidestream process centrate from anaerobic digestion with high ammonia concentrations is treated by partial nitritation and anammox pn a also called de ammonification jetten et al 1997 compared to conventional denitrification it has three advantages reduction in oxygen demand no carbon demand for denitrification and significant reduction in sludge production daigger 2014 jetten et al 1997 wett 2007 removal of nitrogen by the sidestream process in pn a reactors rely on the presence of anaerobic anammox bacteria anaob as well as ammonia oxidising bacteria aob the latter to ensure oxidation of ammonium to nitrite the key substrate for anammox bacteria chen et al 2023 jetten et al 1997 zhang and okabe 2020 however nitrite oxidising bacteria nob may also be present converting nitrite to nitrate this is highly unwanted as it removes the substrate from the process and thereby starves the anammox bacteria nitrite is not only an important substrate but also an inhibitor for the anammox process in high concentrations with reported inhibition in the range from 30 to 350 mg n l dapena mora et al 2007 fux et al 2004 strous et al 1999 however inhibition depends on the duration of high nitrite concentrations and is reversible by lowering the nitrite concentration bettazzi et al 2010 lotti et al 2012 the optimal condition for retaining anaob and aob but no nob in one reactor is obtained by growing the communities in granules and keeping the oxygen level low to ensure an anaerobic inner niche for the anaob and enough oxygen to keep aob active at the granules surface manonmani and joseph 2018 zhang et al 2008 the nob are typically controlled either by keeping the oxygen concentrations very low or by intermittent aeration ma et al 2015 in full scale reactors the performance is typically surveyed and controlled by ph demon wett 2006 nh4 joss et al 2009 a ratio between no2 nh4 concentration or in the case of anitamox by a ratio of influent effluent ammonium concentrations and the nitrate production in the system lackner et al 2014 these parameters are used to control the daily feeding aeration cycles and dissolved oxygen do identifying problems building up over longer periods is not always straightforward issues affecting reactor performance are often related to the influent feed where a high or varying concentration of organic matter often analysed as total suspended solids as well as inhibitory substances can lead to a decrease in reactor performance lackner et al 2014 li et al 2020 qian et al 2023 the development of new sequencing technologies where the nanopore minion is of particular interest due to its size and low price makes it possible to analyse microbial communities from day to day and use this information for surveillance and for control by changing operational conditions pomerantz et al 2018 traditionally the turn around time for obtaining reliable community data by dna sequencing is weeks thus not providing community analyses in time for control purposes however with the development of the minion technology this problem is now solved ciuffreda et al 2021 and reliable community analysis can take place within a few hours on site at the wrrf in addition the ecosystem specific reference databases midas 3 and midas 4 allow unique and robust species level identification producing high resolution insight into the dynamics of microbial communities dueholm et al 2022 nierychlo et al 2020 allowing for cross study comparisons the overall aim of this study was to monitor the process stability in two full scale deammonification reactors based on physicochemical and microbiological data and investigate whether the microbiological data would give additional value for surveillance and control the specific objectives were to 1 evaluate the use of aob and nob abundances dynamics for process monitoring 2 observe the stability and dynamics of anaob 3 investigate the composition and dynamics of the flanking community and 4 to evaluate whether changes in any of these communities could be used as alarms to the operator for potential control measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor details online sensors and operation the study included two full scale pn a reactors with demon configurations located at ejby mølle wrrf in odense denmark and they have been in operation for 5 years the reactors are each 320 m3 and designed to treat 197 kg n day each 0 62 kgn m 3d 1 they were operated in parallel treating ammonium rich centrate from four mesophilic anaerobic digesters at the wrrf the reactors were fitted with hydrocyclones to retain granular sludge table 1 the timeline for operation in this study was divided into an introductory phase with normal operation and collection of only operational data and online sensor surveillance of chemical parameters day 155 0 and three experimental phases with additional biomass sampling and dna analyses phase i day 0 57 to establish a baseline at normal conditions do setpoint of 0 3 mg l phase ii day 58 180 with an increased do set point of 1 0 mg l to increase the activity of aob combined with close surveillance of nob to observe potential growth and phase iii day 181 224 with a lowered do setpoint 0 3 mg l to re establish baseline due to fouling of the membranes in the aeration system during phase ii this phase was divided into two phases phase iia day 58 88 with membrane fouling and phase iib day 89 180 where the do levels could again reach 1 0 mg l for the experimental phases only reactor r1 changed do level the other reactor r2 had continuously normal conditions with a do setpoint of 0 3 mg l mean operational values for the two reactors are available in table 2 reactor 1 and table s1 reactor 2 2 2 biomass sampling due to the granularity of the biomass it was investigated whether sampling variance was larger than the variance introduced in a sequencing workflow by drawing 10 biomass samples with 5 min intervals and analysing each sample in duplicates only minor sample heterogeneity was observed and the variance introduced in the applied sequencing workflow was even smaller fig s2 some temporal variation was observed as a 25 minute break between samples 5 and 6 was visible in the resulting data sampling of biomass was performed by taking five subsamples from the sampling port top of reactor pooling them and homogenising them using a t18 ultra turrax mixer ika for 2 min at 10 000 rpm the homogenised biomass was aliquoted into cryotubes and stored at 18 c until dna extraction sampling occurred 3 times a week for the first 5 weeks and 4 5 times a week from day 36 all samples were homogenised aliquoted and frozen on site within hours whereas downstream sample preparation and sequencing was carried out once a week if possible due to covid 19 restrictions samples were often delayed and processed together in larger batches 2 3 chemical analyses laboratory analyses of chemical parameters were performed routinely to evaluate sensor accuracy ss concentrations were determined by filtering the sludge through a glass fibre filter ga 55 advantec followed by drying at 105 c for two hours nh4 concentrations were analysed using an ammonium 50 nanocolor macherey nagel germany kit according to the manufacturers protocol 2 4 dna extraction dna was extracted using a custom workflow based on the studies by albertsen et al 2015 here developed for on site extraction with minimal equipment 500 µl biomass 480 µl phosphate buffered saline pbs mp biomedicals usa and 120 µl mt buffer mp biomedicals usa were added to a lysing matrix e tube mp biomedicals usa bead beating was performed using a superfastprep 1 mp biomedicals

which was then inverted 10 times by hand and subsequently incubated on ice for 5 min after incubation the sample was centrifuged at 2000 x g for 2 min 750 µl of the supernatant was transferred to a 1 5 ml tube for final dna purification using a custom cleanngs beads solution cleanna netherlands in a sample bead ratio of 1 1 the custom bead solution was made by diluting cleanngs beads 1 10 with a

duplicate amplicon libraries were pooled and purified using cleanngs beads cleanna netherlands in a sample bead ratio of 5 4 sequencing libraries were prepared from the amplicons multiplexed and adapted for nanopore sequencing based on a custom ligation protocol based on the sequencing kit sqk lsk109 as described by uri carreño et al 2023 the libraries were loaded onto a minion 106 v 9 4 1

sequencing can give species level identification ciuffreda et al 2021 the error rate is now around 1 previously much higher and by using the high quality 16s rrna gene reference database for wwtp systems midas 3 or 4 species level classification could be obtained of most asvs the silva or greengenes reference databases would not give the same resolution dueholm et al 2020 2022 illumina and

treating digester centrate were identical in design and operation and have been running for 5 years generally showing according to the operator stable operation table 2 we found the two reactors to be very similar in operation during the period surveyed fig 1 and fig s1 the period from day 155 to day 57 was surveyed to establish a baseline prior to process perturbations in phase ii with elevated do we observed variations in the performance where no2 increased prior to phase i and dropped suddenly in both reactors around day 35 nh4 removal efficiency fluctuated but declined from 92 5 at its peak to 82 5 at the end of phase i fig 2 b increasing do in phase ii did not result in an increase in nitrate concentration as we had expected but rather a drop in both reactors during phase iib the increased do did however cause an increase in nh4 removal efficiency once the do concentration of 1 mg l was successfully maintained in phase iib the removal efficiency peaked around day 140 and started to decline towards 80 the same trends were observed in the control reactor r2 but without a peak at day 140 indicating that the higher do concentration had an effect in reactor 1 fig 1 and fig s1 overall the increased do in reactor 1 appeared to increase the nh4 removal capacity at a slightly higher level than in the control reactor the daily operation of the reactors was based on information from the chemical analyses sensor data and the operator s experience in running the reactors although the operator was working on a timescale with higher resolution some simple alarms could perhaps have been implemented and triggered based on the sensor data reported after day 150 which could have warned the operator about potential operational problems fig 2a and 2b the decline in no3 during phase iib indicated that either a washout suppression of nob had occurred or that the reactors performed heterotrophic denitrification alarms could thus have been triggered in reactor 1 around day 35 45 no2 drop day 70 90 nh4 increase day 100 125 no2 decrease and day 150 160 nh4 removal efficiency decrease increasing the anaob performance may be solved by a lower feeding and a higher biomass retention lackner et al 2014 resulting in a lower load and better accumulation of the anaob biomass 3 2 sampling strategy and analysis of community structure prior to biomass sampling for dna analyses at day 0 we conducted experiments to determine the optimal sampling strategy as the reactor hydraulics and different granules sizes may cause some sample heterogeneity based on the results fig s2 we decided to perform all biomass sampling from the reactors in replicates of 5 to minimise intra sample heterogeneity the biomass replicates were then pooled and homogenised in a blender prior to aliquoting biomass in cryotubes biomass was sampled 3 5 days a week to obtain a high resolution of the time series to reveal possible strong temporal variations the community composition was analysed on nanopore minion and validated with illumina miseq platform using the 16s rrna gene v4 region to enable comparison between platforms we developed a workflow where amplicons were barcoded with nanopore compatible illumina adapters thereby enabling sequencing on both platforms the v4 primer set was selected because the commonly used v1 v3 primers do not target the anaob very well mazzoli et al 2020 the two platforms gave very similar results at genus level fig s3 while abundances varied slightly on species level ca brocadia species were especially affected where abundances in the same libraries varied up to 4 1 point between the two platforms the results could indicate that ca brocadia species are so similar in the v4 region that species level cannot readily be resolved by low accuracy reads and should instead be classified by the full length of the 16s rrna gene it has previously been shown that sequencing of the entire 16s rrna gene can provide strain level resolution dueholm et al 2020 johnson et al 2019 but we chose the v4 region for comparison with the illumina platform 3 3 general microbial community structure while online sensor data was shown from day 155 biomass sampling and community analysis for the baseline commenced at day 0 the community analysis conducted weekly with the developed minion workflow showed that the microbial composition in the two reactors was almost identical and only minor differences were observed in the relative read abundances for some taxa throughout the three phases during phase i the communities were fairly stable and dominated by anaob besides approx 20 genera in relative read abundances above 1 fig 3 for reactor 1 fig s4 for reactor 2 only one anammox genus was observed ca brocadia and it varied in relative abundances of 11 24 fig 2c three different ca brocadia species were identified with ca b caroliniensis as most abundant ca b sapporoensis less abundant and with few ca b sinica fig 2d ca brocadia has previously been reported as the dominant anaob in full scale de ammonification plants occasionally with ca jettenia or ca kuenenia in high abundance as well annavajhala et al 2018 gonzalez martinez et al 2015 zhang and okabe 2020 zhao et al 2023 the genus nitrosomonas was the only known aob detected in the reactors and was the fourth most abundant genus overall 1 4 5 8 in phase i a high diversity of nitrosomonas species was detected with nitrosomonas midas s 5118 and nitrosomonas midas s 639 as most abundant and n europaea and nitrosomonas midas s 6235 in lower abundance fig 2e among the known nob we only detected genus nitrospira and it reached a relative read abundance of 0 4 1 3 we detected five different species but only n defluvii was abundant species from nitrosomonas and nitrospira are commonly found as the dominant nitrifiers in full scale sidestream pn a reactors al hazmi et al 2019 annavajhala et al 2018 gonzalez martinez et al 2015 but as these studies did not have species resolution it remains unknown whether the species are identical the flanking community consisted of many genera severalwithout any known or only poorly described function most notable was genus olb8 bacteroidetes phylum with one dominant species midas s 3279 in abundances up to 11 of the total community fig 3 it may participate in the denitrification but does not have a full pathway kondrotaite et al 2022 other abundant genera were the genus denitratisoma previously described as an anaob symbiontic denitrifier fahrbach et al 2006 qian et al 2023 and a chloroflexi genus midas g 731 interestingly the methanogenic genera methanomethylovorans and methanothrix were also present in high abundance fig 3 methanothrix is commonly found in high abundance in danish mesophilic ads while methanomethylovorans is less common but has been observed in high abundance in the digesters at the treatment plant jiang et al 2020 these methanogens along with other genera commonly present in mesophilic digesters thermovirga and thermomonas indicated that biomass from the anaerobic digesters was transferred to the deammonification reactors the overall community structure remained very similar in both reactors also during phase iia b and iii fig s5 and only the abundances of several genera species changed as described below 3 4 changes in abundances of aob nob and anaob the aob nitrosomonas and nob nitrospira abundances were relatively constant during phase i in both reactors fig 2c and fig s6 the anaob ca brocadia relative read abundance varied between 12 and 24 and was in a downward trend at the end of phase i we followed the community structure by weekly analyses consisting of separate samples at a resolution of 2 day 0 25 to 4 5 day 29 198 times per week to ensure high time resolution in phase i the abundance of nitrosomonas was rather stable 2 5 and there was a constant low level of nitrospira 0 5 1 5 by increasing the oxygen level in phase iia and iib in r1 we tried to increase the nitritation while observing for any unwanted increase of nob fig 2c the increased oxygenation did not clearly increase the abundance of aob the nob remained unexpectedly at low abundances 1 2 through phase ii although a small increase took place around day 80 normal operation phase iii was re established on day 181 in phase iii both aob and nob dropped further to very low levels 0 59 6 91 and 0 00 0 18 relative read abundance respectively the abundance of ca brocadia declined dramatically during phase iia iib it dropped from 18 to only 1 2 in relative abundance with some temporal variations this low level remained throughout most of phase iii where ca brocadia started to increase in abundance again interestingly the dominant ca brocadia at the end of phase iii was ca b sapporoensis whereas ca b caroliniensis had been dominant before the abundance drop the disappearance of ca brocadia was possibly a result of the increased and unstable ss levels in the influent as it would cause some heterotrophic activity and reduce substrates available for the anammox process the decline in ca brocadia was in agreement with the declining nh4 removal efficiency and increasing nh4 levels in the sensor data fig 2a and 2b the trends were the same in both reactors suggesting that the increased do did not strongly affect the abundance of ca brocadia the changes in the nitrifying community in both reactors prompted us to look more into the species level changes for the nob community the same single species nitrospira defluvii dominated throughout all phases without changes fig 2c fig s6 for reactor 2 but for aob interesting changes were observed in both reactors fig 2e fig s6 for reactor 2 two nitrosomonas species were dominating midas s 5118 and midas s 639 the former dominated in both reactors throughout phase i although midas s 639 was dominant at the start of phase i there were some differences in abundance developments for the two species through the three phases all together indicating that growth conditions changed over time and were different in the two reactors fig 2e fig s6 for reactor 2 3 5 dynamics of flanking community explain deteriorated reactor performance the microbial community changed in both reactors during phase iib and into phase iii where both anaob and aob decreased and almost disappeared resulting in a deteriorated n removal ca brocadia was the most abundant genus throughout phase i but other species became more abundant in phase ii and iii fig 4 a and b some of these were also abundant in phase i and have previously been found in full scale sidestream pn a such as dokdonella and denitratisoma gonzalez martinez et al 2015 interestingly several genera usually present in the digester also increased such as the three methanogens methanothrix methanomethylovorans and methanolinea besides the fermenting genus thermovirga the increase of these genera commonly present in the anaerobic digesters indicated that large amounts of biomass from the digesters were added to both reactors due to insufficient removal of ss in the feedline upstream ss was removed using centrifuges with the operator aiming for 500 mg ss l the increased level of other heterotrophic and potential denitrifiers in phase ii and iii such as denitratisoma and genera belonging to chloroflexi and the decline of aob and particularly nob also indicated that the organic load to the two reactors had increased similar observations are described in other recent studies when the organic load increases chen et al 2022 qian et al 2023 the removal of ammonium seemed to have changed from a well functioning sidestream pn a to partly heterotrophic removal by denitrification primarily via nitrite as nob was almost absent the very similar community changes in the two reactors also supported that this was the main cause for the deteriorated community composition 3 6 fast community analyses support online sensors for surveillance and establishing of alarms for control measures the study showed that the fast surveillance of the entire community composition and structure created important added value to the general online monitoring microbial surveillance revealed system disturbances allowed for detection of process and equipment upsets and it could facilitate remediating operational actions based on the microbial community data the operator was able to track the cause of disturbance back to instability in the feed ss the problems were solved by minimising the incoming ss and removing more suspended biomass from the reactors while increasing the retention of heavy granules in the reactor through the hydrocyclones we did not use the microbial information for direct control in this study as we wanted to see how the normal control measures were reflected in the microbial data and use this information to evaluate whether changes in the microbial communities could be applied as potential alarms to select for appropriate control measures the community analysis provided important information about the identity and diversity of the important functional groups the identity of the microbes is important as knowledge about their function can be transferred from one study to another this is possible because we have used the midas reference database with species level taxonomy that can be compared across studies it is however important to further study the microbiology of full scale pn a reactors few studies exist on full scale communities and many members are likely yet to be identified speth et al 2016 zhang and okabe 2020 a number of issues should be considered in relation to applying routine dna analysis for control purposes these include sample frequency alarms based on the entire community profile or specific species and whether an alarm should be based on abundance change over time rate or based on abundance thresholds temporal changes in our case based on analyses of 2 5 samples a week in the microbial composition may form the basis for establishing alarms about potentially critical operational issues these can together with the normal online measurements provide inputs to the control strategies the most obvious measure changes in the nob aob ratio was not possible to evaluate in this study due to the very low nob abundances we expect that an nob aob ratio could be useful for surveillance of the nob and controlling oxygenation so dna surveillance can allow a tighter control with smaller safety margin in do setpoint the change in the anaob abundance may also be converted to an alarm the drop in ca brocadia abundance from day 40 65 was not directly detected in the online sensor data although perhaps indicated by the drop in no2 around day 40 along with an increase in no3 which could indicate higher nob activity and lower anaob activity but an alarm could have been triggered based on dna analysis the subsequent ca brocadia decline between day 80 and 100 was seen in the sensor data as an nh4 increase in the same period topping at 225 mg n l around day 90 which could have alerted the operator as the concentrations were above normal baseline values 10 150 during day 155 57 here dna analysis would have given the operator added information about the state of the anaob community also after the nh4 peak around day 90 the no3 concentration dropped to all time lows after day 110 low nob abundances and thus low no3 concentrations are of course desirable but the rate of decline could have alerted the operator of abnormal operation dna analysis would clarify what had appeared thus providing valuable insight about the potential cause ca brocadia remained in relatively stable abundance 2 8 between day 120 and 150 after which it dropped below 2 this drop was also visible in the sensor data as the nh4 removal efficiency decreased between day 150 and 160 in the same period an ss measurement from the laboratory showed elevated ss concentration from the digesters as indicated from the analyses of the anaerobic community e g the methanogens in this case the analysis of the flanking community gave important information revealing the heavy load of ss from the digesters and it revealed the increase in denitrifiers explaining the fairly good nitrate removal despite the lack of anaob it could be considered whether an alarm could be defined based on the relative abundance of key species originating from the digesters the approach demonstrated here for surveillance and potential control can be applied to all systems related to wastewater treatment including demon reactors however as shown here it may be difficult to interpret the microbial data and use them for active control therefore we recommend running analyses weekly or biweekly for one to two years to gain experience with the plant all plants are different to learn what is normal community structure which variations can be expected how does the community react to operational changes etc in this way the operators build up experiences that later can be used for control furthermore the community analyses could also be related to the physical structure of the granules and the spatial distribution of aob nob anaob and coexisting heterotrophic bacteria and suspended solid adhering onto the granular surface for optimized surveillance the costs are decreasing as the technology develops amplicon sequencing provides a near complete community overview in contrast to qpcr and is not much more costly with time when the genome databases are complete metagenomics will be the choice but presently we recommend amplicon sequencing our cost price to minion amplicon sequencing and chemicals is 30 40 per sample working hours when running 10 20 samples at a time we collect samples from several plants and run them weekly or biweekly at a central laboratory with the equipment and expertise necessary 4 conclusion two full scale sidestream de ammonification pn a reactors treating digester centrates were followed for one year by online sensors for the surveillance and control of operation the overall operation showed good n removal efficiencies of 85 95 although it dropped to 80 in a period the microbial communities were analysed with a resolution of 3 5 samples week by nanopore minion dna sequencing the nitrifiers consisted of one genus of aob nitrosomonas and one nob nitrospira and the anammox anaob of ca brocadia experiments with elevated levels of do in one reactor did not stimulate the growth of nob as expected an increase would have enabled monitoring of an nob aob ratio which is a potential tool for surveillance and control of aeration and operation of the reactors ca brocadia dominated the reactors during stable operation but declined substantially during a period causing poor n removal the decrease in species abundance could be detected before it affected the overall reactor performance detailed analyses of the dynamics of nitrifiers and the flanking community revealed possible causes for the poor reactor performance and enabled the operator to make changes to the operation temporal changes of several species had the potential to act as an alarm to the operator for control purposes overall the ability to obtain high resolution dna sequencing results weekly was an important supplement to the online sensor data for process surveillance understanding and control we recommend fast dna sequencing as an important tool for surveillance of the pn a process building up experiences over one to

14820,the partial nitritation anammox process is a popular process for sidestream nitrogen removal but the process is sensitive to disturbances and requires extensive surveillance and monitoring for optimal performance we followed two parallel sidestream full scale deammonification reactors treating digester centrate for a year with high time resolution of both online sensor data and microbial community as measured by nanopore dna sequencing dna surveillance revealed system disturbances and allowed for detection of process and equipment upsets and it facilitated remediating operational actions surveillance of anammox bacteria ca brocadia revealed unexpected variations and the composition and dynamics of the flanking community indicated causes for occasional process disturbances with poor nitrogen removal monitoring the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob could potentially allow reactor operation with increased dissolved oxygen do yielding higher ammonia conversion while keeping nob in control the use of fast and frequent dna sequencing sampling 3 5 times a week analysed once per week was an important supplement and in many cases superior to

development goal six concerning clean water and sanitation un general assembly 2015 nitrogen is most commonly removed by nitrification denitrification in the activated sludge process but the application of the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is becoming increasingly popular it usually takes place as a sidestream process although there are also reports about inclusion of anammox as a mainstream process primarily in warmer climates cao et al 2018 in the sidestream process centrate from anaerobic digestion with high ammonia concentrations is treated by partial nitritation and anammox pn a also called de ammonification jetten et al 1997 compared to conventional denitrification it has three advantages reduction in oxygen demand no carbon demand for denitrification and significant reduction in sludge production daigger 2014 jetten et al 1997 wett 2007 removal of nitrogen by the sidestream process in pn a reactors rely on the presence of anaerobic anammox bacteria anaob as well as ammonia oxidising bacteria aob the latter to ensure oxidation of ammonium to nitrite the key substrate for anammox bacteria chen et al 2023 jetten et al 1997 zhang and okabe 2020 however nitrite oxidising bacteria nob may also be present converting nitrite to nitrate this is highly unwanted as it removes the substrate from the process and thereby starves the anammox bacteria nitrite is not only an important substrate but also an inhibitor for the anammox process in high concentrations with reported inhibition in the range from 30 to 350 mg n l dapena mora et al 2007 fux et al 2004 strous et al 1999 however inhibition depends on the duration of high nitrite concentrations and is reversible by lowering the nitrite concentration bettazzi et al 2010 lotti et al 2012 the optimal condition for retaining anaob and aob but no nob in one reactor is obtained by growing the communities in granules and keeping the oxygen level low to ensure an anaerobic inner niche for the anaob and enough oxygen to keep aob active at the granules surface manonmani and joseph 2018 zhang et al 2008 the nob are typically controlled either by keeping the oxygen concentrations very low or by intermittent aeration ma et al 2015 in full scale reactors the performance is typically surveyed and controlled by ph demon wett 2006 nh4 joss et al 2009 a ratio between no2 nh4 concentration or in the case of anitamox by a ratio of influent effluent ammonium concentrations and the nitrate production in the system lackner et al 2014 these parameters are used to control the daily feeding aeration cycles and dissolved oxygen do identifying problems building up over longer periods is not always straightforward issues affecting reactor performance are often related to the influent feed where a high or varying concentration of organic matter often analysed as total suspended solids as well as inhibitory substances can lead to a decrease in reactor performance lackner et al 2014 li et al 2020 qian et al 2023 the development of new sequencing technologies where the nanopore minion is of particular interest due to its size and low price makes it possible to analyse microbial communities from day to day and use this information for surveillance and for control by changing operational conditions pomerantz et al 2018 traditionally the turn around time for obtaining reliable community data by dna sequencing is weeks thus not providing community analyses in time for control purposes however with the development of the minion technology this problem is now solved ciuffreda et al 2021 and reliable community analysis can take place within a few hours on site at the wrrf in addition the ecosystem specific reference databases midas 3 and midas 4 allow unique and robust species level identification producing high resolution insight into the dynamics of microbial communities dueholm et al 2022 nierychlo et al 2020 allowing for cross study comparisons the overall aim of this study was to monitor the process stability in two full scale deammonification reactors based on physicochemical and microbiological data and investigate whether the microbiological data would give additional value for surveillance and control the specific objectives were to 1 evaluate the use of aob and nob abundances dynamics for process monitoring 2 observe the stability and dynamics of anaob 3 investigate the composition and dynamics of the flanking community and 4 to evaluate whether changes in any of these communities could be used as alarms to the operator for potential control measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor details online sensors and operation the study included two full scale pn a reactors with demon configurations located at ejby mølle wrrf in odense denmark and they have been in operation for 5 years the reactors are each 320 m3 and designed to treat 197 kg n day each 0 62 kgn m 3d 1 they were operated in parallel treating ammonium rich centrate from four mesophilic anaerobic digesters at the wrrf the reactors were fitted with hydrocyclones to retain granular sludge table 1 the timeline for operation in this study was divided into an introductory phase with normal operation and collection of only operational data and online sensor surveillance of chemical parameters day 155 0 and three experimental phases with additional biomass sampling and dna analyses phase i day 0 57 to establish a baseline at normal conditions do setpoint of 0 3 mg l phase ii day 58 180 with an increased do set point of 1 0 mg l to increase the activity of aob combined with close surveillance of nob to observe potential growth and phase iii day 181 224 with a lowered do setpoint 0 3 mg l to re establish baseline due to fouling of the membranes in the aeration system during phase ii this phase was divided into two phases phase iia day 58 88 with membrane fouling and phase iib day 89 180 where the do levels could again reach 1 0 mg l for the experimental phases only reactor r1 changed do level the other reactor r2 had continuously normal conditions with a do setpoint of 0 3 mg l mean operational values for the two reactors are available in table 2 reactor 1 and table s1 reactor 2 2 2 biomass sampling due to the granularity of the biomass it was investigated whether sampling variance was larger than the variance introduced in a sequencing workflow by drawing 10 biomass samples with 5 min intervals and analysing each sample in duplicates only minor sample heterogeneity was observed and the variance introduced in the applied sequencing workflow was even smaller fig s2 some temporal variation was observed as a 25 minute break between samples 5 and 6 was visible in the resulting data sampling of biomass was performed by taking five subsamples from the sampling port top of reactor pooling them and homogenising them using a t18 ultra turrax mixer ika for 2 min at 10 000 rpm the homogenised biomass was aliquoted into cryotubes and stored at 18 c until dna extraction sampling occurred 3 times a week for the first 5 weeks and 4 5 times a week from day 36 all samples were homogenised aliquoted and frozen on site within hours whereas downstream sample preparation and sequencing was carried out once a week if possible due to covid 19 restrictions samples were often delayed and processed together in larger batches 2 3 chemical analyses laboratory analyses of chemical parameters were performed routinely to evaluate sensor accuracy ss concentrations were determined by filtering the sludge through a glass fibre filter ga 55 advantec followed by drying at 105 c for two hours nh4 concentrations were analysed using an ammonium 50 nanocolor macherey nagel germany kit according to the manufacturers protocol 2 4 dna extraction dna was extracted using a custom workflow based on the studies by albertsen et al 2015 here developed for on site extraction with minimal equipment 500 µl biomass 480 µl phosphate buffered saline pbs mp biomedicals usa and 120 µl mt buffer mp biomedicals usa were added to a lysing matrix e tube mp biomedicals usa bead beating was performed using a superfastprep 1 mp biomedicals

duplicate amplicon libraries were pooled and purified using cleanngs beads cleanna netherlands in a sample bead ratio of 5 4 sequencing libraries were prepared from the amplicons multiplexed and adapted for nanopore sequencing based on a custom ligation protocol based on the sequencing kit sqk lsk109 as described by uri carreño et al 2023 the libraries were loaded onto a minion 106 v 9 4 1

sequencing can give species level identification ciuffreda et al 2021 the error rate is now around 1 previously much higher and by using the high quality 16s rrna gene reference database for wwtp systems midas 3 or 4 species level classification could be obtained of most asvs the silva or greengenes reference databases would not give the same resolution dueholm et al 2020 2022 illumina and

obtained through https github com martinhjorth publications tree master andersen2022 deammonification 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance the two full scale sidestream pn a reactors treating digester centrate were identical in design and operation and have been running for 5 years generally showing according to the operator stable operation table 2 we found the two reactors to be very similar in operation during the period surveyed fig 1 and fig s1 the period from day 155 to day 57 was surveyed to establish a baseline prior to process perturbations in phase ii with elevated do we observed variations in the performance where no2 increased prior to phase i and dropped suddenly in both reactors around day 35 nh4 removal efficiency fluctuated but declined from 92 5 at its peak to 82 5 at the end of phase i fig 2 b increasing do in phase ii did not result in an increase in nitrate concentration as we had expected but rather a drop in both reactors during phase iib the increased do did however cause an increase in nh4 removal efficiency once the do concentration of 1 mg l was successfully maintained in phase iib the removal efficiency peaked around day 140 and started to decline towards 80 the same trends were observed in the control reactor r2 but without a peak at day 140 indicating that the higher do concentration had an effect in reactor 1 fig 1 and fig s1 overall the increased do in reactor 1 appeared to increase the nh4 removal capacity at a slightly higher level than in the control reactor the daily operation of the reactors was based on information from the chemical analyses sensor data and the operator s experience in running the reactors although the operator was working on a timescale with higher resolution some simple alarms could perhaps have been implemented and triggered based on the sensor data reported after day 150 which could have warned the operator about potential operational problems fig 2a and 2b the decline in no3 during phase iib indicated that either a washout suppression of nob had occurred or that the reactors performed heterotrophic denitrification alarms could thus have been triggered in reactor 1 around day 35 45 no2 drop day 70 90 nh4 increase day 100 125 no2 decrease and day 150 160 nh4 removal efficiency decrease increasing the anaob performance may be solved by a lower feeding and a higher biomass retention lackner et al 2014 resulting in a lower load and better accumulation of the anaob biomass 3 2 sampling strategy and analysis of community structure prior to biomass sampling for dna analyses at day 0 we conducted experiments to determine the optimal sampling strategy as the reactor hydraulics and different granules sizes may cause some sample heterogeneity based on the results fig s2 we decided to perform all biomass sampling from the reactors in replicates of 5 to minimise intra sample heterogeneity the biomass replicates were then pooled and homogenised in a blender prior to aliquoting biomass in cryotubes biomass was sampled 3 5 days a week to obtain a high resolution of the time series to reveal possible strong temporal variations the community composition was analysed on nanopore minion and validated with illumina miseq platform using the 16s rrna gene v4 region to enable comparison between platforms we developed a workflow where amplicons were barcoded with nanopore compatible illumina adapters thereby enabling sequencing on both platforms the v4 primer set was selected because the commonly used v1 v3 primers do not target the anaob very well mazzoli et al 2020 the two platforms gave very similar results at genus level fig s3 while abundances varied slightly on species level ca brocadia species were especially affected where abundances in the same libraries varied up to 4 1 point between the two platforms the results could indicate that ca brocadia species are so similar in the v4 region that species level cannot readily be resolved by low accuracy reads and should instead be classified by the full length of the 16s rrna gene it has previously been shown that sequencing of the entire 16s rrna gene can provide strain level resolution dueholm et al 2020 johnson et al 2019 but we chose the v4 region for comparison with the illumina platform 3 3 general microbial community structure while online sensor data was shown from day 155 biomass sampling and community analysis for the baseline commenced at day 0 the community analysis conducted weekly with the developed minion workflow showed that the microbial composition in the two reactors was almost identical and only minor differences were observed in the relative read abundances for some taxa throughout the three phases during phase i the communities were fairly stable and dominated by anaob besides approx 20 genera in relative read abundances above 1 fig 3 for reactor 1 fig s4 for reactor 2 only one anammox genus was observed ca brocadia and it varied in relative abundances of 11 24 fig 2c three different ca brocadia species were identified with ca b caroliniensis as most abundant ca b sapporoensis less abundant and with few ca b sinica fig 2d ca brocadia has previously been reported as the dominant anaob in full scale de ammonification plants occasionally with ca jettenia or ca kuenenia in high abundance as well annavajhala et al 2018 gonzalez martinez et al 2015 zhang and okabe 2020 zhao et al 2023 the genus nitrosomonas was the only known aob detected in the reactors and was the fourth most abundant genus overall 1 4 5 8 in phase i a high diversity of nitrosomonas species was detected with nitrosomonas midas s 5118 and nitrosomonas midas s 639 as most abundant and n europaea and nitrosomonas midas s 6235 in lower abundance fig 2e among the known nob we only detected genus nitrospira and it reached a relative read abundance of 0 4 1 3 we detected five different species but only n defluvii was abundant species from nitrosomonas and nitrospira are commonly found as the dominant nitrifiers in full scale sidestream pn a reactors al hazmi et al 2019 annavajhala et al 2018 gonzalez martinez et al 2015 but as these studies did not have species resolution it remains unknown whether the species are identical the flanking community consisted of many genera severalwithout any known or only poorly described function most notable was genus olb8 bacteroidetes phylum with one dominant species midas s 3279 in abundances up to 11 of the total community fig 3 it may participate in the denitrification but does not have a full pathway kondrotaite et al 2022 other abundant genera were the genus denitratisoma previously described as an anaob symbiontic denitrifier fahrbach et al 2006 qian et al 2023 and a chloroflexi genus midas g 731 interestingly the methanogenic genera methanomethylovorans and methanothrix were also present in high abundance fig 3 methanothrix is commonly found in high abundance in danish mesophilic ads while methanomethylovorans is less common but has been observed in high abundance in the digesters at the treatment plant jiang et al 2020 these methanogens along with other genera commonly present in mesophilic digesters thermovirga and thermomonas indicated that biomass from the anaerobic digesters was transferred to the deammonification reactors the overall community structure remained very similar in both reactors also during phase iia b and iii fig s5 and only the abundances of several genera species changed as described below 3 4 changes in abundances of aob nob and anaob the aob nitrosomonas and nob nitrospira abundances were relatively constant during phase i in both reactors fig 2c and fig s6 the anaob ca brocadia relative read abundance varied between 12 and 24 and was in a downward trend at the end of phase i we followed the community structure by weekly analyses consisting of separate samples at a resolution of 2 day 0 25 to 4 5 day 29 198 times per week to ensure high time resolution in phase i the abundance of nitrosomonas was rather stable 2 5 and there was a constant low level of nitrospira 0 5 1 5 by increasing the oxygen level in phase iia and iib in r1 we tried to increase the nitritation while observing for any unwanted increase of nob fig 2c the increased oxygenation did not clearly increase the abundance of aob the nob remained unexpectedly at low abundances 1 2 through phase ii although a small increase took place around day 80 normal operation phase iii was re established on day 181 in phase iii both aob and nob dropped further to very low levels 0 59 6 91 and 0 00 0 18 relative read abundance respectively the abundance of ca brocadia declined dramatically during phase iia iib it dropped from 18 to only 1 2 in relative abundance with some temporal variations this low level remained throughout most of phase iii where ca brocadia started to increase in abundance again interestingly the dominant ca brocadia at the end of phase iii was ca b sapporoensis whereas ca b caroliniensis had been dominant before the abundance drop the disappearance of ca brocadia was possibly a result of the increased and unstable ss levels in the influent as it would cause some heterotrophic activity and reduce substrates available for the anammox process the decline in ca brocadia was in agreement with the declining nh4 removal efficiency and increasing nh4 levels in the sensor data fig 2a and 2b the trends were the same in both reactors suggesting that the increased do did not strongly affect the abundance of ca brocadia the changes in the nitrifying community in both reactors prompted us to look more into the species level changes for the nob community the same single species nitrospira defluvii dominated throughout all phases without changes fig 2c fig s6 for reactor 2 but for aob interesting changes were observed in both reactors fig 2e fig s6 for reactor 2 two nitrosomonas species were dominating midas s 5118 and midas s 639 the former dominated in both reactors throughout phase i although midas s 639 was dominant at the start of phase i there were some differences in abundance developments for the two species through the three phases all together indicating that growth conditions changed over time and were different in the two reactors fig 2e fig s6 for reactor 2 3 5 dynamics of flanking community explain deteriorated reactor performance the microbial community changed in both reactors during phase iib and into phase iii where both anaob and aob decreased and almost disappeared resulting in a deteriorated n removal ca brocadia was the most abundant genus throughout phase i but other species became more abundant in phase ii and iii fig 4 a and b some of these were also abundant in phase i and have previously been found in full scale sidestream pn a such as dokdonella and denitratisoma gonzalez martinez et al 2015 interestingly several genera usually present in the digester also increased such as the three methanogens methanothrix methanomethylovorans and methanolinea besides the fermenting genus thermovirga the increase of these genera commonly present in the anaerobic digesters indicated that large amounts of biomass from the digesters were added to both reactors due to insufficient removal of ss in the feedline upstream ss was removed using centrifuges with the operator aiming for 500 mg ss l the increased level of other heterotrophic and potential denitrifiers in phase ii and iii such as denitratisoma and genera belonging to chloroflexi and the decline of aob and particularly nob also indicated that the organic load to the two reactors had increased similar observations are described in other recent studies when the organic load increases chen et al 2022 qian et al 2023 the removal of ammonium seemed to have changed from a well functioning sidestream pn a to partly heterotrophic removal by denitrification primarily via nitrite as nob was almost absent the very similar community changes in the two reactors also supported that this was the main cause for the deteriorated community composition 3 6 fast community analyses support online sensors for surveillance and establishing of alarms for control measures the study showed that the fast surveillance of the entire community composition and structure created important added value to the general online monitoring microbial surveillance revealed system disturbances allowed for detection of process and equipment upsets and it could facilitate remediating operational actions based on the microbial community data the operator was able to track the cause of disturbance back to instability in the feed ss the problems were solved by minimising the incoming ss and removing more suspended biomass from the reactors while increasing the retention of heavy granules in the reactor through the hydrocyclones we did not use the microbial information for direct control in this study as we wanted to see how the normal control measures were reflected in the microbial data and use this information to evaluate whether changes in the microbial communities could be applied as potential alarms to select for appropriate control measures the community analysis provided important information about the identity and diversity of the important functional groups the identity of the microbes is important as knowledge about their function can be transferred from one study to another this is possible because we have used the midas reference database with species level taxonomy that can be compared across studies it is however important to further study the microbiology of full scale pn a reactors few studies exist on full scale communities and many members are likely yet to be identified speth et al 2016 zhang and okabe 2020 a number of issues should be considered in relation to applying routine dna analysis for control purposes these include sample frequency alarms based on the entire community profile or specific species and whether an alarm should be based on abundance change over time rate or based on abundance thresholds temporal changes in our case based on analyses of 2 5 samples a week in the microbial composition may form the basis for establishing alarms about potentially critical operational issues these can together with the normal online measurements provide inputs to the control strategies the most obvious measure changes in the nob aob ratio was not possible to evaluate in this study due to the very low nob abundances we expect that an nob aob ratio could be useful for surveillance of the nob and controlling oxygenation so dna surveillance can allow a tighter control with smaller safety margin in do setpoint the change in the anaob abundance may also be converted to an alarm the drop in ca brocadia abundance from day 40 65 was not directly detected in the online sensor data although perhaps indicated by the drop in no2 around day 40 along with an increase in no3 which could indicate higher nob activity and lower anaob activity but an alarm could have been triggered based on dna analysis the subsequent ca brocadia decline between day 80 and 100 was seen in the sensor data as an nh4 increase in the same period topping at 225 mg n l around day 90 which could have alerted the operator as the concentrations were above normal baseline values 10 150 during day 155 57 here dna analysis would have given the operator added information about the state of the anaob community also after the nh4 peak around day 90 the no3 concentration dropped to all time lows after day 110 low nob abundances and thus low no3 concentrations are of course desirable but the rate of decline could have alerted the operator of abnormal operation dna analysis would clarify what had appeared thus providing valuable insight about the potential cause ca brocadia remained in relatively stable abundance 2 8 between day 120 and 150 after which it dropped below 2 this drop was also visible in the sensor data as the nh4 removal efficiency decreased between day 150 and 160 in the same period an ss measurement from the laboratory showed elevated ss concentration from the digesters as indicated from the analyses of the anaerobic community e g the methanogens in this case the analysis of the flanking community gave important information revealing the heavy load of ss from the digesters and it revealed the increase in denitrifiers explaining the fairly good nitrate removal despite the lack of anaob it could be considered whether an alarm could be defined based on the relative abundance of key species originating from the digesters the approach demonstrated here for surveillance and potential control can be applied to all systems related to wastewater treatment including demon reactors however as shown here it may be difficult to interpret the microbial data and use them for active control therefore we recommend running analyses weekly or biweekly for one to two years to gain experience with the plant all plants are different to learn what is normal community structure which variations can be expected how does the community react to operational changes etc in this way the operators build up experiences that later can be used for control furthermore the community analyses could also be related to the physical structure of the granules and the spatial distribution of aob nob anaob and coexisting heterotrophic bacteria and suspended solid adhering onto the granular surface for optimized surveillance the costs are decreasing as the technology develops amplicon sequencing provides a near complete community overview in contrast to qpcr and is not much more costly with time when the genome databases are complete metagenomics will be the choice but presently we recommend amplicon sequencing our cost price to minion amplicon sequencing and chemicals is 30 40 per sample working hours when running 10 20 samples at a time we collect samples from several plants and run them weekly or biweekly at a central laboratory with the equipment and expertise necessary 4 conclusion two full scale sidestream de ammonification pn a reactors treating digester centrates were followed for one year by online sensors for the surveillance and control of operation the overall operation showed good n removal efficiencies of 85 95 although it dropped to 80 in a period the microbial communities were analysed with a resolution of 3 5 samples week by nanopore minion dna sequencing the nitrifiers consisted of one genus of aob nitrosomonas and one nob nitrospira and the anammox anaob of ca brocadia experiments with elevated levels of do in one reactor did not stimulate the growth of nob as expected an increase would have enabled monitoring of an nob aob ratio which is a potential tool for surveillance and control of aeration and operation of the reactors ca brocadia dominated the reactors during stable operation but declined substantially during a period causing poor n removal the decrease in species abundance could be detected before it affected the overall reactor performance detailed analyses of the dynamics of nitrifiers and the flanking community revealed possible causes for the poor reactor performance and enabled the operator to make changes to the operation temporal changes of several species had the potential to act as an alarm to the operator for control purposes overall the ability to obtain high resolution dna sequencing results weekly was an important supplement to the online sensor data for process surveillance understanding and control we recommend fast dna sequencing as an important tool for surveillance of the pn a process building up experiences over one to

14821,global nitrogen n pollution has resulted in increased river nitrous oxide n2o emissions which contribute to climate change however little is known about how pollution abatement conversely reduces river n2o production in a warming climate here field observations and microcosmic experiments were conducted in a coastal urbanized watershed s e china to explore the interactive effect of changing nitrate and temperature on river sediment denitrification dnf and n2o production the results showed that urban river reaches ur with higher organic carbon content and denitrifying gene abundance in sediments have a greater dnf rate nitrate removal efficiency nre and n2o concentration than agricultural river reaches ar microcosmic incubation suggested that the dnf rate and associated n2o production decreased under low nitrate addition wherein the nre increased the scenario simulation illustrated a nonlinear response of n2o production to nitrate removal i e δn2o δno3 n from both ur and ar sediments at a given temperature and the dnf rate and n2o production increased with increasing temperature an increase in temperature by 1 degree celsius would offset 18 75 of the n2o reduction by nitrate removal via dnf these findings implied that watershed pollution abatement undoubtedly contributes to the reduction in global river n2o emissions although it is partially offset by extra n2o production caused by global warming graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urbanization temperature nitrate removal nitrous oxide denitrification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction human activities have significantly altered the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen and other nutrients in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems during the past few decades conley et al 2009 fowler et al 2013 kendall et al 2007 due to the rapid rate of population growth in urban and coastal zones around the world angel et al 2011 seto et al 2011 wang et al 2021 these changes have resulted in environmental and ecological issues in aquatic ecosystems erisman et al 2013 china was experiencing a period of fast urbanization and the number of urban lands increased rapidly xuan et al 2020 which modified the original land use pattern dominated by agriculture and made the impact of nitrate pollution in the mixed land use basin more obvious xuan et al 2022b because the urban river was an important sink for urban sewage rainwater runoff and wastewater phaneuf et al 2008 a water pollution prevention and control action plan was initiated by the state council of china in 2015 so it is crucial to research the removal of nitrate from the urbanized watershed which is essential for improving the ecological health of rivers denitrification dnf and anaerobic ammonium oxidation ana are recognized as the main pathways for nitrate removal in anaerobic environments through microbial mediation burgin and hamilton 2007 dnf is a permanent sink process of nitrogen by reducing no3 n to n2o or n2 hu et al 2020 li et al 2020 thompson et al 2019 and dominates nitrogen removal in river sediments contributing over 75 howarth et al 1996 kim et al showed that dnf was the core process associated with elevated carbon and nitrogen contents and extracellular enzyme activities in riparian and stream sediments kim et al 2016 the urban rivers have an unique dnf hotspot xuan et al 2022a due to the expansion of urban areas and the resulting domestic sewage load seto et al 2012 which increases the nitrogen load and labile carbon and changes the ph and dissolved oxygen in both water bodies and sediments dong et al 2020 sickman et al 2007 williams et al 2016 xuan et al 2020 the discharge of wastewater also alters the microbial communities of sediments and further affects their activity and nitrogen conversion archana et al 2016 eckert et al 2018 quick et al 2019 however little is known about the characteristics of bacterial community structure and its relationship with nitrogen transformation in urban and agricultural rivers dnf was considered the main contributor to n2o through isotope tracing baulch et al 2011 lansdown et al 2012 quick et al 2019 which has a global warming potential gwp of 273 times greater than that of co2 and has a huge warming effect ipcc 2021 global river ecosystems emitted 46 5 55 5 gg n2o to the atmosphere per year which was considered a significant source of greenhouse gasses although the surface area was small compared to other ecosystems hu et al 2016 raymond et al 2013 stanley et al 2016 previous studies have shown that substrate concentration and temperature are important factors in the process of n2o production beaulieu et al 2008 borges et al 2018 li et al 2019 a high nitrogen load and organic matter input were conducive to the improvement of the dnf rate and n2o and the impact of nitrate on n2o production was more significant li et al 2019 which made the n2o emissions of urban rivers generally greater than those of other natural rivers beaulieu et al 2010 stow et al 2005 the increase in temperature also enhanced n2o emissions by 33 li et al 2020 however we are still unclear about the greenhouse effect generated in the process of nitrate removal on n2o reduction benefits and the potential mechanism herein a one year comprehensive field observation was conducted on the artificially affected urban river reach ur and agricultural river reach ar of the jiu river in different seasons we measured nutrients greenhouse gasses and microorganisms in water and sediment indoor incubation of dnf and ana under different nitrate concentrations and temperatures was also performed we mainly studied 1 the temporal and spatial changes in nitrate removal and n2o concentration in ur and ar 2 the main controlling factors and microbial driving mechanisms of the nitrate removal process and 3 the synergistic effect of temperature and nitrate concentration on n2o production all results were used to project the joint regulatory role of water quality improvement under global warming on dnf and n2o production and provide a theoretical basis for the control of river ecosystem pollution and n2o concentration under urbanization 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in xiamen city fujian province southeast china sampling and analysis were performed in the coastal watershed of the jiu river fig 1 its main channel is 20 55 km in length with a drainage area of 101 km2 and finally flows into the dadeng sea area from 2005 to 2015 the build up land in xiamen increased by 22 13 while the cropland decreased by 8 34 the intensification of human activities will seriously affect the biogeochemical cycle of the river ecosystem and produce a huge greenhouse effect according to the spatial distribution pattern of land use the study area was divided into ur u1 u4 and ar a1 a3 which was filled with residential areas and vegetable production carrots sesame

nutrient concentrations in surface water varied in different channels fig 2 nh4 n and no3 n were the main forms of nitrogen in both ur 37 8 and 37 8 and ar 48 4 and 31 7 surface water respectively on average the nh4 n concentration 5 67 1 70 mg l 1 in ar was 27 9 higher than that in ur 4 09 3 06 mg l 1 and the concentrations of no2 n no3 n and don in ur 0 53 0 44 4 09 2 20 and 2 11 1 69 mg l 1 were greater than those in ar 0 41 0 08 3 71 1 64 and 1 92 1 58 mg l 1 but there was no significant difference differences existed in physicochemical properties between ur and ar sediments table 1 the toc content at the ur sites 19 19 2 96 g kg 1 was significantly larger than that at the ar sites 7 20 1 79 g kg 1 p 0 05 the ratio of c n was 13 52 1 38 and 13 50 0 99 in the ur and ar sediments respectively the ph of the ur sediment 7 34 7 89 was always higher than that of the ar sediment 6 62 6 85 and the eh of the ur sediment 51 5 22 8 mv was always lower than that of the ar sediment 2 8 15 0 mv with significant differences p 0 05 ur sediments were composed of silt 54 24 3 91 and sand 45 69 4 00 while ar sediments were dominated by sand 87 37 2 38 δn2 was the main form of nitrate removal products n2 and n2o with an average contribution of 99 00 1 29 the ratios of δn2o δn2 in ur and ar were 0 11 5 95 and 0 23 0 66 respectively fig 2e table s2 the concentrations of δn2 and δn2o in ur 139 12 74 82 and 1 65 2 03 μmol l 1 were higher than those in ar 104 15 42 11 and 0 91 1 25 μmol l 1 and they both had the largest average concentration of δn2o in autumn according to the results ch4 and n2o have 27 9 and 273 0 times the gwp of co2 over a 100 year time horizon respectively of the ipcc ipcc 2021 we calculated the gwp from the concentrations of the ghgs table s2 and the average gwp in the ur was 1 66 times larger than that in the ar n2o contributed 54 15 and 49 57 to the gwp of ur and ar respectively fig s1 3 2 variations of nitrate removal in different sediments and the impact of nitrate concentration and temperature ur and ar had different nitrate removal rates and nre table 1 dnf was the dominant process for nitrate removal with contributions of 99 10 0 89 and 68 64 23 32 in the ur and ar sediments respectively the dnf rate in ur sediment 272 85 1951 29 μmol kg 1 h 1 was always significantly higher than that in ar sediment 4 23 175 22 μmol kg 1 h 1 and ur sediment 75 19 had a significantly greater nre than ar sediment 12 71 p 0 05 in different sediments the dnf and ana rates and nre varied with nitrate concentration and temperature fig 3 fig s2 table s3 dnf accounted for over 94 and the effect of ana was minimal the dnf rate in ur rose gradually with increasing no3 n 0 5 6 0 mg l 1 with a range of 88 9 1407 4 μmol kg 1 h 1 at different temperatures and always reached a maximum at 30 c the dnf rate in ar 4 1 47 70 μmol kg 1 h 1 was significantly positively correlated with temperature but the maximum rate 47 70 33 45 μmol kg 1 h 1 often occurred at 1 5 mg l 1 nitrate when above 15 c the ana rate in the ar sediment was extremely low and had no significant regularity and the ana rate in ur was below the detection limit table s3 the nre of ur 33 52 80 32 was always higher than that of ar 4 50 50 01 and ln nre was always negatively correlated with nitrate concentration but positively correlated with temperature p 0 05 3 3 functional gene abundances and microbial community structures in different sediments and the effects of temperature there were changes in the microbial community structure and functional gene abundances in the ur and ar sediments fig 4 compared with ar the microbial community richness in ur sediment was lower fig 4a and there was a clear land use clustering relationship between the two types but with no obvious seasonal change fig 4b rhodobacter 57 71 was the main denitrifier in ur followed by flavobacterium pseudomonas aeromonas and bradyrhizobium 11 82 8 03 6 61 and 4 46 respectively flavobacterium 33 27 was the main denitrifier in ar followed by pseudomonas bradyrhizobium rhodobacter and mesorhizobium 25 56 8 25 8 09 and 4 84 respectively which were selected from ncbi https www ncbi nlm nih gov fig 4b narg was always the most abundant denitrifying gene in ur 67 52 8 14 and ar 61 61 9 86 sediment except for norb in summer in ur and the abundances of all denitrifying genes in ur were always greater than those in ar sediment however the abundance of hzsb for ana in ar sediment was significantly higher than that in ur p 0 05 fig 4c the effects of temperature on denitrifier and denitrifying gene abundances were different in ur and ar sediment fig 5 the magnitude relationship of richness and denitrifying gene abundances between ur and ar was not affected by temperature but the lowest otu value was observed at 30 c and the highest denitrifying gene abundances appeared at 30 c and 25 c in ur and ar respectively fig 5a c the relative abundances of azospirillum escherichia mycobacterium pseudomonas and rhodobacter had a significant positive correlation with the dnf rates fig s3b pseudomonas was the main relatively positive denitrifier pd in the ur 16 1 1 6 and ar 5 7 1 1 sediments ur always had higher pd relative abundances than ar and reached the highest value 28 6 at 30 c while the pd relative abundances in ar increased with temperature 6 7 to 10 2 fig 5b 3 4 scenario simulation we simulated the δn2o concentration under different conditions and the δn2o concentration generated when removing a unit concentration of nitrate δn2o δno3 n according to the above conclusions fig 6 δno3 n means the reduced amount of nitrate by dnf the detailed calculation method and uncertain analysis were shown in text s5 fig s4 and text s6 the results showed that the concentration of δn2o of ur under different conditions was 1 06 8 41 times that of ar while the δn2o δno3 n of ur was only 51 72 31 66 of ar additionally the δn2o concentration in ur usually increased synchronously with temperature vt δn2o 0 06 within 30 c and nitrate concentration vn δn2o 0 32 and peaked value 4 75 μmol l 1 at 30 c 6 mg l 1 nitrate however the concentration of δn2o in ar usually increased synchronously with temperature vt δn2o 0 0005 and the peak value 0 58 μmol l 1 only appeared at 35 c 1 5 mg l 1 nitrate fig 6a b in contrast δn2o δno3 n in ur generally increased with the reduction in nitrate concentration vn δn2o δno3 n 0 10 and peaked at low temperatures 5 15 c but increased with decreasing temperature vt δn2o δno3 n 0 50 in ar fig 6c d additionally a simplified diagram was provided for understanding fig s5 furthermore our simulation results showed that the maximum contribution of n2 originated by dnf in total n2 production was 53 15 80 47 and 55 71 83 91 in ur and ar respectively the n2o produced by incomplete dnf accounted for at least 1 90 2 86 ur and 0 58 0 88 ar of the complete production by dnf the calculation process was described in text s5 and fig s4 with uncertainty analysis in text s6 4 discussion 4 1 ur had a higher dnf rate and δn2o concentration our results showed that ur had a greater dnf rate and δn2o concentration than ar table 1 table s2 this was related to the difference in characteristics between ur and ar the toc content in ur sediment was greater than that in ar sediment table 1 and the primary causes may be wastewater discharge and nonpoint source runoff carrying different petrochemical compounds sickman et al 2007 higher toc content produced nadh through the tca cycle and the degradation of carbon substrates providing more electron sources for denitrifying enzymes berks et al 1995 our analysis also showed a significant positive correlation between toc content and dnf rate p 0 05 furthermore no3 n which serves as a terminal electron acceptor for the oxidation of organic matter in anaerobic environments was conducive to increasing the dnf rate baulch et al 2011 zumft 1997 compared to arable land metropolitan areas typically have more impermeable surfaces such as roads and lawns which are conducive to nutrient and pollutant transport williams et al 2016 a previous study also found that the input of residential sewage had a substantial impact on the accumulation of nitrate in rivers xuan et al 2022b because microbial nitrification occurred during nitrate migration and before entering the river causing the retention of nitrate in the river basin billy et al 2010 lorenz and lal 2009 a 10 1 greater nitrate concentration in ur surface water fig 2 supported a larger dnf than that in ar in addition ur sediment with lower eh also provided a more favorable reduction environment table 1 which was conducive to the occurrence of dnf brettar et al 2002 masscheleyn et al 1993 denitrifiers were another driver of the dnf process which differed in ur and ar due to the variations in environmental factors fig s3c our results showed that the dominant genera of ur and ar were rhodobacter and flavobacterium respectively fig 4b which are the main denitrifiers in dnf chen et al 2018 pishgar et al 2019 song et al 2022 previous studies have shown that rhodobacter is more representative in urban estuaries newton and mclellan 2015 and less representative in low and medium trophic freshwater environments newton et al 2011 since both high nitrogen and organic matter input change the structure and functional gene abundances of denitrifiers mounier et al 2004 simek and cooper 2002 the strong positive correlation between rhodobacter and carbon contents suggested that high toc in ur resulted in a larger abundance of denitrifiers fig s3c thereby facilitating dnf li et al 2019 additionally the input of urban sewage containing denitrifying bacteria also directly led to an increase in the abundances of denitrification genes and made dnf more obvious in urban rivers xuan et al 2022a compared with ur sediments ar sediments had less gene abundance of per gram dry weight as it contained more sand which had a smaller specific surface area table 1 the relative abundances of all denitrifying genes narg nirs norb and nosz in ur were always greater than those in ar fig 4c supporting the higher dnf rate in ur however flavobacterium behaved in the opposite way which may contain lower abundances of denitrifying genes and lead to a lower dnf rate fig s3a c furthermore zhang et al found that flavobacterium may not contain a gene encoding nitrate reductase although it may progressively convert no2 n to n2 zhang et al 2022 which accounted for the lower dnf rate in ar dnf was the main production pathway of n2o which had been proven by baulch through the isotope method baulch et al 2011 our results also showed that the average ratios of δn2o δn2 were 1 40 and 0 40 in ur and ar respectively which were considered to be produced by dnf when it generally varied from 0 04 to 5 6 beaulieu et al 2011 the significant positive correlation between the abundance of the norb gene nitric oxide reductase dnf rate and δn2o concentration r 0 95 norb vs dnf r 0 98 norb vs n2o r 0 94 dnf vs n2o p 0 05 fig s3a table s2 explained the higher δn2o concentration in ur which had a higher dnf rate and norb gene abundance ur with lower norb nosz had a higher n2o production fig s6 indicating that n2o production was not controlled by the relationship of n2o production reduction harter et al 2014 it might be related to posttranscriptional regulation and enzyme activities than to transcription regulation wang et al 2018 besides nitrate and toc concentration and dnf rate were important factors for n2o production as discussed in the first paragraph garcia ruiz et al 1998 stow et al 2005 as a gas with a strong greenhouse effect 273 times the co2 gwp n2o has a great contribution to global warming ipcc 2021 previous studies have shown that the greenhouse gas emission fluxes of rivers in urban areas are generally higher than those of most natural rivers beaulieu et al 2010 and the n2o emissions in urban rivers account for 36 38 of the total regional emissions with only 5 of the area rosamond et al 2012 our results also showed that n2o accounted for 54 15 and 49 57 of the total gwp in ur and ar respectively fig s1 overall the difference in environmental factors especially carbon and nitrogen content and reduction environment caused by land use had an important impact on the abundance of denitrifiers and functional genes the dominant genera in ur were more conducive to the improvement of functional gene abundances and dnf rates and brought a higher δn2o concentration which resulted in a serious greenhouse effect 4 2 impact of increased nitrate concentration and rising temperature on dnf and nre nitrate concentration and temperature are considered key factors controlling biological metabolic cycling mulholland et al 2008 walker et al 2018 nitrate concentration controls the available substrate concentration and electron acceptor strength of dnf and temperature affected dnf by controlling microbial and enzyme activity baulch et al 2011 borges et al 2018 zumft 1997 however ur and ar had different responses to the increase in nitrate concentration ar generally reached the maximum dnf rate at 1 5 mg l 1 while ur had no limit within 6 mg l 1 this may be caused by the long term high nitrate concentration in ur gao et al 2013 gradually changing the microbial community structure which was more suitable for the growth of microorganisms rhodobacter with high demand for nutrition newton and mclellan 2015 while the low abundance of denitrifying genes in ar affected the upper limit of dnf fig 4 furthermore the ability of unit microorganisms to remove nitrate was limited which supported the reduction in nre which agreed with the discovery of mulholland mulholland et al 2008 additionally our results showed that the dnf rate of ur and ar gradually increased within 30 c which indicates that the temperature had not reached the optimal state of microorganisms a previous study carried out in an expanded granular sludge bed reactor also showed that the optimal reaction temperature was 15 35 c at which point nearly complete denitrification was achieved liao et al 2018 furthermore the relative abundances of pd and denitrifying genes narg nirs norb nosz fig 5b c were the main factors that caused the dnf rate and nre to change with temperature fig s3b this suggested that even though pd may be lower in abundance it contained a higher abundance of denitrifying genes and alterations in pd caused by warming would have a greater impact on the dnf rate and nre additionally warming facilitated the mineralization of organic nitrogen in sediments while increasing inorganic nitrogen influx provided enough dnf substrate and accelerated its rate kadlec and reddy 2001 silvennoinen et al 2008 a reduction in the dnf rate and nre occurred when the temperature exceeded 30 c in ur fig s2 due to the limit of optimal survival of pd we concluded that within a certain range the rising temperature would increase the abundance of denitrifying functional genes the increase in pd relative abundance accompanied by the denitrifying functional genes was an important factor in promoting the dnf rate and nre the low response range 1 5 mg l 1 to the concentration of nitrate in ar made it more sensitive to temperature however the decreased nitrate concentration inhibited the dnf but improved the nre which indicated a more complete nitrate removal ability in the low n river after pollution abatement 4 3 environmental implication since nitrate is a proximal regulator of dnf it was thought to have a significant impact on the change in the dnf instantaneous rate beaulieu et al 2011 quick et al 2016 and the increase in nitrate significantly increased the concentration of δn2o through the data we collected n 250 p 0 001 r2 0 44 fig s7a many studies held that reducing nitrate input was a direct and efficient strategy to minimize n2o emissions beaulieu et al 2011 yan et al 2012 although our results also showed that the reduction of nitrate would decrease the concentration of δn2o δn2o δno3 n was also increased because no2 n would continue to accumulate before no3 n was completely exhausted within the removal capacity of microorganisms and then the next step of reduction would be carried out du et al 2016 a lower concentration of nitrate was more conducive to achieving the production conditions of n2o due to its higher nre fig 3 compared with the high no3 n ur the low no3 n ur with pollution abatement would produce relatively more n2o when removing per concentration of no3 n through dnf however there was no significant correlation between temperature and n2o in the collected data n 136 fig s7b since the temperature during the sampling period was usually stable and the difference in nitrate concentration was more obvious thus covering up the impact of temperature furthermore our results demonstrated the impact of temperature on n2o by variable controlling implying that the n2o increase brought by unit temperature rise within 30 c offset 18 75 of the reduction of n2o brought by unit nitrate removal in ur fig 6a this indicated that global warming may offset the n2o reduction benefits caused by nitrate abatement overall we should not only reconsider the strategy of continuous pollution reduction but also consider making the dnf reaction more complete additionally developing measuring criteria for reducing pollution and carbon emissions would help control pollutants with more direct guidance 5 conclusions 1 a greater dnf rate nre and n2o concentration were found in the ur sediments than in the ar sediments in the urbanized jiu river watershed which was consistent with the higher organic carbon content and denitrifying gene abundance accordingly 2 microcosmic incubation suggested that the ur sediment dnf rate and n2o production decreased with low nitrate addition but the nre increased resulting in a relatively high n2o production per unit of no3 n removal via dnf the nonlinear response of n2o production to nitrate removal indicated that pollution abatement would not reduce n2o production in equal proportion which required more efforts to control the greenhouse effect caused by n2o 3 the river sediment dnf rate and n2o production increased with increasing temperatures global warming temperature rise will favor dnf and produce extra n2o which partially offsets n2o reduction through the implementation of n pollution abatement programs the current results provide an important reference for coordinating watershed nutrient management and the control of n2o production in similar rivers in china and globally credit authorship

14821,global nitrogen n pollution has resulted in increased river nitrous oxide n2o emissions which contribute to climate change however little is known about how pollution abatement conversely reduces river n2o production in a warming climate here field observations and microcosmic experiments were conducted in a coastal urbanized watershed s e china to explore the interactive effect of changing nitrate and temperature on river sediment denitrification dnf and n2o production the results showed that urban river reaches ur with higher organic carbon content and denitrifying gene abundance in sediments have a greater dnf rate nitrate removal efficiency nre and n2o concentration than agricultural river reaches ar microcosmic incubation suggested that the dnf rate and associated n2o production decreased under low nitrate addition wherein the nre increased the scenario simulation illustrated a nonlinear response of n2o production to nitrate removal i e δn2o δno3 n from both ur and ar sediments at a given temperature and the dnf rate and n2o production increased with increasing temperature an increase in temperature by 1 degree celsius would offset 18 75 of the n2o reduction by nitrate removal via dnf these findings implied that watershed pollution abatement undoubtedly contributes to the reduction in global river n2o emissions although it is partially offset by extra n2o production caused by global warming graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urbanization temperature nitrate removal nitrous oxide denitrification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction human activities have significantly altered the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen and other nutrients in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems during the past few decades conley et al 2009 fowler et al 2013 kendall et al 2007 due to the rapid rate of population growth in urban and coastal zones around the world angel et al 2011 seto et al 2011 wang et al 2021 these changes have resulted in environmental and ecological issues in aquatic ecosystems erisman et al 2013 china was experiencing a period of fast urbanization and the number of urban lands increased rapidly xuan et al 2020 which modified the original land use pattern dominated by agriculture and made the impact of nitrate pollution in the mixed land use basin more obvious xuan et al 2022b because the urban river was an important sink for urban sewage rainwater runoff and wastewater phaneuf et al 2008 a water pollution prevention and control action plan was initiated by the state council of china in 2015 so it is crucial to research the removal of nitrate from the urbanized watershed which is essential for improving the ecological health of rivers denitrification dnf and anaerobic ammonium oxidation ana are recognized as the main pathways for nitrate removal in anaerobic environments through microbial mediation burgin and hamilton 2007 dnf is a permanent sink process of nitrogen by reducing no3 n to n2o or n2 hu et al 2020 li et al 2020 thompson et al 2019 and dominates nitrogen removal in river sediments contributing over 75 howarth et al 1996 kim et al showed that dnf was the core process associated with elevated carbon and nitrogen contents and extracellular enzyme activities in riparian and stream sediments kim et al 2016 the urban rivers have an unique dnf hotspot xuan et al 2022a due to the expansion of urban areas and the resulting domestic sewage load seto et al 2012 which increases the nitrogen load and labile carbon and changes the ph and dissolved oxygen in both water bodies and sediments dong et al 2020 sickman et al 2007 williams et al 2016 xuan et al 2020 the discharge of wastewater also alters the microbial communities of sediments and further affects their activity and nitrogen conversion archana et al 2016 eckert et al 2018 quick et al 2019 however little is known about the characteristics of bacterial community structure and its relationship with nitrogen transformation in urban and agricultural rivers dnf was considered the main contributor to n2o through isotope tracing baulch et al 2011 lansdown et al 2012 quick et al 2019 which has a global warming potential gwp of 273 times greater than that of co2 and has a huge warming effect ipcc 2021 global river ecosystems emitted 46 5 55 5 gg n2o to the atmosphere per year which was considered a significant source of greenhouse gasses although the surface area was small compared to other ecosystems hu et al 2016 raymond et al 2013 stanley et al 2016 previous studies have shown that substrate concentration and temperature are important factors in the process of n2o production beaulieu et al 2008 borges et al 2018 li et al 2019 a high nitrogen load and organic matter input were conducive to the improvement of the dnf rate and n2o and the impact of nitrate on n2o production was more significant li et al 2019 which made the n2o emissions of urban rivers generally greater than those of other natural rivers beaulieu et al 2010 stow et al 2005 the increase in temperature also enhanced n2o emissions by 33 li et al 2020 however we are still unclear about the greenhouse effect generated in the process of nitrate removal on n2o reduction benefits and the potential mechanism herein a one year comprehensive field observation was conducted on the artificially affected urban river reach ur and agricultural river reach ar of the jiu river in different seasons we measured nutrients greenhouse gasses and microorganisms in water and sediment indoor incubation of dnf and ana under different nitrate concentrations and temperatures was also performed we mainly studied 1 the temporal and spatial changes in nitrate removal and n2o concentration in ur and ar 2 the main controlling factors and microbial driving mechanisms of the nitrate removal process and 3 the synergistic effect of temperature and nitrate concentration on n2o production all results were used to project the joint regulatory role of water quality improvement under global warming on dnf and n2o production and provide a theoretical basis for the control of river ecosystem pollution and n2o concentration under urbanization 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is in xiamen city fujian province southeast china sampling and analysis were performed in the coastal watershed of the jiu river fig 1 its main channel is 20 55 km in length with a drainage area of 101 km2 and finally flows into the dadeng sea area from 2005 to 2015 the build up land in xiamen increased by 22 13 while the cropland decreased by 8 34 the intensification of human activities will seriously affect the biogeochemical cycle of the river ecosystem and produce a huge greenhouse effect according to the spatial distribution pattern of land use the study area was divided into ur u1 u4 and ar a1 a3 which was filled with residential areas and vegetable production carrots sesame and pitaya respectively the land use within the 500 m buffer zone upstream direction of each station is shown in table s1 2 2 sampling campaigns and laboratory pretreatment we conducted samplings in

nutrient concentrations in surface water varied in different channels fig 2 nh4 n and no3 n were the main forms of nitrogen in both ur 37 8 and 37 8 and ar 48 4 and 31 7 surface water respectively on average the nh4 n concentration 5 67 1 70 mg l 1 in ar was 27 9 higher than that in ur 4 09 3 06 mg l 1 and the concentrations of no2 n no3 n and don in ur 0 53 0 44 4 09 2 20 and 2 11 1 69 mg l 1 were greater than those in ar 0 41 0 08 3 71 1 64 and 1 92 1 58 mg l 1 but there was no significant difference differences existed in physicochemical properties between ur and ar sediments table 1 the toc content at the ur sites 19 19 2 96 g kg 1 was significantly larger than that at the ar sites 7 20 1 79 g kg 1 p 0 05 the ratio of c n was 13 52 1 38 and 13 50 0 99 in the ur and ar sediments respectively the ph of the ur sediment 7 34 7 89 was always higher than that of the ar sediment 6 62 6 85 and the eh of the ur sediment 51 5 22 8 mv was always lower than that of the ar sediment 2 8 15 0 mv with significant differences p 0 05 ur sediments were composed of silt 54 24 3 91 and sand 45 69 4 00 while ar sediments were dominated by sand 87 37 2 38 δn2 was the main form of nitrate removal products n2 and n2o with an average contribution of 99 00 1 29 the ratios of δn2o δn2 in ur and ar were 0 11 5 95 and 0 23 0 66 respectively fig 2e table s2 the concentrations of δn2 and δn2o in ur 139 12 74 82 and 1 65 2 03 μmol l 1 were higher than those in ar 104 15 42 11 and 0 91 1 25 μmol l 1 and they both had the largest average concentration of δn2o in autumn according to the results ch4 and n2o have 27 9 and 273 0 times the gwp of co2 over a 100 year time horizon respectively of the ipcc ipcc 2021 we calculated the gwp from the concentrations of the ghgs table s2 and the average gwp in the ur was 1 66 times larger than that in the ar n2o contributed 54 15 and 49 57 to the gwp of ur and ar respectively fig s1 3 2 variations of nitrate removal in different sediments and the impact of nitrate concentration and temperature ur and ar had different nitrate removal rates and nre table 1 dnf was the dominant process for nitrate removal with contributions of 99 10 0 89 and 68 64 23 32 in the ur and ar sediments respectively the dnf rate in ur sediment 272 85 1951 29 μmol kg 1 h 1 was always significantly higher than that in ar sediment 4 23 175 22 μmol kg 1 h 1 and ur sediment 75 19 had a significantly greater nre than ar sediment 12 71 p 0 05 in different sediments the dnf and ana rates and nre varied with nitrate concentration and temperature fig 3 fig s2 table s3 dnf accounted for over 94 and the effect of ana was minimal the dnf rate in ur rose gradually with increasing no3 n 0 5 6 0 mg l 1 with a range of 88 9 1407 4 μmol kg 1 h 1 at different temperatures and always reached a maximum at 30 c the dnf rate in ar 4 1 47 70 μmol kg 1 h 1 was significantly positively correlated with temperature but the maximum rate 47 70 33 45 μmol kg 1 h 1 often occurred at 1 5 mg l 1 nitrate when above 15 c the ana rate in the ar sediment was extremely low and had no significant regularity and the ana rate in ur was below the detection limit table s3 the nre of ur 33 52 80 32 was always higher than that of ar 4 50 50 01 and ln nre was always negatively correlated with nitrate concentration but positively correlated with temperature p 0 05 3 3 functional gene abundances and microbial community structures in different sediments and the effects of temperature there were changes in the microbial community structure and functional gene abundances in the ur and ar sediments fig 4 compared with ar the microbial community richness in ur sediment was lower fig 4a and there was a clear land use clustering relationship between the two types but with no obvious seasonal change fig 4b rhodobacter 57 71 was the main denitrifier in ur followed by flavobacterium pseudomonas aeromonas and bradyrhizobium 11 82 8 03 6 61 and 4 46 respectively flavobacterium 33 27 was the main denitrifier in ar followed by pseudomonas bradyrhizobium rhodobacter and mesorhizobium 25 56 8 25 8 09 and 4 84 respectively which were selected from ncbi https www ncbi nlm nih gov fig 4b narg was always the most abundant denitrifying gene in ur 67 52 8 14 and ar 61 61 9 86 sediment except for norb in summer in ur and the abundances of all denitrifying genes in ur were always greater than those in ar sediment however the abundance of hzsb for ana in ar sediment was significantly higher than that in ur p 0 05 fig 4c the effects of temperature on denitrifier and denitrifying gene abundances were different in ur and ar sediment fig 5 the magnitude relationship of richness and denitrifying gene abundances between ur and ar was not affected by temperature but the lowest otu value was observed at 30 c and the highest denitrifying gene abundances appeared at 30 c and 25 c in ur and ar respectively fig 5a c the relative abundances of azospirillum escherichia mycobacterium pseudomonas and rhodobacter had a significant positive correlation with the dnf rates fig s3b pseudomonas was the main relatively positive denitrifier pd in the ur 16 1 1 6 and ar 5 7 1 1 sediments ur always had higher pd relative abundances than ar and reached the highest value 28 6 at 30 c while the pd relative abundances in ar increased with temperature 6 7 to 10 2 fig 5b 3 4 scenario simulation we simulated the δn2o concentration under different conditions and the δn2o concentration generated when removing a unit concentration of nitrate δn2o δno3 n according to the above conclusions fig 6 δno3 n means the reduced amount of nitrate by dnf the detailed calculation method and uncertain analysis were shown in text s5 fig s4 and text s6 the results showed that the concentration of δn2o of ur under different conditions was 1 06 8 41 times that of ar while the δn2o δno3 n of ur was only 51 72 31 66 of ar additionally the δn2o concentration in ur usually increased synchronously with temperature vt δn2o 0 06 within 30 c and nitrate concentration vn δn2o 0 32 and peaked value 4 75 μmol l 1 at 30 c 6 mg l 1 nitrate however the concentration of δn2o in ar usually increased synchronously with temperature vt δn2o 0 0005 and the peak value 0 58 μmol l 1 only appeared at 35 c 1 5 mg l 1 nitrate fig 6a b in contrast δn2o δno3 n in ur generally increased with the reduction in nitrate concentration vn δn2o δno3 n 0 10 and peaked at low temperatures 5 15 c but increased with decreasing temperature vt δn2o δno3 n 0 50 in ar fig 6c d additionally a simplified diagram was provided for understanding fig s5 furthermore our simulation results showed that the maximum contribution of n2 originated by dnf in total n2 production was 53 15 80 47 and 55 71 83 91 in ur and ar respectively the n2o produced by incomplete dnf accounted for at least 1 90 2 86 ur and 0 58 0 88 ar of the complete production by dnf the calculation process was described in text s5 and fig s4 with uncertainty analysis in text s6 4 discussion 4 1 ur had a higher dnf rate and δn2o concentration our results showed that ur had a greater dnf rate and δn2o concentration than ar table 1 table s2 this was related to the difference in characteristics between ur and ar the toc content in ur sediment was greater than that in ar sediment table 1 and the primary causes may be wastewater discharge and nonpoint source runoff carrying different petrochemical compounds sickman et al 2007 higher toc content produced nadh through the tca cycle and the degradation of carbon substrates providing more electron sources for denitrifying enzymes berks et al 1995 our analysis also showed a significant positive correlation between toc content and dnf rate p 0 05 furthermore no3 n which serves as a terminal electron acceptor for the oxidation of organic matter in anaerobic environments was conducive to increasing the dnf rate baulch et al 2011 zumft 1997 compared to arable land metropolitan areas typically have more impermeable surfaces such as roads and lawns which are conducive to nutrient and pollutant transport williams et al 2016 a previous study also found that the input of residential sewage had a substantial impact on the accumulation of nitrate in rivers xuan et al 2022b because microbial nitrification occurred during nitrate migration and before entering the river causing the retention of nitrate in the river basin billy et al 2010 lorenz and lal 2009 a 10 1 greater nitrate concentration in ur surface water fig 2 supported a larger dnf than that in ar in addition ur sediment with lower eh also provided a more favorable reduction environment table 1 which was conducive to the occurrence of dnf brettar et al 2002 masscheleyn et al 1993 denitrifiers were another driver of the dnf process which differed in ur and ar due to the variations in environmental factors fig s3c our results showed that the dominant genera of ur and ar were rhodobacter and flavobacterium respectively fig 4b which are the main denitrifiers in dnf chen et al 2018 pishgar et al 2019 song et al 2022 previous studies have shown that rhodobacter is more representative in urban estuaries newton and mclellan 2015 and less representative in low and medium trophic freshwater environments newton et al 2011 since both high nitrogen and organic matter input change the structure and functional gene abundances of denitrifiers mounier et al 2004 simek and cooper 2002 the strong positive correlation between rhodobacter and carbon contents suggested that high toc in ur resulted in a larger abundance of denitrifiers fig s3c thereby facilitating dnf li et al 2019 additionally the input of urban sewage containing denitrifying bacteria also directly led to an increase in the abundances of denitrification genes and made dnf more obvious in urban rivers xuan et al 2022a compared with ur sediments ar sediments had less gene abundance of per gram dry weight as it contained more sand which had a smaller specific surface area table 1 the relative abundances of all denitrifying genes narg nirs norb and nosz in ur were always greater than those in ar fig 4c supporting the higher dnf rate in ur however flavobacterium behaved in the opposite way which may contain lower abundances of denitrifying genes and lead to a lower dnf rate fig s3a c furthermore zhang et al found that flavobacterium may not contain a gene encoding nitrate reductase although it may progressively convert no2 n to n2 zhang et al 2022 which accounted for the lower dnf rate in ar dnf was the main production pathway of n2o which had been proven by baulch through the isotope method baulch et al 2011 our results also showed that the average ratios of δn2o δn2 were 1 40 and 0 40 in ur and ar respectively which were considered to be produced by dnf when it generally varied from 0 04 to 5 6 beaulieu et al 2011 the significant positive correlation between the abundance of the norb gene nitric oxide reductase dnf rate and δn2o concentration r 0 95 norb vs dnf r 0 98 norb vs n2o r 0 94 dnf vs n2o p 0 05 fig s3a table s2 explained the higher δn2o concentration in ur which had a higher dnf rate and norb gene abundance ur with lower norb nosz had a higher n2o production fig s6 indicating that n2o production was not controlled by the relationship of n2o production reduction harter et al 2014 it might be related to posttranscriptional regulation and enzyme activities than to transcription regulation wang et al 2018 besides nitrate and toc concentration and dnf rate were important factors for n2o production as discussed in the first paragraph garcia ruiz et al 1998 stow et al 2005 as a gas with a strong greenhouse effect 273 times the co2 gwp n2o has a great contribution to global warming ipcc 2021 previous studies have shown that the greenhouse gas emission fluxes of rivers in urban areas are generally higher than those of most natural rivers beaulieu et al 2010 and the n2o emissions in urban rivers account for 36 38 of the total regional emissions with only 5 of the area rosamond et al 2012 our results also showed that n2o accounted for 54 15 and 49 57 of the total gwp in ur and ar respectively fig s1 overall the difference in environmental factors especially carbon and nitrogen content and reduction environment caused by land use had an important impact on the abundance of denitrifiers and functional genes the dominant genera in ur were more conducive to the improvement of functional gene abundances and dnf rates and brought a higher δn2o concentration which resulted in a serious greenhouse effect 4 2 impact of increased nitrate concentration and rising temperature on dnf and nre nitrate concentration and temperature are considered key factors controlling biological metabolic cycling mulholland et al 2008 walker et al 2018 nitrate concentration controls the available substrate concentration and electron acceptor strength of dnf and temperature affected dnf by controlling microbial and enzyme activity baulch et al 2011 borges et al 2018 zumft 1997 however ur and ar had different responses to the increase in nitrate concentration ar generally reached the maximum dnf rate at 1 5 mg l 1 while ur had no limit within 6 mg l 1 this may be caused by the long term high nitrate concentration in ur gao et al 2013 gradually changing the microbial community structure which was more suitable for the growth of microorganisms rhodobacter with high demand for nutrition newton and mclellan 2015 while the low abundance of denitrifying genes in ar affected the upper limit of dnf fig 4 furthermore the ability of unit microorganisms to remove nitrate was limited which supported the reduction in nre which agreed with the discovery of mulholland mulholland et al 2008 additionally our results showed that the dnf rate of ur and ar gradually increased within 30 c which indicates that the temperature had not reached the optimal state of microorganisms a previous study carried out in an expanded granular sludge bed reactor also showed that the optimal reaction temperature was 15 35 c at which point nearly complete denitrification was achieved liao et al 2018 furthermore the relative abundances of pd and denitrifying genes narg nirs norb nosz fig 5b c were the main factors that caused the dnf rate and nre to change with temperature fig s3b this suggested that even though pd may be lower in abundance it contained a higher abundance of denitrifying genes and alterations in pd caused by warming would have a greater impact on the dnf rate and nre additionally warming facilitated the mineralization of organic nitrogen in sediments while increasing inorganic nitrogen influx provided enough dnf substrate and accelerated its rate kadlec and reddy 2001 silvennoinen et al 2008 a reduction in the dnf rate and nre occurred when the temperature exceeded 30 c in ur fig s2 due to the limit of optimal survival of pd we concluded that within a certain range the rising temperature would increase the abundance of denitrifying functional genes the increase in pd relative abundance accompanied by the denitrifying functional genes was an important factor in promoting the dnf rate and nre the low response range 1 5 mg l 1 to the concentration of nitrate in ar made it more sensitive to temperature however the decreased nitrate concentration inhibited the dnf but improved the nre which indicated a more complete nitrate removal ability in the low n river after pollution abatement 4 3 environmental implication since nitrate is a proximal regulator of dnf it was thought to have a significant impact on the change in the dnf instantaneous rate beaulieu et al 2011 quick et al 2016 and the increase in nitrate significantly increased the concentration of δn2o through the data we collected n 250 p 0 001 r2 0 44 fig s7a many studies held that reducing nitrate input was a direct and efficient strategy to minimize n2o emissions beaulieu et al 2011 yan et al 2012 although our results also showed that the reduction of nitrate would decrease the concentration of δn2o δn2o δno3 n was also increased because no2 n would continue to accumulate before no3 n was completely exhausted within the removal capacity of microorganisms and then the next step of reduction would be carried out du et al 2016 a lower concentration of nitrate was more conducive to achieving the production conditions of n2o due to its higher nre fig 3 compared with the high no3 n ur the low no3 n ur with pollution abatement would produce relatively more n2o when removing per concentration of no3 n through dnf however there was no significant correlation between temperature and n2o in the collected data n 136 fig s7b since the temperature during the sampling period was usually stable and the difference in nitrate concentration was more obvious thus covering up the impact of temperature furthermore our results demonstrated the impact of temperature on n2o by variable controlling implying that the n2o increase brought by unit temperature rise within 30 c offset 18 75 of the reduction of n2o brought by unit nitrate removal in ur fig 6a this indicated that global warming may offset the n2o reduction benefits caused by nitrate abatement overall we should not only reconsider the strategy of continuous pollution reduction but also consider making the dnf reaction more complete additionally developing measuring criteria for reducing pollution and carbon emissions would help control pollutants with more direct guidance 5 conclusions 1 a greater dnf rate nre and n2o concentration were found in the ur sediments than in the ar sediments in the urbanized jiu river watershed which was consistent with the higher organic carbon content and denitrifying gene abundance accordingly 2 microcosmic incubation suggested that the ur sediment dnf rate and n2o production decreased with low nitrate addition but the nre increased resulting in a relatively high n2o production per unit of no3 n removal via dnf the nonlinear response of n2o production to nitrate removal indicated that pollution abatement would not reduce n2o production in equal proportion which required more efforts to control the greenhouse effect caused by n2o 3 the river sediment dnf rate and n2o production increased with increasing temperatures global warming temperature rise will favor dnf and produce extra n2o which partially offsets n2o reduction through the implementation of n pollution abatement programs the current results provide an important reference for coordinating watershed nutrient management and the control of n2o production in similar rivers in china and globally credit authorship

14822,hydrophobic modified flocculants have demonstrated considerable promise in the removal of emerging contaminants by flocculation however there is a lack of information about the impacts of dosing such flocculants on the performance of subsequent treatment unit s in the overall water treatment process in this work inspired by the ubiquitous protein folding phenomenon an innovative approach using an elevated membrane cleaning temperature as the means to induce residual hydrophobic modified chitosan flocculant trc after flocculation sedimentation to reduce membrane fouling in a subsequent ultrafiltration was proposed this was evaluated in a continuous flocculation sedimentation ultrafiltration fsuf process treating samples of the yangtze river the hydrophobic chains of trc had similar temperature dependent hydrophobicity to those of natural proteins in the 40 day operation of the fsuf system with combined dosing of alum and trc a moderately elevated cleaning water temperature 45 c of both backwash with air bubbling and soaking with sponge scrubbing cleaning significantly reduced reversible and irreversible fouling resistance by 49 8 61 3 and 73 9 83 3 respectively compared to the system using cleaning water at 25 c material flow analysis statistical analysis instrumental characterizations and computational simulations showed that the enhanced fouling mitigation originated from three factors the reduced contaminant accumulation onto membranes the strengthened membrane surface modification role of trc and the weakened structure of the fouling material containing trc at the elevated cleaning temperature other measures of the performance these being water purification membrane stability and economic aspects also confirmed the potential and feasibility of the proposed approach this work has provided new insights into the role of hydrophobic modified flocculants in membrane fouling control in addition to emerging contaminant removal in a fsuf surface water treatment process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrophobic modified flocculant membrane cleaning temperature fouling control surface water treatment flocculation ultrafiltration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the contamination of surface water used for drinking water sources by either conventional or emerging contaminants has continued to increase and poses a serious threat to drinking water security larsen et al 2016 improved drinking water treatment technologies as a response are continuously being developed among them the flocculation sedimentation ultrafiltration fsuf hybrid process train has the merits of a compact continuous treatment flow simple operation and maintenance no secondary pollution risk of contaminant degradation e g by oxidation relatively low cost and high treated water quality as such it has attracted considerable attention and been applied in many drinking water treatment plants dwtps gan et al 2021 long et al 2021 in the fsuf process the flocculation sedimentation fs prior to uf acts as an efficient pretreatment to reduce membrane fouling causing contaminants involving inorganic suspended solids iss and natural organic matter nom ma et al 2014 in addition unsettled residual micro flocs i e flocculant contaminant complexes after sedimentation can be effectively retained by uf which gives rise to an improved quality of the produced water liu et al 2017 despite the above synergistic effects between fs and uf the application of the combined process still has shortcomings that require improvement with regard to current and future concerns in water treatment one of the most enduring challenges for all kinds of membrane filtration based technologies is membrane fouling control xu et al 2021 fs pretreatment alone has been found to be insufficiently effective for fouling mitigation during the long term running of fsuf su et al 2021 the accumulation of residual flocculants especially those with high molecular weight mw he et al 2021 as well as micro flocs on the membrane may induce or aggravate fouling leading to unavoidable flux decline and increased operating cost xu et al 2021 therefore alternative approaches involving membrane surface modification and optimization of operation process such as membrane cleaning methods guo et al 2021 li et al 2022 have been proposed for fouling control in recent years there has been increasing concern in the drinking water supply industry about the contamination of source waters by emerging organic contaminants eocs such as the well known anthropogenic antibiotics wilkinson et al 2017 and how to effectively remove the eocs by the well established fsuf process in existing dwtps yang et al 2022 conventional flocculants either organic e g polyacrylamide pam and its derivatives or inorganic e g al or fe salts despite their high performance for iss and nom removal have been shown to be ineffective for the removal of small sized antibiotic molecules demissie et al 2021 to address this a promising approach recently reported is to develop new flocculants through chemical modification of conventional hydrophilic flocculants for example chitosan metal hydroxides etc with moderately hydrophobic organic chains demissie et al 2021 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2022 yang et al 2020 by doing so the hydrophobic association between the hydrophobic modified flocculants and small antibiotic molecules can be strengthened liu et al 2019 wang et al 2022 yang et al 2020 thereby enabling greater binding of antibiotics into floc particles during flocculation and removal by subsequent sedimentation the benefit of strengthening the hydrophobicity of flocculants dosed in the flocculation unit is not only that it can increase the water purification capacity enhancing the treatment efficacy for eoc removal as reported liu et al 2019 wang et al 2022 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 but also that it may increase other aspects of performance in particular the formation during filtration and destruction during membrane cleaning of foulant materials on the membrane surface in the subsequent uf unit ho et al 2022 this latter aspect has not been fully studied as yet and is inspired by the ubiquitous protein folding phenomenon in nature colvin et al 2016 dill et al 2008 as has been acknowledged water mediated hydrophobic association plays a vital role in protein folding through which tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins with mature functions are achieved eisenberg and sawaya 2016 the apolar segments of proteins form hydrophobic cores whereas the polar and charged chains make up the stabilized water exposed surface of proteins walti et al 2016 similarly it is suggested that the hydrophobic chains of the residual hydrophobic modified flocculants after fs be tightly bound onto the hydrophobic surface of ultrafiltration membranes such as the commonly used polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes through hydrophobic association whereas the hydrophilic and charged chains of flocculants form a stabilized water exposed surface in this way residual hydrophboic modifed flocculants after fs exert a surface modification effect on uf membrane which can provide a protective hydration layer on the membrane surface to inhibit fouling formation although a part of the residual hydrophobic modified flocculants will participate in the above proposed in situ membrane surface modification another part will become involved in influencing the nature of the fouling li and elimelech 2004 on the used membrane inspired by the structural changes of proteins with the variation of temperature wolfenden et al 2015 structure of fouling deposits containing hydrophobically modified flocculants may also change at different temperatures this may bring about new opportunities for developing more efficient membrane cleaning modes e g by adjusting the cleaning water temperature by revisiting the features of protein folding it was recognized that the strength of hydrophobic association is temperature dependent thus with the rise of temperature the hydrophobicity of most of the hydrophobic chains in proteins increases and the original stable tertiary or quaternary structure of proteins may be weakened baldwin 1986 wolfenden et al 2015 based on this it was hypothesized that the temperature responsive characteristic of hydrophobic chains could possibly be utilized for the destruction of membrane fouling by an environmental benign and chemical free membrane cleaning method thus as residual hydrophobic modified flocculants enter the inside of the membrane fouling layer and act as one of the building materials increasing the cleaning water temperature may induce the flocculants to decrease the stability of the fouling structure from within promoting the release of material under turbulence caused by the backwash with air bubbling soaking with scrubbing or other techniques however little information is known about this approach for membrane cleaning and fouling control in the continuous flow fsuf process with the dosing of hydrophobic modified flocculants in this work the hypothesis of using membrane cleaning temperature as the means of reducing fouling in the long term operation of a continuous flow fsuf process with the dosing of hydrophobic modified flocculant was evaluated for the first time to achieve this laboratory experiments were carried out raw water samples collected from the yangtze river were employed chitosan modified with thermo responsive hydrophobic chains denoted as trc as well as commercial alum and pam for comparison was selected as the flocculant both backwash with air bubbling b a cleaning and soaking with sponge scrubbing s s cleaning were employed for membrane cleaning and the effects of the b a and s s cleaning temperatures on fouling control were studied the underlying mechanisms of fouling reduction were clarified with evidence from material flow analysis statistical analysis instrumental characterizations and computational simulations the results of this work present a new proof of concept approach to the control of membrane fouling in the fsuf process and are expected to provide new insights into the role of hydrophobic modified flocculants in surface water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples and flocculants raw water from the yangtze river was sampled in august 2021 at caishi dwtp ma anshan city anhui province china supporting information si fig s1 to represent micro polluted surface water contaminated by trace antibiotics the samples were spiked with stock solutions of four commonly detected antibiotics sulfamethoxazole smx norfloxacin nor tetracycline tc and roxithromycin rox dalian meilun biotechnol co dalian liaoning province china physicochemical parameters in the si table s1 to reach a concentration of 0 1 μg l of each before the water treatment tests water quality parameters are listed in table 1 the hydrophobic modified flocculant trc with optimized structural parameters as shown in fig 1a according to the authors previous work wang et al 2022 was synthesized by grafting thermo responsive hydrophobic chains poly n iso propylacrylamide pnipam onto chitosan viscosity average mw 820 kda deacetylation degree 86 shandong aokang biotechnol co jinan shandong province china the detailed synthesis method as well as characterization results are given in the si text s1 and fig s2 alum and pam were purchased from nanjing chem reagent co nanjing jiangsu province china 2 2 water treatment tests continuous flow fsuf tests were conducted using a parallel continuous flow apparatus schematic description of the experimental set up shown in fig 1b at 25 for 40 days to evaluate the performance of membrane fouling control and water purification the flow rate was maintained at 12 l day throughout the flocculant coagulant dosages used in the fsuf process tests were optimized by preliminary jar tests operation details in the si text s2 the results of jar tests removal efficiencies res dosage profiles depicted in the si fig s3 were consistent with those reported in previous literature melo guimaraes et al 2013 demissie et al 2021 neither alum nor pam could effectively remove trace antibiotics but trc exhibited improved res for both conventional parameters re turbidity and re doc 90 and trace antibiotics res 72 92 compared to alum and pam successive dosing of the inorganic alum 6 mg l and organic trc 4 mg l demonstrated enhanced cost effectiveness by increasing the res and decreasing the optimal dosages of trc as alum was effective in the removal of conventional contaminants iss and nom this enabled trc dosed subsequently to be used where it was most effective for antibiotic removal wang et al 2022 the corresponding optimal dosages of flocculant coagulant were dosed in the first flocculation tank the mechanical stirring speeds of the four flocculation tanks were 200 150 100 and 50 rpm as shown in fig 1b respectively the hydraulic retention time hrt of each flocculation tank the inclined plate sedimentation tank and the submerged uf tank were 5 60 and 30 min respectively a cluster of pvdf hollow fiber uf membranes hangzhou haotian co hangzhou zhejiang province china with pore size of 20 nm surface area of 0 025 m2 and inner outer diameter of 1 0 1 4 mm were employed in the uf tank b a cleaning involving backwash 0 66 l m2 min accompanied with air bubbling 2 5 l min for 1 min was performed after every 0 5 h of operation s s cleaning by soaking the membrane in water for 5 min accompanied with sponge scrubbing details provided in the si text s3 was performed after every 13 day period in addition to cleaning at 25 c a reduced 5 c and an elevated 45 c temperature representing a relatively significant difference were also tested for both b a and s s cleaning to investigate the effects of cleaning temperatures on fouling control as proposed above considering the aspects of energy consumption which increases with temperature elevation above ambient and microorganism growth which can be inhibited at a temperature above the normal maximum temperature for the process related microorganisms the elevated temperature selected in the cleaning tests was 45 c this temperature could be facilely achieved using industrial low grade waste heat via a heat exchanger if the concept of using elevated cleaning temperature for fouling control was to be promoted to large scale practical applications adhikary et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 membrane fouling represented by trans membrane pressure tmp was monitored reversible rev m 1 and irreversible fouling resistances irr m 1 defined as the related material that is able or unable to be removed by the s s cleaning respectively were calculated according to equations eqs 1 and 2 guo et al 2021 1 r e v t m p b t m p a μ j 2 i r r t m p a t m p 0 μ j where tmp0 tmpb and tmpa pa are the tmp values at the beginning of the testing day 0 before and after s s cleaning respectively μ is the viscosity pa s of water and j m3 m2 s is the flux water quality parameters of the effluents after the fourth flocculation tank the sedimentation tank and the uf tank respectively were continuously measured every day detailed methods provided in the si text s4 among them the concentrations of trc were determined by a fluorescent labeling technique details of the technique as well as its feasibility verification are provided in the si text s4 and figs s4 s7 to exclude the impact of material adsorption onto the inner surface of the fsuf apparatus controlled experiments were conducted to calibrate the results each data point was the average from three parallel experiments 2 3 material flow analysis mfa statistical analysis instrumental characterizations and computational simulations mfa to summarize the main material path was carried out using sankey diagrams graedel 2019 van vuuren et al 2019 principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis of the mfa results were conducted using ibm spss statistics 20 software details of analytical instruments and methods involving measurements of water contact angles wcas zeta potentials zps and sizes of trc sem and afm observations fouling cake layer thickness determination mechanical property tests pore size distribution analysis and measurements of floc size and fractal dimension df representing the compactness of porous materials are described in the si text s4 s5 and fig s8 computational simulations of molecular structures and the corresponding binding energies of different molecular pairs were performed using materials studio 2019 software chen et al 2019 liu et al 2019 with detailed information provided in the si text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermo responsiveness of trc the thermo responsiveness of the hydrophobic modified flocculant is the key premise of the above hypothesized membrane cleaning method that involves regulating the washing temperature therefore the thermo responsiveness of trc was tested the variations of the wca of trc transmittance of trc aqueous solution and zp and size of trc in water at different temperatures are plotted in fig 1c as wca is commonly used to represent the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of materials cui et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the upward trend of the wca temperature curve indicated that trc became more hydrophobic at the elevated temperature the original transparent transmittance 90 trc aqueous solution 1 g l at 5 c became opaque milky white with the increase of temperature since the heightened hydrophobicity reduced the solubility specifically the critical temperature point representing the switch for solution transparency which is called the lower critical solution temperature lcst of thermo responsive materials wang et al 1998 was determined to be 34 c si fig s9 the average size of trc underwent a decline from 372 nm at 5 c to 126 nm at 45 c and higher temperature gave rise to lower zp chitosan backbones with protonated amino groups were positively charged lupa et al 2022 whereas pnipam typically showed more negative zp due to the adsorption of oh ions at higher temperatures when its structure collapsed utashiro et al 2016 hence the downward zp temperature curve of trc was attributed to the collapsed pnipam chains with more adsorbed oh ions which suppressed the positive charges of chitosan the md computation results of pnipam chains of trc in fig 1d displayed the temperature dependent behaviour of the pnipam chain which was similar to that of hydrophobic chains of protein in the folding process baldwin 1986 wolfenden et al 2015 fewer intermolecular pnipam water h bonds 53 34 and 20 at 5 25 and 45 c respectively but more intramolecular h bonds within the pnipam chain 10 17 and 22 at 5 25 and 45 c respectively were formed at higher temperatures engendering the collapsed chain in contrast the chitosan chain did not change much at various temperatures the si fig s10 potential link between the temperature dependent bahaviour of the pnipam chains of trc to fouling control performance will be described later 3 2 membrane fouling control performance 3 2 1 effect of flocculant coagulant type the rise in tmp indicating membrane fouling development for different fsuf systems with the single dosing of alum pam and trc and the combined dosing of alum and trc denoted as alum trc over the 40 days of operation 3 membrane cycles stages is illustrated in fig 2a the tmp increased steadily during each stage before s s cleaning among the fsuf systems with the single dosing of flocculant coagulant the trc system displayed the slowest tmp growth rate the tmp at day 40 was 13 75 kpa in the trc system which was much less than the values 19 25 and 21 55 kpa respectively in the alum and pam systems when the trc was combined with alum a further improvement in fouling development was achieved with the final tmp decreasing to 11 95 kpa the s s cleaning at the end of each stage was effective in the removal of rev with a substantial tmp decline the remaining fouling resistance corresponded to the irr both rev and irr in the different flocculant coagulant systems are depicted in fig 2b the advantages of the alum trc system over the other three systems in fouling mitigation were shown in the enhanced reduction of both rev and irr as stated above in section 2 2 the successive dosing of alum and trc can remove more potential fouling causing materials prior to uf compared to the dosing of any single flocculant coagulant si fig s3 in addition another reason for the enhanced fouling reduction was attributed to the effective membrane surface modification effect of residual trc in the uf feed water which was supported by both experimental and computational results si figs s11 s12 specifically when the uf membranes were used for direct filtration without any pretreatment of raw water si fig s11 alum solution and trc solution the wcas of used membranes were always lower than that of the pristine membrane indicating that each of the hydrophilic materials originating from the raw water alum and trc contributed to the hydrophilization of the uf membrane surface among them trc made the most contribution with the lowest wca value chemical computations demonstrated that the hydrophobic pnipam chain had a much larger be with pvdf the matrix material of the uf membrane via hydrophobic association than the chitosan backbone other coagulant flocculant or any of the main contaminants in residual micro flocs the si fig s12 hence similar to the association of hydrophobic segments in proteins pnipam chains of residual trc and the hydrophobic pvdf chains on the uf membrane surface could be tightly bound whereas the hydrophilic charged chitosan of trc or other compositions of micro flocs formed a water exposed surface which provided a protective hydration layer to inhibit accumulation of fouling material 3 2 2 effects of cleaning temperatures the pnipam chains of trc were found to be important in membrane surface modification in the alum trc system as the hydrophobicity of the pnipam chains are temperature dependent the effects of both b a and s s cleaning temperature on the fouling control performance in the system were studied the tmp development as well as rev and irr are depicted in figs 2c d in which the fsuf system denoted by x c y c referred to a cleaning mode with b a cleaning at x c and s s cleaning at y c the variations in the b a cleaning temperature generated significant differences in tmp growth from the first day fig 2c an elevated backwash water temperature x 45 c was beneficial for slowing down tmp growth whereas the lower temperature x 5 c was detrimental with more severe fouling the b a cleaning every 30 min gradually amplified the above differences in the following 39 days at day 40 the average tmp of the two systems with b a cleaning temperatures of 5 c reached 15 75 kpa while the average of the other two systems with b a cleaning temperatures of 45 c was 6 08 kpa similar to the influence of b a cleaning temperature a higher s s cleaning water temperature promoted the decline of tmp however the influence of the s s cleaning temperature was less than that of the b a cleaning temperature the 45 c 45 c cleaning mode in the fsuf system had the best performance fig 2c d compared to the conventional cleaning process at room temperature the approach of moderately increasing the cleaning temperature in the alum trc system substantially reduced the rev and irr by 49 8 61 3 and 73 9 83 3 respectively fig 2d however in the fsuf system using alum alone as the coagulant the elevated temperature did not affect the tmp variation rev and irr the si fig s13 this implied that although the increase of temperature will lead to intensified activity of water molecules the contribution of the intensified activity to fouling mitigation was small the significant fouling reduction at the elevated temperature in the alum trc system was more likely attributable to the temperature responsiveness of trc which will be considered subsequently in section 3 3 in addition to tmp the surface morphology of the used membranes at day 40 was examined using sem and afm to show directly the membrane fouling before the final s s cleaning in stage 3 the membranes with cake layers on the surfaces were observed using sem images in fig 3a f demonstrated that cake layers in the systems with b a cleaning at both 25 c fig 3b and 5 c fig 3e f covered nearly the whole membrane surface with a compact structure in contrast loose cake layers with obvious cracks were found in the two systems with elevated b a cleaning temperature fig 3c d between them an elevated s s cleaning temperature in stages 1 and 2 also made the cake layers looser and thinner with larger cracks fig 3c the sem observations implied that the raised cleaning temperature effectively damaged the cake layers which was beneficial to lowering hydraulic resistance during the uf operation subsequently after cake layers were removed by s s cleaning for the last time the surfaces of the used membranes with only irreversible fouling were observed using afm fig 3g l among afm images the system with the 45 c 45 c cleaning mode had the smallest surface roughness rq of 0 216 the closest to the value of a pristine membrane indicating the effectiveness of elevated cleaning temperature in the mitigation of irreversible fouling taking the rq value of the 25 c 25 c mode as the reference irrespective of the s s cleaning temperature the membrane surfaces in the two systems with a b a cleaning temperature of 45 c had a smaller rq whereas those in the other two systems with a b a cleaning of 5 c had a larger rq such a result confirmed the dominant influence of the b a cleaning temperature over the s s cleaning temperature on irreversible fouling control 3 3 mechanisms for the membrane cleaning approach based on temperature regulation the above results confirmed the effectiveness of increasing cleaning temperature for fouling control in the fsuf system with the dosing of trc to reveal the mechanisms an in depth investigation involving statistical analyses instrumental characterizations and chemical computations was carried out as follows 3 3 1 impact on the accumulation of contaminants on the membranes the flows of the principal materials in solution involving inorganic iss and organic total organic carbon toc substances total phosphorous tp trc and alum which might impact membrane fouling in the fsuf process were visualized using sankey diagrams as shown in fig 4a and the si fig s14 these diagrams have been widely employed for performing the path analytics and understanding the potential links of complex data graedel 2019 van vuuren et al 2019 control tests using raw water without spiked antibiotics as a reference demonstrated that the influence of antibiotics on fouling could be neglected see details in the si fig s15 since the concentrations of spiked antibiotics were 4 log units lower than the above mentioned principal materials in water hence antibiotic flows were not analyzed here as illustrated in fig 4a and the si fig s14 material flows in the flocculation and sedimentation units were the same in the fsuf systems with different cleaning modes as the same fs operation parameters were used after sedimentation the residual materials in the uf feed water were divided into three parts involving those in the fouling material on the membrane in the sludge at the uf tank bottom and in the final produced water as materials adhering to the membranes directly influence their permeability pca and correlation analysis of the final tmp value and different percentages of materials on the membranes were performed as depicted in fig 4b c according to pca loading plots fig 4b only one statistically significant principal component pc1 was found explaining 96 99 of the total variance a considerably high value to show the accurate description of the real experimental data by the pca model with respect to pc1 different variables were grouped into two species the positive value tmp and percentages of alum iss tp and toc on the membrane and the negative value species percentage of trc it could be inferred that trc left on the membrane inhibited the accumulation of iss toc and tp and the increase of tmp the linear correlation between tmp and other variables in fig 4c provided quantitative data describing the relationships iss toc and tp on the membranes which could generate inorganic organic and bio fouling gao et al 2011 li et al 2023 respectively were positively correlated with tmp with large regression coefficients r2 the amounts of iss toc or tp accumulated on the final membrane in the 45 c 45 c system was the lowest among the five systems indicating that the increased cleaning temperature effectively alleviated accumulation of these contaminants this further weakened the mass transfer of small sized contaminants those smaller than 20 nm in the effluent after fs as shown in the si fig s16 from the membrane surface to the pores as depicted in the pore size distribution curves of the used membranes after the final s s cleaning fig 4d although peaks and the average pore sizes shifted towards smaller values after use due to the blockage of pores those in the 45 c 45 c system were the closest to the corresponding values of the pristine membrane 3 3 2 impact on the surface modification of uf regarding the impact of externally dosed coagulant and flocculant on the uf membrane the results in fig 4c showed that alum and trc had opposite influences on tmp the amount of alum on the membrane was positively slope 0 correlated r2 0 781 with tmp implying that the residual coagulant on the membrane aggravated inorganic fouling ma et al 2014 however the inverse correlation slope 0 between tmp and trc left on the membrane was found to be more significant r2 0 984 this indicated that the hydrophobic modified flocculant deposited on the membrane did not intensify organic fouling but was conducive to fouling reduction among the five systems the largest amount of trc but lowest amount of alum left on the membranes appeared in the 45 c 45 c system fig 4c giving rise to the lowest tmp at the end of the fsuf operation in the same system the most significant surface modification effect with the lowest wca value of the used membrane fig 4e was found hence similar to the strengthened hydrophobic association of hydrophobic chains in proteins at elevated temperatures baldwin 1986 wolfenden et al 2015 the increase of cleaning temperature strengthens the membrane surface modification role of trc direct evidence to support this was provided by the computed bes of different fragments adsorbed onto the pvdf interface in water at different temperatures as illustrated in fig 5 the fragments of trc chitosan and pnipam chains nom and iss using kaolin as a representative were computed according to fig 5 at any temperature the be of the pnipam pvdf complexes formed by hydrophobic association were notably greater than those of other complexes confirming that the surface modification effect of trc was unlikely to be significantly affected by the coexistence of other contaminants for the pnipam pvdf complexes fig 5a c the rise of temperature remarkably enhanced the hydrophobic association with be values from 15 25 kcal mol at 5 c to 40 56 kcal mol at 45 c this was consistent with previous findings in protein folding that hydrophobic association was an entropy increase driven process eisenberg and sawaya 2016 for which the elevated temperature was favored according to thermodynamic relationships consequently the membrane surface modification effect of trc was strengthened by both the b a and ss cleaning at an elevated temperature 3 3 3 impact on the structure of fouling on the membrane as well as inhibiting contaminant accumulation and strengthening the surface modification effect of trc the increased cleaning temperature can affect the structure of fouling on the membrane which may be similar to the impact of temperature on the protein structure building materials of the fouling deposits involving the coagulant the flocculant iss nom and so on were the same to those of flocs generated in the same fsuf system thus the influence of temperature on fouling structure was qualitatively similar to that on the floc structure of which the in situ characterizations have been well established yang et al 2013 the real time variations of floc size and fractal dimension df at different temperatures and velocity gradients g values were monitored and are shown in fig 6a b in the tests prior to changing the water temperature the starting point t 0 min flocs were fully grown under a rapid mix at g 128 s 1 for 5 min and a subsequent flocculation at g 16 s 1 for 15 min at 25 c subsequently three stages of experiments at different temperatures were successively designed and conducted involving stage 1 at the unchanged g value 16 s 1 stage 2 for floc breakage at g 128 s 1 and stage 3 for floc regrowth at g 16 s 1 a floc strength factor f1 and regrowth factor f2 under different conditions were calculated 3 f 1 d 2 d 1 4 f 2 d 3 d 2 d 1 d 2 where d1 d2 and d3 were the floc sizes at the end of stages 1 2 and 3 respectively as depicted in fig 6a b in stage 1 although the g value was kept unchanged the higher temperature induced the flocs to became slightly smaller and less compact df decline spontaneously this implied that the increased temperature weakened floc stability such an effect was enhanced at a greater g value in stage 2 flocs at 45 c with a lower f1 value were much more easily broken than flocs at the other two temperatures therefore it could be inferred through a reasonable analogy that fouling material with a destabilized structure at the elevated temperature was more easily degraded and removed from the membrane under turbulent conditions caused by cleaning furthermore the results in stage 3 demonstrated that the regrowth capacity of the broken flocs at 45 c was the worst substantial decline of f2 value in other words the increased temperature caused more severe irreversible damage to the structure of flocs as well as to that of the fouling material analogously the collapsed trc structure at the elevated temperature causes the fouling material to become unstable and thus be removed more easily the temperature induced structural damage was also related to the thermo responsiveness of pnipam chains according to the computed bes of pnipam nom and pnipam iss complexes fig 6c h with the rise of temperature the bes representing the stability of both complexes decreased since trc nom and iss were the main building materials of fouling ho et al 2022 the fouling structure was thus weakened 3 4 evaluation of other measures of performance water purification membrane stability and economic aspects other important measures of performance of the fsuf process involving water purification membrane stability and economic aspects which might be influenced by the elevated cleaning temperature were evaluated as follows 3 4 1 water purification water quality improvement is a priority goal of water treatment and it was important to establish whether the elevated cleaning temperature would affect the produced water quality the quality of the produced water by the different fsuf systems is summarized in the si figs s6 and s17 the dosing of trc in the fsuf process remarkably improved the res of the antibiotics si fig s15 due to the enhanced hydrophobic association between the hydrophobic modified flocculant and antibiotics as previously reported wang et al 2022 for the alum trc system which had the highest res of the antibiotics si fig s17 changing the cleaning temperature in the uf tank did not lead to significant differences in water quality si fig s6 this was attributed to the fact that the major contribution to contaminant removal occurred in the fs stage despite this compared to other cleaning modes the minor improvement rather than a deterioration of res of contaminants in the 45 c 45 c system si fig s18 eliminated any concerns about adverse water quality impacts by the elevating temperature cleaning approach the minor improvement of res was ascribed to the improved cleaning performance at the higher temperature which inhibited penetration mass transfer of contaminants through the membrane as aforementioned in addition to the contaminants in the produced water attention was also given to the presence of residual trc and al3 considering the potential risks associated with the flocculant and the coagulant for trc both the natural chitosan backbones and the pnipam chains widely used for in vivo drug delivery of trc are environmentally benign and biocompatible polymers sun et al 2014 in addition according to the test results fig 4a trc was not detected in the final produced water since the size of trc fig 1c was much larger than the uf membrane pores with respect to residual al ions according to the sankey diagram in fig 4a the al concentration in the produced water was 0 027 mg l which is much lower than the upper limit 0 2 mg l in chinese national standards for drinking water quality gb 5749 2022 therefore it was concluded that the successive dosing of trc and alum in the fsuf system did not pose significant direct risks to the produced water quality 3 4 2 membrane stability pvdf is well known for its high chemical stability with heat resistance liu et al 2011 despite this the physical stability of the membranes under the conditions of repeated temperature changes was uncertain the stress strain curves of the pristine membrane and used membranes after the final s s cleaning for the different fsuf systems are shown in the si fig s19 which indicated a negligible difference in behavior among all the membranes this result demonstrated that the elevated cleaning water temperature did not appear to affect the mechanical integrity of the uf membranes on the other hand as previously mentioned in section 3 3 1 although membrane pores were blocked to various degrees after use in all fsuf systems fig 4d the degree of pore blockage in the 45 c 45 c system was the lowest thus compared to the conventionally operated 25 c 25 c mode the elevated cleaning temperature slightly improved the pore structure stability of the membrane 3 4 3 economic analysis a preliminary analysis of the economic feasibility of applying an elevated cleaning temperature approach was explored in view of the additional cost of energy for heating the cleaning water for the b a and s s che operations by assuming the use of industrial low grade waste heat e g industrial cooling water at 90 c adhikary et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 for heating the cleaning water at an initial temperature of 25 c in large scale applications as a basis the che was calculated 5 c h e p p u c w m b a m s s t c l e a n i n g t i n i t i a l t c w t c l e a n i n g ε where ppucw cny kg is the price per unit of industrial cooling water at 90 c mba kg and mss kg are the total massmass of water used for b a and s s cleaning respectively tcleaning c tinitial c and tcw c are the temperatures of backwash or soaking water 45 c initial water 25 c and the used industrial cooling water 90 c respectively ε is the heat exchange efficiency based on the values as given in the si table s2 the che for the 40 days of fsuf operation 480 l of treated water in total was 0 097 chinese yuan cny that is to say the cost was 0 202 cny us 0 029 m3 of water for the elevated cleaning temperature approach to significantly alleviate membrane fouling the reductions of rev and irr were 49 8 61 3 and 73 9 83 3 respectively as mentioned above as well as the very low energy cost the mitigated fouling during the uf operation could save i pumping energy costs one of the major operational expenses due to fouling jafari et al 2021 porcelli and judd 2010 ii membrane replacement costs another of the major operational expenses when the membrane service lifetime is reached after extensive fouling formation jafari et al 2021 porcelli and judd 2010 and iii chemicals such as acids and bases in conventional membrane cleaning considering these aspects it could be regarded as potentially economically feasible to apply the proposed cleaning approach by raising the cleaning water temperature to mitigate fouling 4 conclusions the hydrophobic modified flocculant trc was found to have temperature dependent hydrophobicity which was similar to the characteristics of natural proteins inspired by the protein folding phenomenon the approach of using membrane cleaning temperature as the trigger to induce deposited residual trc after fs to reduce subsequent uf fouling was proposed and verified in this work the alum trc fsuf system was found to have notable advantages in fouling control over the conventional alum system a moderately elevated cleaning water temperature 45 c applied in both b a and s s cleaning in the alum trc system gave rise to substantial reductions in rev and irr of 49 8 61 3 and 73 9 83 3 respectively of which the elevated temperature of b a cleaning contributed the major part the mechanisms for the enhanced fouling mitigation performance of the novel approach were i inhibited contaminant accumulation onto membranes ii the strengthened membrane surface modification effect of trc and iii the weakened structure of the foulant layer at the elevated cleaning temperature other key measures of performance involving water purification membrane stability and economic aspects also confirmed the advantages and feasibility of the novel approach in summary this work has demonstrated more beneficial role of hydrophobic modified flocculants in the treatment of surface water by a flocculation

14822,hydrophobic modified flocculants have demonstrated considerable promise in the removal of emerging contaminants by flocculation however there is a lack of information about the impacts of dosing such flocculants on the performance of subsequent treatment unit s in the overall water treatment process in this work inspired by the ubiquitous protein folding phenomenon an innovative approach using an elevated membrane cleaning temperature as the means to induce residual hydrophobic modified chitosan flocculant trc after flocculation sedimentation to reduce membrane fouling in a subsequent ultrafiltration was proposed this was evaluated in a continuous flocculation sedimentation ultrafiltration fsuf process treating samples of the yangtze river the hydrophobic chains of trc had similar temperature dependent hydrophobicity to those of natural proteins in the 40 day operation of the fsuf system with combined dosing of alum and trc a moderately elevated cleaning water temperature 45 c of both backwash with air bubbling and soaking with sponge scrubbing cleaning significantly reduced reversible and irreversible fouling resistance by 49 8 61 3 and 73 9 83 3 respectively compared to the system using cleaning water at 25 c material flow analysis statistical analysis instrumental characterizations and computational simulations showed that the enhanced fouling mitigation originated from three factors the reduced contaminant accumulation onto membranes the strengthened membrane surface modification role of trc and the weakened structure of the fouling material containing trc at the elevated cleaning temperature other measures of the performance these being water purification membrane stability and economic aspects also confirmed the potential and feasibility of the proposed approach this work has provided new insights into the role of hydrophobic modified flocculants in membrane fouling control in addition to emerging contaminant removal in a fsuf surface water treatment process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrophobic modified flocculant membrane cleaning temperature fouling control surface water treatment flocculation ultrafiltration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the contamination of surface water used for drinking water sources by either conventional or emerging contaminants has continued to increase and poses a serious threat to drinking water security larsen et al 2016 improved drinking water treatment technologies as a response are continuously being developed among them the flocculation sedimentation ultrafiltration fsuf hybrid process train has the merits of a compact continuous treatment flow simple operation and maintenance no secondary pollution risk of contaminant degradation e g by oxidation relatively low cost and high treated water quality as such it has attracted considerable attention and been applied in many drinking water treatment plants dwtps gan et al 2021 long et al 2021 in the fsuf process the flocculation sedimentation fs prior to uf acts as an efficient pretreatment to reduce membrane fouling causing contaminants involving inorganic suspended solids iss and natural organic matter nom ma et al 2014 in addition unsettled residual micro flocs i e flocculant contaminant complexes after sedimentation can be effectively retained by uf which gives rise to an improved quality of the produced water liu et al 2017 despite the above synergistic effects between fs and uf the application of the combined process still has shortcomings that require improvement with regard to current and future concerns in water treatment one of the most enduring challenges for all kinds of membrane filtration based technologies is membrane fouling control xu et al 2021 fs pretreatment alone has been found to be insufficiently effective for fouling mitigation during the long term running of fsuf su et al 2021 the accumulation of residual flocculants especially those with high molecular weight mw he et al 2021 as well as micro flocs on the membrane may induce or aggravate fouling leading to unavoidable flux decline and increased operating cost xu et al 2021 therefore alternative approaches involving membrane surface modification and optimization of operation process such as membrane cleaning methods guo et al 2021 li et al 2022 have been proposed for fouling control in recent years there has been increasing concern in the drinking water supply industry about the contamination of source waters by emerging organic contaminants eocs such as the well known anthropogenic antibiotics wilkinson et al 2017 and how to effectively remove the eocs by the well established fsuf process in existing dwtps yang et al 2022 conventional flocculants either organic e g polyacrylamide pam and its derivatives or inorganic e g al or fe salts despite their high performance for iss and nom removal have been shown to be ineffective for the removal of small sized antibiotic molecules demissie et al 2021 to address this a promising approach recently reported is to develop new flocculants through chemical modification of conventional hydrophilic flocculants for example chitosan metal hydroxides etc with moderately hydrophobic organic chains demissie et al 2021 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2022 yang et al 2020 by doing so the hydrophobic association between the hydrophobic modified flocculants and small antibiotic molecules can be strengthened liu et al 2019 wang et al 2022 yang et al 2020 thereby enabling greater binding of antibiotics into floc particles during flocculation and removal by subsequent sedimentation the benefit of strengthening the hydrophobicity of flocculants dosed in the flocculation unit is not only that it can increase the water purification capacity enhancing the treatment efficacy for eoc removal as reported liu et al 2019 wang et al 2022 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 but also that it may increase other aspects of performance in particular the formation during filtration and destruction during membrane cleaning of foulant materials on the membrane surface in the subsequent uf unit ho et al 2022 this latter aspect has not been fully studied as yet and is inspired by the ubiquitous protein folding phenomenon in nature colvin et al 2016 dill et al 2008 as has been acknowledged water mediated hydrophobic association plays a vital role in protein folding through which tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins with mature functions are achieved eisenberg and sawaya 2016 the apolar segments of proteins form hydrophobic cores whereas the polar and charged chains make up the stabilized water exposed surface of proteins walti et al 2016 similarly it is suggested that the hydrophobic chains of the residual hydrophobic modified flocculants after fs be tightly bound onto the hydrophobic surface of ultrafiltration membranes such as the commonly used polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes through hydrophobic association whereas the hydrophilic and charged chains of flocculants form a stabilized water exposed surface in this way residual hydrophboic modifed flocculants after fs exert a surface modification effect on uf membrane which can provide a protective hydration layer on the membrane surface to inhibit fouling formation although a part of the residual hydrophobic modified flocculants will participate in the above proposed in situ membrane surface modification another part will become involved in influencing the nature of the fouling li and elimelech 2004 on the used membrane inspired by the structural changes of proteins with the variation of temperature wolfenden et al 2015 structure of fouling deposits containing hydrophobically modified flocculants may also change at different temperatures this may bring about new opportunities for developing more efficient membrane cleaning modes e g by adjusting the cleaning water temperature by revisiting the features of protein folding it was recognized that the strength of hydrophobic association is temperature dependent thus with the rise of temperature the hydrophobicity of most of the hydrophobic chains in proteins increases and the original stable tertiary or quaternary structure of proteins may be weakened baldwin 1986 wolfenden et al 2015 based on this it was hypothesized that the temperature responsive characteristic of hydrophobic chains could possibly be utilized for the destruction of membrane fouling by an environmental benign and chemical free membrane cleaning method thus as residual hydrophobic modified flocculants enter the inside of the membrane fouling layer and act as one of the building materials increasing the cleaning water temperature may induce the flocculants to decrease the stability of the fouling structure from within promoting the release of material under turbulence caused by the backwash with air bubbling soaking with scrubbing or other techniques however little information is known about this approach for membrane cleaning and fouling control in the continuous flow fsuf process with the dosing of hydrophobic modified flocculants in this work the hypothesis of using membrane cleaning temperature as the means of reducing fouling in the long term operation of a continuous flow fsuf process with the dosing of hydrophobic modified flocculant was evaluated for the first time to achieve this laboratory experiments were carried out raw water samples collected from the yangtze river were employed chitosan modified with thermo responsive hydrophobic chains denoted as trc as well as commercial alum and pam for comparison was selected as the flocculant both backwash with air bubbling b a cleaning and soaking with sponge scrubbing s s cleaning were employed for membrane cleaning and the effects of the b a and s s cleaning temperatures on fouling control were studied the underlying mechanisms of fouling reduction were clarified with evidence from material flow analysis statistical analysis instrumental characterizations and computational simulations the results of this work present a new proof of concept approach to the control of membrane fouling in the fsuf process and are expected to provide new insights into the role of hydrophobic modified flocculants in surface water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples and flocculants raw water from the yangtze river was sampled in august 2021 at caishi dwtp ma anshan city anhui province china supporting information si fig s1 to represent micro polluted surface water contaminated by trace antibiotics the samples were spiked with stock solutions of four commonly detected antibiotics sulfamethoxazole smx norfloxacin nor tetracycline tc and roxithromycin rox dalian meilun biotechnol co dalian liaoning province china physicochemical parameters in the si table s1 to reach a concentration of 0 1 μg l of each before the water treatment tests water quality parameters are listed in table 1 the hydrophobic modified flocculant trc with optimized structural parameters as shown in fig 1a according to the authors previous work wang et al 2022 was synthesized by grafting thermo responsive hydrophobic chains poly n iso propylacrylamide pnipam onto chitosan viscosity average mw 820 kda deacetylation degree 86 shandong aokang biotechnol co jinan shandong province china the detailed synthesis method as well as characterization results are given in the si text s1 and fig s2 alum and pam were purchased from nanjing chem reagent co nanjing jiangsu province china 2 2 water treatment tests continuous flow fsuf tests were conducted using a parallel continuous flow apparatus schematic description of the experimental set up shown in fig 1b at 25 for 40 days to evaluate the performance of membrane fouling control and water purification the flow rate was maintained at 12 l day throughout the flocculant coagulant dosages used in the fsuf process tests were optimized by preliminary jar tests operation details in the si text s2 the results of jar tests removal efficiencies res dosage profiles depicted in the si fig s3 were consistent with those reported in previous literature melo guimaraes et al 2013 demissie et al 2021 neither alum nor pam could effectively remove trace antibiotics but trc exhibited improved res for both conventional parameters re turbidity and re doc 90 and trace antibiotics res 72 92 compared to alum and pam successive dosing of the inorganic alum 6 mg l and organic trc 4 mg l demonstrated enhanced cost effectiveness by increasing the res and decreasing the optimal dosages of trc as alum was effective in the removal of conventional contaminants iss and nom this enabled trc dosed subsequently to be used where it was most effective for antibiotic removal wang et al 2022 the corresponding optimal dosages of flocculant coagulant were dosed in the first flocculation tank the mechanical stirring speeds of the four flocculation tanks were 200 150 100 and 50 rpm as shown in fig 1b respectively the hydraulic retention time hrt of each flocculation tank the inclined plate sedimentation tank and the submerged uf tank were 5 60 and 30 min respectively a cluster of pvdf hollow fiber uf membranes hangzhou haotian co hangzhou zhejiang province china with pore size of 20 nm surface area of 0 025 m2 and inner outer diameter of 1 0 1 4 mm were employed in the uf tank b a cleaning involving backwash 0 66 l m2 min accompanied with air bubbling 2 5 l min for 1 min was performed after every 0 5 h of operation s s cleaning by soaking the membrane in water for 5 min accompanied with sponge scrubbing details provided in the si text s3 was performed after every 13 day period in addition to cleaning at 25 c a reduced 5 c and an elevated 45 c temperature representing a relatively significant difference were also tested for both b a and s s cleaning to investigate the effects of cleaning temperatures on fouling control as proposed above considering the aspects of energy consumption which increases with temperature elevation above ambient and microorganism growth which can be inhibited at a temperature above the normal maximum temperature for the process related microorganisms the elevated temperature selected in the cleaning tests was 45 c this temperature could be facilely achieved using industrial low grade waste heat via a heat exchanger if the concept of using elevated cleaning temperature for fouling control was to be promoted to large scale practical applications adhikary et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 membrane fouling represented by trans membrane pressure tmp was monitored reversible rev m 1 and irreversible fouling resistances irr m 1 defined as the related material that is able or unable to be removed by the s s cleaning respectively were calculated according to equations eqs 1 and 2 guo et al 2021 1 r e v t m p b t m p a μ j 2 i r r t m p a t m p 0 μ j where tmp0 tmpb and tmpa pa are the tmp values at the beginning of the testing day 0 before and after s s cleaning respectively μ is the viscosity pa s of water and j m3 m2 s is the flux water quality parameters of the effluents after the fourth flocculation tank the sedimentation tank and the uf tank respectively were continuously measured every day detailed methods provided in the si text s4 among them the concentrations of trc were determined by a fluorescent labeling technique details of the technique as well as its feasibility verification are provided in the si text s4 and figs s4 s7 to exclude the impact of material adsorption onto the inner surface of the fsuf apparatus controlled experiments were conducted to calibrate the results each data point was the average from three parallel experiments 2 3 material flow analysis mfa statistical analysis instrumental characterizations and computational simulations mfa to summarize the main material path was carried out using sankey diagrams graedel 2019 van vuuren et al 2019 principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis of the mfa results were conducted using ibm spss statistics 20 software details of analytical instruments and methods involving measurements of water contact angles wcas zeta potentials zps and sizes of trc sem and afm observations fouling cake layer thickness determination mechanical property tests pore size distribution analysis and measurements of floc size and fractal dimension df representing the compactness of porous materials are described in the si text s4 s5 and fig s8 computational simulations of molecular structures and the corresponding binding energies of different molecular pairs were performed using materials studio 2019 software chen et al 2019 liu et al 2019 with detailed information provided in the si text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermo responsiveness of trc the thermo responsiveness of the hydrophobic modified flocculant is the key premise of the above hypothesized membrane cleaning method that involves regulating the washing temperature therefore the thermo responsiveness of trc was tested the variations of the wca of trc transmittance of trc aqueous solution and zp and size of trc in water at different temperatures are plotted in fig 1c as wca is commonly used to represent the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of materials cui et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the upward trend of the wca temperature curve indicated that trc became more hydrophobic at the elevated temperature the original transparent transmittance 90 trc aqueous solution 1 g l at 5 c became opaque milky white with the increase of temperature since the heightened hydrophobicity reduced the solubility specifically the critical temperature point representing the switch for solution transparency which is called the lower critical solution temperature lcst of thermo responsive materials wang et al 1998 was determined to be 34 c si fig s9 the average size of trc underwent a decline from 372 nm at 5 c to 126 nm at 45 c and higher temperature gave rise to lower zp chitosan backbones with protonated amino groups were positively charged lupa et al 2022 whereas pnipam typically showed more negative zp due to the adsorption of oh ions at higher temperatures when its structure collapsed utashiro et al 2016 hence the downward zp temperature curve of trc was attributed to the collapsed pnipam chains with more adsorbed oh ions which suppressed the positive charges of chitosan the md computation results of pnipam chains of trc in fig 1d displayed the temperature dependent behaviour of the pnipam chain which was similar to that of hydrophobic chains of protein in the folding process baldwin 1986 wolfenden et al 2015 fewer intermolecular pnipam water h bonds 53 34 and 20 at 5 25 and 45 c respectively but more intramolecular h bonds within the pnipam chain 10 17 and 22 at 5 25 and 45 c respectively were formed at higher temperatures engendering the collapsed chain in contrast the chitosan chain did not change much at various temperatures the si fig s10 potential link between the temperature dependent bahaviour of the pnipam chains of trc to fouling control performance will be described later 3 2 membrane fouling control performance 3 2 1 effect of flocculant coagulant type the rise in tmp indicating membrane fouling development for different fsuf systems with the single dosing of alum pam and trc and the combined dosing of alum and trc denoted as alum trc over the 40 days of operation 3 membrane cycles stages is illustrated in fig 2a the tmp increased steadily during each stage before s s cleaning among the fsuf systems with the single dosing of flocculant coagulant the trc system displayed the slowest tmp growth rate the tmp at day 40 was 13 75 kpa in the trc system which was much less than the values 19 25 and 21 55 kpa respectively in the alum and pam systems when the trc was combined with alum a further improvement in fouling development was achieved with the final tmp decreasing to 11 95 kpa the s s cleaning at the end of each stage was effective in the removal of rev with a substantial tmp decline the remaining fouling resistance corresponded to the irr both rev and irr in the different flocculant coagulant systems are depicted in fig 2b the advantages of the alum trc system over the other three systems in fouling mitigation were shown in the enhanced reduction of both rev and irr as stated above in section 2 2 the successive dosing of alum and trc can remove more potential fouling causing materials prior to uf compared to the dosing of any single flocculant coagulant si fig s3 in addition another reason for the enhanced fouling reduction was attributed to the effective membrane surface modification effect of residual trc in the uf feed water which was supported by both experimental and computational results si figs s11 s12 specifically when the uf membranes were used for direct filtration without any pretreatment of raw water si fig s11 alum solution and trc solution the wcas of used membranes were always lower than that of the pristine membrane indicating that each of the hydrophilic materials originating from the raw water alum and trc contributed to the hydrophilization of the uf membrane surface among them trc made the most contribution with the lowest wca value chemical computations demonstrated that the hydrophobic pnipam chain had a much larger be with pvdf the matrix material of the uf membrane via hydrophobic association than the chitosan backbone other coagulant flocculant or any of the main contaminants in residual micro flocs the si fig s12 hence similar to the association of hydrophobic segments in proteins pnipam chains of residual trc and the hydrophobic pvdf chains on the uf membrane surface could be tightly bound whereas the hydrophilic charged chitosan of trc or other compositions of micro flocs formed a water exposed surface which provided a protective hydration layer to inhibit accumulation of fouling material 3 2 2 effects of cleaning temperatures the pnipam chains of trc were found to be important in membrane surface modification in the alum trc system as the hydrophobicity of the pnipam chains are temperature dependent the effects of both b a and s s cleaning temperature on the fouling control performance in the system were studied the tmp development as well as rev and irr are depicted in figs 2c d in which the fsuf system denoted by x c y c referred to a cleaning mode with b a cleaning at x c and s s cleaning at y c the variations in the b a cleaning temperature generated significant differences in tmp growth from the first day fig 2c an elevated backwash water temperature x 45 c was beneficial for slowing down tmp growth whereas the lower temperature x 5 c was detrimental with more severe fouling the b a cleaning every 30 min gradually amplified the above differences in the following 39 days at day 40 the average tmp of the two systems with b a cleaning temperatures of 5 c reached 15 75 kpa while the average of the other two systems with b a cleaning temperatures of 45 c was 6 08 kpa similar to the influence of b a cleaning temperature a higher s s cleaning water temperature promoted the decline of tmp however the influence of the s s cleaning temperature was less than that of the b a cleaning temperature the 45 c 45 c cleaning mode in the fsuf system had the best performance fig 2c d compared to the conventional cleaning process at room temperature the approach of moderately increasing the cleaning temperature in the alum trc system substantially reduced the rev and irr by 49 8 61 3 and 73 9 83 3 respectively fig 2d however in the fsuf system using alum alone as the coagulant the elevated temperature did not affect the tmp variation rev and irr the si fig s13 this implied that although the increase of temperature will lead to intensified activity of water molecules the contribution of the intensified activity to fouling mitigation was small the significant fouling reduction at the elevated temperature in the alum trc system was more likely attributable to the temperature responsiveness of trc which will be considered subsequently in section 3 3 in addition to tmp the surface morphology of the used membranes at day 40 was examined using sem and afm to show directly the membrane fouling before the final s s cleaning in stage 3 the membranes with cake layers on the surfaces were observed using sem images in fig 3a f demonstrated that cake layers in the systems with b a cleaning at both 25 c fig 3b and 5 c fig 3e f covered nearly the whole membrane surface with a compact structure in contrast loose cake layers with obvious cracks were found in the two systems with elevated b a cleaning temperature fig 3c d between them an elevated s s cleaning temperature in stages 1 and 2 also made the cake layers looser and thinner with larger cracks fig 3c the sem observations implied that the raised cleaning temperature effectively damaged the cake layers which was beneficial to lowering hydraulic resistance during the uf operation subsequently after cake layers were removed by s s cleaning for the last time the surfaces of the used membranes with only irreversible fouling were observed using afm fig 3g l among afm images the system with the 45 c 45 c cleaning mode had the smallest surface roughness rq of 0 216 the closest to the value of a pristine membrane indicating the effectiveness of elevated cleaning temperature in the mitigation of irreversible fouling taking the rq value of the 25 c 25 c mode as the reference irrespective of the s s cleaning temperature the membrane surfaces in the two systems with a b a cleaning temperature of 45 c had a smaller rq whereas those in the other two systems with a b a cleaning of 5 c had a larger rq such a result confirmed the dominant influence of the b a cleaning temperature over the s s cleaning temperature on irreversible fouling control 3 3 mechanisms for the membrane cleaning approach based on temperature regulation the above results confirmed the effectiveness of increasing cleaning temperature for fouling control in the fsuf system with the dosing of trc to reveal the mechanisms an in depth investigation involving statistical analyses instrumental characterizations and chemical computations was carried out as follows 3 3 1 impact on the accumulation of contaminants on the membranes the flows of the principal materials in solution involving inorganic iss and organic total organic carbon toc substances total phosphorous tp trc and alum which might impact membrane fouling in the fsuf process were visualized using sankey diagrams as shown in fig 4a and the si fig s14 these diagrams have been widely employed for performing the path analytics and understanding the potential links of complex data graedel 2019 van vuuren et al 2019 control tests using raw water without spiked antibiotics as a reference demonstrated that the influence of antibiotics on fouling could be neglected see details in the si fig s15 since the concentrations of spiked antibiotics were 4 log units lower than the above mentioned principal materials in water hence antibiotic flows were not analyzed here as illustrated in fig 4a and the si fig s14 material flows in the flocculation and sedimentation units were the same in the fsuf systems with different cleaning modes as the same fs operation parameters were used after sedimentation the residual materials in the uf feed water were divided into three parts involving those in the fouling material on the membrane in the sludge at the uf tank bottom and in the final produced water as materials adhering to the membranes directly influence their permeability pca and correlation analysis of the final tmp value and different percentages of materials on the membranes were performed as depicted in fig 4b c according to pca loading plots fig 4b only one statistically significant principal component pc1 was found explaining 96 99 of the total variance a considerably high value to show the accurate description of the real experimental data by the pca model with respect to pc1 different variables were grouped into two species the positive value tmp and percentages of alum iss tp and toc on the membrane and the negative value species percentage of trc it could be inferred that trc left on the membrane inhibited the accumulation of iss toc and tp and the increase of tmp the linear correlation between tmp and other variables in fig 4c provided quantitative data describing the relationships iss toc and tp on the membranes which could generate inorganic organic and bio fouling gao et al 2011 li et al 2023 respectively were positively correlated with tmp with large regression coefficients r2 the amounts of iss toc or tp accumulated on the final membrane in the 45 c 45 c system was the lowest among the five systems indicating that the increased cleaning temperature effectively alleviated accumulation of these contaminants this further weakened the mass transfer of small sized contaminants those smaller than 20 nm in the effluent after fs as shown in the si fig s16 from the membrane surface to the pores as depicted in the pore size distribution curves of the used membranes after the final s s cleaning fig 4d although peaks and the average pore sizes shifted towards smaller values after use due to the blockage of pores those in the 45 c 45 c system were the closest to the corresponding values of the pristine membrane 3 3 2 impact on the surface modification of uf regarding the impact of externally dosed coagulant and flocculant on the uf membrane the results in fig 4c showed that alum and trc had opposite influences on tmp the amount of alum on the membrane was positively slope 0 correlated r2 0 781 with tmp implying that the residual coagulant on the membrane aggravated inorganic fouling ma et al 2014 however the inverse correlation slope 0 between tmp and trc left on the membrane was found to be more significant r2 0 984 this indicated that the hydrophobic modified flocculant deposited on the membrane did not intensify organic fouling but was conducive to fouling reduction among the five systems the largest amount of trc but lowest amount of alum left on the membranes appeared in the 45 c 45 c system fig 4c giving rise to the lowest tmp at the end of the fsuf operation in the same system the most significant surface modification effect with the lowest wca value of the used membrane fig 4e was found hence similar to the strengthened hydrophobic association of hydrophobic chains in proteins at elevated temperatures baldwin 1986 wolfenden et al 2015 the increase of cleaning temperature strengthens the membrane surface modification role of trc direct evidence to support this was provided by the computed bes of different fragments adsorbed onto the pvdf interface in water at different temperatures as illustrated in fig 5 the fragments of trc chitosan and pnipam chains nom and iss using kaolin as a representative were computed according to fig 5 at any temperature the be of the pnipam pvdf complexes formed by hydrophobic association were notably greater than those of other complexes confirming that the surface modification effect of trc was unlikely to be significantly affected by the coexistence of other contaminants for the pnipam pvdf complexes fig 5a c the rise of temperature remarkably enhanced the hydrophobic association with be values from 15 25 kcal mol at 5 c to 40 56 kcal mol at 45 c this was consistent with previous findings in protein folding that hydrophobic association was an entropy increase driven process eisenberg and sawaya 2016 for which the elevated temperature was favored according to thermodynamic relationships consequently the membrane surface modification effect of trc was strengthened by both the b a and ss cleaning at an elevated temperature 3 3 3 impact on the structure of fouling on the membrane as well as inhibiting contaminant accumulation and strengthening the surface modification effect of trc the increased cleaning temperature can affect the structure of fouling on the membrane which may be similar to the impact of temperature on the protein structure building materials of the fouling deposits involving the coagulant the flocculant iss nom and so on were the same to those of flocs generated in the same fsuf system thus the influence of temperature on fouling structure was qualitatively similar to that on the floc structure of which the in situ characterizations have been well established yang et al 2013 the real time variations of floc size and fractal dimension df at different temperatures and velocity gradients g values were monitored and are shown in fig 6a b in the tests prior to changing the water temperature the starting point t 0 min flocs were fully grown under a rapid mix at g 128 s 1 for 5 min and a subsequent flocculation at g 16 s 1 for 15 min at 25 c subsequently three stages of experiments at different temperatures were successively designed and conducted involving stage 1 at the unchanged g value 16 s 1 stage 2 for floc breakage at g 128 s 1 and stage 3 for floc regrowth at g 16 s 1 a floc strength factor f1 and regrowth factor f2 under different conditions were calculated 3 f 1 d 2 d 1 4 f 2 d 3 d 2 d 1 d 2 where d1 d2 and d3 were the floc sizes at the end of stages 1 2 and 3 respectively as depicted in fig 6a b in stage 1 although the g value was kept unchanged the higher temperature induced the flocs to became slightly smaller and less compact df decline spontaneously this implied that the increased temperature weakened floc stability such an effect was enhanced at a greater g value in stage 2 flocs at 45 c with a lower f1 value were much more easily broken than flocs at the other two temperatures therefore it could be inferred through a reasonable analogy that fouling material with a destabilized structure at the elevated temperature was more easily degraded and removed from the membrane under turbulent conditions caused by cleaning furthermore the results in stage 3 demonstrated that the regrowth capacity of the broken flocs at 45 c was the worst substantial decline of f2 value in other words the increased temperature caused more severe irreversible damage to the structure of flocs as well as to that of the fouling material analogously the collapsed trc structure at the elevated temperature causes the fouling material to become unstable and thus be removed more easily the temperature induced structural damage was also related to the thermo responsiveness of pnipam chains according to the computed bes of pnipam nom and pnipam iss complexes fig 6c h with the rise of temperature the bes representing the stability of both complexes decreased since trc nom and iss were the main building materials of fouling ho et al 2022 the fouling structure was thus weakened 3 4 evaluation of other measures of performance water purification membrane stability and economic aspects other important measures of performance of the fsuf process involving water purification membrane stability and economic aspects which might be influenced by the elevated cleaning temperature were evaluated as follows 3 4 1 water purification water quality improvement is a priority goal of water treatment and it was important to establish whether the elevated cleaning temperature would affect the produced water quality the quality of the produced water by the different fsuf systems is summarized in the si figs s6 and s17 the dosing of trc in the fsuf process remarkably improved the res of the antibiotics si fig s15 due to the enhanced hydrophobic association between the hydrophobic modified flocculant and antibiotics as previously reported wang et al 2022 for the alum trc system which had the highest res of the antibiotics si fig s17 changing the cleaning temperature in the uf tank did not lead to significant differences in water quality si fig s6 this was attributed to the fact that the major contribution to contaminant removal occurred in the fs stage despite this compared to other cleaning modes the minor improvement rather than a deterioration of res of contaminants in the 45 c 45 c system si fig s18 eliminated any concerns about adverse water quality impacts by the elevating temperature cleaning approach the minor improvement of res was ascribed to the improved cleaning performance at the higher temperature which inhibited penetration mass transfer of contaminants through the membrane as aforementioned in addition to the contaminants in the produced water attention was also given to the presence of residual trc and al3 considering the potential risks associated with the flocculant and the coagulant for trc both the natural chitosan backbones and the pnipam chains widely used for in vivo drug delivery of trc are environmentally benign and biocompatible polymers sun et al 2014 in addition according to the test results fig 4a trc was not detected in the final produced water since the size of trc fig 1c was much larger than the uf membrane pores with respect to residual al ions according to the sankey diagram in fig 4a the al concentration in the produced water was 0 027 mg l which is much lower than the upper limit 0 2 mg l in chinese national standards for drinking water quality gb 5749 2022 therefore it was concluded that the successive dosing of trc and alum in the fsuf system did not pose significant direct risks to the produced water quality 3 4 2 membrane stability pvdf is well known for its high chemical stability with heat resistance liu et al 2011 despite this the physical stability of the membranes under the conditions of repeated temperature changes was uncertain the stress strain curves of the pristine membrane and used membranes after the final s s cleaning for the different fsuf systems are shown in the si fig s19 which indicated a negligible difference in behavior among all the membranes this result demonstrated that the elevated cleaning water temperature did not appear to affect the mechanical integrity of the uf membranes on the other hand as previously mentioned in section 3 3 1 although membrane pores were blocked to various degrees after use in all fsuf systems fig 4d the degree of pore blockage in the 45 c 45 c system was the lowest thus compared to the conventionally operated 25 c 25 c mode the elevated cleaning temperature slightly improved the pore structure stability of the membrane 3 4 3 economic analysis a preliminary analysis of the economic feasibility of applying an elevated cleaning temperature approach was explored in view of the additional cost of energy for heating the cleaning water for the b a and s s che operations by assuming the use of industrial low grade waste heat e g industrial cooling water at 90 c adhikary et al 2020 zhou et al 2015 for heating the cleaning water at an initial temperature of 25 c in large scale applications as a basis the che was calculated 5 c h e p p u c w m b a m s s t c l e a n i n g t i n i t i a l t c w t c l e a n i n g ε where ppucw cny kg is the price per unit of industrial cooling water at 90 c mba kg and mss kg are the total massmass of water used for b a and s s cleaning respectively tcleaning c tinitial c and tcw c are the temperatures of backwash or soaking water 45 c initial water 25 c and the used industrial cooling water 90 c respectively ε is the heat exchange efficiency based on the values as given in the si table s2 the che for the 40 days of fsuf operation 480 l of treated water in total was 0 097 chinese yuan cny that is to say the cost was 0 202 cny us 0 029 m3 of water for the elevated cleaning temperature approach to significantly alleviate membrane fouling the reductions of rev and irr were 49 8 61 3 and 73 9 83 3 respectively as mentioned above as well as the very low energy cost the mitigated fouling during the uf operation could save i pumping energy costs one of the major operational expenses due to fouling jafari et al 2021 porcelli and judd 2010 ii membrane replacement costs another of the major operational expenses when the membrane service lifetime is reached after extensive fouling formation jafari et al 2021 porcelli and judd 2010 and iii chemicals such as acids and bases in conventional membrane cleaning considering these aspects it could be regarded as potentially economically feasible to apply the proposed cleaning approach by raising the cleaning water temperature to mitigate fouling 4 conclusions the hydrophobic modified flocculant trc was found to have temperature dependent hydrophobicity which was similar to the characteristics of natural proteins inspired by the protein folding phenomenon the approach of using membrane cleaning temperature as the trigger to induce deposited residual trc after fs to reduce subsequent uf fouling was proposed and verified in this work the alum trc fsuf system was found to have notable advantages in fouling control over the conventional alum system a moderately elevated cleaning water temperature 45 c applied in both b a and s s cleaning in the alum trc system gave rise to substantial reductions in rev and irr of 49 8 61 3 and 73 9 83 3 respectively of which the elevated temperature of b a cleaning contributed the major part the mechanisms for the enhanced fouling mitigation performance of the novel approach were i inhibited contaminant accumulation onto membranes ii the strengthened membrane surface modification effect of trc and iii the weakened structure of the foulant layer at the elevated cleaning temperature other key measures of performance involving water purification membrane stability and economic aspects also confirmed the advantages and feasibility of the novel approach in summary this work has demonstrated more beneficial role of hydrophobic modified flocculants in the treatment of surface water by a flocculation

14823,due to structural and hydraulic deterioration urban water pipe networks have annual rehabilitation needs worldwide these needs are often significantly larger than the actual amount of rehabilitation being performed leading to increased risks of serious failures lower performance and a growing techno financial burden for future generations it is well accepted that in order to limit the multiple impacts of utility works in the urban environment rehabilitation projects should be coordinated between water transport energy and telecommunication infrastructures in practice such coordination means that public utilities must rehabilitate assets earlier or later than technically needed in order to engage in joint projects in which digging and resurfacing expenditures are shared hence at the municipal scale such coordination influences two variables that are key to strategic decision support average costs metre for asset rehabilitation and the service lifetimes of those assets however current models for strategic asset management do not enable practitioners to estimate how changes in the coordination process may influence the long term financial and environmental impacts of infrastructure rehabilitation the present study aimed at addressing this methodological gap by introducing the concept of a coordination window that quantifies to what extent utilities compromise asset rehabilitation times in order to join multi utility projects an algorithm for modelling the influence of the coordination window size on long term sustainability costs is presented and applied to one swedish municipality the results suggested that total capital costs and carbon emissions can be lowered by 34 and 16 with a coordination window of 35 and 25 year in comparison to the no coordination case keywords infrastructure asset management pipe networks pavement multi utility rehabilitation trenchless data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction despite their criticality for human welfare and development municipal infrastructures such as drinking water sewers and road networks have been shown worldwide to be in poor condition berger et al 2016 wall and rust 2017 sakai et al 2020 asce 2021 and to suffer from insufficient reinvestment this underlines the need for water and road utilities to step up their pro active rehabilitation efforts and thereby prevent levels of service deteriorating and operational expenditures increasing water utilities are under pressure to meet rehabilitation needs in a cost effective manner as they also have to finance adaptations to climate change urban population growth and tighter environmental regulations for example it has been estimated that all eu countries but germany need to increase annual expenditures for water supply and sanitations by at least 25 to comply with the current water directives oecd 2020 at the same time utilities must decrease the external consequences of successive excavation activities as these affect numerous external actors and may also hinder the implementation of rehabilitation projects these external consequences include disturbance to traffic and local businesses as well damage to adjacent infrastructure and the local environment e g trees to address these challenges and the problem of ageing municipal infrastructures two complementary strategies can be identified the implementation of infrastructure asset management marlow beale and burn 2010 and coordination of rehabilitation efforts between utilities infrastructure asset management for water utilities has been organised into three aligned decision levels alegre et al 2013 work at the strategic level includes setting target renewal rates for the entire infrastructure and securing the corresponding reinvestment budget with a time horizon of 10 to 20 years the tactical level often refers to the production of 3 to 5 year plans through which rehabilitation projects are prioritized typically taking a risk based approach the focus at that level is generally to maximize network improvement with the available reinvestment budget the operational level deals with project implementation on a 1 2 years time horizon including choice of rehabilitation methods and spatial and temporal coordination of building activities possibly with other utilities the ability to address multi utility coordination is important at all three decision levels of water infrastructure asset management in particular coordination of rehabilitation works between utilities has an influence on the quantities evaluated at the strategic level including the yearly capital expenditure required to meet the renewal needs of urban water pipe networks this is because coordination can reduce rehabilitation costs metre through for example shared excavations and repaving expenditures but may also shorten or extend asset service lives this is a consequence of the problems of scale defined by daulat et al 2022 as one of the seven challenges in practicing integrated multi infrastructure asset management integration of multi utility coordination in the water infrastructure asset management process has mostly been addressed in scientific studies at the tactical decision level for example studies by carey and lueke 2013 osman 2015 tscheikner gratl et al 2016 abu samra et al 2020 and shahata et al 2022 focus on optimized scheduling and prioritization of rehabilitation interventions with the general aim of making the best use of available re investment budgets integration of multi utility coordination at the strategic level has been partly addressed by bruaset et al 2018 who estimated total reinvestment costs over a 15 year period for the drinking water and sewer pipe networks of trondheim municipality in norway the authors considered different scenarios with regards to multi utility coordination and use of trenchless technologies however the coordination process was assumed to be systematic i e rehabilitation of an asset triggers rehabilitation of the adjacent assets independent of their conditions which did not allow for modelling different levels of coordination earlier malm et al 2013 estimated the capital costs of meeting the long term renewal needs of both sewer and water pipe networks in sweden using cohort survival functions calibrated with historical decommissioning data this approach assumes a same as in the past scenario large et al 2015 when it comes to rehabilitation performed for other reasons than deterioration including coordination between utilities the study presented in this paper aimed at increasing the currently limited knowledge and availability of tools for assessing the long term 30 years effects of multi utility coordinated rehabilitation on strategic asset management metrics the objectives of the study were to develop an algorithm modelling the influence of multi utility coordination on the long term costs of pipe and road network rehabilitation to apply the algorithm to a case study to compare different coordination policies in terms of long term sustainability costs and identify possible optimal coordination levels and to assess the importance of the inter infrastructure spatial correlation of asset lifetimes as a modelling parameter 2 method 2 1 defining and quantifying the concept of coordination coordination can have different meanings depending on which aspect of integrated multi infrastructure asset management daulat et al 2022 is being discussed in this study coordination was identified where adjacent infrastructure assets e g pipes pavement were rehabilitated earlier or later than the end of their functional lives in order to carry out works on multiple assets within a single project the end of an asset s functional life was defined as the point in time when the asset reaches an unacceptable level of performance or risk due to deterioration and therefore needs to be rehabilitated thresholds for unacceptable performance or risk levels may be organisation and time dependent bruaset et al 2017 the concept of adjacency between assets was determined by the observation that the digging required to rehabilitate these assets individually would involve partly or fully excavating the same soil masses modelling the influence of coordination on long term rehabilitation costs requires that coordination is quantified this was achieved by introducing the concept of a coordination window as presented in fig 1 the coordination window starts when one asset needs rehabilitation and is extended a given number of years τ into the future this period represents the criteria for coordination meaning that adjacent assets i e those in the same street segment whose end of functional life circles in fig 1 falls within the coordination window are rehabilitated together in a joined multi infrastructure project vertically aligned crosses in fig 1 a pro active asset management approach was assumed meaning that the joint rehabilitation project would take place at the beginning of the coordination window this implies that asset rehabilitations are performed at a maximum τ years earlier than needed the variable τ was used as a quantitative metric of the intensity of the coordination process occurring in infrastructure asset rehabilitation if τ 0 adjacent assets are rehabilitated in joint projects only if they reach the end of their functional lives at the same time leading to mostly single utility projects i e no coordination if τ adjacent assets are always rehabilitated in multi utility projects i e there is systematic coordination in this paper τ is interchangeably referred to as the size of the coordination window or the level of coordination the coordination model was developed on the basis of τ being constant throughout the simulation period 2 2 choice of the deterioration model the cohort survival approach was selected to model infrastructure asset deterioration in the algorithm developed providing the predictions of remaining functional lifetimes needed to implement the concept of a coordination window cohort survival is a probabilistic single variate kleiner and rajani 2001 modelling approach which has been applied mainly to drinking water herz 1996 malm et al 2012 large et al 2015 bruaset et al 2017 and sewer pipe networks baur and herz 2002 duchesne et al 2013 malm et al 2013 no theoretical or practical obstacles to using this approach for other networked infrastructure were found in the literature the approach consists of organizing assets into groups cohorts that are homogeneous with regard to their deterioration behaviour herz 1996 the approach is well suited to making long term predictions of rehabilitation needs at the network level and has a relatively low data requirement it does not take into account spatial co variates with the intention of making predictions for single assets the minimum data requirement is so called survival functions for each cohort as well as the network age and cohort distribution expressed in installed kilometres of pipe road installed per decade and cohort type the survival functions can be based on any statistical distribution e g herz weibull that is appropriate to the observations used in its calibration if the purpose is to forecast replacement needs as in this study these observations should normally be a dataset of times or time periods at which assets have reached the end of their functional life i e need replacement due to unacceptable levels of performance e g excessive frequency of leakage for a drinking water pipe high groundwater infiltration rate for a sewer pipe or risk e g poor structural condition for a critical sewer pipe for sewer networks the calibration of survival curves capturing pipe deterioration is currently limited by the fact that cctv inspection which is by far the most common inspection method has many flaws in assessing structural integrity and water tightness other methods are under development and are expected to be mature within 2 10 years tscheikner gratl et al 2020 the choice of using a cohort survival model was motivated by the availability of data for such models in a scandinavian context as they are commonly used for estimating rehabilitation needs at the strategical level for both sewer and drinking water networks the developed coordination model is however compatible with other survival model for example the ones that have been previously developed for sewer networks laakso et al 2019 the coordination model may also be used with failure prediction models which are more common for drinking water networks scheidegger et al 2015 by assuming that the end of functional life corresponds to a failure probability threshold 2 3 level of aggregation of the infrastructure inventories the coordination model was developed on the assumption that an integrated asset inventory would be available as input data the integrated asset inventory is more detailed than the conventional data requirement of cohort survival models and refers to a list of segments with the following attributes segment length installation years for each infrastructure concerned and cohort type for each infrastructure concerned as mentioned in section 2 2 the age distribution in installed km per decade and cohort type is sufficient to run a cohort survival model for a single infrastructure however the study of a coordination scenario requires knowledge of the inter infrastructure spatial combination of one of the outputs of cohort survival models namely remaining lifetimes hence the inter infrastructure spatial combination of cohort survival model inputs installation years and cohort types was identified as a necessary input to the coordination model that was developed one way to summarize this information is to use combined multi infrastructure cohorts but these can be too numerous to be practical to consider 3 infrastructures and 5 cohorts leads to 125 combined cohorts moreover adjacent assets from different infrastructures do not necessarily have the same installation year leading to even more combinations to express the asset inventories in a summarized way this motivated the choice to use a detailed integrated asset inventory gis information about whole pipe road networks is becoming increasingly available and quick to process thanks to improved computing power an example of integrated asset inventory is presented in table 1 the coordination model was developed to process input data at segment level but not to make predictions at that level as this would constitute tactical asset management the detailed asset inventory was used as a structure to sample lifetimes and derive aggregated information at the network level concerning the strategic implications of different coordination strategies a segment see above contains adjacent assets and is sometimes referred to as either a street segment if it contains a road or otherwise a trench segment the criteria used to define segments were that they should be short enough to contain no more than one cohort type and one installation year per infrastructure 2 4 lifetime sampling strategy the survival function s of a given cohort is directly related to the cumulative distribution function f of its assets lifetime distribution through the relation s 1 f cumulative distribution functions can be used to generate random numbers according to given distributions by using inverse transform sampling devroye and devroye 1986 therefore inverse transform sampling was used in the coordination model to assign a functional lifetime to all infrastructure assets based on the expected lifetime distribution within each cohort this involved first assigning to the assets a random number x from a uniform distribution in the range 0 1 and then computing f 1 x to obtain the corresponding lifetime different uniform distributions were used for each infrastructure type special attention was given to how correlated these distributions were as described in section 2 5 below 2 5 accounting for inter infrastructure spatial correlation of asset lifetimes the cholesky decomposition cholesky 2005 was identified as a suitable method to account for the inter infrastructure correlation of asset lifetimes in the coordination model it is the simplest method that was found in the literature that generates sets of normally distributed random numbers with given correlation coefficients between these sets burgess 2022 the matrix r was defined as an input modelling parameter with ρ i j referring to the pearson coefficient between the asset lifetimes of infrastructure i and infrastructure j the model followed a routine to 1 generate for each infrastructure a normal distribution in the range 0 1 with as many elements as there are street segments 2 use the cholesky decomposition to generate a new set of normal distributions correlated according to matrix r 3 apply the cumulative distribution function of the normal distributions to obtain uniform distributions in the range 0 1 also correlated according to the r matrix r ρ i j 1 i i 1 j i 2 6 definition of model outputs the following quantities are needed in order to compare coordination polices and evaluate their implications for infrastructure owners length i e meters of of rehabilitation action performed per year a rehabilitation action corresponds to a combination of adjacent assets being rehabilitated examples rehabilitation of drinking water pipe and pavement rehabilitation of sewer and pavement etc the number of possible rehabilitation actions a is related to the number of studied infrastructures i with the equation a 2i 1 sustainability costs per year e g capital costs greenhouse gases emissions obtained by multiplying per year length of rehabilitation performed action by the user defined unit costs of these actions rehabilitation rate per year by infrastructure type expressed as a percentage under utilization ratio per year by infrastructure type this is the average ratio between asset age at time of rehabilitation and the asset s functional lifetime the structure of the coordination model developed implies that the result from one simulation is based on only one possible set of assigned asset lifetimes compatible with the input cohort survival functions and the inter infrastructure correlation matrix r to obtain results with a decision making value the model was programmed to run numerous simulations and plot the average value and 95 confidence interval of the output quantities for each year of the simulation period the number of simulations to be performed should be increased incrementally in order to narrow confidence intervals until the comparison between coordination policies is deemed to be meaningful 2 7 application to the case study of luleå 2 7 1 integrated asset inventory the comparative coordination study focused on the sewer drinking water distribution and road infrastructure of the municipality of luleå in sweden in january 2021 the population of luleå municipality serviced by the public water utility was 66 700 inhabitants asset inventories of the three infrastructures were retrieved in gis format from the water utility and the swedish transport administration website an integrated asset inventory was produced by processing the gis layers of the three infrastructures with the buffering and spatial join functions of the open source software qgis a 6 metre wide buffer was created along each sewer pipes to determine if there was an adjacent drinking water pipe and to read its attributes the inventory comprised 3469 residential street segments with an average length of 50 7 m for a total length of 176 km this corresponded to 39 of the total street length of luleå municipality the attributes of the segments were length installation year of drinking water pipe material of drinking water pipe installation year of sewer pipe material of sewer pipe installation year of the road subbase all segments corresponded to residential streets with average daily traffic of less than 1000 vehicles the inventory was limited to such streets because they were considered to be the most suitable for coordinated infrastructure renewal projects in the chosen municipality a large proportion of residential streets in luleå municipality lacks both an engineered subbase layer and a functioning drainage solution improving the status of these roads therefore requires excavation works which could be performed in coordination with open cut pipe replacement operations on the other hand condition improvement operations on larger roads more commonly consists of replacing the asphalt top layer making them less suited for coordination with open cut pipe replacement projects 2 7 2 survival functions the cohort survival functions estimated by malm et al 2013 were used for the water and sewer pipes in the asset inventory for luleå these curves are described by herz survival functions herz 1996 on the basis of three parameters t100 the time after installation when 100 of the asset cohort remain functional t50 the time after installation when 50 of the asset cohort remain functional t10 the time after installation when 10 of the asset cohort remain functional the survival functions were determined based on decommissioning data from gothenburg stockholm and several norwegian municipalities malm et al 2013 they do not capture only the deterioration behaviour of the different cohorts but also the fact that pipes were replaced for adapting hydraulic capacity or due to external factors e g coordination to an unspecified extent it is a limitation of this case study as the murm prototype requires that the input survival functions represent the deterioration of the assets a method to obtain such curves is described in section 4 3 lifetime estimates for road subbase layers are scarce in the literature for the case of luleå a review of amortization periods used by swedish municipalities for road subbase layers was performed this found an average value of 80 years this figure was used as the parameter t50 for the road subbase values of 50 and 110 years were assumed for the t100 and t10 parameters 30 years all the survival curves used for the case study of luleå are presented in fig 2 the survival curves water pe and ductile iron after 1980 and sewer plastic were used for water and sewer pipes rehabilitated with the digging method pipe replacement for pipes rehabilitated with structural trenchless methods the survival curves proposed by bruaset et al 2018 were applied 2 7 3 unit costs of actions the economic cost global warming potential gwp and excavation need for each combination of rehabilitation actions are presented in table 2 the assumed rehabilitation methods digging or trenchless are also given for each infrastructure note that a trenchless approach is assumed for rehabilitation of pipes without road rehabilitation this is because due to installation depth and trench width changing urban water pipes with the open cut method in luleå cannot be performed without changing the road layers economic costs for open cut rehabilitations were derived from completed projects within the municipality of luleå for the trenchless methods the costs were derived from completed projects in stockholm municipality as there was insufficient data available for the municipality of luleå the cured in placed pipe cipp relining method was assumed for the trenchless rehabilitation of sewers while pipe bursting was assumed for drinking water pipes global warming potential and excavation needs for the open cut operations were obtained from pericault et al 2018 for the cipp method values were obtained from ariaratnam and sihabuddin 2009 for the pipe bursting method values were obtained from kaushal and najafi 2020 2 7 4 comparison of coordination policies three coordination policies involving the rehabilitation of urban water pipes and road subbase in the residential streets of luleå municipality were compared one policy with no coordination coordination window of 1 year another with an optimized coordination level and a third policy with extensive coordination coordination window of 100 years for the optimized coordination scenario the model was run for sizes of coordination window varying from 1 to 100 years and total costs over the period 2020 2120 were computed the optimized coordination window was chosen based on the point where the weighed sum of total capital cost global warming potential and excavated volume was lowest with all three factors given equal weight when computing the weighed sum total costs values capital cost global warming potential excavation need over the period 2020 2120 were first divided by the value obtained for the case of no coordination τ 0 the python codes for the murm and murp modules adapted for the case study of luleå and the headers of the different input tables are published on the zenodo repository with the following doi 10 5281 zenodo 7118609 2 7 5 sensitivity analysis an analysis was performed to assess the sensitivity of the optimized coordination window to changes in input parameters the following changes in input parameters were tested change from middle to upper and lower bounds of the ranges of survival times proposed by malm et al 2013 for drinking water and sewer pipe cohorts changes in similar proportion were applied to the survival times of road subbase these changes are summarized in table 3 alongside the initial survival times 50 decrease 25 decrease 25 increase and 50 increase in economic cost and global warming potential per metre of the different rehabilitation actions 25 decrease and 50 decrease in excavation needs per metre for the open cut rehabilitation actions increase in excavation needs were not tested as the values used for luleå are high in comparison to other european cities due to deep frost free line for pipes installation 2 5 m and thick road subbase for frost heave protection 1 m 50 increase in the weights given to economic environmental and social costs when optimizing the coordination window the optimization of the coordination window size τ was repeated for each change in parameter value this resulted in 32 optimizations corresponding to 640 simulations as one optimization required 20 simulations τ values from 0 to 100 year with a 5 year time step the optimized τ values and corresponding reductions increases in total costs were saved for comparison 3 results 3 1 multi utility rehabilitation modeller murm and planner murp the infrastructure coordination model developed in this study consisted of a python program structured in two modules the murm multi utility rehabilitation modeller module computes model outputs for one set of input modelling parameters τ r ρt and one sampling of asset lifetimes the different computing steps of the murm module are shown in a flowchart fig 3 using the murm module with other deterioration models would imply discarding the part of the flowchart leading to interface 1 the deterioration model would need to feed the computing step coordinated renewal modelling with the estimated end of functional life of the infrastructures for all studied segments murp enables up to three sets of modelling parameters to be compared by running the murm module a user defined number of times for each set of parameters and plotting the corresponding average values and confidence intervals of the model outputs in line charts 3 2 case study of luleå residential streets 3 2 1 influence of coordination window size and inter infrastructure lifetime correlation on total sustainability costs fig 4 shows the influence of the size of the coordination window τ on capital costs global warming potential and excavated volume accumulated over the period 2020 2120 these accumulated costs are also referred to as total sustainability costs the relationships between τ and total costs represented in fig 4 were computed assuming a low ρ 0 1 moderate ρ 0 5 and high ρ 0 9 correlation of asset lifetimes between infrastructures total capital expenditures fig 4a were highest 425 million for a coordination window size τ of 0 year i e a policy of no coordination increasing τ up to 35 or 40 years was found to decrease capital expenditure by up to 34 or 29 depending on the inter infrastructure correlation of asset lifetimes ρ 0 9 or 0 1 increasing the coordination window size further to beyond 40 years was found to moderately increase the total capital cost fig 4a although the latter remained lower than with a policy of no coordination τ 0 years for example for ρ 0 5 a τ value of 100 years corresponding to a policy of extensive coordination resulted in a total capital cost of 319 million a 25 reduction on the no coordination policy τ 0 years total global warming potential fig 4b reached a minimum of 13 000 tons of co2 equivalent for a coordination window size τ of 25 years representing a 16 reduction on the 16 000 thousand tons of co2 equivalent emitted with the no coordination policy for τ values greater than 25 years total global warming potential increased additionally τ values larger than 60 years resulted in a higher global warming potential than if no coordination took place τ 0 years total excavated volume 4c was consistently found to increase from 1 25 to 2 15 million cubic meters as the coordination window increased from 0 to 100 years this is because in this case study single utility i e uncoordinated replacement of pipes was assumed to be carried out using trenchless methods the rate of increase was higher in the range 0 40 years than for τ values of more than 40 years the inter infrastructure spatial correlation of asset lifetimes ρ was found to have a somewhat positive effect on total capital cost reductions this effect was most noticeable for a τ value of 30 years where increasing ρ from 0 1 to 0 9 was found to reduce total capital costs by 11 the influence of ρ on total global warming potential and total excavation was very limited with changes of at most 4 and 2 observed for a τ value of 100 years a possible explanation for this is the differences in survival functions between the different infrastructure cohorts this leads to lifetime underutilization even under the beneficial scenario of ρ 0 9 under which short lived sewer pipes are adjacent to short lived drinking water pipes and situated under short lived road subbases as short lived has different meaning among the infrastructures in terms of functional lifetimes 3 2 2 yearly sustainability costs renewal rates and under utilization ratios fig 6 shows the modelled yearly capital costs global warming potential and excavated volume associated with the renewal of drinking water sewer and road infrastructures in the residential streets of luleå in sweden the results are shown for three policies no coordination blue curve τ 0 years optimized coordination orange curve τ 20 years and extensive coordination green curve τ 100 years for each curve the bold line represents the average of 30 simulations and the area surrounding the bold line represents the corresponding 95 confidence interval results are shown for 30 simulations because standard deviation of the different yearly costs were stable when increasing the number of simulations beyond 30 an example of this is shown in fig 5 for capital costs the inter infrastructure lifetime correlation coefficient ρ was set to 0 5 moderate correlation between all three infrastructures the τ value for the optimized coordination policy 20 years was selected based on the relationships shown in fig 4 and according to the method described in section 2 7 this policy resulted in differences of 22 in total capital costs 14 in total global warming potential and 19 in total excavated volume over the period 2020 2120 compared to the no coordination policy the policy of no coordination fig 6 a blue curve resulted in relatively low levels of reinvestment 4 4 0 4 million per year over the period 2020 2170 on the other hand extensive coordination fig 6a green curve led to high initial capital costs of 5 8 million per year steadily decreasing to 2 1 million per year by the 2065 and later remaining in the range 2 7 0 5 million per year the optimized coordination policy fig 6a orange curve showed similar variation but within a narrower range of capital cost values it led to 5 2 million per year of reinvestment at the beginning of the simulation period sharply decreasing to 2 8 million per year by 2035 and remaining in the range 3 2 0 4 million per year beyond this greenhouse gas emissions were also relatively stable over time under the no coordination policy fig 6b blue curve these emissions corresponded to global warming potential values in the range 150 25 tons co2 equivalent per year extensive coordination fig 6b green curve led to much higher emissions of 340 tons co2 equivalent per year at the beginning of the simulation period with a decreasing trend up to 2070 and levels similar to the no coordination policy 150 25 tons co2 equivalent per year beyond that optimized coordination fig 6c orange curve also resulted in high initial greenhouse gases emissions 250 tons co2 equivalent per year but with a sharp decrease to 120 tons co2 equivalent per year by 2035 and beyond which is lower than the levels achieved by the other two policies as with capital costs and global warming potential excavated volumes fig 6c were initially high for the extensive green curve and optimized orange curve coordination policies and decreased at different rates to more stable levels however they both resulted in more excavation volume per year than with the no coordination policy blue curve thoughout the 2020 2170 period this is because low coordination resulted in more single pipe rehabiliation projects which were assumed to be perfomed with trenchless methods i e no or very low excavation needed per metre of rehabiliated pipe however after 2035 the excess excavation volume associated with the optimized coordination policy was only 20 greater than the level expected under the no coordination policy fig 7 presents the implications of the different coordination policies for each infrastructure in terms of renewal rate i e renewed pipe length divided by total network length achieved via coordinated open cut projects a c renewal rate achieved via trenchless or single utility projects d f and under utilization ratios g i the total renewal rate of an infrastructure is the sum of the renewal rate achieved via coordinated open cut projects and the renewal rate achieved via trenchless methods in this case study the policy of no coordination τ 0 implied no open cut projects for rehabilitating water or sewer pipes and no road subgrade replacement projects in coordination with pipe replacement as shown by the blue curves in fig 7a b and c with τ 0 the renewal of infrastructures was achieved entirely with trenchless and road alone projects at renewal rates varying within the ranges 1 05 0 25 water fig 7d 1 0 3 sewer fig 7e and 1 15 0 25 road fig 7f during the period 2020 2170 these renewal rates followed the actual renewal need of the three infrastructures through just on time asset rehabilitation this is illustrated by the under utilization plots fig 7g i showing null values for the τ 0 policy blue curves throughout the simulation period the policy of extensive coordination τ 100 years green curves showed the opposite to the no coordination policy with asset rehabilitation achieved only through open cut coordinated projects fig 7a c with negligible application of trenchless technologies and road alone rehabilitation projects fig 7d f the renewal rates of the three infrastructures were equal during the entire simulation period as the rehabilitation of an asset from one infrastructure systematically triggered rehabilitation of the adjacent assets from the two other infrastructures initially these rates were particularly high at 2 6 but then decreased to 0 9 by 2065 and varied within the range 1 2 0 2 later on these values did not reflect the renewal needs of the three infrastructures as assets were rehabilitated not only based on their condition but also for coordination reasons this is reflected in the under utilization ratios which are not null for this policy fig 7g i green curves under utilization of assets was not the same across the three networks in the simulation it increased from 12 and 17 to 35 and 30 for the drinking water and sewer networks while for the road infrastructure it decreased from 15 to 4 the optimized coordination policy fig 7 orange curves resulted in both open cut and trenchless methods being employed to renew the piped infrastructures the rate of renewal of the drinking water pipe network with open cut projects had an initial value of 1 6 fig 7a and gradually decreased to remain in the range 0 4 0 1 by 2060 and beyond with trenchless methods this rate fell within the range 0 4 0 15 before 2060 and 0 5 0 1 after that date for the sewer network renewal with open cut methods had an initial value of 1 2 and gradually decreased to 0 15 by 2060 and beyond while with trenchless methods this rate was within the range 0 5 0 2 before 2060 and 0 8 0 1 later on the road infrastructure was renewed both in coordination with pipe rehabilitation fig 7c orange curve and in individual projects fig 7f orange curve with the optimimized policy under utilization ratios fig 7g i orange curves were considerably lower and more balanced than with the extensive coordination policy green curve the lifetimes of renewed drinking water and sewer pipes were under utilized by about 5 thoughout the simulation period fig 7g h orange curves for the road subbases the underutilization ratio fig 6i orange curve had an initial value of 10 but then decreased to 0 4 from 2050 onwards 3 2 3 sensitivity analysis the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in table 4 the optimized coordination window τ proved relatively robust to single changes of parameters values i e changing value of one parameter at a time the largest change in optimized tau value was observed when the digging costs were decrease by 50 or when the weight of the economic costs was increased by 50 this increased the optimized coordination window by 10 years from 15 to 25 years note that in the original analysis the optimized value obtained for τ with the initial parameter set was 20 years while in table 4 this value is 15 years this is because only multiple of 10 years were considered for τ in the original analysis in the sensitivity analysis a refined time step of 5 years was used in the optimization the differences in total sustainability costs between the optimized coordination window and the case of no coordination were considerably affected by some of the changes in input parameters for example when decreasing digging cost by 50 the reduction in total capital costs was of 43 in comparison to 18 in the initial optimization the reduction in total global warming potential changed from 14 to 27 when decreasing the global warming potential per metre of open cut rehabilitation by 50 the excess excavation need in comparison to the no coordination case changed from 15 to 29 when increasing by 50 the weight of economic costs in the optimization process 4 discussion 4 1 renewal coordination long term impacts and strategic implications this study confirms and illustrates the intuitive hypothesis that coordinating infrastructure renewal too little or too much can both be sub optimal due to respectively missed opportunities for cost sharing or underutilizing the lifetimes of particular assets application of the coordination model to the case study of luleå showed that total capital cost and global warming potential could be minimized by using a coordination window τ of 35 and 25 years respectively the results from applying the coordination model also showed that deviation from these values e g 10 or 50 years would result in substantially higher total costs for the municipality these results suggest that it is beneficial for a municipality to have control over the τ parameter by pro actively choosing and implementing a coordination policy in light of its long term strategic implications treating coordination as a purely operational project specific matter i e not having a specific coordination policy in place is likely to result in sub optimal levels of coordination and cost more overall this study showed that the capital cost reduction obtained by optimizing coordination was 34 over a 100 year period this differs considerably from the 11 to 7 reductions found by other studies carey and lueke 2013 and abu samra et al 2020 where coordination was optimized at the tactical decision level one possible reason for these differences is that pipes in luleå are installed at a minimum depth of 2 5 m to protect them from ground frost leading to large excavation volumes per pipe replaced and consequently more potential for savings through cost sharing than in other locations a second possible reason for the large savings found in this study is that the option of using either open cut or trenchless methods was considered in the optimization process this option can lead to more cost efficient scenarios than when only the open cut method is considered but it has the drawback of assuming that trenchless methods can be used for any pipe replacement project which is not always valid for example where pipes suffer from an uneven slope profile or where pipe diameter needs to be increased the results also indicate that coordinating the rehabilitation of multiple adjacent infrastructures can lead to higher sustainability costs in the shorter to mid terms but still yield long term benefits for example the optimized policy orange curve in fig 6a b implied higher yearly capital costs and carbon emissions than the no coordination policy blue curve during the first 10 years of the simulation but was cheaper and less carbon intensive from a 100 year perspective fig 4a b this was due to future costly replacement of individual assets e g sewer pipes being avoided by replacing the asset earlier in joint projects with other infrastructures e g road and or drinking water this highlights the need for a long term approach when studying the benefits of coordinated asset rehabilitation hence its relevance to the strategic decision level incurring high short term capital costs may be unrealistic because they require prohibitively sharp increases in investment budgets and customer fees there may also be insufficient in house staff and contractors to carry out rehabilitation projects at the rate that a more coordinated approach would entail besides excessive carbon emissions in the short term may not be desirable even if in the long run there are greater savings as climate studies have shown the need to reduce carbon emissions drastically and urgently ipcc 2022 keeping short term costs at acceptable levels is therefore a criterion that should be considered when identifying the ideal size of a coordination window in addition to minimizing sustainability costs accumulated in the long term this could be addressed by studying coordination policies where the size of the coordination window increases progressively during the first 10 20 years of the simulation period for the case study of luleå where the rehabilitation of individual pipes without road subbase replacement was assumed to be carried out using trenchless methods the size of the coordination window influenced the yearly ratios of rehabilitation that would be performed with open cut versus no dig methods this finding is significant for the water utility in terms of ensuring that contractors and in house capacity with the right competence is available the optimized coordination policy orange curve fig 7 a b d e involved a significant share of trenchless rehabilitation throughout the simulation period particularly after 2060 when approximately half of the water pipes and 80 of the sewer pipes would be rehabilitated using trenchless methods in an economic sustainability study in trondheim norway bruaset et al 2018 found that a scenario under which 100 of pipe rehabilitation was performed by open cut methods in coordination with the drinking water sewer and road networks would be preferable closely followed by the same scenario but with 50 of rehabilitations performed with no dig methods amongst several other factors the overall pipe age and material distribution in that setting could explain the differences between bruaset et al 2018 s findings and the present study in particular bruaset et al 2018 assumed a 50 ratio between structural and non structural no dig methods and focused on the cost borne by the water utility while the present study considered only structural no dig rehabilitation and looked at the total cost for water sewer and road infrastructure rehabilitation this study of different coordination policies has highlighted differences between the infrastructures in terms of asset lifetime underutilization fig 7g i with an extensive coordination policy road lifetimes were underutilized to a lesser extent than urban water pipes this can be explained by the shorter functional lifetimes assumed for road subbase than for the largest pipe cohorts in luleå municipality see fig 2 meaning that road sections triggered coordinated rehabilitation projects more often than urban water pipes did this is because the concept of a coordination window applied through the present multi utility rehabilitation model murm implies that the asset which is in need of rehabilitation first initiates the coordinated project in the case of luleå asset lifetime underutilization was relatively balanced between the infrastructures when applying the optimized coordination policy but there is no reason to expect similar results in other contexts as balancing lifetime underutilization was not a specified objective when optimizing the size of the coordination window insight into asset lifetime underutilization may be particularly important to establishing cost sharing principles between utility owners as a given coordination policy may trigger re investment in the infrastructure to a greater extent and or sooner in one utility than another the influence of the inter infrastructure spatial correlation of asset lifetimes ρ on total sustainability costs fig 4 of at most 11 for capital costs and 4 for the other costs appears to be limited compared to the uncertainties inherent in estimating asset lifetimes and the evolution of unit rehabilitation costs in the future this suggests that estimating the ρ parameter is not essential to studying the long term effects of coordination policies 4 2 generalizability the age distributions of luleå s drinking water pipe networks is similar to the swedish average for suburban and middle to small municipalities as seen in fig 8 the same is true of sewer pipes when comparing the age distribution of luleå to the swedish average as provided by the swedish water association svenskt vatten 2021 this study therefore appears to be representative of the swedish context in terms of pipe network rehabilitation need however pipe networks in other countries may have significantly different age distributions due for example to reconstruction efforts after world war ii or different historical trends in urban development in this study the rehabilitation of drinking water and or sewer pipe without replacement of the road subbase was assumed to be performed using trenchless methods this is because in luleå the replacement of urban water pipes by digging normally requires 2 5 3 m deep trenches with a top width of 4 6 m a new road subbase and bitumen layer is therefore laid whenever open cut pipe replacement is carried out although it may be financed by the water utility if the road utility does not decide to join the rehabilitation project further the rehabilitation of only sewer pipes and the road subbase was assumed to involve relining of the sewer and digging for the road subbase this is because open cut replacement of the sewer pipe without changing the drinking water pipe is highly impractical and risks damaging the latter it is therefore avoided by the water utility which manages both networks these factors mean the results of the case study cannot be generalized to municipalities where open cut replacement of individual pipes is common and implies partial excavation and restoration of the road width this is a rather common practice in the rest of europe where pipes are laid at a more shallow depth due to shallower frost depth and or the different infrastructures are separately owned the comparison of coordination policies in such contexts could be performed with the murm model and may show higher costs for low coordination levels than in the present study as there would be an increased probability of re excavating the same soil masses and resurfacing the same road sections within short time frames 4 3 usability putting into practice the concepts of a coordination window and coordination policy options presented here requires the participation of the different utilities at the strategic tactical and operational decision levels most negotiation and decision making would take place at the strategic level where infrastructure owners could meet twice to create the coordination policy the first meeting would entail seeking agreement on the action types and costs matrix as in table 2 the time horizons on which to evaluate the coordination policies and how to weight the sustainability costs against each other before the second meeting infrastructure owners would have to provide input data to the murm and murp modules including the survival functions that should be calibrated on local data to increase accuracy a first important aspect in the calibration stage is to determine the levels of service or levels of risk that represent the threshold at which a pipe reaches the end of its functional life a second important aspect is to correct for the left truncation and right censoring biases in the survival data using for example the kaplan meier method the second meeting would take place once the coordination policies different tau values have been evaluated with the murm and murp modules in this meeting stakeholders would have to agree on which coordination policy they deem most beneficial for the municipality as a whole the choice would have to be made in light of the implications of the coordination policy for each infrastructure in terms of rehabilitation rates as in fig 7a f and capital costs this is to ensure that the infrastructure owners can allocate the necessary budget and secure sufficient staff to implement the coordination policy estimation of capital costs per infrastructure would need to include a cost sharing scheme in the murm model which was outside the scope of the present study the two meetings at the strategic level and the data gathering and modelling work could be organized by one of the infrastructure owners a third party representing the general interest of the municipality e g employee of the town hall or a consulting firm with the relevant competencies in multi utility asset management the coordination policy should be revised on a timeline that is relevant to strategic asset management for example 10 years alegre et al 2013 coordination of rehabilitation works would be guided at the tactical level by the coordination policy i e the agreed coordination window size this implies that each utility would make their own 3 5 years list of projects having identified which of its assets are in need of rehabilitation prioritized for example on the basis of risk when a utility e g drinking water communicates its prioritized projects to the other infrastructure managers e g sewer road the latter would have to justify whether their assets situated in the affected infrastructure corridors have a high or low probability of operating at acceptable risk and performance levels for longer than the agreed τ value e g 30 years on this basis they would decline or accept joining the relevant rehabilitation projects in this way applying the coordination policy as defined in this study would not involve performing an integrated prioritization or optimization of rehabilitation projects at the tactical decision level as proposed for example by tscheikner et al 2016 or carey and lueke 2013 this is because the development of the coordination policy choice of coordination window size at the strategic level relies on the assumption that each utility a meets their own short term rehabilitation needs tactical time horizon of 3 5 years and b joins rehabilitation projects initiated by other utilities if it contributes to meeting future rehabilitation needs within the timeframe of the coordination window e g 30 years at the operational level the participation of the different utilities in implementing the chosen coordination approach would consist of continuously documenting replaced assets actual τ values and actual costs through a database which is accessible to stakeholders at the tactical and strategic decision levels in this way deviations from the agreed tau value and expected sustainability costs can be taken into account when applying and revising the coordination policy 4 4 limitations and potential sustainability cost predictions were made in this study using a time horizon of over 100 years this creates significant uncertainties due to expected technological developments in rehabilitation methods e g use of electrical excavator advances in trenchless technologies and asphalt production which are likely to affect the economic costs and global warming potential per metre of rehabilitated pipes and roads besides the sensitivity analysis performed in this study it would be preferable to estimate the uncertainties associated to each input parameter and evaluated their joined effect on result uncertainties changes in functional requirements may also occur during the coming 100 years for example concerning source separation of wastewater and adaptation of residential streets to pedestrian and bike traffic such changes may be drivers of asset replacement but they are not accounted for in the present modelling approach more generally use of the model in its current state is limited to areas characterized by street segments where asset rehabilitation is driven by deterioration areas where hydraulics or traffic capacity increase are likely to drive rehabilitation would have to be analysed separately another limitation of the model is that predictions can only be based on a given rehabilitation need per asset cohort described by survival functions calibrated for a target performance or risk level the model does not estimate decrease of performance levels leakage or infiltration and inflow rate associated with coordination policies where asset rehabilitations may be delayed beyond the end of the functional lifetimes of relevant assets excavation volume was used as an indicator of the external consequences of excavation e g disturbances to traffic in the case study this is another limitation of this study as a given excavation size can disturb traffic in different ways depending on its location external consequences are also connected to the time of interventions which are a function of not only the excavation volume but also other parameters such soil type pipe diameter etc results which are more valuable for practitioners could be obtained with the present coordination model murm and murp modules by adding modules allowing it to i predict economic cost per utility with a cost sharing scheme ii account for inflation and discount rates in economic calculations iii include a minimum length for rehabilitation projects iv account for uncertainties in cohort survival functions v use multi variate asset deterioration models or vi use model coordination policies where the coordination window size depends on the infrastructure initiating the rehabilitation project 5 conclusion a modelling approach was developed to quantify the influence of multi utility coordination on the overall long term costs of water sewer and road network rehabilitation the concept of a coordination window size was introduced as part of the model and this appears to be a useful parameter in accounting for the impact of coordinated rehabilitation projects on shortening the lifetime of infrastructure assets the study highlights the so far poorly employed value of considering and leveraging multi utility coordination at the strategic decision level where long term financing of infrastructure rehabilitation is addressed similar studies on other municipalities which consider the uncertainties in survival functions and rehabilitation costs metre are needed before any generalizable quantifications of the benefits of multi

14823,due to structural and hydraulic deterioration urban water pipe networks have annual rehabilitation needs worldwide these needs are often significantly larger than the actual amount of rehabilitation being performed leading to increased risks of serious failures lower performance and a growing techno financial burden for future generations it is well accepted that in order to limit the multiple impacts of utility works in the urban environment rehabilitation projects should be coordinated between water transport energy and telecommunication infrastructures in practice such coordination means that public utilities must rehabilitate assets earlier or later than technically needed in order to engage in joint projects in which digging and resurfacing expenditures are shared hence at the municipal scale such coordination influences two variables that are key to strategic decision support average costs metre for asset rehabilitation and the service lifetimes of those assets however current models for strategic asset management do not enable practitioners to estimate how changes in the coordination process may influence the long term financial and environmental impacts of infrastructure rehabilitation the present study aimed at addressing this methodological gap by introducing the concept of a coordination window that quantifies to what extent utilities compromise asset rehabilitation times in order to join multi utility projects an algorithm for modelling the influence of the coordination window size on long term sustainability costs is presented and applied to one swedish municipality the results suggested that total capital costs and carbon emissions can be lowered by 34 and 16 with a coordination window of 35 and 25 year in comparison to the no coordination case keywords infrastructure asset management pipe networks pavement multi utility rehabilitation trenchless data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction despite their criticality for human welfare and development municipal infrastructures such as drinking water sewers and road networks have been shown worldwide to be in poor condition berger et al 2016 wall and rust 2017 sakai et al 2020 asce 2021 and to suffer from insufficient reinvestment this underlines the need for water and road utilities to step up their pro active rehabilitation efforts and thereby prevent levels of service deteriorating and operational expenditures increasing water utilities are under pressure to meet rehabilitation needs in a cost effective manner as they also have to finance adaptations to climate change urban population growth and tighter environmental regulations for example it has been estimated that all eu countries but germany need to increase annual expenditures for water supply and sanitations by at least 25 to comply with the current water directives oecd 2020 at the same time utilities must decrease the external consequences of successive excavation activities as these affect numerous external actors and may also hinder the implementation of rehabilitation projects these external consequences include disturbance to traffic and local businesses as well damage to adjacent infrastructure and the local environment e g trees to address these challenges and the problem of ageing municipal infrastructures two complementary strategies can be identified the implementation of infrastructure asset management marlow beale and burn 2010 and coordination of rehabilitation efforts between utilities infrastructure asset management for water utilities has been organised into three aligned decision levels alegre et al 2013 work at the strategic level includes setting target renewal rates for the entire infrastructure and securing the corresponding reinvestment budget with a time horizon of 10 to 20 years the tactical level often refers to the production of 3 to 5 year plans through which rehabilitation projects are prioritized typically taking a risk based approach the focus at that level is generally to maximize network improvement with the available reinvestment budget the operational level deals with project implementation on a 1 2 years time horizon including choice of rehabilitation methods and spatial and temporal coordination of building activities possibly with other utilities the ability to address multi utility coordination is important at all three decision levels of water infrastructure asset management in particular coordination of rehabilitation works between utilities has an influence on the quantities evaluated at the strategic level including the yearly capital expenditure required to meet the renewal needs of urban water pipe networks this is because coordination can reduce rehabilitation costs metre through for example shared excavations and repaving expenditures but may also shorten or extend asset service lives this is a consequence of the problems of scale defined by daulat et al 2022 as one of the seven challenges in practicing integrated multi infrastructure asset management integration of multi utility coordination in the water infrastructure asset management process has mostly been addressed in scientific studies at the tactical decision level for example studies by carey and lueke 2013 osman 2015 tscheikner gratl et al 2016 abu samra et al 2020 and shahata et al 2022 focus on optimized scheduling and prioritization of rehabilitation interventions with the general aim of making the best use of available re investment budgets integration of multi utility coordination at the strategic level has been partly addressed by bruaset et al 2018 who estimated total reinvestment costs over a 15 year period for the drinking water and sewer pipe networks of trondheim municipality in norway the authors considered different scenarios with regards to multi utility coordination and use of trenchless technologies however the coordination process was assumed to be systematic i e rehabilitation of an asset triggers rehabilitation of the adjacent assets independent of their conditions which did not allow for modelling different levels of coordination earlier malm et al 2013 estimated the capital costs of meeting the long term renewal needs of both sewer and water pipe networks in sweden using cohort survival functions calibrated with historical decommissioning data this approach assumes a same as in the past scenario large et al 2015 when it comes to rehabilitation performed for other reasons than deterioration including coordination between utilities the study presented in this paper aimed at increasing the currently limited knowledge and availability of tools for assessing the long term 30 years effects of multi utility coordinated rehabilitation on strategic asset management metrics the objectives of the study were to develop an algorithm modelling the influence of multi utility coordination on the long term costs of pipe and road network rehabilitation to apply the algorithm to a case study to compare different coordination policies in terms of long term sustainability costs and identify possible optimal coordination levels and to assess the importance of the inter infrastructure spatial correlation of asset lifetimes as a modelling parameter 2 method 2 1 defining and quantifying the concept of coordination coordination can have different meanings depending on which aspect of integrated multi infrastructure asset management daulat et al 2022 is being discussed in this study coordination was identified where adjacent infrastructure assets e g pipes pavement were rehabilitated earlier or later than the end of their functional lives in order to carry out works on multiple assets within a single project the end of an asset s functional life was defined as the point in time when the asset reaches an unacceptable level of performance or risk due to deterioration and therefore needs to be rehabilitated thresholds for unacceptable performance or risk levels may be organisation and time dependent bruaset et al 2017 the concept of adjacency between assets was determined by the observation that the digging required to rehabilitate these assets individually would involve partly or fully excavating the same soil masses modelling the influence of coordination on long term rehabilitation costs requires that coordination is quantified this was achieved by introducing the concept of a coordination window as presented in fig 1 the coordination window starts when one asset needs rehabilitation and is extended a given number of years τ into the future this period represents the criteria for coordination meaning that adjacent assets i e those in the same street segment whose end of functional life circles in fig 1 falls within the coordination window are rehabilitated together in a joined multi infrastructure project vertically aligned crosses in fig 1 a pro active asset management approach was assumed meaning that the joint rehabilitation project would take place at the beginning of the coordination window this implies that asset rehabilitations are performed at a maximum τ years earlier than needed the variable τ was used as a quantitative metric of the intensity of the coordination process occurring in infrastructure asset rehabilitation if τ 0 adjacent assets are rehabilitated in joint projects only if they reach the end of their functional lives at the same time leading to mostly single utility projects i e no coordination if τ adjacent assets are always rehabilitated in multi utility projects i e there is systematic coordination in this paper τ is interchangeably referred to as the size of the coordination window or the level of coordination the coordination model was developed on the basis of τ being constant throughout the simulation period 2 2 choice of the deterioration model the cohort survival approach was selected to model infrastructure asset deterioration in the algorithm developed providing the predictions of remaining functional lifetimes needed to implement the concept of a coordination window cohort survival is a probabilistic single variate kleiner and rajani 2001 modelling approach which has been applied mainly to drinking water herz 1996 malm et al 2012 large et al 2015 bruaset et al 2017 and sewer pipe networks baur and herz 2002 duchesne et al 2013 malm et al 2013 no theoretical or practical obstacles to using this approach for other networked infrastructure were found in the literature the approach consists of organizing assets into groups cohorts that are homogeneous with regard to their deterioration behaviour herz 1996 the approach is well suited to making long term predictions of rehabilitation needs at the network level and has a relatively low data requirement it does not take into account spatial co variates with the intention of making predictions for single assets the minimum data requirement is so called survival functions for each cohort as well as the network age and cohort distribution expressed in installed kilometres of pipe road installed per decade and cohort type the survival functions can be based on any statistical distribution e g herz weibull that is appropriate to the observations used in its calibration if the purpose is to forecast replacement needs as in this study these observations should normally be a dataset of times or time periods at which assets have reached the end of their functional life i e need replacement due to unacceptable levels of performance e g excessive frequency of leakage for a drinking water pipe high groundwater infiltration rate for a sewer pipe or risk e g poor structural condition for a critical sewer pipe for sewer networks the calibration of survival curves capturing pipe deterioration is currently limited by the fact that cctv inspection which is by far the most common inspection method has many flaws in assessing structural integrity and water tightness other methods are under development and are expected to be mature within 2 10 years tscheikner gratl et al 2020 the choice of using a cohort survival model was motivated by the availability of data for such models in a scandinavian context as they are commonly used for estimating rehabilitation needs at the strategical level for both sewer and drinking water networks the developed coordination model is however compatible with other survival model for example the ones that have been previously developed for sewer networks laakso et al 2019 the coordination model may also be used with failure prediction models which are more common for drinking water networks scheidegger et al 2015 by assuming that the end of functional life corresponds to a failure probability threshold 2 3 level of aggregation of the infrastructure inventories the coordination model was developed on the assumption that an integrated asset inventory would be available as input data the integrated asset inventory is more detailed than the conventional data requirement of cohort survival models and refers to a list of segments with the following attributes segment length installation years for each infrastructure concerned and cohort type for each infrastructure concerned as mentioned in section 2 2 the age distribution in installed km per decade and cohort type is sufficient to run a cohort survival model for a single infrastructure however the study of a coordination scenario requires knowledge of the inter infrastructure spatial combination of one of the outputs of cohort survival models namely remaining lifetimes hence the inter infrastructure spatial combination of cohort survival model inputs installation years and cohort types was identified as a necessary input to the coordination model that was developed one way to summarize this information is to use combined multi infrastructure cohorts but these can be too numerous to be practical to consider 3 infrastructures and 5 cohorts leads to 125 combined cohorts moreover adjacent assets from different infrastructures do not necessarily have the same installation year leading to even more combinations to express the asset inventories in a summarized way this motivated the choice to use a detailed integrated asset inventory gis information about whole pipe road networks is becoming increasingly available and quick to process thanks to improved computing power an example of integrated asset inventory is presented in table 1 the coordination model was developed to process input data at segment level but not to make predictions at that level as this would constitute tactical asset management the detailed asset inventory was used as a structure to sample lifetimes and derive aggregated information at the network level concerning the strategic implications of different coordination strategies a segment see above contains adjacent assets and is sometimes referred to as either a street segment if it contains a road or otherwise a trench segment the criteria used to define segments were that they should be short enough to contain no more than one cohort type and one installation year per infrastructure 2 4 lifetime sampling strategy the survival function s of a given cohort is directly related to the cumulative distribution function f of its assets lifetime distribution through the relation s 1 f cumulative distribution functions can be used to generate random numbers according to given distributions by using inverse transform sampling devroye and devroye 1986 therefore inverse transform sampling was used in the coordination model to assign a functional lifetime to all infrastructure assets based on the expected lifetime distribution within each cohort this involved first assigning to the assets a random number x from a uniform distribution in the range 0 1 and then computing f 1 x to obtain the corresponding lifetime different uniform distributions were used for each infrastructure type special attention was given to how correlated these distributions were as described in section 2 5 below 2 5 accounting for inter infrastructure spatial correlation of asset lifetimes the cholesky decomposition cholesky 2005 was identified as a suitable method to account for the inter infrastructure correlation of asset lifetimes in the coordination model it is the simplest method that was found in the literature that generates sets of normally distributed random numbers with given correlation coefficients between these sets burgess 2022 the matrix r was defined as an input modelling parameter with ρ i j referring to the pearson coefficient between the asset lifetimes of infrastructure i and infrastructure j the model followed a routine to 1 generate for each infrastructure a normal distribution in the range 0 1 with as many elements as there are street segments 2 use the cholesky decomposition to generate a new set of normal distributions correlated according to matrix r 3 apply the cumulative distribution function of the normal distributions to obtain uniform distributions in the range 0 1 also correlated according to the r matrix r ρ i j 1 i i 1 j i 2 6 definition of model outputs the following quantities are needed in order to compare coordination polices and evaluate their implications for infrastructure owners length i e meters of of rehabilitation action performed per year a rehabilitation action corresponds to a combination of adjacent assets being rehabilitated examples rehabilitation of drinking water pipe and pavement rehabilitation of sewer and pavement etc the number of possible rehabilitation actions a is related to the number of studied infrastructures i with the equation a 2i 1 sustainability costs per year e g capital costs greenhouse gases emissions obtained by multiplying per year length of rehabilitation performed action by the user defined unit costs of these actions rehabilitation rate per year by infrastructure type expressed as a percentage under utilization ratio per year by infrastructure type this is the average ratio between asset age at time of rehabilitation and the asset s functional lifetime the structure of the coordination model developed implies that the result from one simulation is based on only one possible set of assigned asset lifetimes compatible with the input cohort survival functions and the inter infrastructure correlation matrix r to obtain results with a decision making value the model was programmed to run numerous simulations and plot the average value and 95 confidence interval of the output quantities for each year of the simulation period the number of simulations to be performed should be increased incrementally in order to narrow confidence intervals until the comparison between coordination policies is deemed to be meaningful 2 7 application to the case study of luleå 2 7 1 integrated asset inventory the comparative coordination study focused on the sewer drinking water distribution and road infrastructure of the municipality of luleå in sweden in january 2021 the population of luleå municipality serviced by the public water utility was 66 700 inhabitants asset inventories of the three infrastructures were retrieved in gis format from the water utility and the swedish transport administration website an integrated asset inventory was produced by processing the gis layers of the three infrastructures with the buffering and spatial join functions of the open source software qgis a 6 metre wide buffer was created along each sewer pipes to determine if there was an adjacent drinking water pipe and to read its attributes the inventory comprised 3469 residential street segments with an average length of 50 7 m for a total length of 176 km this corresponded to 39 of the total street length of luleå municipality the attributes of the segments were length installation year of drinking water pipe material of drinking water pipe installation year of sewer pipe material of sewer pipe installation year of the road subbase all segments corresponded to residential streets with average daily traffic of less than 1000 vehicles the inventory was limited to such streets because they were considered to be the most suitable for coordinated infrastructure renewal projects in the chosen municipality a large proportion of residential streets in luleå municipality lacks both an engineered subbase layer and a functioning drainage solution improving the status of these roads therefore requires excavation works which could be performed in coordination with open cut pipe replacement operations on the other hand condition improvement operations on larger roads more commonly consists of replacing the asphalt top layer making them less suited for coordination with open cut pipe replacement projects 2 7 2 survival functions the cohort survival functions estimated by malm et al 2013 were used for the water and sewer pipes in the asset inventory for luleå these curves are described by herz survival functions herz 1996 on the basis of three parameters t100 the time after installation when 100 of the asset cohort remain functional t50 the time after installation when 50 of the asset cohort remain functional t10 the time after installation when 10 of the asset cohort remain functional the survival functions were determined based on decommissioning data from gothenburg stockholm and several norwegian municipalities malm et al 2013 they do not capture only the deterioration behaviour of the different cohorts but also the fact that pipes were replaced for adapting hydraulic capacity or due to external factors e g coordination to an unspecified extent it is a limitation of this case study as the murm prototype requires that the input survival functions represent the deterioration of the assets a method to obtain such curves is described in section 4 3 lifetime estimates for road subbase layers are scarce in the literature for the case of luleå a review of amortization periods used by swedish municipalities for road subbase layers was performed this found an average value of 80 years this figure was used as the parameter t50 for the road subbase values of 50 and 110 years were assumed for the t100 and t10 parameters 30 years all the survival curves used for the case study of luleå are presented in fig 2 the survival curves water pe and ductile iron after 1980 and sewer plastic were used for water and sewer pipes rehabilitated with the digging method pipe replacement for pipes rehabilitated with structural trenchless methods the survival curves proposed by bruaset et al 2018 were applied 2 7 3 unit costs of actions the economic cost global warming potential gwp and excavation need for each combination of rehabilitation actions are presented in table 2 the assumed rehabilitation methods digging or trenchless are also given for each infrastructure note that a trenchless approach is assumed for rehabilitation of pipes without road rehabilitation this is because due to installation depth and trench width changing urban water pipes with the open cut method in luleå cannot be performed without changing the road layers economic costs for open cut rehabilitations were derived from completed projects within the municipality of luleå for the trenchless methods the costs were derived from completed projects in stockholm municipality as there was insufficient data available for the municipality of luleå the cured in placed pipe cipp relining method was assumed for the trenchless rehabilitation of sewers while pipe bursting was assumed for drinking water pipes global warming potential and excavation needs for the open cut operations were obtained from pericault et al 2018 for the cipp method values were obtained from ariaratnam and sihabuddin 2009 for the pipe bursting method values were obtained from kaushal and najafi 2020 2 7 4 comparison of coordination policies three coordination policies involving the rehabilitation of urban water pipes and road subbase in the residential streets of luleå municipality were compared one policy with no coordination coordination window of 1 year another with an optimized coordination level and a third policy with extensive coordination coordination window of 100 years for the optimized coordination scenario the model was run for sizes of coordination window varying from 1 to 100 years and total costs over the period 2020 2120 were computed the optimized coordination window was chosen based on the point where the weighed sum of total capital cost global warming potential and excavated volume was lowest with all three factors given equal weight when computing the weighed sum total costs values capital cost global warming potential excavation need over the period 2020 2120 were first divided by the value obtained for the case of no coordination τ 0 the python codes for the murm and murp modules adapted for the case study of luleå and the headers of the different input tables are published on the zenodo repository with the following doi 10 5281 zenodo 7118609 2 7 5 sensitivity analysis an analysis was performed to assess the sensitivity of the optimized coordination window to changes in input parameters the following changes in input parameters were tested change from middle to upper and lower bounds of the ranges of survival times proposed by malm et al 2013 for drinking water and sewer pipe cohorts changes in similar proportion were applied to the survival times of road subbase these changes are summarized in table 3 alongside the initial survival times 50 decrease 25 decrease 25 increase and 50 increase in economic cost and global warming potential per metre of the different rehabilitation actions 25 decrease and 50 decrease in excavation needs per metre for the open cut rehabilitation actions increase in excavation needs were not tested as the values used for luleå are high in comparison to other european cities due to deep frost free line for pipes installation 2 5 m and thick road subbase for frost heave protection 1 m 50 increase in the weights given to economic environmental and social costs when optimizing the coordination window the optimization of the coordination window size τ was repeated for each change in parameter value this resulted in 32 optimizations corresponding to 640 simulations as one optimization required 20 simulations τ values from 0 to 100 year with a 5 year time step the optimized τ values and corresponding reductions increases in total costs were saved for comparison 3 results 3 1 multi utility rehabilitation modeller murm and planner murp the infrastructure coordination model developed in this study consisted of a python program structured in two modules the murm multi utility rehabilitation modeller module computes model outputs for one set of input modelling parameters τ r ρt and one sampling of asset lifetimes the different computing steps of the murm module are shown in a flowchart fig 3 using the murm module with other deterioration models would imply discarding the part of the flowchart leading to interface 1 the deterioration model would need to feed the computing step coordinated renewal modelling with the estimated end of functional life of the infrastructures for all studied segments murp enables up to three sets of modelling parameters to be compared by running the murm module a user defined number of times for each set of parameters and plotting the corresponding average values and confidence intervals of the model outputs in line charts 3 2 case study of luleå residential streets 3 2 1 influence of coordination window size and inter infrastructure lifetime correlation on total sustainability costs fig 4 shows the influence of the size of the coordination window τ on capital costs global warming potential and excavated volume accumulated over the period 2020 2120 these accumulated costs are also referred to as total sustainability costs the relationships between τ and total costs represented in fig 4 were computed assuming a low ρ 0 1 moderate ρ 0 5 and high ρ 0 9 correlation of asset lifetimes between infrastructures total capital expenditures fig 4a were highest 425 million for a coordination window size τ of 0 year i e a policy of no coordination increasing τ up to 35 or 40 years was found to decrease capital expenditure by up to 34 or 29 depending on the inter infrastructure correlation of asset lifetimes ρ 0 9 or 0 1 increasing the coordination window size further to beyond 40 years was found to moderately increase the total capital cost fig 4a although the latter remained lower than with a policy of no coordination τ 0 years for example for ρ 0 5 a τ value of 100 years corresponding to a policy of extensive coordination resulted in a total capital cost of 319 million a 25 reduction on the no coordination policy τ 0 years total global warming potential fig 4b reached a minimum of 13 000 tons of co2 equivalent for a coordination window size τ of 25 years representing a 16 reduction on the 16 000 thousand tons of co2 equivalent emitted with the no coordination policy for τ values greater than 25 years total global warming potential increased additionally τ values larger than 60 years resulted in a higher global warming potential than if no coordination took place τ 0 years total excavated volume 4c was consistently found to increase from 1 25 to 2 15 million cubic meters as the coordination window increased from 0 to 100 years this is because in this case study single utility i e uncoordinated replacement of pipes was assumed to be carried out using trenchless methods the rate of increase was higher in the range 0 40 years than for τ values of more than 40 years the inter infrastructure spatial correlation of asset lifetimes ρ was found to have a somewhat positive effect on total capital cost reductions this effect was most noticeable for a τ value of 30 years where increasing ρ from 0 1 to 0 9 was found to reduce total capital costs by 11 the influence of ρ on total global warming potential and total excavation was very limited with changes of at most 4 and 2 observed for a τ value of 100 years a possible explanation for this is the differences in survival functions between the different infrastructure cohorts this leads to lifetime underutilization even under the beneficial scenario of ρ 0 9 under which short lived sewer pipes are adjacent to short lived drinking water pipes and situated under short lived road subbases as short lived has different meaning among the infrastructures in terms of functional lifetimes 3 2 2 yearly sustainability costs renewal rates and under utilization ratios fig 6 shows the modelled yearly capital costs global warming potential and excavated volume associated with the renewal of drinking water sewer and road infrastructures in the residential streets of luleå in sweden the results are shown for three policies no coordination blue curve τ 0 years optimized coordination orange curve τ 20 years and extensive coordination green curve τ 100 years for each curve the bold line represents the average of 30 simulations and the area surrounding the bold line represents the corresponding 95 confidence interval results are shown for 30 simulations because standard deviation of the different yearly costs were stable when increasing the number of simulations beyond 30 an example of this is shown in fig 5 for capital costs the inter infrastructure lifetime correlation coefficient ρ was set to 0 5 moderate correlation between all three infrastructures the τ value for the optimized coordination policy 20 years was selected based on the relationships shown in fig 4 and according to the method described in section 2 7 this policy resulted in differences of 22 in total capital costs 14 in total global warming potential and 19 in total excavated volume over the period 2020 2120 compared to the no coordination policy the policy of no coordination fig 6 a blue curve resulted in relatively low levels of reinvestment 4 4 0 4 million per year over the period 2020 2170 on the other hand extensive coordination fig 6a green curve led to high initial capital costs of 5 8 million per year steadily decreasing to 2 1 million per year by the 2065 and later remaining in the range 2 7 0 5 million per year the optimized coordination policy fig 6a orange curve showed similar variation but within a narrower range of capital cost values it led to 5 2 million per year of reinvestment at the beginning of the simulation period sharply decreasing to 2 8 million per year by 2035 and remaining in the range 3 2 0 4 million per year beyond this greenhouse gas emissions were also relatively stable over time under the no coordination policy fig 6b blue curve these emissions corresponded to global warming potential values in the range 150 25 tons co2 equivalent per year extensive coordination fig 6b green curve led to much higher emissions of 340 tons co2 equivalent per year at the beginning of the simulation period with a decreasing trend up to 2070 and levels similar to the no coordination policy 150 25 tons co2 equivalent per year beyond that optimized coordination fig 6c orange curve also resulted in high initial greenhouse gases emissions 250 tons co2 equivalent per year but with a sharp decrease to 120 tons co2 equivalent per year by 2035 and beyond which is lower than the levels achieved by the other two policies as with capital costs and global warming potential excavated volumes fig 6c were initially high for the extensive green curve and optimized orange curve coordination policies and decreased at different rates to more stable levels however they both resulted in more excavation volume per year than with the no coordination policy blue curve thoughout the 2020 2170 period this is because low coordination resulted in more single pipe rehabiliation projects which were assumed to be perfomed with trenchless methods i e no or very low excavation needed per metre of rehabiliated pipe however after 2035 the excess excavation volume associated with the optimized coordination policy was only 20 greater than the level expected under the no coordination policy fig 7 presents the implications of the different coordination policies for each infrastructure in terms of renewal rate i e renewed pipe length divided by total network length achieved via coordinated open cut projects a c renewal rate achieved via trenchless or single utility projects d f and under utilization ratios g i the total renewal rate of an infrastructure is the sum of the renewal rate achieved via coordinated open cut projects and the renewal rate achieved via trenchless methods in this case study the policy of no coordination τ 0 implied no open cut projects for rehabilitating water or sewer pipes and no road subgrade replacement projects in coordination with pipe replacement as shown by the blue curves in fig 7a b and c with τ 0 the renewal of infrastructures was achieved entirely with trenchless and road alone projects at renewal rates varying within the ranges 1 05 0 25 water fig 7d 1 0 3 sewer fig 7e and 1 15 0 25 road fig 7f during the period 2020 2170 these renewal rates followed the actual renewal need of the three infrastructures through just on time asset rehabilitation this is illustrated by the under utilization plots fig 7g i showing null values for the τ 0 policy blue curves throughout the simulation period the policy of extensive coordination τ 100 years green curves showed the opposite to the no coordination policy with asset rehabilitation achieved only through open cut coordinated projects fig 7a c with negligible application of trenchless technologies and road alone rehabilitation projects fig 7d f the renewal rates of the three infrastructures were equal during the entire simulation period as the rehabilitation of an asset from one infrastructure systematically triggered rehabilitation of the adjacent assets from the two other infrastructures initially these rates were particularly high at 2 6 but then decreased to 0 9 by 2065 and varied within the range 1 2 0 2 later on these values did not reflect the renewal needs of the three infrastructures as assets were rehabilitated not only based on their condition but also for coordination reasons this is reflected in the under utilization ratios which are not null for this policy fig 7g i green curves under utilization of assets was not the same across the three networks in the simulation it increased from 12 and 17 to 35 and 30 for the drinking water and sewer networks while for the road infrastructure it decreased from 15 to 4 the optimized coordination policy fig 7 orange curves resulted in both open cut and trenchless methods being employed to renew the piped infrastructures the rate of renewal of the drinking water pipe network with open cut projects had an initial value of 1 6 fig 7a and gradually decreased to remain in the range 0 4 0 1 by 2060 and beyond with trenchless methods this rate fell within the range 0 4 0 15 before 2060 and 0 5 0 1 after that date for the sewer network renewal with open cut methods had an initial value of 1 2 and gradually decreased to 0 15 by 2060 and beyond while with trenchless methods this rate was within the range 0 5 0 2 before 2060 and 0 8 0 1 later on the road infrastructure was renewed both in coordination with pipe rehabilitation fig 7c orange curve and in individual projects fig 7f orange curve with the optimimized policy under utilization ratios fig 7g i orange curves were considerably lower and more balanced than with the extensive coordination policy green curve the lifetimes of renewed drinking water and sewer pipes were under utilized by about 5 thoughout the simulation period fig 7g h orange curves for the road subbases the underutilization ratio fig 6i orange curve had an initial value of 10 but then decreased to 0 4 from 2050 onwards 3 2 3 sensitivity analysis the results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in table 4 the optimized coordination window τ proved relatively robust to single changes of parameters values i e changing value of one parameter at a time the largest change in optimized tau value was observed when the digging costs were decrease by 50 or when the weight of the economic costs was increased by 50 this increased the optimized coordination window by 10 years from 15 to 25 years note that in the original analysis the optimized value obtained for τ with the initial parameter set was 20 years while in table 4 this value is 15 years this is because only multiple of 10 years were considered for τ in the original analysis in the sensitivity analysis a refined time step of 5 years was used in the optimization the differences in total sustainability costs between the optimized coordination window and the case of no coordination were considerably affected by some of the changes in input parameters for example when decreasing digging cost by 50 the reduction in total capital costs was of 43 in comparison to 18 in the initial optimization the reduction in total global warming potential changed from 14 to 27 when decreasing the global warming potential per metre of open cut rehabilitation by 50 the excess excavation need in comparison to the no coordination case changed from 15 to 29 when increasing by 50 the weight of economic costs in the optimization process 4 discussion 4 1 renewal coordination long term impacts and strategic implications this study confirms and illustrates the intuitive hypothesis that coordinating infrastructure renewal too little or too much can both be sub optimal due to respectively missed opportunities for cost sharing or underutilizing the lifetimes of particular assets application of the coordination model to the case study of luleå showed that total capital cost and global warming potential could be minimized by using a coordination window τ of 35 and 25 years respectively the results from applying the coordination model also showed that deviation from these values e g 10 or 50 years would result in substantially higher total costs for the municipality these results suggest that it is beneficial for a municipality to have control over the τ parameter by pro actively choosing and implementing a coordination policy in light of its long term strategic implications treating coordination as a purely operational project specific matter i e not having a specific coordination policy in place is likely to result in sub optimal levels of coordination and cost more overall this study showed that the capital cost reduction obtained by optimizing coordination was 34 over a 100 year period this differs considerably from the 11 to 7 reductions found by other studies carey and lueke 2013 and abu samra et al 2020 where coordination was optimized at the tactical decision level one possible reason for these differences is that pipes in luleå are installed at a minimum depth of 2 5 m to protect them from ground frost leading to large excavation volumes per pipe replaced and consequently more potential for savings through cost sharing than in other locations a second possible reason for the large savings found in this study is that the option of using either open cut or trenchless methods was considered in the optimization process this option can lead to more cost efficient scenarios than when only the open cut method is considered but it has the drawback of assuming that trenchless methods can be used for any pipe replacement project which is not always valid for example where pipes suffer from an uneven slope profile or where pipe diameter needs to be increased the results also indicate that coordinating the rehabilitation of multiple adjacent infrastructures can lead to higher sustainability costs in the shorter to mid terms but still yield long term benefits for example the optimized policy orange curve in fig 6a b implied higher yearly capital costs and carbon emissions than the no coordination policy blue curve during the first 10 years of the simulation but was cheaper and less carbon intensive from a 100 year perspective fig 4a b this was due to future costly replacement of individual assets e g sewer pipes being avoided by replacing the asset earlier in joint projects with other infrastructures e g road and or drinking water this highlights the need for a long term approach when studying the benefits of coordinated asset rehabilitation hence its relevance to the strategic decision level incurring high short term capital costs may be unrealistic because they require prohibitively sharp increases in investment budgets and customer fees there may also be insufficient in house staff and contractors to carry out rehabilitation projects at the rate that a more coordinated approach would entail besides excessive carbon emissions in the short term may not be desirable even if in the long run there are greater savings as climate studies have shown the need to reduce carbon emissions drastically and urgently ipcc 2022 keeping short term costs at acceptable levels is therefore a criterion that should be considered when identifying the ideal size of a coordination window in addition to minimizing sustainability costs accumulated in the long term this could be addressed by studying coordination policies where the size of the coordination window increases progressively during the first 10 20 years of the simulation period for the case study of luleå where the rehabilitation of individual pipes without road subbase replacement was assumed to be carried out using trenchless methods the size of the coordination window influenced the yearly ratios of rehabilitation that would be performed with open cut versus no dig methods this finding is significant for the water utility in terms of ensuring that contractors and in house capacity with the right competence is available the optimized coordination policy orange curve fig 7 a b d e involved a significant share of trenchless rehabilitation throughout the simulation period particularly after 2060 when approximately half of the water pipes and 80 of the sewer pipes would be rehabilitated using trenchless methods in an economic sustainability study in trondheim norway bruaset et al 2018 found that a scenario under which 100 of pipe rehabilitation was performed by open cut methods in coordination with the drinking water sewer and road networks would be preferable closely followed by the same scenario but with 50 of rehabilitations performed with no dig methods amongst several other factors the overall pipe age and material distribution in that setting could explain the differences between bruaset et al 2018 s findings and the present study in particular bruaset et al 2018 assumed a 50 ratio between structural and non structural no dig methods and focused on the cost borne by the water utility while the present study considered only structural no dig rehabilitation and looked at the total cost for water sewer and road infrastructure rehabilitation this study of different coordination policies has highlighted differences between the infrastructures in terms of asset lifetime underutilization fig 7g i with an extensive coordination policy road lifetimes were underutilized to a lesser extent than urban water pipes this can be explained by the shorter functional lifetimes assumed for road subbase than for the largest pipe cohorts in luleå municipality see fig 2 meaning that road sections triggered coordinated rehabilitation projects more often than urban water pipes did this is because the concept of a coordination window applied through the present multi utility rehabilitation model murm implies that the asset which is in need of rehabilitation first initiates the coordinated project in the case of luleå asset lifetime underutilization was relatively balanced between the infrastructures when applying the optimized coordination policy but there is no reason to expect similar results in other contexts as balancing lifetime underutilization was not a specified objective when optimizing the size of the coordination window insight into asset lifetime underutilization may be particularly important to establishing cost sharing principles between utility owners as a given coordination policy may trigger re investment in the infrastructure to a greater extent and or sooner in one utility than another the influence of the inter infrastructure spatial correlation of asset lifetimes ρ on total sustainability costs fig 4 of at most 11 for capital costs and 4 for the other costs appears to be limited compared to the uncertainties inherent in estimating asset lifetimes and the evolution of unit rehabilitation costs in the future this suggests that estimating the ρ parameter is not essential to studying the long term effects of coordination policies 4 2 generalizability the age distributions of luleå s drinking water pipe networks is similar to the swedish average for suburban and middle to small municipalities as seen in fig 8 the same is true of sewer pipes when comparing the age distribution of luleå to the swedish average as provided by the swedish water association svenskt vatten 2021 this study therefore appears to be representative of the swedish context in terms of pipe network rehabilitation need however pipe networks in other countries may have significantly different age distributions due for example to reconstruction efforts after world war ii or different historical trends in urban development in this study the rehabilitation of drinking water and or sewer pipe without replacement of the road subbase was assumed to be performed using trenchless methods this is because in luleå the replacement of urban water pipes by digging normally requires 2 5 3 m deep trenches with a top width of 4 6 m a new road subbase and bitumen layer is therefore laid whenever open cut pipe replacement is carried out although it may be financed by the water utility if the road utility does not decide to join the rehabilitation project further the rehabilitation of only sewer pipes and the road subbase was assumed to involve relining of the sewer and digging for the road subbase this is because open cut replacement of the sewer pipe without changing the drinking water pipe is highly impractical and risks damaging the latter it is therefore avoided by the water utility which manages both networks these factors mean the results of the case study cannot be generalized to municipalities where open cut replacement of individual pipes is common and implies partial excavation and restoration of the road width this is a rather common practice in the rest of europe where pipes are laid at a more shallow depth due to shallower frost depth and or the different infrastructures are separately owned the comparison of coordination policies in such contexts could be performed with the murm model and may show higher costs for low coordination levels than in the present study as there would be an increased probability of re excavating the same soil masses and resurfacing the same road sections within short time frames 4 3 usability putting into practice the concepts of a coordination window and coordination policy options presented here requires the participation of the different utilities at the strategic tactical and operational decision levels most negotiation and decision making would take place at the strategic level where infrastructure owners could meet twice to create the coordination policy the first meeting would entail seeking agreement on the action types and costs matrix as in table 2 the time horizons on which to evaluate the coordination policies and how to weight the sustainability costs against each other before the second meeting infrastructure owners would have to provide input data to the murm and murp modules including the survival functions that should be calibrated on local data to increase accuracy a first important aspect in the calibration stage is to determine the levels of service or levels of risk that represent the threshold at which a pipe reaches the end of its functional life a second important aspect is to correct for the left truncation and right censoring biases in the survival data using for example the kaplan meier method the second meeting would take place once the coordination policies different tau values have been evaluated with the murm and murp modules in this meeting stakeholders would have to agree on which coordination policy they deem most beneficial for the municipality as a whole the choice would have to be made in light of the implications of the coordination policy for each infrastructure in terms of rehabilitation rates as in fig 7a f and capital costs this is to ensure that the infrastructure owners can allocate the necessary budget and secure sufficient staff to implement the coordination policy estimation of capital costs per infrastructure would need to include a cost sharing scheme in the murm model which was outside the scope of the present study the two meetings at the strategic level and the data gathering and modelling work could be organized by one of the infrastructure owners a third party representing the general interest of the municipality e g employee of the town hall or a consulting firm with the relevant competencies in multi utility asset management the coordination policy should be revised on a timeline that is relevant to strategic asset management for example 10 years alegre et al 2013 coordination of rehabilitation works would be guided at the tactical level by the coordination policy i e the agreed coordination window size this implies that each utility would make their own 3 5 years list of projects having identified which of its assets are in need of rehabilitation prioritized for example on the basis of risk when a utility e g drinking water communicates its prioritized projects to the other infrastructure managers e g sewer road the latter would have to justify whether their assets situated in the affected infrastructure corridors have a high or low probability of operating at acceptable risk and performance levels for longer than the agreed τ value e g 30 years on this basis they would decline or accept joining the relevant rehabilitation projects in this way applying the coordination policy as defined in this study would not involve performing an integrated prioritization or optimization of rehabilitation projects at the tactical decision level as proposed for example by tscheikner et al 2016 or carey and lueke 2013 this is because the development of the coordination policy choice of coordination window size at the strategic level relies on the assumption that each utility a meets their own short term rehabilitation needs tactical time horizon of 3 5 years and b joins rehabilitation projects initiated by other utilities if it contributes to meeting future rehabilitation needs within the timeframe of the coordination window e g 30 years at the operational level the participation of the different utilities in implementing the chosen coordination approach would consist of continuously documenting replaced assets actual τ values and actual costs through a database which is accessible to stakeholders at the tactical and strategic decision levels in this way deviations from the agreed tau value and expected sustainability costs can be taken into account when applying and revising the coordination policy 4 4 limitations and potential sustainability cost predictions were made in this study using a time horizon of over 100 years this creates significant uncertainties due to expected technological developments in rehabilitation methods e g use of electrical excavator advances in trenchless technologies and asphalt production which are likely to affect the economic costs and global warming potential per metre of rehabilitated pipes and roads besides the sensitivity analysis performed in this study it would be preferable to estimate the uncertainties associated to each input parameter and evaluated their joined effect on result uncertainties changes in functional requirements may also occur during the coming 100 years for example concerning source separation of wastewater and adaptation of residential streets to pedestrian and bike traffic such changes may be drivers of asset replacement but they are not accounted for in the present modelling approach more generally use of the model in its current state is limited to areas characterized by street segments where asset rehabilitation is driven by deterioration areas where hydraulics or traffic capacity increase are likely to drive rehabilitation would have to be analysed separately another limitation of the model is that predictions can only be based on a given rehabilitation need per asset cohort described by survival functions calibrated for a target performance or risk level the model does not estimate decrease of performance levels leakage or infiltration and inflow rate associated with coordination policies where asset rehabilitations may be delayed beyond the end of the functional lifetimes of relevant assets excavation volume was used as an indicator of the external consequences of excavation e g disturbances to traffic in the case study this is another limitation of this study as a given excavation size can disturb traffic in different ways depending on its location external consequences are also connected to the time of interventions which are a function of not only the excavation volume but also other parameters such soil type pipe diameter etc results which are more valuable for practitioners could be obtained with the present coordination model murm and murp modules by adding modules allowing it to i predict economic cost per utility with a cost sharing scheme ii account for inflation and discount rates in economic calculations iii include a minimum length for rehabilitation projects iv account for uncertainties in cohort survival functions v use multi variate asset deterioration models or vi use model coordination policies where the coordination window size depends on the infrastructure initiating the rehabilitation project 5 conclusion a modelling approach was developed to quantify the influence of multi utility coordination on the overall long term costs of water sewer and road network rehabilitation the concept of a coordination window size was introduced as part of the model and this appears to be a useful parameter in accounting for the impact of coordinated rehabilitation projects on shortening the lifetime of infrastructure assets the study highlights the so far poorly employed value of considering and leveraging multi utility coordination at the strategic decision level where long term financing of infrastructure rehabilitation is addressed similar studies on other municipalities which consider the uncertainties in survival functions and rehabilitation costs metre are needed before any generalizable quantifications of the benefits of multi utility rehabilitation can be made funding this work was funded by the swedish research council for sustainable development grant number 2018 01178 and the swedish innovation agency grant number 2019

14824,microalgae bacteria symbiotic systems were known to have great potential for simultaneous water purification and resource recovery among them microalgae bacteria biofilm granules have attracted much attention due to its excellent effluent quality and convenient biomass recovery however the effect of bacteria with attached growth mode on microalgae which has more significance for bioresource utilization has been historically ignored thus this study attempted to explore the responses of c vulgaris to extracellular polymeric substances eps extracted from aerobic granular sludge ags for enhancing the understanding of microscopic mechanism of attached microalgae bacteria symbiosis results showed that the performance of c vulgaris was effectively boosted with ags eps treatment at 12 16 mg toc l highest biomass production 0 32 0 01 g l lipid accumulation 44 33 5 69 and flocculation ability 20 83 0 21 were achieved these phenotypes were promoted associated with bioactive microbial metabolites in ags eps n acyl homoserine lactones humic acid and tryptophan furthermore the addition of co2 triggered carbon flow into the storage of lipids in c vulgaris and the synergistic effect of ags eps and co2 for improving microalgal flocculation ability was disclosed transcriptomic analysis further revealed up regulation of synthesis pathways for fatty acid and triacylglycerol that was triggered by ags eps and within the context of co2 addition ags eps substantially upregulated the expression of aromatic protein encoding genes which further enhanced the self flocculation of c vulgaris these findings provide novel insights into the microscopic mechanism of microalgae bacteria symbiosis and bring new enlightenment to wastewater valorization and carbon neutral operation of wastewater treatment plants based on the symbiotic biofilm biogranules system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioactive microbial metabolites bioresource recovery carbon sequestration transcriptomics wastewater valorization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the microalgae bacteria symbiosis system mbs has been extensively discussed owing to its excellent performance in synchronous implementation of carbon sequestration resource recovery and water purification ma et al 2022 yan et al 2022a the establishment of mbs depends on the exchange of bioactive microbial metabolites between microalgae and bacteria liu et al 2023 traditional mbs such as wastewater stabilization pond has been used for decades in wastewater treatment these systems remove contaminants by the growth metabolism of microalgae and bacteria live as free individuals however the bottleneck for widespread application of these systems in water pollution control lies in 1 weak mutualistic interactions and synergy 2 poor performance on nutrients removal and 3 difficult harvesting separation processes wang et al 2022a establishing an attached microalgal bacterial system has been identified as an efficient technology to address the above limitations seeded with activated sludge as or aerobic granular sludge ags a typical attached microalgal bacterial system microalgal bacterial granular sludge mbgs can be obtained by adjusting the operation conditions abouhend et al 2018 wang and li 2022 mbgs has provoked thriving attention as it shows superior settling properties and tight symbiosis ji and liu 2021 the o2 co2 cycle inside the mbgs particles is of great significance for reducing carbon emissions and aeration energy consumption in the sewage treatment industry zhang et al 2021 khoo et al 2021 furthermore mbgs based carbon negative wastewater treatment shows great potential in the realization of carbon neutrality goals as the flue gas emitted from the industrial processes can be utilized as the essential nutrients for the growth of microalgae bacteria consortium sun et al 2022 ji and liu 2022 chia et al 2021 in additional the large enrichment of lipid or fatty acid methyl esters fames in mbgs is meaningful for the useful biomass recovery cao et al 2022 and mbgs shows excellent sedimentation performance and decontamination efficiency the cod removal efficiency reached 96 7 zhang et al 2018a however much research effort is currently focused on the physicochemical characteristics and nutrient removal efficiency of mbgs as well as the impact of co2 addition on these properties the microscopic mechanism of symbiosis in microalgal bacterial biofilm granules system has rarely been reported besides most studies paid attention to the impact of microalgae on bacteria instead of the effect of bacteria with attached growth mode on microalgae actually the growth and characteristics of microalgae in symbiotic system play significant role for carbon negative wastewater treatment and valorization in addition the molecular mechanism between microalgae and bacteria with attached growth mode in symbiotic system remains unclear extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix secreted by attached growth bacteria is a complex mixture of polymers containing quorum sensing molecules qsms polysaccharides ps proteins pn humic like substances etc which are easily exposed to microalgae in the symbiotic system wang et al 2018 ran et al 2022 therefore it is crucial to determine the physiological role of eps emitted by attached growth bacteria on microalgae which is contributed to gain insight into the microscopic mechanism of symbiosis in microalgal bacterial biofilm granules system furthermore determining the effect of co2 on the physiological characteristics of microalgae especially the effect of eps within the context of co2 addition has crucial significance for simultaneous co2 sequestration and resource recovery based on the mbgs which remains to be explored in more depth the present study intended to elucidate the microscopic mechanism of symbiosis in the attached microalgae bacteria symbiotic system and to shed light on the simultaneous co2 sequestration and resource recovery based on a microalgae bacteria biofilm granules system our objectives were 1 to explore the effect of eps extracted from ags and bioactive microbial metabolites in ags eps n acyl homoserine lactones ahls humic acid ha and tryptophan trp on c vulgaris to better understand the symbiotic relationships between microalgae and ags in mbgs 2 to determine the single action of co2 and combined action of eps co2 on the physiological characteristics of microalgae 3 to fill gaps in the field of molecular mechanism between microalgae and bacteria in symbiotic system using transcriptomic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganisms and reagents chlorella vulgaris was selected as a model alga since it has been demonstrated to effectively remove nitrogen and phosphorus in different water environments and shows great potential to produce appreciable amounts of biolipids fazal et al 2021 c vulgaris fachb 13 was obtained from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china microalgae were cultivated and multiplied on bg 11 medium at ph 7 1 and the medium was autoclaved at 121 c for 30 min before culture to sterilize the temperature was set to 25 1 c and the light dark cycle was set to 12 h 12 h with a light intensity of 6000 lux the reagents n hexanoyl l homoserine lactone c6 hsl ha trp and indole 3 acetic acid iaa were purchased from aladdin china all solutions were prepared using sterile ultrapure deionized water for the component analysis of fames the internal standard 1 3 dichlorobenzene and reference material fames were purchased from sigma aldrich usa 2 2 exposure experiments of c vulgaris to ags eps the ags was cultivated using a plexiglass reactor with a working volume of 2 4 l 6 cm in diameter and 80 cm in height the reactor was operated in a sequential mode for a 4 h cycle with 4 min of feeding 5 min of sludge settling 4 min of effluent discharge and 227 min of aeration with the airflow rate of 1 0 l min the influent was a synthetic inorganic nitrogen wastewater wang et al 2018 the microbial community structure of ags was fully described in our previous study and gram negative aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonas europaea has been proven to be dominant in ags yan et al 2022b compared with as we found that eps obtained from ags secreted a richer set of active factors including ahls trp and ha see text s1 fig s1 s2 and table s1 for details therefore ags eps was chosen to investigate its effect on microalgae eps of ags was extracted according to the procedure of outer eps extraction described by wang et al 2018 to clarify the effects of the ags eps amount on the microalgal growth lipid synthesis and flocculation four different concentrations of eps were used 4 mg toc l 8 mg toc l 12 mg toc l and 16 mg toc l in addition three groups treated with pure standard materials in ags eps 100 nmol c6 hsl 0 75 mg l ha and 3 5 mg l trp were employed to elucidate the mechanisms of the effect of ags eps on the commensal microalgae the rationale for the ha and trp concentrations was based on the measured value of 12 mg toc l eps which was well fit for microalgae growth according to preliminary experimental results c6 hsl was selected as a representative ahl because it was widely detected from biological wastewater treatment systems and played a crucial role in regulating ags properties chen et al 2019 and the dosing concentration of c6 hsl was determined by referring to fan et al 2019 c vulgaris cultured with no additional reagents was used as a control the c vulgaris growth was tested in 250 ml conical flask containing 100 ml of bg 11 media and the initial inoculation dose was set as 1 106 cells ml the incubation was conducted at 25 1 in a light incubator cxz 1000 ningbo jiangnan instrument factory china with a 12 12 h light dark cycle set at 20 illumination the c vulgaris samples were drawn from the flasks every 24 h to monitor cell growth all groups were performed in triplicate for 10 days 2 3 effect of external co2 on c vulgaris samples with or without the addition of 12 mg toc l ags eps with co2 were set as the experimental groups named eps co2 and co2 respectively according to the pre experimental results co2 concentrations v v were set at 15 15 ml co2 was led into the sealed flasks with 100 ml bg 11 medium and co2 was made fresh every 48 h other reaction conditions were identical to those in section 2 2 2 4 analytical

expressed genes degs between every two different experimental groups genes were screened by a significance threshold of log2 fold change 1 p adjust 0 001 additionally functional enrichment analyses including gene ontology go and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg were performed to determine the main biological functions and physiological metabolic pathways of these degs 2 4 8 statistical analysis the differences in lipid production of microalgae cultivated in different groups were compared by least significance deviation lsd the pearson correlation coefficient was employed to measure correlations among variables using ibm statistical product service solutions statistics 22 differences at p 0 01 were considered highly significant and significant were considered at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth of c vulgaris exposed to ags eps both ags eps and standard bioactive microbial metabolites promoted the growth of c vulgaris fig 1 and a high dose of eps gave a higher specific growth rate table s4 the microalgae after exposure to 12 mg toc l and 16 mg toc l eps achieved the highest biomass production which was at least 28 higher than those of microalgae exposed to any other doses of eps fig 1b these improvements were mainly credited to abundant active factors in ags eps three differential concentrations of active substances ahls trp and ha in attached growth granules and suspended sludge were found text s1 in addition all these three active factors at set concentrations promoted microalgal growth among them c6 hsl performed better in both specific growth rate table s4 and biomass production of c vulgaris fig 1b the biomass improved by 48 compared with the control c6 hsl has been extensively shown to be one of the dominant qsms detected from biological wastewater treatment systems huang et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 demonstrated that green algae could sense and respond to qsms emitted by bacteria das et al 2019 proved that qsms containing c6 hsl triggered the chlorella sorokiniana biomass synthesis by reducing the doubling time therefore it is not hard to draw a conclusion that in ags based microalgae bacteria communities qsms represented by c6 hsl secreted by ags can enhance the microalgal biomass production by facilitating cell proliferation second as biochemical metabolic triggers trps exerted a promoting effect on microalgae growth mainly from the perspective of biomass production fig 1b previous studies reported that trp could be converted to iaa following indole 3 pyruvic acid tryptamine indole 3 acetaldoxime pathways in microalgae tandon et al 2019 the phytohormone iaa plays a role in promoting the plant cell division or elongation yu et al 2017 it also has been repeatedly confirmed that the incorporation of iaa is effective in improving the biomass production of microalgae by increasing the dehydrogenase activity photosynthesis and nutrient uptake efficiency giridhar babu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 supporting the notion above 0 41 μg l iaa was detected in the supernatant of the trp group but not detected in the control after 10 days of cultivation data not shown furthermore trps can act as organic nitrogen sources for the c vulgaris growth nateghpour et al 2021 therefore we speculate that in a symbiotic environment the trp secreted by ags serves as a physiological precursor for microalgae to synthesize iaa which in turn increases the productivity of microalgae biomass by promoting cell division and cell enlargement ha in ags eps also improved the biomass accumulation and specific cell growth rate of c vulgaris fig 1b and table s4 originally ha was reported as a biostimulant to promote the nutrient availability of plants tavares et al 2017 and it was gradually found to have a greater effect on microalgae because it generated more dynamic supramolecular structure in aqueous environments than in soil popa et al 2022 nakano et al 2021 researches show that ha has double dose effects on microalgae growth i e high concentrations 2 mg c l inhibit growth while low concentrations 2 mg c l stimulate growth by stimulating the biosynthesis of the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll b and enhancing the ability of microalgae to absorb and transfer light energy zheng et al 2022 overall ha in ags eps can regulate microalgae growth by modulating the function of the photosystem co2 provides a sufficient inorganic carbon source for microalgae growth with the addition of 15 co2 the biomass of c vulgaris increased by 34 78 and simultaneously applying co2 and ags eps substantially increased the biomass by 60 87 fig 1b the increased biomass suggests that there were possible carbon constraints of microalgae that acquire co2 from air but a periodic co2 supply stimulated the carbon fixation processes of microalgae furthermore a periodic co2 supply every 48 h can buffer the change in ph turned from 7 1 to 9 2 in the control group and maintain the extracellular ph at approximately 7 0 which improves the performance of c vulgaris in growth gabriel et al 2023 as is well known low concentrations of cells and biomass are dominant limiting factors to extensively utilizing microalgae in wastewater treatment and energy recovery the above results indicated that bioactive factors in ags eps could enhance the microalgae cell division and biomass productivity which implies the positive effects of algae bacteria symbiosis established by c vulgaris and sludge with the attached growth mode furthermore the ags eps within the context of co2 addition also substantially increased the biomass of c vulgaris which shows great potential for incorporation of carbon dioxide into biomass by c vulgaris in algae bacteria symbiosis system 3 2 lipid production of c vulgaris exposed to ags eps the addition of ags eps effectively promoted the biolipid synthesis of c vulgaris especially in the 12 mg toc l and 16 mg toc l eps groups table 1 compared to the control sample the lipid content and lipid yield increased by 18 50 and 63 31 in the 12 mg toc l eps group and by 25 37 and 72 49 in the 16 mg toc l group respectively in order to further elucidate the mechanism behind the improvement of biolipid synthesis by ags eps addition we performed addition experiments of pure active factors contained in ags eps further analyses and interpretation of results are presented as follows trp strongly enhanced lipid synthesis and the lipid content reached 44 46 0 48 as a ketogenic amino acid trp can be metabolized into acetyl coa by c vulgaris during catabolism nateghpour et al 2021 and acetyl coa is known as the main building block to synthesize fatty acids yao et al 2017 in addition as mentioned in section 3 1 trps can be converted into iaa by c vulgaris numerous studies have proven that the phytohormone iaa promotes growth and induces lipid accumulation of microalgae giridhar babu et al 2017 chang et al 2022 this can be interpreted as iaa changing carbon partitioning so more carbon flux flows to lipid biosynthesis while the carbohydrate biosynthesis pathway is restricted yu et al 2017 as a representative bacterial signal c6 hsl caused oxidative stress in microalgae fig 2 which contributed to the biolipid synthesis thus the lipid content of c vulgaris increased by 22 45 under oxidative stress conditions caused by exogenous stimuli microalgae can be induced to synthesize energy rich compounds such as lipids and starch to keep the cells alive zhang et al 2018b demonstrated that enzymes of the fatty acid synthesis pathways fasn and acetyl coa carboxylase were noticeably upregulated under the stress of qsms similarly the addition of ha increased the ros fluorescence fig 2 humic substances can activate the secondary metabolism of terrestrial photosynthetic organisms by chemical priming jindo et al 2020 in recent years humic substances have also been proposed as microalgal biostimulants popa et al 2022 the chemical priming triggered by ha in microalgae depends on the increase in ros zanin et al 2018 therefore exogenous stimuli can trigger excessive ros which can enhance the lipid production guo et al 2021 overall eps secretion from ags provides a reliable platform for microalgae bacteria consortia which involves stimulating microalgae growth and allocating carbon flow to accumulate high value bioproducts besides co2 favored the accumulation of biolipid in c vulgaris individually adding co2 and simultaneously applying co2 and ags eps increased the lipid content by 23 95 and 32 64 respectively table 1 a considerable increase in lipid accumulation per dry weight with increased carbon availability conditions reveals that co2 tends to trigger carbon flow to the storage of lipids instead of other macromolecules which is a more energy dense carbon sink cecchin et al 2021 3 3 composition and physical properties of fames in this study the fames of microalgae mainly comprised linoleic acid c18 2 22 30 linolenic acid c18 3 23 26 palmitic acid c16 0 15 24 and palmitoleic acid c16 1 6 11 fig 3a treating c vulgaris cells with different dosages of ags eps had different fames compositions compared with blank samples the c16 0 and c18 1 contents showed a downward trend whereas the c16 1 hexadecadienoic acid c16 2 hexadecatrienoic acid c16 3 and c18 2 compositions showed an increasing trend in the ags eps treated groups fig 3b the increased mufas mono unsaturated fatty acids and pufas poly unsaturated fatty acids content may be attributed to the excessive ros induced by ags eps fig 2 ros in cells including superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 can cause oxidative stress and consequent damage to organelles to survive microalgae exposed to exogenous stimuli transfer saturated fatty acids into unsaturated fatty acids or increase the unsaturation degree of free fatty acids which reduces oxidative stress by consuming large amounts of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen and oxygen arora et al 2019 to illustrate this process the synthetic pathway of c18 1 and c18 2 was used as a reference fig s3 as the components with the largest proportion in fames of c vulgaris in this study c18 2 and c18 3 have been reported as pufas with extensive applications in nutrition science lin et al 2018 besides these pufas can be used to make soap produce solid lipid nanoparticles and drug carrier systems and realize the surface functionalization of nanocrystals and inorganic materials due to their amphiphilic nature špačková et al 2020 the heatmap shows the increase in proportion of c18 2 induced by ags eps and the conversion from c18 2 to c18 3 triggered by co2 stress fig 3b therefore ags and co2 help c vulgaris become a more suitable raw material to produce these valuable pufas however a high degree of unsaturation resulted in a low cetane number of the lipid for biodiesel production table s2 which is not favorable for fuel quality fortunately ags lipid is mainly composed of saturated fames over 50 and can compensate for the deficiencies of microalgae biolipids table s3 therefore their mixture has the potential to produce biodiesel it is expected that in the symbiosis system the proportion of microalgae and bacteria and the co cultivation mode can be adjusted according to different target products to comprehensively apply biolipids 3 4 flocculation of c vulgaris exposed to ags eps after 10 days of cultivation the flocculation ability of c vulgaris treated with ags eps was enhanced the 4 mg toc l eps and 12 mg toc l eps groups showed better flocculation ability than the other dose groups fig 4a concretely the flocculation ability of the control group was only 2 11 0 19 and 12 49 0 18 after 30 min and 180 min of settling respectively however the flocculation ability of the 4 mg toc l eps and 12 mg toc l eps groups exceeded 12 49 within 60 min and increased to 22 07 0 20 and 20 83 0 21 with 180 min of settling respectively this phenomenon is mainly due to the addition of ags eps triggers a change in the microalgae eps composition fig 4b the eps of c vulgaris in 4 mg toc l eps group showed a highest pss content and showed a highest pns content in 12 mg toc l eps group these two components are both positively correlated with the flocculation efficiency of the microalgae li et al 2023 main functional groups of pss including hydroxyl oh and carboxyl coo can provide binding sites during the microalgae flocculation process zeeshan et al 2022 and pns have hydrophobic bonds and are crucial in determining the adherence property of microbes ding et al 2021 the self aggregation and eps content change of c vulgaris could be mediated by three standard active materials based on the flocculation response of c vulgaris to three standard active materials it can be speculated that trp in ags eps was the most dominant cause in the microalgae self aggregation response and the flocculation ability was more than twice that of the blank sample followed by c6 hsl the flocculation ability reached 25 13 0 08 with 180 min of settling and ha showed less impact trp is an aromatic amino acid as well as ahl like substances of bacteria can trigger the aromatic protein secretion of microalgae zhou et al 2017 in this study the pn contents of microalgae with ags eps and standard reagent addition increased compared with the control except for the 4 mg toc l ags eps dosage especially in the trp dosage fig 4b according to their eem fluorescence spectra fig s4 the increased components can be identified as protein derived amino acid tryptophan the ex em ratio was 280 330 in region iv and aromatic protein like substances the ex em ratio was 230 335 350 in regions i ii it has been confirmed that aromatic proteins play a crucial role in microalgae flocculation process wang et al 2022b in general the addition of ags eps in which the active substance triggers a change in the microalgae eps composition further affects its self flocculation ability according to reports microalgal harvesting accounts for 20 30 of the cost of total renewable oil production yin et al 2021 the results of this study show that microalgae bacteria symbiosis has great potential to reduce costs for microalgae recovery adding an external source of co2 alone does not measurably improve the flocculation ability of microalgae ags eps plays a more important role than co2 in the solid liquid separation of the c vulgaris biomass surprisingly ags eps within the context of co2 addition improved the flocculation efficiency to 56 01 1 79 which was significantly higher than that of the control 12 49 0 18 and 12 mg toc l eps dosage 20 83 0 21 fig 4a in other words the effect of the mixture eps co2 is greater than the simple stack of effect of eps and co2 in terms of improvement of the flocculation ability ji and liu 2022 claimed that co2 could enhance the secretion of aromatic proteins from mbgs which favors flocculation stability consistently our results demonstrate the higher protein production of c vulgaris treated with eps co2 fig 4b the underlying synergistic mechanism of co2 and ags eps was further explored using molecular biology techniques 3 5 regulation mechanism of ags eps and co2 by transcriptomic analysis according to the afore mentioned physiological biochemical analysis ags eps co2 and their mixture improved the lipid production and self flocculation of c vulgaris transcriptomic analysis further revealed the regulatory mechanism of ags eps and co2 on the biolipid production and self flocculation of c vulgaris in the bacterial microalgal coupling system a total of 25 830 degs were identified in the eps co2 vs cg comparison 12 825 degs were distinguished in the co2 vs cg comparison and 11 623 degs were identified in the eps vs cg comparison these results suggest that ags eps and co2 significantly affected the gene expression and phenotypic traits of c vulgaris by subjecting these degs to the kegg pathway enrichment analysis we found that multiple metabolic pathways directly or indirectly related to lipid production and self flocculation were strongly affected the gene expressions related to the lipid synthesis fig 5 and aromatic protein synthesis fig 6 of c vulgaris under ags eps and co2 addition are provided here the fatty acid biosynthesis depends on acetyl coa which is generated from pyruvate pyruvate dehydrogenase pdh ec 1 2 4 1 had 8 4 and 3 upregulated transcripts in the eps vs cg co2 vs cg and eps co2 vs cg comparisons respectively which indicates the promotion of acetyl coa production in response to ags eps and co2 in addition the downregulation of transcripts encoding pyruvate decarboxylase pdc ec 4 1 1 1 prevented pyruvate from being shunted toward ethanol to supply sufficient precursors for the lipid synthesis subsequently genes encoding malonyl coa acp transacylase fabd ec 2 3 1 39 3 oxoacyl acp synthase fadf ec 2 3 1 79 β ketoacyl acp reductase fabg ec 1 1 1 100 and 3 hydroxyacyl dehydratase fabz ec 4 2 1 59 were upregulated which indicates a push toward the fatty acid biosynthesis of c vulgaris with ags eps and co2 addition based on these results the fatty acid synthesis steps provided a sufficient acyl pool for subsequent triacylglycerol tag synthesis furthermore genes that encode main enzymes involved in fatty acid elongation process such as very long chain 3 oxoacyl coa synthase elovl ec 2 3 1 199 very long chain 3 oxoacyl coa reductase ec 1 1 1 330 and 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase hadh ec 1 1 1 35 were also significantly upregulated which is beneficial to the long chain fatty acid n 16 synthesis table s5 genes encoding fatty acid desaturase delta 9 desaturase scd ec 1 14 19 1 and linoleoyl coa desaturase ec 1 14 19 3 were upregulated in eps treated c vulgaris which indicates the biosynthesis of c16 1 c18 1 and c18 2 table s5 these results are consistent with the changes in fames composition fig 3 subsequently a step by step conversion of glycerol 3p to tag was catalyzed by glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase gpat ec 2 3 1 15 1 acylglycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase agpat ec 2 3 1 51 phospholipid phosphatase plpp ec 3 1 3 4 and diacylglycerol acyltransferase dgat ec 2 3 1 20 for the eps vs cg comparison there were 3 1 and 3 upregulated transcripts that encoded gpat agpat and plpp log2 fold change 3 respectively which suggests that ags eps induced the genes related to lipid turnover and culminated in the tag accumulation the transcription level of triacylglycerol lipase tgl ec 3 1 1 3 was significantly downregulated in the eps co2 vs cg and co2 vs cg comparisons table s5 which implies less tag degradation these findings imply that in a microalgae bacterial coupling system ags eps and co2 produced by bacteria induced the genes involved in the lipid turnover and enhanced the capability of c vulgaris to produce lipids by promoting the fatty acid synthesis and inhibiting the tag degradation in addition the gene expression of amidase enzyme amie ec 3 5 1 4 which is responsible for indole acetate synthesis by catalyzing indole 3 acetamide was upregulated in the eps group table s5 this finding supports the conclusions drawn from phenotype analysis in the previous sections that trp in ags eps can induce the synthesis of iaa by c vulgaris and thereby increase the cell growth lipid content and flocculation ability in addition genes encoding enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis were downregulated under co2 exposure conditions including glycogen synthase ec 2 4 1 21 and glycogen branching enzyme gbe ec 2 4 1 18 table s5 this result verifies the assertion in section 3 2 that co2 triggers carbon flow to the storage of lipids instead of carbohydrates previous researches have emphasized that aromatic protein secretion is crucial for enhancing the self flocculation efficiencies of green algae zhou et al 2017 wang et al 2022b degs related to aromatic protein synthesis pathways were analyzed fig 6 prephenate aminotransferases pat ec 2 6 1 78 2 6 1 79 and prephenate dehydratase pdt ec 4 2 1 51 4 2 1 91 are responsible for the synthesis of tyrosine and phenylalanine respectively an examination of the expression of the genes that encode the two enzymes predicted that eps eps co2 and co2 upregulated the biosynthesis of phenylpyruvate arogenate and phenylalanine three aromatic amino acid aminotransferases were detected for phenylalanine and tyrosine synthesis tyrosine aminotransferase tat ec 2 6 1 5 histidinol phosphate aminotransferase hisc ec 2 6 1 9 and aspartate aminotransferase got ec 2 6 1 1 got and tat were differentially expressed in the three comparisons especially eps co2 which upregulated more genes than the other two groups similarly eps co2 performed better in the improvement of subsequent amino acyl trna synthetase gene expression including phenylalanyl trna synthetase farsa farsb ec 6 1 1 20 tyrosyl trna synthetase yars ec 6 1 1 1 and tryptophanyl trna synthetase wars ec 6 1 1 2 this result explains the observed significant improvement in the aggregation ability of c vulgaris treated with eps co2 fig 4a in addition eps and co2 also triggered an increase in anthranilate synthase asa ec 4 1 3 27 gene expression anthranilate synthase is responsible for the derivative formation of anthranilate anthranilate and its derivatives can form proteoglycans or glycoproteins which play a critical role in the cell self aggregation these results indicate that ags eps and co2 induced the expression of key enzyme genes that improve the aromatic protein accumulation and self aggregation especially in the eps co2 treatment group co2 acts as a substrate for the photosynthetic carbon metabolism and can provide energy and carbon framework for amino acids and proteins synthesis including aromatic proteins and their precursors xu et al 2020 in eps co2 vs cg comparison 75 degs related to carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms pathway were identified including 55 up regulated and 20 down regulated ones fig s5 among them 5 genes encoding transketolase convert ribulose 5 phosphate to erythrose 4 phosphate ec 2 2 1 1 were all up regulated erythrose 4 phosphate a precursor for shikimate biosynthesis is a prerequisite for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids müller et al 2018 therefore ags eps can not only provide nitrogen for nitrogen metabolism but can also stimulate carbon metabolism mediated by bioactive microbial metabolite thus the combination of co2 and ags eps can increase the availability of nutrients for microalgae leading to the upregulation of genes involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic proteins 4 conclusions this study reveals the crucial role of the eps of ags bacteria with attached growth mode on the growth biolipid synthesis and settling performance of microalgae c vulgaris the main mechanisms are ascribed to that bioactive microbial metabolite in ags eps including ahls trp and ha played distinct roles in regulating phenotypes of c vulgaris in addition ags eps within the context of co2 addition enhanced the biolipid production as well as greatly improved the self flocculation of c vulgaris transcriptome analysis of c vulgaris further confirmed that ags eps and co2 upregulated the synthesis pathways of biolipid and aromatic protein which contribute to microalgae flocculation this study provides a new insight about the microscopic mechanism of microalgae bacteria symbiosis by highlighting how attached growth bacteria use eps to regulate microalgal phenotypes which might facilitate the application of microalgae bacteria biofilm granules system for simultaneous water purification carbon sequestration and resource recovery the impact of microalgae bacteria ratio and the attached growth cocultivation mode on the resource recovery from wastewater for different target products should be

14824,microalgae bacteria symbiotic systems were known to have great potential for simultaneous water purification and resource recovery among them microalgae bacteria biofilm granules have attracted much attention due to its excellent effluent quality and convenient biomass recovery however the effect of bacteria with attached growth mode on microalgae which has more significance for bioresource utilization has been historically ignored thus this study attempted to explore the responses of c vulgaris to extracellular polymeric substances eps extracted from aerobic granular sludge ags for enhancing the understanding of microscopic mechanism of attached microalgae bacteria symbiosis results showed that the performance of c vulgaris was effectively boosted with ags eps treatment at 12 16 mg toc l highest biomass production 0 32 0 01 g l lipid accumulation 44 33 5 69 and flocculation ability 20 83 0 21 were achieved these phenotypes were promoted associated with bioactive microbial metabolites in ags eps n acyl homoserine lactones humic acid and tryptophan furthermore the addition of co2 triggered carbon flow into the storage of lipids in c vulgaris and the synergistic effect of ags eps and co2 for improving microalgal flocculation ability was disclosed transcriptomic analysis further revealed up regulation of synthesis pathways for fatty acid and triacylglycerol that was triggered by ags eps and within the context of co2 addition ags eps substantially upregulated the expression of aromatic protein encoding genes which further enhanced the self flocculation of c vulgaris these findings provide novel insights into the microscopic mechanism of microalgae bacteria symbiosis and bring new enlightenment to wastewater valorization and carbon neutral operation of wastewater treatment plants based on the symbiotic biofilm biogranules system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bioactive microbial metabolites bioresource recovery carbon sequestration transcriptomics wastewater valorization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the microalgae bacteria symbiosis system mbs has been extensively discussed owing to its excellent performance in synchronous implementation of carbon sequestration resource recovery and water purification ma et al 2022 yan et al 2022a the establishment of mbs depends on the exchange of bioactive microbial metabolites between microalgae and bacteria liu et al 2023 traditional mbs such as wastewater stabilization pond has been used for decades in wastewater treatment these systems remove contaminants by the growth metabolism of microalgae and bacteria live as free individuals however the bottleneck for widespread application of these systems in water pollution control lies in 1 weak mutualistic interactions and synergy 2 poor performance on nutrients removal and 3 difficult harvesting separation processes wang et al 2022a establishing an attached microalgal bacterial system has been identified as an efficient technology to address the above limitations seeded with activated sludge as or aerobic granular sludge ags a typical attached microalgal bacterial system microalgal bacterial granular sludge mbgs can be obtained by adjusting the operation conditions abouhend et al 2018 wang and li 2022 mbgs has provoked thriving attention as it shows superior settling properties and tight symbiosis ji and liu 2021 the o2 co2 cycle inside the mbgs particles is of great significance for reducing carbon emissions and aeration energy consumption in the sewage treatment industry zhang et al 2021 khoo et al 2021 furthermore mbgs based carbon negative wastewater treatment shows great potential in the realization of carbon neutrality goals as the flue gas emitted from the industrial processes can be utilized as the essential nutrients for the growth of microalgae bacteria consortium sun et al 2022 ji and liu 2022 chia et al 2021 in additional the large enrichment of lipid or fatty acid methyl esters fames in mbgs is meaningful for the useful biomass recovery cao et al 2022 and mbgs shows excellent sedimentation performance and decontamination efficiency the cod removal efficiency reached 96 7 zhang et al 2018a however much research effort is currently focused on the physicochemical characteristics and nutrient removal efficiency of mbgs as well as the impact of co2 addition on these properties the microscopic mechanism of symbiosis in microalgal bacterial biofilm granules system has rarely been reported besides most studies paid attention to the impact of microalgae on bacteria instead of the effect of bacteria with attached growth mode on microalgae actually the growth and characteristics of microalgae in symbiotic system play significant role for carbon negative wastewater treatment and valorization in addition the molecular mechanism between microalgae and bacteria with attached growth mode in symbiotic system remains unclear extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix secreted by attached growth bacteria is a complex mixture of polymers containing quorum sensing molecules qsms polysaccharides ps proteins pn humic like substances etc which are easily exposed to microalgae in the symbiotic system wang et al 2018 ran et al 2022 therefore it is crucial to determine the physiological role of eps emitted by attached growth bacteria on microalgae which is contributed to gain insight into the microscopic mechanism of symbiosis in microalgal bacterial biofilm granules system furthermore determining the effect of co2 on the physiological characteristics of microalgae especially the effect of eps within the context of co2 addition has crucial significance for simultaneous co2 sequestration and resource recovery based on the mbgs which remains to be explored in more depth the present study intended to elucidate the microscopic mechanism of symbiosis in the attached microalgae bacteria symbiotic system and to shed light on the simultaneous co2 sequestration and resource recovery based on a microalgae bacteria biofilm granules system our objectives were 1 to explore the effect of eps extracted from ags and bioactive microbial metabolites in ags eps n acyl homoserine lactones ahls humic acid ha and tryptophan trp on c vulgaris to better understand the symbiotic relationships between microalgae and ags in mbgs 2 to determine the single action of co2 and combined action of eps co2 on the physiological characteristics of microalgae 3 to fill gaps in the field of molecular mechanism between microalgae and bacteria in symbiotic system using transcriptomic analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganisms and reagents chlorella vulgaris was selected as a model alga since it has been demonstrated to effectively remove nitrogen and phosphorus in different water environments and shows great potential to produce appreciable amounts of biolipids fazal et al 2021 c vulgaris fachb 13 was obtained from the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china microalgae were cultivated and multiplied on bg 11 medium at ph 7 1 and the medium was autoclaved at 121 c for 30 min before culture to sterilize the temperature was set to 25 1 c and the light dark cycle was set to 12 h 12 h with a light intensity of 6000 lux the reagents n hexanoyl l homoserine lactone c6 hsl ha trp and indole 3 acetic acid iaa were purchased from aladdin china all solutions were prepared using sterile ultrapure deionized water for the component analysis of fames the internal standard 1 3 dichlorobenzene and reference material fames were purchased from sigma aldrich usa 2 2 exposure experiments of c vulgaris to ags eps the ags was cultivated using a plexiglass reactor with a working volume of 2 4 l 6 cm in diameter and 80 cm in height the reactor was operated in a sequential mode for a 4 h cycle with 4 min of feeding 5 min of sludge settling 4 min of effluent discharge and 227 min of aeration with the airflow rate of 1 0 l min the influent was a synthetic inorganic nitrogen wastewater wang et al 2018 the microbial community structure of ags was fully described in our previous study and gram negative aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonas europaea has been proven to be dominant in ags yan et al 2022b compared with as we found that eps obtained from ags secreted a richer set of active factors including ahls trp and ha see text s1 fig s1 s2 and table s1 for details therefore ags eps was chosen to investigate its effect on microalgae eps of ags was extracted according to the procedure of outer eps extraction described by wang et al 2018 to clarify the effects of the ags eps amount on the microalgal growth lipid synthesis and flocculation four different concentrations of eps were used 4 mg toc l 8 mg toc l 12 mg toc l and 16 mg toc l in addition three groups treated with pure standard materials in ags eps 100 nmol c6 hsl 0 75 mg l ha and 3 5 mg l trp were employed to elucidate the mechanisms of the effect of ags eps on the commensal microalgae the rationale for the ha and trp concentrations was based on the measured value of 12 mg toc l eps which was well fit for microalgae growth according to preliminary experimental results c6 hsl was selected as a representative ahl because it was widely detected from biological wastewater treatment systems and played a crucial role in regulating ags properties chen et al 2019 and the dosing concentration of c6 hsl was determined by referring to fan et al 2019 c vulgaris cultured with no additional reagents was used as a control the c vulgaris growth was tested in 250 ml conical flask containing 100 ml of bg 11 media and the initial inoculation dose was set as 1 106 cells ml the incubation was conducted at 25 1 in a light incubator cxz 1000 ningbo jiangnan instrument factory china with a 12 12 h light dark cycle set at 20 illumination the c vulgaris samples were drawn from the flasks every 24 h to monitor cell growth all groups were performed in triplicate for 10 days 2 3 effect of external co2 on c vulgaris samples with or without the addition of 12 mg toc l ags eps with co2 were set as the experimental groups named eps co2 and co2 respectively according to the pre experimental results co2 concentrations v v were set at 15 15 ml co2 was led into the sealed flasks with 100 ml bg 11 medium and co2 was made fresh every 48 h other reaction conditions were identical to those in section 2 2 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 characterization of sludge algae eps ahls in sludge eps were detected using an in situ bioassay wang et al 2018 ps in eps was quantified by a phenol sulfuric acid method pn and ha were quantified by modified lowry method dubois et al 1951 frolund et al 1995 xiao et al 2022 yu et al 2023 the organic substances in eps were analyzed based on the fluorescence excitation emission matrix

japan the mixed liquor suspended sludge mlss was determined followed the standard methods apha 2005 2 4 2 microalgal growth the optical density at 680 nm od680 of c vulgaris was measured by a microplate reader infinite m200 tecan switzerland to monitor the growth after 10 days of cultivation the algae solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to collect the wet biomass the residue was freeze dried by a lyophilizer lgj 10 beijing songyuanhuaxing technology develop co ltd china at 50 for 48 h and subsequently weighed to determine the biomass accumulation a flow cytometer novocyte acea usa was employed to analyze the cell numbers per unit volume a standard curve and regression equation were established between od680 and cell numbers per unit volume based on data from various growth stages of c vulgaris 1 y 33 982 x 1 6193 1 0 6 r 2 0 995 p 0 05 where y is the cell concentration cells ml and x is the od680 the specific cell growth rate μ was calculated as follows 2 μ ln x

the principles for its detection were applying a 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate oxidant sensitive dye the steps to determine the ros followed the manufacturers instructions and previously published methods zheng et al 2022 2 4 6 flocculation ability the flocculation ability was determined to evaluate the microalgae settling performance according to previous reports li et al 2023 and

extracted from the microalgae cells of the control group cg 12 mg toc l eps co2 and eps co2 after 10 days of cultivation using the omniplant rna kit dnase i cw2598s cwbio china according to the manufacturer s protocol the degradation and contamination of rna were assessed on 1 agarose gels the integrity and purity were assessed with a 2100 bioanalyzer agilent santa clara ca usa and quantified using a nanodrop spectrophotometer nd 2000 thermo usa one microgram of total rna was employed to prepare the rna seq transcriptome library using a truseq rna sample preparation kit illumina san diego ca briefly this process includes messenger rna isolation and fragmentation double stranded cdna synthesis and modification next cdna fragments of 300 bp were pcr amplified using phusion dna polymerase for 15 pcr cycles and sequencing was performed on an illumina novaseq 6000 system software rsem https github com deweylab rsem was used for quantifying transcript abundances from rna seq data and the gene expression level was determined according to the transcripts per million reads tpm method based on these results degseq algorithms were adopted to identify the differentially expressed genes degs between every two different experimental groups genes were screened by a significance threshold of log2 fold change 1 p adjust 0 001 additionally functional enrichment analyses including gene ontology go and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg were performed to determine the main biological functions and physiological metabolic pathways of these degs 2 4 8 statistical analysis the differences in lipid production of microalgae cultivated in different groups were compared by least significance deviation lsd the pearson correlation coefficient was employed to measure correlations among variables using ibm statistical product service solutions statistics 22 differences at p 0 01 were considered highly significant and significant were considered at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 growth of c vulgaris exposed to ags eps both ags eps and standard bioactive microbial metabolites promoted the growth of c vulgaris fig 1 and a high dose of eps gave a higher specific growth rate table s4 the microalgae after exposure to 12 mg toc l and 16 mg toc l eps achieved the highest biomass production which was at least 28 higher than those of microalgae exposed to any other doses of eps fig 1b these improvements were mainly credited to abundant active factors in ags eps three differential concentrations of active substances ahls trp and ha in attached growth granules and suspended sludge were found text s1 in addition all these three active factors at set concentrations promoted microalgal growth among them c6 hsl performed better in both specific growth rate table s4 and biomass production of c vulgaris fig 1b the biomass improved by 48 compared with the control c6 hsl has been extensively shown to be one of the dominant qsms detected from biological wastewater treatment systems huang et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 demonstrated that green algae could sense and respond to qsms emitted by bacteria das et al 2019 proved that qsms containing c6 hsl triggered the chlorella sorokiniana biomass synthesis by reducing the doubling time therefore it is not hard to draw a conclusion that in ags based microalgae bacteria communities qsms represented by c6 hsl secreted by ags can enhance the microalgal biomass production by facilitating cell proliferation second as biochemical metabolic triggers trps exerted a promoting effect on microalgae growth mainly from the perspective of biomass production fig 1b previous studies reported that trp could be converted to iaa following indole 3 pyruvic acid tryptamine indole 3 acetaldoxime pathways in microalgae tandon et al 2019 the phytohormone iaa plays a role in promoting the plant cell division or elongation yu et al 2017 it also has been repeatedly confirmed that the incorporation of iaa is effective in improving the biomass production of microalgae by increasing the dehydrogenase activity photosynthesis and nutrient uptake efficiency giridhar babu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 supporting the notion above 0 41 μg l iaa was detected in the supernatant of the trp group but not detected in the control after 10 days of cultivation data not shown furthermore trps can act as organic nitrogen sources for the c vulgaris growth nateghpour et al 2021 therefore we speculate that in a symbiotic environment the trp secreted by ags serves as a physiological precursor for microalgae to synthesize iaa which in turn increases the productivity of microalgae biomass by promoting cell division and cell enlargement ha in ags eps also improved the biomass accumulation and specific cell growth rate of c vulgaris fig 1b and table s4 originally ha was reported as a biostimulant to promote the nutrient availability of plants tavares et al 2017 and it was gradually found to have a greater effect on microalgae because it generated more dynamic supramolecular structure in aqueous environments than in soil popa et al 2022 nakano et al 2021 researches show that ha has double dose effects on microalgae growth i e high concentrations 2 mg c l inhibit growth while low concentrations 2 mg c l stimulate growth by stimulating the biosynthesis of the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll b and enhancing the ability of microalgae to absorb and transfer light energy zheng et al 2022 overall ha in ags eps can regulate microalgae growth by modulating the function of the photosystem co2 provides a sufficient inorganic carbon source for microalgae growth with the addition of 15 co2 the biomass of c vulgaris increased by 34 78 and simultaneously applying co2 and ags eps substantially increased the biomass by 60 87 fig 1b the increased biomass suggests that there were possible carbon constraints of microalgae that acquire co2 from air but a periodic co2 supply stimulated the carbon fixation processes of microalgae furthermore a periodic co2 supply every 48 h can buffer the change in ph turned from 7 1 to 9 2 in the control group and maintain the extracellular ph at approximately 7 0 which improves the performance of c vulgaris in growth gabriel et al 2023 as is well known low concentrations of cells and biomass are dominant limiting factors to extensively utilizing microalgae in wastewater treatment and energy recovery the above results indicated that bioactive factors in ags eps could enhance the microalgae cell division and biomass productivity which implies the positive effects of algae bacteria symbiosis established by c vulgaris and sludge with the attached growth mode furthermore the ags eps within the context of co2 addition also substantially increased the biomass of c vulgaris which shows great potential for incorporation of carbon dioxide into biomass by c vulgaris in algae bacteria symbiosis system 3 2 lipid production of c vulgaris exposed to ags eps the addition of ags eps effectively promoted the biolipid synthesis of c vulgaris especially in the 12 mg toc l and 16 mg toc l eps groups table 1 compared to the control sample the lipid content and lipid yield increased by 18 50 and 63 31 in the 12 mg toc l eps group and by 25 37 and 72 49 in the 16 mg toc l group respectively in order to further elucidate the mechanism behind the improvement of biolipid synthesis by ags eps addition we performed addition experiments of pure active factors contained in ags eps further analyses and interpretation of results are presented as follows trp strongly enhanced lipid synthesis and the lipid content reached 44 46 0 48 as a ketogenic amino acid trp can be metabolized into acetyl coa by c vulgaris during catabolism nateghpour et al 2021 and acetyl coa is known as the main building block to synthesize fatty acids yao et al 2017 in addition as mentioned in section 3 1 trps can be converted into iaa by c vulgaris numerous studies have proven that the phytohormone iaa promotes growth and induces lipid accumulation of microalgae giridhar babu et al 2017 chang et al 2022 this can be interpreted as iaa changing carbon partitioning so more carbon flux flows to lipid biosynthesis while the carbohydrate biosynthesis pathway is restricted yu et al 2017 as a representative bacterial signal c6 hsl caused oxidative stress in microalgae fig 2 which contributed to the biolipid synthesis thus the lipid content of c vulgaris increased by 22 45 under oxidative stress conditions caused by exogenous stimuli microalgae can be induced to synthesize energy rich compounds such as lipids and starch to keep the cells alive zhang et al 2018b demonstrated that enzymes of the fatty acid synthesis pathways fasn and acetyl coa carboxylase were noticeably upregulated under the stress of qsms similarly the addition of ha increased the ros fluorescence fig 2 humic substances can activate the secondary metabolism of terrestrial photosynthetic organisms by chemical priming jindo et al 2020 in recent years humic substances have also been proposed as microalgal biostimulants popa et al 2022 the chemical priming triggered by ha in microalgae depends on the increase in ros zanin et al 2018 therefore exogenous stimuli can trigger excessive ros which can enhance the lipid production guo et al 2021 overall eps secretion from ags provides a reliable platform for microalgae bacteria consortia which involves stimulating microalgae growth and allocating carbon flow to accumulate high value bioproducts besides co2 favored the accumulation of biolipid in c vulgaris individually adding co2 and simultaneously applying co2 and ags eps increased the lipid content by 23 95 and 32 64 respectively table 1 a considerable increase in lipid accumulation per dry weight with increased carbon availability conditions reveals that co2 tends to trigger carbon flow to the storage of lipids instead of other macromolecules which is a more energy dense carbon sink cecchin et al 2021 3 3 composition and physical properties of fames in this study the fames of microalgae mainly comprised linoleic acid c18 2 22 30 linolenic acid c18 3 23 26 palmitic acid c16 0 15 24 and palmitoleic acid c16 1 6 11 fig 3a treating c vulgaris cells with different dosages of ags eps had different fames compositions compared with blank samples the c16 0 and c18 1 contents showed a downward trend whereas the c16 1 hexadecadienoic acid c16 2 hexadecatrienoic acid c16 3 and c18 2 compositions showed an increasing trend in the ags eps treated groups fig 3b the increased mufas mono unsaturated fatty acids and pufas poly unsaturated fatty acids content may be attributed to the excessive ros induced by ags eps fig 2 ros in cells including superoxide o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 can cause oxidative stress and consequent damage to organelles to survive microalgae exposed to exogenous stimuli transfer saturated fatty acids into unsaturated fatty acids or increase the unsaturation degree of free fatty acids which reduces oxidative stress by consuming large amounts of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen and oxygen arora et al 2019 to illustrate this process the synthetic pathway of c18 1 and c18 2 was used as a reference fig s3 as the components with the largest proportion in fames of c vulgaris in this study c18 2 and c18 3 have been reported as pufas with extensive applications in nutrition science lin et al 2018 besides these pufas can be used to make soap produce solid lipid nanoparticles and drug carrier systems and realize the surface functionalization of nanocrystals and inorganic materials due to their amphiphilic nature špačková et al 2020 the heatmap shows the increase in proportion of c18 2 induced by ags eps and the conversion from c18 2 to c18 3 triggered by co2 stress fig 3b therefore ags and co2 help c vulgaris become a more suitable raw material to produce these valuable pufas however a high degree of unsaturation resulted in a low cetane number of the lipid for biodiesel production table s2 which is not favorable for fuel quality fortunately ags lipid is mainly composed of saturated fames over 50 and can compensate for the deficiencies of microalgae biolipids table s3 therefore their mixture has the potential to produce biodiesel it is expected that in the symbiosis system the proportion of microalgae and bacteria and the co cultivation mode can be adjusted according to different target products to comprehensively apply biolipids 3 4 flocculation of c vulgaris exposed to ags eps after 10 days of cultivation the flocculation ability of c vulgaris treated with ags eps was enhanced the 4 mg toc l eps and 12 mg toc l eps groups showed better flocculation ability than the other dose groups fig 4a concretely the flocculation ability of the control group was only 2 11 0 19 and 12 49 0 18 after 30 min and 180 min of settling respectively however the flocculation ability of the 4 mg toc l eps and 12 mg toc l eps groups exceeded 12 49 within 60 min and increased to 22 07 0 20 and 20 83 0 21 with 180 min of settling respectively this phenomenon is mainly due to the addition of ags eps triggers a change in the microalgae eps composition fig 4b the eps of c vulgaris in 4 mg toc l eps group showed a highest pss content and showed a highest pns content in 12 mg toc l eps group these two components are both positively correlated with the flocculation efficiency of the microalgae li et al 2023 main functional groups of pss including hydroxyl oh and carboxyl coo can provide binding sites during the microalgae flocculation process zeeshan et al 2022 and pns have hydrophobic bonds and are crucial in determining the adherence property of microbes ding et al 2021 the self aggregation and eps content change of c vulgaris could be mediated by three standard active materials based on the flocculation response of c vulgaris to three standard active materials it can be speculated that trp in ags eps was the most dominant cause in the microalgae self aggregation response and the flocculation ability was more than twice that of the blank sample followed by c6 hsl the flocculation ability reached 25 13 0 08 with 180 min of settling and ha showed less impact trp is an aromatic amino acid as well as ahl like substances of bacteria can trigger the aromatic protein secretion of microalgae zhou et al 2017 in this study the pn contents of microalgae with ags eps and standard reagent addition increased compared with the control except for the 4 mg toc l ags eps dosage especially in the trp dosage fig 4b according to their eem fluorescence spectra fig s4 the increased components can be identified as protein derived amino acid tryptophan the ex em ratio was 280 330 in region iv and aromatic protein like substances the ex em ratio was 230 335 350 in regions i ii it has been confirmed that aromatic proteins play a crucial role in microalgae flocculation process wang et al 2022b in general the addition of ags eps in which the active substance triggers a change in the microalgae eps composition further affects its self flocculation ability according to reports microalgal harvesting accounts for 20 30 of the cost of total renewable oil production yin et al 2021 the results of this study show that microalgae bacteria symbiosis has great potential to reduce costs for microalgae recovery adding an external source of co2 alone does not measurably improve the flocculation ability of microalgae ags eps plays a more important role than co2 in the solid liquid separation of the c vulgaris biomass surprisingly ags eps within the context of co2 addition improved the flocculation efficiency to 56 01 1 79 which was significantly higher than that of the control 12 49 0 18 and 12 mg toc l eps dosage 20 83 0 21 fig 4a in other words the effect of the mixture eps co2 is greater than the simple stack of effect of eps and co2 in terms of improvement of the flocculation ability ji and liu 2022 claimed that co2 could enhance the secretion of aromatic proteins from mbgs which favors flocculation stability consistently our results demonstrate the higher protein production of c vulgaris treated with eps co2 fig 4b the underlying synergistic mechanism of co2 and ags eps was further explored using molecular biology techniques 3 5 regulation mechanism of ags eps and co2 by transcriptomic analysis according to the afore mentioned physiological biochemical analysis ags eps co2 and their mixture improved the lipid production and self flocculation of c vulgaris transcriptomic analysis further revealed the regulatory mechanism of ags eps and co2 on the biolipid production and self flocculation of c vulgaris in the bacterial microalgal coupling system a total of 25 830 degs were identified in the eps co2 vs cg comparison 12 825 degs were distinguished in the co2 vs cg comparison and 11 623 degs were identified in the eps vs cg comparison these results suggest that ags eps and co2 significantly affected the gene expression and phenotypic traits of c vulgaris by subjecting these degs to the kegg pathway enrichment analysis we found that multiple metabolic pathways directly or indirectly related to lipid production and self flocculation were strongly affected the gene expressions related to the lipid synthesis fig 5 and aromatic protein synthesis fig 6 of c vulgaris under ags eps and co2 addition are provided here the fatty acid biosynthesis depends on acetyl coa which is generated from pyruvate pyruvate dehydrogenase pdh ec 1 2 4 1 had 8 4 and 3 upregulated transcripts in the eps vs cg co2 vs cg and eps co2 vs cg comparisons respectively which indicates the promotion of acetyl coa production in response to ags eps and co2 in addition the downregulation of transcripts encoding pyruvate decarboxylase pdc ec 4 1 1 1 prevented pyruvate from being shunted toward ethanol to supply sufficient precursors for the lipid synthesis subsequently genes encoding malonyl coa acp transacylase fabd ec 2 3 1 39 3 oxoacyl acp synthase fadf ec 2 3 1 79 β ketoacyl acp reductase fabg ec 1 1 1 100 and 3 hydroxyacyl dehydratase fabz ec 4 2 1 59 were upregulated which indicates a push toward the fatty acid biosynthesis of c vulgaris with ags eps and co2 addition based on these results the fatty acid synthesis steps provided a sufficient acyl pool for subsequent triacylglycerol tag synthesis furthermore genes that encode main enzymes involved in fatty acid elongation process such as very long chain 3 oxoacyl coa synthase elovl ec 2 3 1 199 very long chain 3 oxoacyl coa reductase ec 1 1 1 330 and 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase hadh ec 1 1 1 35 were also significantly upregulated which is beneficial to the long chain fatty acid n 16 synthesis table s5 genes encoding fatty acid desaturase delta 9 desaturase scd ec 1 14 19 1 and linoleoyl coa desaturase ec 1 14 19 3 were upregulated in eps treated c vulgaris which indicates the biosynthesis of c16 1 c18 1 and c18 2 table s5 these results are consistent with the changes in fames composition fig 3 subsequently a step by step conversion of glycerol 3p to tag was catalyzed by glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase gpat ec 2 3 1 15 1 acylglycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase agpat ec 2 3 1 51 phospholipid phosphatase plpp ec 3 1 3 4 and diacylglycerol acyltransferase dgat ec 2 3 1 20 for the eps vs cg comparison there were 3 1 and 3 upregulated transcripts that encoded gpat agpat and plpp log2 fold change 3 respectively which suggests that ags eps induced the genes related to lipid turnover and culminated in the tag accumulation the transcription level of triacylglycerol lipase tgl ec 3 1 1 3 was significantly downregulated in the eps co2 vs cg and co2 vs cg comparisons table s5 which implies less tag degradation these findings imply that in a microalgae bacterial coupling system ags eps and co2 produced by bacteria induced the genes involved in the lipid turnover and enhanced the capability of c vulgaris to produce lipids by promoting the fatty acid synthesis and inhibiting the tag degradation in addition the gene expression of amidase enzyme amie ec 3 5 1 4 which is responsible for indole acetate synthesis by catalyzing indole 3 acetamide was upregulated in the eps group table s5 this finding supports the conclusions drawn from phenotype analysis in the previous sections that trp in ags eps can induce the synthesis of iaa by c vulgaris and thereby increase the cell growth lipid content and flocculation ability in addition genes encoding enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis were downregulated under co2 exposure conditions including glycogen synthase ec 2 4 1 21 and glycogen branching enzyme gbe ec 2 4 1 18 table s5 this result verifies the assertion in section 3 2 that co2 triggers carbon flow to the storage of lipids instead of carbohydrates previous researches have emphasized that aromatic protein secretion is crucial for enhancing the self flocculation efficiencies of green algae zhou et al 2017 wang et al 2022b degs related to aromatic protein synthesis pathways were analyzed fig 6 prephenate aminotransferases pat ec 2 6 1 78 2 6 1 79 and prephenate dehydratase pdt ec 4 2 1 51 4 2 1 91 are responsible for the synthesis of tyrosine and phenylalanine respectively an examination of the expression of the genes that encode the two enzymes predicted that eps eps co2 and co2 upregulated the biosynthesis of phenylpyruvate arogenate and phenylalanine three aromatic amino acid aminotransferases were detected for phenylalanine and tyrosine synthesis tyrosine aminotransferase tat ec 2 6 1 5 histidinol phosphate aminotransferase hisc ec 2 6 1 9 and aspartate aminotransferase got ec 2 6 1 1 got and tat were differentially expressed in the three comparisons especially eps co2 which upregulated more genes than the other two groups similarly eps co2 performed better in the improvement of subsequent amino acyl trna synthetase gene expression including phenylalanyl trna synthetase farsa farsb ec 6 1 1 20 tyrosyl trna synthetase yars ec 6 1 1 1 and tryptophanyl trna synthetase wars ec 6 1 1 2 this result explains the observed significant improvement in the aggregation ability of c vulgaris treated with eps co2 fig 4a in addition eps and co2 also triggered an increase in anthranilate synthase asa ec 4 1 3 27 gene expression anthranilate synthase is responsible for the derivative formation of anthranilate anthranilate and its derivatives can form proteoglycans or glycoproteins which play a critical role in the cell self aggregation these results indicate that ags eps and co2 induced the expression of key enzyme genes that improve the aromatic protein accumulation and self aggregation especially in the eps co2 treatment group co2 acts as a substrate for the photosynthetic carbon metabolism and can provide energy and carbon framework for amino acids and proteins synthesis including aromatic proteins and their precursors xu et al 2020 in eps co2 vs cg comparison 75 degs related to carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms pathway were identified including 55 up regulated and 20 down regulated ones fig s5 among them 5 genes encoding transketolase convert ribulose 5 phosphate to erythrose 4 phosphate ec 2 2 1 1 were all up regulated erythrose 4 phosphate a precursor for shikimate biosynthesis is a prerequisite for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids müller et al 2018 therefore ags eps can not only provide nitrogen for nitrogen metabolism but can also stimulate carbon metabolism mediated by bioactive microbial metabolite thus the combination of co2 and ags eps can increase the availability of nutrients for microalgae leading to the upregulation of genes involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic proteins 4 conclusions this study reveals the crucial role of the eps of ags bacteria with attached growth mode on the growth biolipid synthesis and settling performance of microalgae c vulgaris the main mechanisms are ascribed to that bioactive microbial metabolite in ags eps including ahls trp and ha played distinct roles in regulating phenotypes of c vulgaris in addition ags eps within the context of co2 addition enhanced the biolipid production as well as greatly improved the self flocculation of c vulgaris transcriptome analysis of c vulgaris further confirmed that ags eps and co2 upregulated the synthesis pathways of biolipid and aromatic protein which contribute to microalgae flocculation this study provides a new insight about the microscopic mechanism of microalgae bacteria symbiosis by highlighting how attached growth bacteria use eps to regulate microalgal phenotypes which might facilitate the application of microalgae bacteria biofilm granules system for simultaneous water purification carbon sequestration and resource recovery the impact of microalgae bacteria ratio and the attached growth cocultivation mode on the resource recovery from wastewater for different target products should be
