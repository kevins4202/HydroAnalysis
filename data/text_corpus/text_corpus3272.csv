16360,rivers have been recognized as major transport pathways for microplastics into the sea but large scale quantitative data on the environmental fate of riverine microplastics remains limited hindering proper risk assessment and development of regulatory measures microplastics in the whole yangtze river basin of china were systematically investigated by sampling the water sediment and soil microplastics were detected in all samples with an average abundance of 1 27 items l 286 20 items kg and 338 09 items kg for water sediments and soils respectively with polypropylene and polyethylene being the most abundant polymers a generally increasing trend of microplastic abundance from upstream to downstream was identified which were co attributed by geographical and anthropogenic factors including elevation longitude distance from the nearest city population density urbanization rate and land use microplastics in the sediments showed more prominent vertical migration than those in the soils and the density and size of microplastics may be the key factors governing the migration of microplastics across different compartments community analysis showed that microplastics in different compartments were significantly different and highly correlated with geographical distance major cities at the middle and lower reaches were considered pivotal nodes of microplastic pollution in the yangtze river basin policy recommendations were also proposed towards better remediation of microplastic pollution involving riverine systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics migration freshwater ecosystems yangtze river basin community analysis policy recommendations 1 introduction the environmental fate of microplastics in the hydrosphere has become an urgent and hot topic bank and hansson 2019 hoellein and rochman 2021 worldwide efforts have been made to map the distribution of microplastics in oceans shorelines and marine organisms ajith et al 2020 auta et al 2017 browne et al 2011 microplastics have been identified with high abundance in estuaries jiang et al 2021 martellini et al 2018 which suggests that rivers may play an important role in the transportation of microplastics from land to sea it is estimated that 1 15 to 2 41 million tonnes of plastics enter the sea each year from rivers lebreton et al 2017 in particular the yangtze river which was considered the largest plastic exporting river to the oceans lebreton et al 2017 mai et al 2020 is now in dispute due to the long distances between the location of plastic waste generation the river and the ocean meijer et al 2021 to date field investigations on the environmental fate of microplastics at the whole watershed scale are still lacking which is crucial for clarifying the actual roles of river systems in transporting microplastics into the ocean despite rivers are considered important transporter of microplastics to oceans relevant studies on boundary areas between water and land are rare xu et al 2021 cao et al 2021 recorded that the abundance of microplastics in soils along the lower reaches of yangtze river was 4 94 252 70 items kg which was higher than that in the sediments 10 60 items kg of the yangtze estuary li et al 2019 the high loads of heterogeneous microplastics in river ecosystems have sparked research efforts to better understand the driving factors of the geographical distribution of microplastics in the watershed some field studies suggest that microplastic pollution in rivers is closely related to anthropogenic disturbance in the catchment such as population density land use and point source pollution barrows et al 2018 klein et al 2015 it is also found that microplastic pollution in riparian soils was closely associated with elevation and precipitation zhou et al 2021 nevertheless little is known about the migration of microplastics across different compartments and most research on factors driving microplastic transport is theoretical or qualitative a comprehensive description of the composition and diversity of microplastics can better describe the status and source of microplastic pollution in a specific area based on the similarity between microplastic combinations and biological communities a new concept of microplastic community referring to groups of a variety of microplastics in the same environmental matrices at the same geographical area was recently proposed to analyze the associations of the microplastics in different environmental compartments li et al 2021a however distinct subjective criteria for visual identification of physical characteristics in different studies may confuse the results of microplastic community analysis in this study we applied the polymer type of microplastics as the key identifier of microplastics in the microplastic community rather than the physical characteristics of microplastics unlike colors and shapes that may be affected by fading or fragmentation the polymer types of microplastics do not change after being discharged into the environment thus community analysis based on the chemical composition of microplastics may provide new insights into the source and fate of microplastics which would facilitate pollution control of microplastics the yangtze river is the third largest river in the world with a total length of 6300 km investigating the distribution patterns of microplastics in different compartments of the whole scale watershed can provide valuable data to advance our understanding of the environmental fate of microplastics here we conducted the first whole scale investigation of microplastic communities across the yangtze river spanning gradients of land use from un developed catchments in the remote high altitude qinghai tibet plateau to the densely populated coastal estuary community analyses on microplastics were introduced and highlighted in this study that showed high potentials for future microplastic research policy recommendations and future research prospects were proposed to better remediate microplastic pollution involving riverine systems the large number of sampling sites high diversity of geographical locations and rich local anthropogenic database made this multifaceted study an ideal case to explore complex factors that influence the environmental fate of microplastics in river ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 survey area and sample collection the yangtze river originates from the qinghai tibet plateau and flows through 11 provincial administrative regions to the east china sea from october 10 to november 20 2019 surface water shore sediment and grass soil were collected at 38 riverine points along the yangtze river fig 1 detailed information about the geographical location of sampling sites is given in table s1 at each site a 5 l steel sampler was used and repeated 10 times to collect a total of 50 l of surface water 0 50 cm in depth a stainless steel sieve 300 meshes i e pore size of 48 μm was used to filter the surface water in situ residues on the sieve were rinsed into a glass bottle 250 ml using pure water to form a concentrated surface water sample the sampling of sediment and soil samples was conducted using the method described by scheurer and bigalke 2018 the composite sample of sediment consisted of fifteen sediment cores 3 2 cm diameter and 15 cm depth taken from 0 2 to 0 5 m below the river water level the composite sample of soil was also composed of fifteen soil cores which were taken from the grass covered place 10 25 m away from the water the collected sediment or soil at each sampling site was packed in two stainless steel boxes according to the upper layer 0 5 cm and the lower layer 10 15 cm a total of 38 surface water samples 76 sediment samples half upper and half lower and 76 soil samples half upper and half lower were collected 2 2 isolation of microplastics microplastics from the water samples were extracted using the methodology described by enders et al 2017 with minor modifications briefly the concentrated surface water samples were incubated with 30 koh naclo 1 1 solution for 24 h to degrade the organic matter the digested solution was filtered onto a 0 45 μm filter paper gf f 47 mm ø whatman for further examination the sediment and soil samples were wrapped in kraft paper and air dried at room temperature then the isolation of microplastics from sediment and soil samples was performed following the methods optimized in our previous studies yuan et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 more details of microplastic extraction are provided in the supplementary materials 2 3 quantification and validation of microplastics microplastics on the filters were checked and photographed using a stereomicroscope smz25 nikon japan microplastics were visually identified according to their morphological characteristics the numbers shapes fiber film fragment bead and foam colors white transparent black grey blue red brown yellow orange green and purple and sizes of the microplastics were recorded raman analyses were performed to determine the polymer type of microplastics 10 100 of the particles within each sample were analyzed based on the number of particles in each sample resulting in a total of 8251 chemically analyzed particles table s3 the spectrum of each suspected particle was obtained using a micro raman spectrometer dxr2 thermofisher scientific usa with an incident laser of 785 nm to reduce fluorescence interference the suspected particles were rinsed with alcohol and placed on silver slides the polymer types of the resulting spectra were confirmed by comparison to the raman spectrum library of the instrument the results with a matching degree exceeding 60 were used for the compositional analysis of microplastics 2 4 quality control measures for microplastic quantification all containers and apparatus were washed thoroughly with filtered tap water before use to reduce the pollution of airborne microplastics in the field samples and equipment were covered with glass lids or aluminum foils nitrile gloves and a cotton lab gown were worn during field sampling and laboratory operation all liquid solutions were filtered with 0 45 μm filters before use the number of microplastics detected in the procedural controls was 0 28 0 36 items per filter indicating negligible pollution during the analysis process 2 5 acquisition of other data the meteorological data were obtained from china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn the precipitation data was the sum of monthly precipitation from january to october in 2019 the population density per capita gdp and urbanization rate of each site were counted according to the information published by the national bureau of statistics of china http www stats gov cn and the websites of counties districts people s government as in the study by li et al 2021b the land use type grass forest cropland and build land of each site was interpreted based on satellite data the runoff and sediment discharges of the yangtze river in 2019 were derived from the yangtze river water resources commission http www cjw gov cn the loads of microplastics in the yangtze river basin were generated by the multiplication of the abundance of microplastics at the estuary site 38 and the annual runoff and or annual sediment discharge of the yangtze river i e assuming that the vertical distribution of microplastics in water or sediment is relatively uniform 2 6 statistical analysis the correlation between variables was tested with a pearson correlation analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to analyze the difference in microplastic abundance among different groups p 0 05 the confidence level used was 95 for all statistical analyses shannon wiener diversity indexes of different samples were calculated based on their polymer compositions analysis of similarities anosim was performed to check the statistical differences in the polymer composition of microplastics in different compartments and unconstrained ordination of microplastics composition was conducted by non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds the similarity of microplastic composition between samples was calculated based on the bray curtis distance similarity 1 bray curtis the distance decay relationship ddr was established to verify the effect of increasing geographical distance between different sites on the similarity of microplastics communities data with a similarity higher than 0 90 was selected to construct the similarity matrix of the microplastic communities between the samples and visualized on a network graph with gephi version 0 9 2 geographical locations and sampling sites are plotted with arcgis version 10 6 data analyses and plotting were performed in r version 4 0 0 using packages vegan and ggplot2 3 results 3 1 abundance and distribution of microplastics in the watershed microplastics were pervasive in all samples with an abundance of 0 02 2 58 average 1 27 0 83 items l 7 788 average 286 20 208 62 items kg and 11 754 average 338 09 226 88 items kg for the water sediment and soil samples respectively figs 1 s1 there were significant positive correlations between the abundance of microplastics among water sediment and soil samples fig s2 sampling sites in this study were further classified according to geographical locations upstream midstream and downstream and land uses grass forest cropland and built land a generally increasing trend of microplastic abundance from upstream to downstream was identified in all three compartments fig 2 a interestingly the average microplastic abundance near built land areas was the highest followed by croplands while the lowest microplastic abundance was detected near grass and forest areas fig 2 b when considering depths the abundance of microplastics in the upper layer of sediments 6 765 276 63 203 22 items kg was slightly lower than that in the lower layer 8 811 297 56 214 28 items kg while the abundance of microplastics in the upper layer of soils 12 838 370 34 248 50 items kg was higher than that in the lower layer 9 671 305 87 205 98 items kg figs 1 s1 as expected clear significant positive correlations were observed between the abundance of microplastics in the upper and lower layers of sediments or soils fig s3 3 2 factors driving the distribution pattern of microplastics in the watershed according to pearson s correlation analysis the abundance of microplastics showed close relationships with the elevation of sampling sites the longitude of sampling sites the distance from the nearest city the population density and the urbanization rate fig 2 c no significant relationship was found between the abundance of microplastics and the mean annual precipitation map or the mean annual temperature mat the abundance of microplastics was negatively correlated with the elevation pearson s r 0 674 0 548 and the proximity to city r 0 533 0 487 while positively correlated with the longitude r 0 9304 0 9426 the population density r 0 565 0 616 and the urbanization rate r 0 482 0 606 table s8 among them the longitude of sampling sites was the most significantly correlated with the microplastic abundance of all three compartments in the yangtze river basin p 0 001 moreover the abundance of microplastics in water was more susceptible to these drivers with the highest determination coefficients r2 of 0 474 0 674 followed by the soil r2 0 413 0 616 and the sediment r2 0 368 0 588 samples 3 3 characteristics and composition of microplastics in the watershed microplastics in this study were classified into seven color categories white transparent black grey blue red brown yellow orange green and purple and five shapes fiber film fragment bead and foam fig 3 representative microplastics observed in this study were shown in fig s4 white transparent 25 3 28 8 and black grey microplastics 26 4 28 9 were the main colors of microplastics in all three compartments of the yangtze river basin followed by blue red brown and yellow orange 10 6 12 8 being green 4 6 5 2 and purple 0 9 1 9 the least detected fig 3 a fibers were the main shape of microplastics detected in water and sediments 50 fig 3 b fibers 41 7 and fragments 32 6 were the dominant shapes of microplastics in soil accounting for more than 70 of the tested polymers beads 4 5 7 5 and foams 0 3 0 8 were the least detected shapes in all three compartments small microplastics 1 0 mm dominated in all three compartments of the yangtze river basin fig s4 accounting for 87 5 91 3 and 81 2 of the microplastics in water sediment and soil samples respectively notably these small microplastics represented 93 8 and 84 5 in the lower layers of sediments and soils respectively which were higher than those in the upper layers of sediments 88 7 and soils 79 4 the average size order of microplastics in different compartments is the upper soil 0 952 0 719 mm the lower soil 0 795 0 722 mm the surface water 0 750 0 638 mm the upper sediment 0 716 0 523 mm the lower sediment 0 620 0 601 mm beside fig 1 b showed that there is no generalizable trend in the size distribution of microplastics between different sampling sites the major polymer types of microplastics detected in this study included polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polyamide pa polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet polycarbonate pc and polyvinyl fluoride pvf fig 3 c pp and pe were the dominant polymer types of microplastics with a proportion of over 20 each pa ps pvc and pet were detected in the range of approximately 6 5 10 5 with wide variation in water sediment and soil samples pc and pvf were less detected in the yangtze river 2 6 3 9 shannon wiener index was applied to test the diversity of microplastic communities in each compartment the diversity of microplastics was highest in the sediment 2 86 0 10 followed by the soil 2 83 0 08 and the water 2 72 0 09 fig s5 since no significant difference was identified in the composition and diversity between the upper and lower layers of sediments or soils the layer of sediments or soils was not considered as a factor in the following community analysis 3 4 community analysis of microplastics in different compartments anosim showed that the differences of microplastic communities in different compartments were significantly higher than those in different sites of same compartment r 0 645 p 0 001 fig 4 a nmds analysis demonstrated that the polymer composition of microplastic communities was grouped according to three different compartments fig 4 a the distance decay linear model was applied to examine the effect of geographical distance on the links among microplastic communities in different compartments fig 4 b d significant distance decay relationships for the similarity of microplastic communities were found in all three compartments suggested that the geographical distance had a significant impact on the microplastic communities beside the distance decay relationship of microplastic communities in the water r2 0 711 p 0 001 was stronger than those in the sediments r2 0 687 p 0 001 and the soils r2 0 529 p 0 001 indicating that microplastic communities changed during the flow transport in the yangtze river a network analysis of microplastic community for each sampling site in different compartments was run based on the similarity of microplastic communities fig 5 a interestingly the microplastic communities of sampling sites adjacent to metropolis in the middle and lower reaches such as wuhan site 21 and shanghai site 36 occupied a more central position in the network suggesting large cities as the main point sources of microplastic pollution in the yangtze river basin also the microplastic communities in surface water showed both the highest degree centrality 6 27 4 23 and the lowest betweenness centrality 3 60 5 10 in the network fig 5 b c which suggested that the surface water of the yangtze river may play a more critical role in the migration of microplastics community than the sediments and the soils 4 discussion 4 1 source analysis of microplastics in the yangtze river the morphological characteristics and chemical compositions of microplastics could provide clues of their potential sources campanale et al 2020 kim et al 2021 in our study fibers are dominant in all compartments and account for more than 40 in all sampling sites domestic laundry wastewater was considered to be the main source of fibrous microplastics in freshwater hernandez et al 2017 hernandez et al 2017 found that thousands of fibrous microplastics 0 1 0 8 mm were released from household textiles during washing a previous study has highlighted the significance of releasing fibrous microplastics through fisheries xue et al 2020 this conclusion may also be applicable to the yangtze river basin the most prosperous area of inland fisheries in china some commonly used agricultural plastic products such as shade nets and fertilizer bags can also decompose into fibers over time in the environment fakour et al 2021 fragments 15 6 32 6 and films 11 5 19 4 also accounted for a large proportion of the microplastics detected in this study these plastics are likely to originate from the fragmentation of plastic waste and usually associated with terrestrial sources lenaker et al 2019 rubber particles from tire wear are suspected to be an important source of microplastic fragments yukioka et al 2020 horton et al 2017 proved that the storm drain outfall receiving urban runoff as the reason of the increased fragments plastic packaging discarded into the environment may produce a large number of microplastic films alimba and faggio 2019 the broken plastic mulching in agricultural activities may be the contributor of films since the agriculture around the yangtze river basin is well developed the proportion of beads is relatively small in the yangtze river although it was estimated that more than 200 trillion microbeads are discharged into the water environment every year in china zhang et al 2018 one possible reason could be that the bead and foam in the wastewater treatment plants wwtps are prone to be adsorbed and transferred into sludge liu et al 2019 pe and pp are two common polymers occurring in the yangtze river basin these two polymers are the most demanding and produced plastic types in the world and are widely used for packaging containers pipes agricultural film automotive parts fishing gears and houseware plasticseurope 2020 owing to the polymers of microplastics are related to their applications the diversity of microplastic polymers can be used to reflect the complexity of the sources of microplastics wang et al 2019 fig 2 a showed that the area located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river has higher microplastic abundance and diversity this is reasonable because anthropogenic activities and economic development in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river are higher than those in the upper reaches similarly due to the proximity of microplastic sources sampling sites located in the built land and cropland have higher microplastic abundances and diversities the diversity of microplastic polymers in sediments is the highest followed by soils and the least in surface water fig s5 compared with other compartments sediments are more likely to become the sink of various microplastic sources in the watershed including surface runoff sewage treatment plants fishery activities among others he et al 2020 liu et al 2021 xue et al 2020 while the sources of microplastics in soils are more limited by local point pollution the diversity of microplastics in surface water is the lowest which may be due to the selective sedimentation of some high density microplastics in water column on the other hand no significant difference in the diversity of microplastics was found at different depths of sediments or soils suggesting similar sources of the same environmental compartment addressing the definitive origins of microplastics is challenging given the dispersion and diversity of microplastic sources in the yangtze river basin 4 2 transportation of microplastics from upstream to downstream microplastics in the river have multiple potential sinks discharged into the sea lebreton et al 2017 stranded on riparian soils zhou et al 2021 deposited in sediments xue et al 2020 or ingested by aquatic organisms yuan et al 2019 the yangtze river is the largest river of hydropower in the world and is considered to play an important role in exporting plastics to the ocean lebreton et al 2017 mai et al 2020 the generally increasing trend of microplastic abundance from upstream to downstream identified in this study also suggests that the yangtze river can transport microplastics to the ocean it is estimated that 68 of plastic waste is generated in the upper reaches of the yangtze river lebreton et al 2017 despite better waste management measures microplastic pollution in the lower reaches of the yangtze river is more serious this shows that in addition to secondary microplastics the direct emission of primary microplastics plays a more important role in the source of microplastics in the yangtze river basin the size of microplastics did not decrease or increase significantly from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the yangtze river this implied that the aggravation of microplastic pollution in the lower reaches of the yangtze river may not be due to the fragmentation or cracking of plastics but the transportation and accumulation of homologous microplastics particularly fibers account for the vast majority of microplastics in the yangtze river basin and they are likely to come from laundry wastewater after limited sewage treatments along the yangtze river liu et al 2019 this implies that the mismanaged plastic waste mpw model that is often used for plastics prediction might not be suitable for the prediction of microplastics the abundance of microplastics in the yangtze river basin shows significant spatial specificity microplastic pollution was generally higher on sampling sites near large cities such as wuhan jiujiang and shanghai sites 21 25 and 36 in fig 1 these areas located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and close to the metropolis that receives large amounts of agricultural backwater and domestic sewage on the contrary the upper stream with less human activities showed lower abundance and diversity of microplastic pollution compared to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river figs 2 a s6 in addition population density per capita gdp urbanization rate and land use are significantly correlated to the microplastic pollution in the yangtze river basin fig 2 c this finding is supported by previous studies chen et al 2020 he et al 2020 weber and opp 2020 which observed the relationship between anthropogenic factors within the catchment areas and microplastic pollution lower correlations were observed between microplastic pollution in sediments and anthropogenic factors this could be attributed to the complex dynamic mechanism of microplastic transportation and deposition in riverine sediment including hydraulic deposition resuspension and bioturbation liu et al 2021 niu et al 2021 xia et al 2021 hydrodynamics may also explain the large variation of microplastic abundance within the upstream and downstream of the yangtze river a negative relationship between water velocities and microplastic pollution has been found in river systems by tibbetts et al 2018 the lower reaches of the yangtze river have much lower velocities than the upper reaches and are known sinks for fine grained sediment chen et al 2007 and hence potentially for microplastics the highest microplastic abundance of water and sediment samples was documented at site 38 from the yangtze river estuary the tides and weak velocities in the estuaries could contribute to the re entering and sedimentation of microplastics zhao et al 2019 previous study claimed that artificial barriers on rivers could intercept a large number of microplastics during horizontal transportation due to weakened hydraulic conditions zhang et al 2015 however this study does not find that the presence of artificial barriers played a role in affecting the transportation of microplastics in the yangtze river the most prominent evidence is that the abundance of microplastics at site 16 downstream of the three gorges dam had not decreased although this may also be due to the emergence of new pollution sources downstream of the dam similarly weideman et al 2019 proposed that dams do not trap floating microplastics this means that the artificial barrier without a filtering device for microplastics cannot intercept the transportation of microplastics effectively which should be paid attention to in future projects distance decay relationship ddr analysis indicates that microplastic communities in different compartments of the watershed including the water sediment and soil are highly correlated with geographical distance fig 4 once entering the aquatic environment some high density microplastics of specific polymer types could be relatively easy to sediment in the lotic environment hence the microplastic communities in the river system might be influenced by geographical distance additionally co occurrence networks reveal that migration of microplastic communities in the watershed is dominant in water whereas neglect in sediment and soil fig 5 considering the limited transportation riverine sediments and soils may act as sinks of microplastics instead of transport pathways he et al 2021 overall pollution sources and hydrological factors contribute to the horizontal distribution and transportation of microplastics in the yangtze river rivers with large watersheds will receive microplastics from various point and nonpoint pollution sources as introduced by sewage and runoff and transport them to sink i e riverine sediments or marine environments at the action of hydrodynamics 4 3 migration of microplastic communities across different compartments the compositions of microplastic communities are significantly different between different compartments fig 4 a the most abundant of low densities microplastics such as pp and pe were observed in the water followed by the soils and the least in the sediments microplastics in sediments originate from the deposition of microplastics in water column over a relatively long period generally high density microplastics settle more easily while low density microplastics tend to be suspended in water sun et al 2021 however low density microplastics might also sink to the sediment when biofouling occurred van melkebeke et al 2020 through a simulation experiment hoellein et al 2019 observed that the settling rate of fragments in water was higher than that of fibers which was consistent with our field results i e the proportion of fragments in sediment was higher than that in water in this study microplastics in the sediments showed more prominent vertical migration than that in the soils the migration of microplastics between different layers of riverine sediments may be realized by frequent hydraulic fluctuations weber and opp 2020 the flowing river water may take away the microplastics from the surface of the sediment making the abundance of microplastic lower at the surface in soils leaching bioturbation and cultivation can affect the degradation and migration of microplastics but this migration rate is very slow cao et al 2021 rillig and lehmann 2020 microplastics in soils may be transported along with water runoff and soil erosion into adjacent rivers but this pathway has not been experimentally tested wetland plants may intercept plastic debris in surface runoff resulting in the decreased input of microplastics into the river helcoski et al 2020 the sizes of microplastics might be the key factors governing this process fig s7 suggests that grass and forest may help prevent the migration of large plastics from riparian soils to riverine sediments the proportion of small size microplastics in soils was lower than those in water and sediments possibly because smaller microplastics are more difficult to be intercepted by plants the distance decay relationships showed that the similarity between microplastic communities strengthen with the decrease of geographical distance fig 4 b d suggesting that the adjacent sampling sites have similar or shared pollution sources wang et al 2019 some drivers such as wildlife flood and air may lead to the migration and exchange of microplastics between adjacent locations rillig and lehmann 2020 rochman 2018 rochman and hoellein 2020 the similarity network of microplastic compositions indicates close associations between microplastic communities in different compartments fig 5 a node level topological features of the network demonstrate that the microplastic communities between adjacent sampling sites in water are most closely connected while the microplastic communities in sediments and soils are more scattered in the network fig 5 b c this implies that the microplastic communities in the yangtze river are prone to migrate through the water rather than the sediments and soils of the watershed notably the microplastic communities adjacent to large cities such as wuhan site 21 and shanghai site 36 occupy a more central position in the network this finding suggests that large cities in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river are pivotal nodes of microplastic pollution in the river thus should receive more attention in the prevention and control of microplastics in the future 4 4 future research prospects and policy recommendations to better remediate microplastic pollution involving riverine systems policy recommendations and future research prospects were proposed based our findings i there are different advantages of microplastic distribution in the three compartments of the yangtze river basin fig 6 a microplastics in the surface water are of low abundance aplenty fiber and high degree centrality microplastics in sediment are small in size colorful and of high diversity the highest abundance is observed in soils future studies should deepen the consideration of distinct sources and fates of microplastics in different compartments within the watershed system ii the relatively high abundance of microplastics in the estuarine area indicates that the river system act as an important pathway for microplastics from land to sea according to the runoff and sediment discharge of the yangtze river in 2019 it is preliminarily estimated that 1 22 1015 microplastic items 0 05 5 mm enter the sea through the water 97 54 of the total load and sediment 2 46 of the total load of the yangtze river in 2019 fig 6 b thus water management and wastewater treatment should be the top priority of microplastics mitigation in the yangtze river basin iii complex geographical and anthropogenic factors contribute to the prevalence of microplastics increasing from upstream to downstream reducing the deterioration of microplastic pollution caused by anthropogenic factors is an important measure for the prevention and control of microplastics microplastics in the yangtze river basin are related to land use strategies and microplastic pollution around grass and forest decreases significantly planting green on the river banks near densely populated areas therefore is expected to effectively intercept and reduce the river microplastics from land sources iv the vertical migration of microplastics at the watershed scale is worthy of attention although small microplastics are more prone to sedimentation the vertical migration of microplastics in sediments and soils showed different patterns microplastics in sediments tend to migrate deeper but not in soils sedimental microplastics may pose an environmental risk particularly to benthos due to the deposition of a large number of small microplastics thus it is necessary to further study the potential impact of sedimental microplastics on benthic ecosystems v community analysis shows close associations of the microplastic communities in different environmental compartments these associations suggest the migration and transport of microplastics among different compartments and locations providing field based evidence for the concept of the plastic cycle bank and hansson 2019 rochman and hoellein 2020 beside results of the network of microplastic communities indicate that the major cities in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river such as wuhan and shanghai could play a significant role in remediating microplastic pollution in the yangtze river basin vi a more efficient plastic monitoring at a global scale is needed to better understand the drivers and impacts of microplastic pollution bank et al 2021 meanwhile the application of community analysis method to study the environmental fate of microplastics is advocated the ultimate way to remediate microplastic pollution is to minimize plastic consumption optimize waste management and seek alternative products which requires unremitting efforts by managers scientists as well as the publics 5 conclusions our research shows microplastics are universal and heterogeneous in the yangtze river basin and are transported over long distances in the river extending to the ocean domestic wastewater fishery activities and surface runoff may be the main sources of microplastics in the yangtze river basin complex geographical and anthropogenic factors contributed to the prevalence of microplastics increased from upstream to downstream although the abundances of microplastics in riverine sediments and soils are much higher than that in water microplastics tend to be transported to the ocean through the water rather than riverine sediments and soils sedimental microplastics showed a high ecological risk due to their small size and high vertical mobility the density and size of microplastics may be the key factors affecting the migration of microplastics in different compartments additionally community analyses on microplastic polymers were introduced and highlighted in this study that showed high potentials for future microplastic research microplastic communities in different environmental compartments were significantly different and highly correlated with geographical distance the major cities at the middle and lower reaches were considered pivotal nodes of microplastic pollution in the yangtze river basin thus should receive more attention in the prevention and control of microplastics in the future finally we suggest paying attention to the distinct sources and fates of microplastics in different

16360,rivers have been recognized as major transport pathways for microplastics into the sea but large scale quantitative data on the environmental fate of riverine microplastics remains limited hindering proper risk assessment and development of regulatory measures microplastics in the whole yangtze river basin of china were systematically investigated by sampling the water sediment and soil microplastics were detected in all samples with an average abundance of 1 27 items l 286 20 items kg and 338 09 items kg for water sediments and soils respectively with polypropylene and polyethylene being the most abundant polymers a generally increasing trend of microplastic abundance from upstream to downstream was identified which were co attributed by geographical and anthropogenic factors including elevation longitude distance from the nearest city population density urbanization rate and land use microplastics in the sediments showed more prominent vertical migration than those in the soils and the density and size of microplastics may be the key factors governing the migration of microplastics across different compartments community analysis showed that microplastics in different compartments were significantly different and highly correlated with geographical distance major cities at the middle and lower reaches were considered pivotal nodes of microplastic pollution in the yangtze river basin policy recommendations were also proposed towards better remediation of microplastic pollution involving riverine systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics migration freshwater ecosystems yangtze river basin community analysis policy recommendations 1 introduction the environmental fate of microplastics in the hydrosphere has become an urgent and hot topic bank and hansson 2019 hoellein and rochman 2021 worldwide efforts have been made to map the distribution of microplastics in oceans shorelines and marine organisms ajith et al 2020 auta et al 2017 browne et al 2011 microplastics have been identified with high abundance in estuaries jiang et al 2021 martellini et al 2018 which suggests that rivers may play an important role in the transportation of microplastics from land to sea it is estimated that 1 15 to 2 41 million tonnes of plastics enter the sea each year from rivers lebreton et al 2017 in particular the yangtze river which was considered the largest plastic exporting river to the oceans lebreton et al 2017 mai et al 2020 is now in dispute due to the long distances between the location of plastic waste generation the river and the ocean meijer et al 2021 to date field investigations on the environmental fate of microplastics at the whole watershed scale are still lacking which is crucial for clarifying the actual roles of river systems in transporting microplastics into the ocean despite rivers are considered important transporter of microplastics to oceans relevant studies on boundary areas between water and land are rare xu et al 2021 cao et al 2021 recorded that the abundance of microplastics in soils along the lower reaches of yangtze river was 4 94 252 70 items kg which was higher than that in the sediments 10 60 items kg of the yangtze estuary li et al 2019 the high loads of heterogeneous microplastics in river ecosystems have sparked research efforts to better understand the driving factors of the geographical distribution of microplastics in the watershed some field studies suggest that microplastic pollution in rivers is closely related to anthropogenic disturbance in the catchment such as population density land use and point source pollution barrows et al 2018 klein et al 2015 it is also found that microplastic pollution in riparian soils was closely associated with elevation and precipitation zhou et al 2021 nevertheless little is known about the migration of microplastics across different compartments and most research on factors driving microplastic transport is theoretical or qualitative a comprehensive description of the composition and diversity of microplastics can better describe the status and source of microplastic pollution in a specific area based on the similarity between microplastic combinations and biological communities a new concept of microplastic community referring to groups of a variety of microplastics in the same environmental matrices at the same geographical area was recently proposed to analyze the associations of the microplastics in different environmental compartments li et al 2021a however distinct subjective criteria for visual identification of physical characteristics in different studies may confuse the results of microplastic community analysis in this study we applied the polymer type of microplastics as the key identifier of microplastics in the microplastic community rather than the physical characteristics of microplastics unlike colors and shapes that may be affected by fading or fragmentation the polymer types of microplastics do not change after being discharged into the environment thus community analysis based on the chemical composition of microplastics may provide new insights into the source and fate of microplastics which would facilitate pollution control of microplastics the yangtze river is the third largest river in the world with a total length of 6300 km investigating the distribution patterns of microplastics in different compartments of the whole scale watershed can provide valuable data to advance our understanding of the environmental fate of microplastics here we conducted the first whole scale investigation of microplastic communities across the yangtze river spanning gradients of land use from un developed catchments in the remote high altitude qinghai tibet plateau to the densely populated coastal estuary community analyses on microplastics were introduced and highlighted in this study that showed high potentials for future microplastic research policy recommendations and future research prospects were proposed to better remediate microplastic pollution involving riverine systems the large number of sampling sites high diversity of geographical locations and rich local anthropogenic database made this multifaceted study an ideal case to explore complex factors that influence the environmental fate of microplastics in river ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 survey area and sample collection the yangtze river originates from the qinghai tibet plateau and flows through 11 provincial administrative regions to the east china sea from october 10 to november 20 2019 surface water shore sediment and grass soil were collected at 38 riverine points along the yangtze river fig 1 detailed information about the geographical location of sampling sites is given in table s1 at each site a 5 l steel sampler was used and repeated 10 times to collect a total of 50 l of surface water 0 50 cm in depth a stainless steel sieve 300 meshes i e pore size of 48 μm was used to filter the surface water in situ residues on the sieve were rinsed into a glass bottle 250 ml using pure water to form a concentrated surface water sample the sampling of sediment and soil samples was conducted using the method described by scheurer and bigalke 2018 the composite sample of sediment consisted of fifteen sediment cores 3 2 cm diameter and 15 cm depth taken from 0 2 to 0 5 m below the river water level the composite sample of soil was also composed of fifteen soil cores which were taken from the grass covered place 10 25 m away from the water the collected sediment or soil at each sampling site was packed in two stainless steel boxes according to the upper layer 0 5 cm and the lower layer 10 15 cm a total of 38 surface water samples 76 sediment samples half upper and half lower and 76 soil samples half upper and half lower were collected 2 2 isolation of microplastics microplastics from the water samples were extracted using the methodology described by enders et al 2017 with minor modifications briefly the concentrated surface water samples were incubated with 30 koh naclo 1 1 solution for 24 h to degrade the organic matter the digested solution was filtered onto a 0 45 μm filter paper gf f 47 mm ø whatman for further examination the sediment and soil samples were wrapped in kraft paper and air dried at room temperature then the isolation of microplastics from sediment and soil samples was performed following the methods optimized in our previous studies yuan et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 more details of microplastic extraction are provided in the supplementary materials 2 3 quantification and validation of microplastics microplastics on the filters were checked and photographed using a stereomicroscope smz25 nikon japan microplastics were visually identified according to their morphological characteristics the numbers shapes fiber film fragment bead and foam colors white transparent black grey blue red brown yellow orange green and purple and sizes of the microplastics were recorded raman analyses were performed to determine the polymer type of microplastics 10 100 of the particles within each sample were analyzed based on the number of particles in each sample resulting in a total of 8251 chemically analyzed particles table s3 the spectrum of each suspected particle was obtained using a micro raman spectrometer dxr2 thermofisher scientific usa with an incident laser of 785 nm to reduce fluorescence interference the suspected particles were rinsed with alcohol and placed on silver slides the polymer types of the resulting spectra were confirmed by comparison to the raman spectrum library of the instrument the results with a matching degree exceeding 60 were used for the compositional analysis of microplastics 2 4 quality control measures for microplastic quantification all containers and apparatus were washed thoroughly with filtered tap water before use to reduce the pollution of airborne microplastics in the field samples and equipment were covered with glass lids or aluminum foils nitrile gloves and a cotton lab gown were worn during field sampling and laboratory operation all liquid solutions were filtered with 0 45 μm filters before use the number of microplastics detected in the procedural controls was 0 28 0 36 items per filter indicating negligible pollution during the analysis process 2 5 acquisition of other data the meteorological data were obtained from china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma cn the precipitation data was the sum of monthly precipitation from january to october in 2019 the population density per capita gdp and urbanization rate of each site were counted according to the information published by the national bureau of statistics of china http www stats gov cn and the websites of counties districts people s government as in the study by li et al 2021b the land use type grass forest cropland and build land of each site was interpreted based on satellite data the runoff and sediment discharges of the yangtze river in 2019 were derived from the yangtze river water resources commission http www cjw gov cn the loads of microplastics in the yangtze river basin were generated by the multiplication of the abundance of microplastics at the estuary site 38 and the annual runoff and or annual sediment discharge of the yangtze river i e assuming that the vertical distribution of microplastics in water or sediment is relatively uniform 2 6 statistical analysis the correlation between variables was tested with a pearson correlation analysis one way analysis of variance anova was used to analyze the difference in microplastic abundance among different groups p 0 05 the confidence level used was 95 for all statistical analyses shannon wiener diversity indexes of different samples were calculated based on their polymer compositions analysis of similarities anosim was performed to check the statistical differences in the polymer composition of microplastics in different compartments and unconstrained ordination of microplastics composition was conducted by non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds the similarity of microplastic composition between samples was calculated based on the bray curtis distance similarity 1 bray curtis the distance decay relationship ddr was established to verify the effect of increasing geographical distance between different sites on the similarity of microplastics communities data with a similarity higher than 0 90 was selected to construct the similarity matrix of the microplastic communities between the samples and visualized on a network graph with gephi version 0 9 2 geographical locations and sampling sites are plotted with arcgis version 10 6 data analyses and plotting were performed in r version 4 0 0 using packages vegan and ggplot2 3 results 3 1 abundance and distribution of microplastics in the watershed microplastics were pervasive in all samples with an abundance of 0 02 2 58 average 1 27 0 83 items l 7 788 average 286 20 208 62 items kg and 11 754 average 338 09 226 88 items kg for the water sediment and soil samples respectively figs 1 s1 there were significant positive correlations between the abundance of microplastics among water sediment and soil samples fig s2 sampling sites in this study were further classified according to geographical locations upstream midstream and downstream and land uses grass forest cropland and built land a generally increasing trend of microplastic abundance from upstream to downstream was identified in all three compartments fig 2 a interestingly the average microplastic abundance near built land areas was the highest followed by croplands while the lowest microplastic abundance was detected near grass and forest areas fig 2 b when considering depths the abundance of microplastics in the upper layer of sediments 6 765 276 63 203 22 items kg was slightly lower than that in the lower layer 8 811 297 56 214 28 items kg while the abundance of microplastics in the upper layer of soils 12 838 370 34 248 50 items kg was higher than that in the lower layer 9 671 305 87 205 98 items kg figs 1 s1 as expected clear significant positive correlations were observed between the abundance of microplastics in the upper and lower layers of sediments or soils fig s3 3 2 factors driving the distribution pattern of microplastics in the watershed according to pearson s correlation analysis the abundance of microplastics showed close relationships with the elevation of sampling sites the longitude of sampling sites the distance from the nearest city the population density and the urbanization rate fig 2 c no significant relationship was found between the abundance of microplastics and the mean annual precipitation map or the mean annual temperature mat the abundance of microplastics was negatively correlated with the elevation pearson s r 0 674 0 548 and the proximity to city r 0 533 0 487 while positively correlated with the longitude r 0 9304 0 9426 the population density r 0 565 0 616 and the urbanization rate r 0 482 0 606 table s8 among them the longitude of sampling sites was the most significantly correlated with the microplastic abundance of all three compartments in the yangtze river basin p 0 001 moreover the abundance of microplastics in water was more susceptible to these drivers with the highest determination coefficients r2 of 0 474 0 674 followed by the soil r2 0 413 0 616 and the sediment r2 0 368 0 588 samples 3 3 characteristics and composition of microplastics in the watershed microplastics in this study were classified into seven color categories white transparent black grey blue red brown yellow orange green and purple and five shapes fiber film fragment bead and foam fig 3 representative microplastics observed in this study were shown in fig s4 white transparent 25 3 28 8 and black grey microplastics 26 4 28 9 were the main colors of microplastics in all three compartments of the yangtze river basin followed by blue red brown and yellow orange 10 6 12 8 being green 4 6 5 2 and purple 0 9 1 9 the least detected fig 3 a fibers were the main shape of microplastics detected in water and sediments 50 fig 3 b fibers 41 7 and fragments 32 6 were the dominant shapes of microplastics in soil accounting for more than 70 of the tested polymers beads 4 5 7 5 and foams 0 3 0 8 were the least detected shapes in all three compartments small microplastics 1 0 mm dominated in all three compartments of the yangtze river basin fig s4 accounting for 87 5 91 3 and 81 2 of the microplastics in water sediment and soil samples respectively notably these small microplastics represented 93 8 and 84 5 in the lower layers of sediments and soils respectively which were higher than those in the upper layers of sediments 88 7 and soils 79 4 the average size order of microplastics in different compartments is the upper soil 0 952 0 719 mm the lower soil 0 795 0 722 mm the surface water 0 750 0 638 mm the upper sediment 0 716 0 523 mm the lower sediment 0 620 0 601 mm beside fig 1 b showed that there is no generalizable trend in the size distribution of microplastics between different sampling sites the major polymer types of microplastics detected in this study included polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polyamide pa polystyrene ps polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet polycarbonate pc and polyvinyl fluoride pvf fig 3 c pp and pe were the dominant polymer types of microplastics with a proportion of over 20 each pa ps pvc and pet were detected in the range of approximately 6 5 10 5 with wide variation in water sediment and soil samples pc and pvf were less detected in the yangtze river 2 6 3 9 shannon wiener index was applied to test the diversity of microplastic communities in each compartment the diversity of microplastics was highest in the sediment 2 86 0 10 followed by the soil 2 83 0 08 and the water 2 72 0 09 fig s5 since no significant difference was identified in the composition and diversity between the upper and lower layers of sediments or soils the layer of sediments or soils was not considered as a factor in the following community analysis 3 4 community analysis of microplastics in different compartments anosim showed that the differences of microplastic communities in different compartments were significantly higher than those in different sites of same compartment r 0 645 p 0 001 fig 4 a nmds analysis demonstrated that the polymer composition of microplastic communities was grouped according to three different compartments fig 4 a the distance decay linear model was applied to examine the effect of geographical distance on the links among microplastic communities in different compartments fig 4 b d significant distance decay relationships for the similarity of microplastic communities were found in all three compartments suggested that the geographical distance had a significant impact on the microplastic communities beside the distance decay relationship of microplastic communities in the water r2 0 711 p 0 001 was stronger than those in the sediments r2 0 687 p 0 001 and the soils r2 0 529 p 0 001 indicating that microplastic communities changed during the flow transport in the yangtze river a network analysis of microplastic community for each sampling site in different compartments was run based on the similarity of microplastic communities fig 5 a interestingly the microplastic communities of sampling sites adjacent to metropolis in the middle and lower reaches such as wuhan site 21 and shanghai site 36 occupied a more central position in the network suggesting large cities as the main point sources of microplastic pollution in the yangtze river basin also the microplastic communities in surface water showed both the highest degree centrality 6 27 4 23 and the lowest betweenness centrality 3 60 5 10 in the network fig 5 b c which suggested that the surface water of the yangtze river may play a more critical role in the migration of microplastics community than the sediments and the soils 4 discussion 4 1 source analysis of microplastics in the yangtze river the morphological characteristics and chemical compositions of microplastics could provide clues of their potential sources campanale et al 2020 kim et al 2021 in our study fibers are dominant in all compartments and account for more than 40 in all sampling sites domestic laundry wastewater was considered to be the main source of fibrous microplastics in freshwater hernandez et al 2017 hernandez et al 2017 found that thousands of fibrous microplastics 0 1 0 8 mm were released from household textiles during washing a previous study has highlighted the significance of releasing fibrous microplastics through fisheries xue et al 2020 this conclusion may also be applicable to the yangtze river basin the most prosperous area of inland fisheries in china some commonly used agricultural plastic products such as shade nets and fertilizer bags can also decompose into fibers over time in the environment fakour et al 2021 fragments 15 6 32 6 and films 11 5 19 4 also accounted for a large proportion of the microplastics detected in this study these plastics are likely to originate from the fragmentation of plastic waste and usually associated with terrestrial sources lenaker et al 2019 rubber particles from tire wear are suspected to be an important source of microplastic fragments yukioka et al 2020 horton et al 2017 proved that the storm drain outfall receiving urban runoff as the reason of the increased fragments plastic packaging discarded into the environment may produce a large number of microplastic films alimba and faggio 2019 the broken plastic mulching in agricultural activities may be the contributor of films since the agriculture around the yangtze river basin is well developed the proportion of beads is relatively small in the yangtze river although it was estimated that more than 200 trillion microbeads are discharged into the water environment every year in china zhang et al 2018 one possible reason could be that the bead and foam in the wastewater treatment plants wwtps are prone to be adsorbed and transferred into sludge liu et al 2019 pe and pp are two common polymers occurring in the yangtze river basin these two polymers are the most demanding and produced plastic types in the world and are widely used for packaging containers pipes agricultural film automotive parts fishing gears and houseware plasticseurope 2020 owing to the polymers of microplastics are related to their applications the diversity of microplastic polymers can be used to reflect the complexity of the sources of microplastics wang et al 2019 fig 2 a showed that the area located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river has higher microplastic abundance and diversity this is reasonable because anthropogenic activities and economic development in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river are higher than those in the upper reaches similarly due to the proximity of microplastic sources sampling sites located in the built land and cropland have higher microplastic abundances and diversities the diversity of microplastic polymers in sediments is the highest followed by soils and the least in surface water fig s5 compared with other compartments sediments are more likely to become the sink of various microplastic sources in the watershed including surface runoff sewage treatment plants fishery activities among others he et al 2020 liu et al 2021 xue et al 2020 while the sources of microplastics in soils are more limited by local point pollution the diversity of microplastics in surface water is the lowest which may be due to the selective sedimentation of some high density microplastics in water column on the other hand no significant difference in the diversity of microplastics was found at different depths of sediments or soils suggesting similar sources of the same environmental compartment addressing the definitive origins of microplastics is challenging given the dispersion and diversity of microplastic sources in the yangtze river basin 4 2 transportation of microplastics from upstream to downstream microplastics in the river have multiple potential sinks discharged into the sea lebreton et al 2017 stranded on riparian soils zhou et al 2021 deposited in sediments xue et al 2020 or ingested by aquatic organisms yuan et al 2019 the yangtze river is the largest river of hydropower in the world and is considered to play an important role in exporting plastics to the ocean lebreton et al 2017 mai et al 2020 the generally increasing trend of microplastic abundance from upstream to downstream identified in this study also suggests that the yangtze river can transport microplastics to the ocean it is estimated that 68 of plastic waste is generated in the upper reaches of the yangtze river lebreton et al 2017 despite better waste management measures microplastic pollution in the lower reaches of the yangtze river is more serious this shows that in addition to secondary microplastics the direct emission of primary microplastics plays a more important role in the source of microplastics in the yangtze river basin the size of microplastics did not decrease or increase significantly from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of the yangtze river this implied that the aggravation of microplastic pollution in the lower reaches of the yangtze river may not be due to the fragmentation or cracking of plastics but the transportation and accumulation of homologous microplastics particularly fibers account for the vast majority of microplastics in the yangtze river basin and they are likely to come from laundry wastewater after limited sewage treatments along the yangtze river liu et al 2019 this implies that the mismanaged plastic waste mpw model that is often used for plastics prediction might not be suitable for the prediction of microplastics the abundance of microplastics in the yangtze river basin shows significant spatial specificity microplastic pollution was generally higher on sampling sites near large cities such as wuhan jiujiang and shanghai sites 21 25 and 36 in fig 1 these areas located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river and close to the metropolis that receives large amounts of agricultural backwater and domestic sewage on the contrary the upper stream with less human activities showed lower abundance and diversity of microplastic pollution compared to the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river figs 2 a s6 in addition population density per capita gdp urbanization rate and land use are significantly correlated to the microplastic pollution in the yangtze river basin fig 2 c this finding is supported by previous studies chen et al 2020 he et al 2020 weber and opp 2020 which observed the relationship between anthropogenic factors within the catchment areas and microplastic pollution lower correlations were observed between microplastic pollution in sediments and anthropogenic factors this could be attributed to the complex dynamic mechanism of microplastic transportation and deposition in riverine sediment including hydraulic deposition resuspension and bioturbation liu et al 2021 niu et al 2021 xia et al 2021 hydrodynamics may also explain the large variation of microplastic abundance within the upstream and downstream of the yangtze river a negative relationship between water velocities and microplastic pollution has been found in river systems by tibbetts et al 2018 the lower reaches of the yangtze river have much lower velocities than the upper reaches and are known sinks for fine grained sediment chen et al 2007 and hence potentially for microplastics the highest microplastic abundance of water and sediment samples was documented at site 38 from the yangtze river estuary the tides and weak velocities in the estuaries could contribute to the re entering and sedimentation of microplastics zhao et al 2019 previous study claimed that artificial barriers on rivers could intercept a large number of microplastics during horizontal transportation due to weakened hydraulic conditions zhang et al 2015 however this study does not find that the presence of artificial barriers played a role in affecting the transportation of microplastics in the yangtze river the most prominent evidence is that the abundance of microplastics at site 16 downstream of the three gorges dam had not decreased although this may also be due to the emergence of new pollution sources downstream of the dam similarly weideman et al 2019 proposed that dams do not trap floating microplastics this means that the artificial barrier without a filtering device for microplastics cannot intercept the transportation of microplastics effectively which should be paid attention to in future projects distance decay relationship ddr analysis indicates that microplastic communities in different compartments of the watershed including the water sediment and soil are highly correlated with geographical distance fig 4 once entering the aquatic environment some high density microplastics of specific polymer types could be relatively easy to sediment in the lotic environment hence the microplastic communities in the river system might be influenced by geographical distance additionally co occurrence networks reveal that migration of microplastic communities in the watershed is dominant in water whereas neglect in sediment and soil fig 5 considering the limited transportation riverine sediments and soils may act as sinks of microplastics instead of transport pathways he et al 2021 overall pollution sources and hydrological factors contribute to the horizontal distribution and transportation of microplastics in the yangtze river rivers with large watersheds will receive microplastics from various point and nonpoint pollution sources as introduced by sewage and runoff and transport them to sink i e riverine sediments or marine environments at the action of hydrodynamics 4 3 migration of microplastic communities across different compartments the compositions of microplastic communities are significantly different between different compartments fig 4 a the most abundant of low densities microplastics such as pp and pe were observed in the water followed by the soils and the least in the sediments microplastics in sediments originate from the deposition of microplastics in water column over a relatively long period generally high density microplastics settle more easily while low density microplastics tend to be suspended in water sun et al 2021 however low density microplastics might also sink to the sediment when biofouling occurred van melkebeke et al 2020 through a simulation experiment hoellein et al 2019 observed that the settling rate of fragments in water was higher than that of fibers which was consistent with our field results i e the proportion of fragments in sediment was higher than that in water in this study microplastics in the sediments showed more prominent vertical migration than that in the soils the migration of microplastics between different layers of riverine sediments may be realized by frequent hydraulic fluctuations weber and opp 2020 the flowing river water may take away the microplastics from the surface of the sediment making the abundance of microplastic lower at the surface in soils leaching bioturbation and cultivation can affect the degradation and migration of microplastics but this migration rate is very slow cao et al 2021 rillig and lehmann 2020 microplastics in soils may be transported along with water runoff and soil erosion into adjacent rivers but this pathway has not been experimentally tested wetland plants may intercept plastic debris in surface runoff resulting in the decreased input of microplastics into the river helcoski et al 2020 the sizes of microplastics might be the key factors governing this process fig s7 suggests that grass and forest may help prevent the migration of large plastics from riparian soils to riverine sediments the proportion of small size microplastics in soils was lower than those in water and sediments possibly because smaller microplastics are more difficult to be intercepted by plants the distance decay relationships showed that the similarity between microplastic communities strengthen with the decrease of geographical distance fig 4 b d suggesting that the adjacent sampling sites have similar or shared pollution sources wang et al 2019 some drivers such as wildlife flood and air may lead to the migration and exchange of microplastics between adjacent locations rillig and lehmann 2020 rochman 2018 rochman and hoellein 2020 the similarity network of microplastic compositions indicates close associations between microplastic communities in different compartments fig 5 a node level topological features of the network demonstrate that the microplastic communities between adjacent sampling sites in water are most closely connected while the microplastic communities in sediments and soils are more scattered in the network fig 5 b c this implies that the microplastic communities in the yangtze river are prone to migrate through the water rather than the sediments and soils of the watershed notably the microplastic communities adjacent to large cities such as wuhan site 21 and shanghai site 36 occupy a more central position in the network this finding suggests that large cities in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river are pivotal nodes of microplastic pollution in the river thus should receive more attention in the prevention and control of microplastics in the future 4 4 future research prospects and policy recommendations to better remediate microplastic pollution involving riverine systems policy recommendations and future research prospects were proposed based our findings i there are different advantages of microplastic distribution in the three compartments of the yangtze river basin fig 6 a microplastics in the surface water are of low abundance aplenty fiber and high degree centrality microplastics in sediment are small in size colorful and of high diversity the highest abundance is observed in soils future studies should deepen the consideration of distinct sources and fates of microplastics in different compartments within the watershed system ii the relatively high abundance of microplastics in the estuarine area indicates that the river system act as an important pathway for microplastics from land to sea according to the runoff and sediment discharge of the yangtze river in 2019 it is preliminarily estimated that 1 22 1015 microplastic items 0 05 5 mm enter the sea through the water 97 54 of the total load and sediment 2 46 of the total load of the yangtze river in 2019 fig 6 b thus water management and wastewater treatment should be the top priority of microplastics mitigation in the yangtze river basin iii complex geographical and anthropogenic factors contribute to the prevalence of microplastics increasing from upstream to downstream reducing the deterioration of microplastic pollution caused by anthropogenic factors is an important measure for the prevention and control of microplastics microplastics in the yangtze river basin are related to land use strategies and microplastic pollution around grass and forest decreases significantly planting green on the river banks near densely populated areas therefore is expected to effectively intercept and reduce the river microplastics from land sources iv the vertical migration of microplastics at the watershed scale is worthy of attention although small microplastics are more prone to sedimentation the vertical migration of microplastics in sediments and soils showed different patterns microplastics in sediments tend to migrate deeper but not in soils sedimental microplastics may pose an environmental risk particularly to benthos due to the deposition of a large number of small microplastics thus it is necessary to further study the potential impact of sedimental microplastics on benthic ecosystems v community analysis shows close associations of the microplastic communities in different environmental compartments these associations suggest the migration and transport of microplastics among different compartments and locations providing field based evidence for the concept of the plastic cycle bank and hansson 2019 rochman and hoellein 2020 beside results of the network of microplastic communities indicate that the major cities in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river such as wuhan and shanghai could play a significant role in remediating microplastic pollution in the yangtze river basin vi a more efficient plastic monitoring at a global scale is needed to better understand the drivers and impacts of microplastic pollution bank et al 2021 meanwhile the application of community analysis method to study the environmental fate of microplastics is advocated the ultimate way to remediate microplastic pollution is to minimize plastic consumption optimize waste management and seek alternative products which requires unremitting efforts by managers scientists as well as the publics 5 conclusions our research shows microplastics are universal and heterogeneous in the yangtze river basin and are transported over long distances in the river extending to the ocean domestic wastewater fishery activities and surface runoff may be the main sources of microplastics in the yangtze river basin complex geographical and anthropogenic factors contributed to the prevalence of microplastics increased from upstream to downstream although the abundances of microplastics in riverine sediments and soils are much higher than that in water microplastics tend to be transported to the ocean through the water rather than riverine sediments and soils sedimental microplastics showed a high ecological risk due to their small size and high vertical mobility the density and size of microplastics may be the key factors affecting the migration of microplastics in different compartments additionally community analyses on microplastic polymers were introduced and highlighted in this study that showed high potentials for future microplastic research microplastic communities in different environmental compartments were significantly different and highly correlated with geographical distance the major cities at the middle and lower reaches were considered pivotal nodes of microplastic pollution in the yangtze river basin thus should receive more attention in the prevention and control of microplastics in the future finally we suggest paying attention to the distinct sources and fates of microplastics in different compartments within the watershed system and taking water management and wastewater treatment as the primary task of microplastics mitigation in large rivers declaration of competing interest the

16361,preoxidation ultrafiltration process is an effective method for fe2 and mn2 removal in which fe2 mn2 are firstly oxidized to feox mnox then collected by the ultrafiltration membrane however the simultaneous presence of fe2 mn2 and organics in feed can cause severe membrane fouling which inhibits the overall performance of this method prominently in this study a novel feox mnox h2o2 membrane cleaning method is proposed based on the idea of turning in situ generated membrane foulants i e feox mnox into the catalysts for membrane cleaning the results demonstrate that the feox mnox h2o2 system can achieve more than 95 membrane flux recovery and remove almost all irreversible membrane foulants within only 5 min and with only 0 5 w t h2o2 solution the outstanding performance of the system is mainly attributed to the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 to generate both highly reactive radicals such as hydroxyl radicals oh and abundant oxygen in addition when the membrane is loaded by only mnox polyaluminium chloride pac as the coagulator demonstrates prominent influence on the performance of membrane cleaning however pac makes almost no contribution to membrane cleaning when the membrane is loaded by feox this is because coagulation induced by pac exerts more prominent impact on the particle size distribution of mnox than that of feox in conclusion the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 by in situ generated feox mnox is a promising advanced oxidation process to achieve outstanding membrane cleaning performance under the condition of low h2o2 concentration and no extra dosage of catalysts the novel membrane cleaning system exhibits high potential for the practical membrane treatment processes to treat water with high contents of fe and mn graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane fouling membrane cleaning feox mnox 1 introduction despite many advantages and increasingly employments of ultrafiltration uf process the membrane performance has always been hampered by membrane fouling due to cake layer formation and membrane pore blocking tang et al 2021a in view of this membrane cleaning is applied to remove the foulants and restore the membrane flux a number of chemical techniques have been used for removing the irreversible membrane foulants that physical cleaning is not sufficient to cope with liu et al 2018a however most of the chemical cleaning methods recover the membrane flux by soaking the membrane module in highly concentrated chemical solution for long period of time which would deteriorate the membrane material and interrupt the water treatment process to solve this problem researchers have developed some moderate and efficient membrane cleaning methods based on the advanced oxidation process aop such as h2o2 mno2 membrane cleaning system he et al 2019 the free radicals produced during aop could be used to decompose organic pollutants effectively and perform efficient physiochemical membrane cleaning li et al 2020 however the dosage of extra catalysts such as mno2 particles for membrane cleaning is still inconvenient in practice the excessive presence of fe2 and mn2 in water can affect the esthetic quality of drinking water and even pose a threat to the safety of human health ramachandran et al 2021 yang et al 2020 however fe and mn concentration often exceed the safety thresholds in waste water and natural water especially for groundwater tang et al 2021b to address these problems many methods have been proposed such as natural oxidation by aeration chemical oxidation by chlorine oxidation process immobilization of iron and manganese oxidizing bacteria with a biofilm forming bacterium biological roughing up flow filtration technology and rapid filter cheng et al 2020c wang et al 2021 yang et al 2020 among them preoxidation filtration is utilized most widely in which fe2 and mn2 are firstly converted into oxide particles feox and mnox by pre oxidation and then removed by the subsequent membrane filtration or bed filtration cheng et al 2020c during long term membrane filtration the simultaneous accumulation of feox mnox and other foulants inside the membrane pores or on the membrane surface exactly exert new problems of membrane fouling choo et al 2005 such membrane fouling is usually difficult to be removed by regularly physical cleaning methods such as air washing and backwashing which will cause severely irreversible membrane flux loss and increase the operation cost of uf process in practical application chen et al 2017 inspired by recent membrane cleaning methods based on aop and the conventional water treatment processes to remove fe and mn in this study we propose a new membrane cleaning system by utilizing feox and mnox which are in situ generated by pre oxidation and collected on the membrane by adding small amount of h2o2 the particles of feox and mnox can initiate the fenton like reaction for effective membrane cleaning to our best knowledge this is the first attempt to utilize the common membrane foulants feox mnox as the valuable reagents for membrane cleaning 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials in this study the feed water was prepared by dissolving the solid ferrous sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o and manganese sulfate tetrahydrate mnso4 4h2o in milli q water with a resistivity of 18 mω meanwhile humic acid ha was chosen as the representative organic foulants to load the membrane ha solution with an initial concentration of 6 1 mg l was prepared by dissolving solid ha in milli q water at ph 9 adjusted by sodium hydroxide concentrations of ha fe2 and mn2 in feed water were all within the normal range of groundwater the key characteristics of feed water were listed in table 1 sodium hypochlorite naclo sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and polyaluminium chloride pac which were utilized for pre oxidation ph adjustment and coagulation respectively reagents used in the experiments were all analytical grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china they are directly used in the experiments without further purification polyether sulfone pes membranes with a nominal molecular weight cut off mwco of 30 kda and effective filtration area of 32 15cm2 were employed in the water treatment system mosu science equipment co ltd shanghai all membranes were soaked in milli q water for 24 h before use to remove the protective liquids 2 2 experimental setup as shown in fig 1 the experimental setup was designed based on conventional water treatment processes for fe and mn it mainly consisted of four steps pre oxidation ph adjustment coagulation and uf membrane filtration noted as step a to d in fig 1 in the pre oxidation step dissolved fe 3 mg l or mn 1 mg l were oxidized to higher oxidation state by naclo 2 mg l then ph was adjusted to 8 by nahco3 which was favorable to coagulation and prevented ph drop the step of coagulation by pac 40 mg l led to the increase of flocs size and density to facilitate the effective collection of them by the subsequent filtration process to investigate the contribution of coagulation on the removal of fe and mn experiments without pac addition were also carried out by the same experimental setup all samples were collected when the system had been adjusted to stable condition especially at the step of ultrafiltration the filtration experiments were conducted under dead end filtration mode with the trans membrane pressure tmp being remained at 0 1 mpa and the permeate was continuously collected and weighted by a digital balance prior to ultrafiltration of feed water the new membrane was immersed in milli q water for about 12 h the membrane flux was calculated based on the collected permeate volume time interval for filtration and effective membrane area in details firstly the initial stable membrane flux j 0 was determined by preliminary filtration tests of clean membrane with milli q water for at least 20 min then the membrane was loaded by feed continually for about 8 0 h at the end of the fouling experiment permeate flux of the fouled membrane was measured again by milli q water after that the fouled membrane was rinsed with milli q water completely to remove reversible membrane fouling then the chemical membrane cleaning procedures was conducted the membrane was immersed into 90 ml h2o2 solution 0 5 w t for 5 min subsequently it was taken out and washed by milli q water again to remove residual h2o2 from membrane surface finally the washed membrane was subjected to filtration with milli q water 20 min to obtain the flux after membrane washing j w the membrane cleaning efficiency r w could be calculated as follows 1 r w j w j 0 100 beside at the initial stage of filtration the first 40 ml permeate was collected to test the ha filtration efficiency by clean membrane then at the end of filtration the final 40 ml permeate was also collected to test the filtration efficiency of ha by the fouled membrane finally the washed membrane was utilized to filtrate the feed again to obtain the ha filtration efficiency by it all filtration experiments were conducted under the same condition for three times at least see table s1 for details the detailed expressions for the ratios of membrane flux the resistance in series model and filtration efficiency of ha were all listed in the text s1 2 3 analytical techniques total fe and mn concentrations were measured with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes periknelmer 8300010403 prior to the analysis particulate fe and mn were dissolved using heat and acid digestion method triplicate analyses were performed on each sample and the average concentrations were calculated total organic carbon toc of ha was measured by a toc analyzer apg basisgerat analytik jena ag the membrane surface morphology before and after membrane cleaning was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 200feg fei and atomic force microscopy afm bioscope resolution 030118 bruker the free radicals were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance epr elexsys ii e560 bruker spectroscopy utilizing 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as spin trapping agent see text s2 for details structural changes of the ha caused by the free radicals were further tested by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher measurements were conducted by the esclab 250xi spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic al ka x ray source to analyze the chemical state of membrane foulants the x ray diffraction xrd x pert pro panalytical holland patterns were examined with cu kα radiation source to determine the crystal degrees for feox and mnox the marvin laser particle size analyzer mastersizer2000 was used to determine the particle size distributions of feox mnox and their corresponding flocs after the coagulation step by pac to characterize the different morphologies of feox mnox and the changes of them caused by pac transmission electron microscopy tem jem1400010101 was also used 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of pollutants removal by the water treatment processes in order to evaluate the feasibility of the applied integrated water treatment processes treatment tests with feed water containing 3 0 mg l fe2 1 0 mg l mn2 and 6 1 mg l ha were conducted firstly the performance of fe and mn removal by each step were presented separately in fig 2 a it was shown that more than 90 of fe and mn in feed water could be removed by the integrated treatment processes the residual fe and mn concentrations were fulfilled with who guidelines for drinking water quality fe 0 3 mg l mn 0 1 mg l el araby et al 2009 for ha removal fig 2b demonstrated that the existence of fe mn and pac in feed could promote the ha removal by both clean and fouled membranes for the case of ha fe mn it could be seen that the presence of fe and mn promoted the removal of ha by uf this might be contributed to the complexation among fe mn and ha which enhanced collection of ha on the filtration cake dashtban kenari and barbeau 2016 furthermore the gradual accumulation of fe and mn on membrane surface further promoted the growth of filtration cake through bridging effect tang et al 2021b beside previous studies also found that the electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange between ha and metal oxide surfaces could lead to the strong adsorption capacity of pre oxidized feox mnox to ha resulting in the higher filtration efficiency of ha boguta et al 2019 kong et al 2014 for the case of ha fe mn pac the experimental results indicated that ha retention by uf was further enhanced owing to the existence of pac this was because pac could inhibit the electrostatic repulsion among the negatively charged active functional groups of ha prominently leading to the formation of more stable flocs which were easier to be retained by the membrane wang et al 2009 3 2 effects of fe and mn on membrane fouling and cleaning 3 2 1 changes in membrane flux membrane resistance and contact angle although fe and mn are commonly co existing in natural water they were further studied separately to better assess their influences on membrane fouling and cleaning fig 3 illustrated the influences of fe and mn on membrane fouling and cleaning by the comparison of membrane flux recovery fig 3a and membrane resistance fig 3b at the same time effects of pac on membrane cleaning efficiency fig 3c and irreversible membrane resistance fig 3d were also studied for the cases of ha fe and ha fe mn the membrane flux was increased from 20 25 to 93 98 after chemical cleaning and the irreversible membrane resistance was greatly reduced for the case of ha mn the irreversible membrane fouling being removed was slightly lower compared with those containing fe it may be related to the amount of mnox deposited on membrane and the valence of mn which will be discussed in the following section detailedly in contrast the case of ha alone demonstrated almost no membrane cleaning capacity indicating that feox and mnox contributed prominently to the membrane cleaning process fig 3c indicated that pac exhibited distinct impact on membrane flux recovery and membrane resistance for the case of ha mn the membrane cleaning efficiency for the case of ha mn pac was greatly higher than that of ha mn however pac had little influence on membrane cleaning efficiency for the cases of ha fe and ha fe mn similar trends could also be observed for the membrane resistance shown in fig 3d in details about 92 and 98 of the irreversible membrane fouling could be removed by chemical cleaning for the cases of ha fe pac and ha fe mn pac respectively which were slightly higher than that of ha mn pac 80 by contrast when pac was not added the removal efficiency of irreversible membrane resistance for the case of ha mn was as low as that of ha alone in which almost no irreversible fouling was removed the results revealed that pac could greatly increase the membrane flux recovery when mnox alone was used for chemical cleaning of fouled membrane however for the case of ha fe and ha fe mn the membrane flux recovery was hardly improved by adding pac the contact angle measurements were further utilized to investigate the characteristics of fouled and washed membranes as shown in table s2 for the cases of ha fe pac ha mn pac ha fe mn pac there were no obvious changes between the clean and washed membranes which verified the efficient membrane cleaning by feox mnox it should be noticed that fouled membranes with ha fe pac ha mn pac ha fe mn pac were more hydrophilic than that with ha pac alone resulting from the electrostatic interaction and coordination among fe mn and ha the hydrophilic foulants are easier to be removed from hydrophobic pes membranes 3 2 2 feasibility of the cleaning method to test the feasibility of this cleaning method 6 consecutive membrane fouling and cleaning experiments were carried out for the case of ha fe mn pac and the results were shown in fig 4 it could be seen in fig 4a that during consecutive membrane fouling and cleaning processes the flux recovery ratio could be always maintained at about 95 and the filtration efficiency of ha kept stable and comparable with the original membrane beside as shown in fig 4b and c the removal efficiencies of both fe and mn were always above 95 the relatively stable results indicated that this cleaning method demonstrated negligible impacts on the characteristics of membrane implying the feasibility of it in practice 3 2 3 microscopic analyses of membrane structure above experimental results demonstrated that feox and mnox deposited on membranes were effective catalysts for h2o2 which could effectively restore membrane flux and alleviate almost irreversible membrane resistance this could be further verified by comparing the micro scale changes of membrane surface before and after the chemical cleaning fig 5 demonstrated the sem images for the case of ha fe mn pac it could be seen from fig 5b that the irreversible foulants including organic substances has and inorganic substances feox mnox within the gel layer or membrane pores could not be easily removed by the physical cleaning method with water flushing while as shown in fig 5c by chemical cleaning with 0 5 h2o2 for 5 min most of the irreversible foulants were removed and the membrane surface was restored nearly the same as that of the clean membrane fig 5a the fouled and washed membranes for the cases of ha fe pac and ha mn pac also demonstrated similar results and were shown in fig s8 fig s9 and table s3 illustrated the afm results over a membrane area of 5 µm 5 µm the clean membrane showed the lowest roughness with rq ra of 8 28 2 5 3 27 2 3 nm in comparison a much higher roughness of 169 12 1 130 10 4 nm was observed for the fouled membrane which confirmed the formation of cake layer after washing by h2o2 the washed membranes possessed similar roughness of 16 6 3 3 13 1 2 6 nm to the clean one indicating the outstanding performance of the cleaning method which was consistent with the results of sem images 3 2 4 proposed mechanisms for membrane cleaning to identify the occurrence of free radicals in feox mnox h2o2 system the epr test with dmpo as spin trapping agent fig 6 a and quenching experiments with tba as free radical scavengers fig 6b were conducted for epr test it could be seen that no distinct signal was detected for h2o2 alone while the strong signal of dmpo oh adduct with αn αh 14 9 g appeared in feox mnox h2o2 system the signal is generally corresponded to the signature of hydroxyl radicals oh liu et al 2021 however previous studies indicated that the unique reaction between high valence metals e g fe iv wang et al 2018 and mn vii xu et al 2017 and water could also result in the formation of dmpo oh adducts jing and chaplin 2017 to make it clear tba was involved as the scavenger for oh k oh tba 3 8 to 7 6 108m 1 s 1 he et al 2020 as shown in fig 6a the intensity of dmpo oh disappeared with the addition of tba indicating that oh rather than the high valence metals dominated the generation of dmpo oh this also implied that there was neither high valence fe iv nor mn vii formed by the pre oxidation step the conclusion was also supported by the quenching experiments as depicted in fig 6b tba could lead to prominent inhibition on membrane flux recovery confirming the contribution of oh to the removal of irreversible membrane resistance the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 on the surface of feox and mnox was complicated the main possible reactions were listed as follows biswas and pal 2020 cao et al 2020 fischbacher et al 2017 fe iii h 2 o 2 fe ii h o 2 h fe ii h 2 o 2 h fe iii oh h 2 o mn iii h 2 o 2 oh o h mn iv oh h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 2 o h o 2 mn iv o 2 h mn iii where fe ii and mn iii represented the active intermediate state of feox and mnox to activate and transfer oh produced from h2o2 as shown in the above reactions oh were the main oxidizing species generated in the system it was reported that oh in h2o2 mno2 system could cause structural changes of ha during membrane cleaning process he et al 2019 in this study ftir spectra of ha before and after the reactions in feox mnox h2o2 system were compared to verify the functional group changes of ha as shown in fig 7 the reactions prominently reduced the intensities of typical hydrophobic groups such as the peak at about 1400 cm 1 representing the c h deformation of aliphatic and ch3 groups yu et al 2005 and between 600 and 700 cm 1 representing c h out of plane deformation fukushima et al 2001 nevertheless the typical hydrophilic groups such as c o stretching vibration of carboxylic acids and esters at about 1600 cm 1 kanokkantapong et al 2006 and o h groups of alcohols phenols and organic acids at about 3360 cm 1 yu et al 2005 were still remained after reactions the results indicated that has became more hydrophilic after membrane cleaning by feox mnox h2o2 system which were easier to be removed from the hydrophobic membrane surface 3 3 pac influence on membrane cleaning process 3 3 1 pac influence on recovery efficiency of membrane flux above experimental results indicated that pac exhibited little influence on the membrane flux recovery for the cases of ha fe and ha fe mn but demonstrated prominent impact on the case of ha mn to explore the reasons concentrations of fe and mn in feed and permeate w o pac were analyzed by icp oes as shown in fig 8 for the case of ha mn the addition of pac presented notable promotion on mn removal by membrane filtration step d due to that the bridging effect between mnox and pac assisted the accumulation of complexes on the membrane cheng et al 2020b naceradska et al 2017 it should be noted that more mnox collected on membrane meant more dramatic catalytic decomposition of h2o2 for membrane cleaning that is the reason why pac could influence the performance of membrane cleaning remarkably for the case of ha mn on the contrary the removal of fe by membrane filtration step d showed almost no change w o pac for the case of ha fe so pac demonstrated almost no influence on membrane cleaning under this condition in order to investigate the reasons why pac exhibited opposite influences on the removal of fe and mn by membrane filtration the particle size analysis was further used to explore the changes of particle size distribution of feox and mnox caused by pac it has been well known that pac as the coagulator can destabilize the particles by reducing the negative charge on the surface of the particles resulting in the formation of flocs with large size to facilitate the separation of them from water yan et al 2008 as shown in fig 9 the average particle sizes of mnox and feox without pac addition were 18 μm and 72 μm respectively the distinct difference of particle size between them accounted for the results shown in fig 8 that most of feox particles could be collected on membrane however for mnox a substantial portion of small sized mnox could permeate through the membrane by adding pac as the coagulator the average particle size of mnox was enhanced greatly from 18 μm to 116 μm however the average particle size of feox which had already been as large as 72 μm after the step of pre oxidation was only further increased to 121 μm by pac addition the results demonstrated that coagulation induced by pac exhibited much more influence on the particle size distribution of mnox than that of feox and it was necessary to add pac to increase the average particle size of mnox in practice with the increase of particle size the mn retention rate by pes membrane was increased which led to the prominent promotion of the membrane flux recovery by membrane cleaning step for the case of ha mn however pac demonstrated relatively less effect on the average particle size of feox actually most of feox could be retained by the membrane even without pac so pac contributed slightly for the membrane flux recovery by membrane cleaning step for the case of ha fe 3 3 2 characterization of membrane foulants in order to better observe the pac influence on foulants morphology sem images of membrane surface fouled by ha mn ha fe and ha fe mn without pac fig 10 a c or with pac fig 10g i were compared with each other the corresponding foulants were also collected separately for further characterization by tem fig 10 d f j l for the cases without pac foulants on membrane surface showed different morphologies as shown in fig 10a sem and d tem the ha mn flocs were loose with fragmented edges and can form compact filtration cake when being collected on the membrane in contrast the ha fe foulants exhibited clear shape fig 10e and the foulants collected on the membrane surface demonstrated relatively separated structure as fig 10b the morphology of ha fe mn foulants collected on membrane showed similar compact morphology with ha fe fig 10c while its edges were more rounded fig 10f for comparison the ha mn pac foulants on membrane surface were much denser fig 10g and j however as shown in fig 10h and k the morphology of ha fe pac foulants on membrane surface showed neglected changes compared to the case without pac which demonstrated that pac might have little effect on the physiochemical properties of ha fe foulants ha mn flocs with rougher and unshaped fine morphology might have larger specific surface area than ha fe with the needle shaped crystal combined with the particle size analysis of flocs shown in fig 9 it could be deduced that the large specific surface area of ha mn flocs could provide more surface to coagulate with pac leading to the great extension of the average particle size in the step of coagulation cheng et al 2020a 2020b to clarify the chemical states of feox and mnox deposited on the membrane surface fe 2p and mn 2p were further investigated by the high resolution xps spectra the respective binding energy of fe 2p 3 2 and fe 2p 1 2 being located at 711 ev and 724 4 ev and the distinguishable high satellite peak observed at 718 8 ev and 732 5 ev which did not overlap either the fe 2p 3 2 or fe 2p 1 2 peaks confirmed the presence of fe3 from fe2o3 fig 11 a tan 2016 the deconvoluted mn 2p spectrum fig 11b showed doublet peaks at 641 5 ev mn 2p 3 2 and 653 3 ev mn 2p 1 2 confirming the existence of mn3 in mn2o3 and the spin energy separation between the two peaks 11 7 ev also belonged to mn2o3 nagamuthu and ryu 2019 shao et al 2017 furthermore mn 2p 3 2 was shifted to a higher binding energy of 642 2 ev indicating the formation of mn4 guo et al 2019 lu et al 2020 xps spectra showed that fe ii was completely oxidized to fe iii while the oxidation of mn ii was not complete only part of them were oxidized to mn iv the degrees of crystallinity for feox and mnox were also different fig 11c displayed that feox exhibited better crystallinity which was well corresponded to fe2o3 while mnox in fig 11d showed lower peak intensities and weaker crystallinity lu et al 2020 the amorphous mnox might provide more active sites liu et al 2018b which was beneficial to the coagulation process so the particle size of mnox could be increased more than that of feox 4 conclusion in this study the common membrane foulants feox mnox was utilized as the in situ membrane cleaning catalysts for the first time the novel membrane cleaning method could achieve above 95 membrane flux recovery and remove almost irreversible membrane foulants under the condition of low chemical dosage and short washing time the outstanding membrane cleaning performance was mainly attributed to the simultaneous generation of active species oh and oxygen bubbles beside the coagulator pac played an important role on the membrane cleaning performance by mnox while it exhibited nearly no promotion on that by feox this might be due to the different degrees of crystallinity for feox and mnox the amorphous mnox was more favorable to coagulate with pac than feox with higher crystallinity resulting in the more enhancement of its mean particle size by coagulation conclusively the feox mnox h2o2 system proposed a new membrane cleaning method by taking advantage of the in situ formed membrane foulants with the advantages of no extra catalysts dosage low concentration of h2o2 demanded short membrane washing time and outstanding performance of membrane cleaning the feox mnox h2o2 system demonstrated high potential for practical application in the membrane treatment process for water containing fe and mn moreover as the first attempt to transfer membrane foulants into useful catalysts this study proposed a new way to reduce the cost of membrane cleaning process and more following researches are expected in this direction for example to investigate whether this cleaning system is also an effective strategy for the practical decentralized water supply the ceramic membranes and hollow fiber membranes used for the filtration of iron and manganese containing water are need to be tested in addition follow up researches are also needed to test whether different types of coagulants will exert various

sodium hydroxide concentrations of ha fe2 and mn2 in feed water were all within the normal range of groundwater the key characteristics of feed water were listed in table 1 sodium hypochlorite naclo sodium bicarbonate nahco3 and polyaluminium chloride pac which were utilized for pre oxidation ph adjustment and coagulation respectively reagents used in the experiments were all analytical grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china they are directly used in the experiments without further purification polyether sulfone pes membranes with a nominal molecular weight cut off mwco of 30 kda and effective filtration area of 32 15cm2 were employed in the water treatment system mosu science equipment co ltd shanghai all membranes were soaked in milli q water for 24 h before use to remove the protective liquids 2 2 experimental setup as shown in fig 1 the experimental setup was designed based on conventional water treatment processes for fe and mn it mainly consisted of four steps pre oxidation ph adjustment coagulation and uf membrane filtration noted as step a to d in fig 1 in the pre oxidation step dissolved fe 3 mg l or mn 1 mg l were oxidized to higher oxidation state by naclo 2 mg l then ph was adjusted to 8 by nahco3 which was favorable to coagulation and prevented ph drop the step of coagulation by pac 40 mg l led to the increase of flocs size and density to facilitate the effective collection of them by the subsequent filtration process to investigate the contribution of coagulation on the removal of fe and mn experiments without pac addition were also carried out by the same experimental setup all samples were collected when the system had been adjusted to stable condition especially at the step of ultrafiltration the filtration experiments were conducted under dead end filtration mode with the trans membrane pressure tmp being remained at 0 1 mpa and the permeate was continuously collected and weighted by a digital balance prior to ultrafiltration of feed water the new membrane was immersed in milli q water for about 12 h the membrane flux was calculated based on the collected permeate volume time interval for filtration and effective membrane area in details firstly the initial stable membrane flux j 0 was determined by preliminary filtration tests of clean membrane with milli q water for at least 20 min then the membrane was loaded by feed continually for about 8 0 h at the end of the fouling experiment permeate flux of the fouled membrane was measured again by milli q water after that the fouled membrane was rinsed with milli q water completely to remove reversible membrane fouling then the chemical membrane cleaning procedures was conducted the membrane was immersed into 90 ml h2o2 solution 0 5 w t for 5 min subsequently it was taken out and washed by milli q water again to remove residual h2o2 from membrane surface finally the washed membrane was subjected to filtration with milli q water 20 min to obtain the flux after membrane washing j w the membrane cleaning efficiency r w could be calculated as follows 1 r w j w j 0 100 beside at the initial stage of filtration the first 40 ml permeate was collected to test the ha filtration efficiency by clean membrane then at the end of filtration the final 40 ml permeate was also collected to test the filtration efficiency of ha by the fouled membrane finally the washed membrane was utilized to filtrate the feed again to obtain the ha filtration efficiency by it all filtration experiments were conducted under the same condition for three times at least see table s1 for details the detailed expressions for the ratios of membrane flux the resistance in series model and filtration efficiency of ha were all listed in the text s1 2 3 analytical techniques total fe and mn concentrations were measured with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes periknelmer 8300010403 prior to the analysis particulate fe and mn were dissolved using heat and acid digestion method triplicate analyses were performed on each sample and the average concentrations were calculated total organic carbon toc of ha was measured by a toc analyzer apg basisgerat analytik jena ag the membrane surface morphology before and after membrane cleaning was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 200feg fei and atomic force microscopy afm bioscope resolution 030118 bruker the free radicals were characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance epr elexsys ii e560 bruker spectroscopy utilizing 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as spin trapping agent see text s2 for details structural changes of the ha caused by the free radicals were further tested by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher measurements were conducted by the esclab 250xi spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic al ka x ray source to analyze the chemical state of membrane foulants the x ray diffraction xrd x pert pro panalytical holland patterns were examined with cu kα radiation source to determine the crystal degrees for feox and mnox the marvin laser particle size analyzer mastersizer2000 was used to determine the particle size distributions of feox mnox and their corresponding flocs after the coagulation step by pac to characterize the different morphologies of feox mnox and the changes of them caused by pac transmission electron microscopy tem jem1400010101 was also used 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of pollutants removal by the water treatment processes in order to evaluate the feasibility of the applied integrated water treatment processes treatment tests with feed water containing 3 0 mg l fe2 1 0 mg l mn2 and 6 1 mg l ha were conducted firstly the performance of fe and mn removal by each step were presented separately in fig 2 a it was shown that more than 90 of fe and mn in feed water could be removed by the integrated treatment processes the residual fe and mn concentrations were fulfilled with who guidelines for drinking water quality fe 0 3 mg l mn 0 1 mg l el araby et al 2009 for ha removal fig 2b demonstrated that the existence of fe mn and pac in feed could promote the ha removal by both clean and fouled membranes for the case of ha fe mn it could be seen that the presence of fe and mn promoted the removal of ha by uf this might be contributed to the complexation among fe mn and ha which enhanced collection of ha on the filtration cake dashtban kenari and barbeau 2016 furthermore the gradual accumulation of fe and mn on membrane surface further promoted the growth of filtration cake through bridging effect tang et al 2021b beside previous studies also found that the electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange between ha and metal oxide surfaces could lead to the strong adsorption capacity of pre oxidized feox mnox to ha resulting in the higher filtration efficiency of ha boguta et al 2019 kong et al 2014 for the case of ha fe mn pac the experimental results indicated that ha retention by uf was further enhanced owing to the existence of pac this was because pac could inhibit the electrostatic repulsion among the negatively charged active functional groups of ha prominently leading to the formation of more stable flocs which were easier to be retained by the membrane wang et al 2009 3 2 effects of fe and mn on membrane fouling and cleaning 3 2 1 changes in membrane flux membrane resistance and contact angle although fe and mn are commonly co existing in natural water they were further studied separately to better assess their influences on membrane fouling and cleaning fig 3 illustrated the influences of fe and mn on membrane fouling and cleaning by the comparison of membrane flux recovery fig 3a and membrane resistance fig 3b at the same time effects of pac on membrane cleaning efficiency fig 3c and irreversible membrane resistance fig 3d were also studied for the cases of ha fe and ha fe mn the membrane flux was increased from 20 25 to 93 98 after chemical cleaning and the irreversible membrane resistance was greatly reduced for the case of ha mn the irreversible membrane fouling being removed was slightly lower compared with those containing fe it may be related to the amount of mnox deposited on membrane and the valence of mn which will be discussed in the following section detailedly in contrast the case of ha alone demonstrated almost no membrane cleaning capacity indicating that feox and mnox contributed prominently to the membrane cleaning process fig 3c indicated that pac exhibited distinct impact on membrane flux recovery and membrane resistance for the case of ha mn the membrane cleaning efficiency for the case of ha mn pac was greatly higher than that of ha mn however pac had little influence on membrane cleaning efficiency for the cases of ha fe and ha fe mn similar trends could also be observed for the membrane resistance shown in fig 3d in details about 92 and 98 of the irreversible membrane fouling could be removed by chemical cleaning for the cases of ha fe pac and ha fe mn pac respectively which were slightly higher than that of ha mn pac 80 by contrast when pac was not added the removal efficiency of irreversible membrane resistance for the case of ha mn was as low as that of ha alone in which almost no irreversible fouling was removed the results revealed that pac could greatly increase the membrane flux recovery when mnox alone was used for chemical cleaning of fouled membrane however for the case of ha fe and ha fe mn the membrane flux recovery was hardly improved by adding pac the contact angle measurements were further utilized to investigate the characteristics of fouled and washed membranes as shown in table s2 for the cases of ha fe pac ha mn pac ha fe mn pac there were no obvious changes between the clean and washed membranes which verified the efficient membrane cleaning by feox mnox it should be noticed that fouled membranes with ha fe pac ha mn pac ha fe mn pac were more hydrophilic than that with ha pac alone resulting from the electrostatic interaction and coordination among fe mn and ha the hydrophilic foulants are easier to be removed from hydrophobic pes membranes 3 2 2 feasibility of the cleaning method to test the feasibility of this cleaning method 6 consecutive membrane fouling and cleaning experiments were carried out for the case of ha fe mn pac and the results were shown in fig 4 it could be seen in fig 4a that during consecutive membrane fouling and cleaning processes the flux recovery ratio could be always maintained at about 95 and the filtration efficiency of ha kept stable and comparable with the original membrane beside as shown in fig 4b and c the removal efficiencies of both fe and mn were always above 95 the relatively stable results indicated that this cleaning method demonstrated negligible impacts on the characteristics of membrane implying the feasibility of it in practice 3 2 3 microscopic analyses of membrane structure above experimental results demonstrated that feox and mnox deposited on membranes were effective catalysts for h2o2 which could effectively restore membrane flux and alleviate almost irreversible membrane resistance this could be further verified by comparing the micro scale changes of membrane surface before and after the chemical cleaning fig 5 demonstrated the sem images for the case of ha fe mn pac it could be seen from fig 5b that the irreversible foulants including organic substances has and inorganic substances feox mnox within the gel layer or membrane pores could not be easily removed by the physical cleaning method with water flushing while as shown in fig 5c by chemical cleaning with 0 5 h2o2 for 5 min most of the irreversible foulants were removed and the membrane surface was restored nearly the same as that of the clean membrane fig 5a the fouled and washed membranes for the cases of ha fe pac and ha mn pac also demonstrated similar results and were shown in fig s8 fig s9 and table s3 illustrated the afm results over a membrane area of 5 µm 5 µm the clean membrane showed the lowest roughness with rq ra of 8 28 2 5 3 27 2 3 nm in comparison a much higher roughness of 169 12 1 130 10 4 nm was observed for the fouled membrane which confirmed the formation of cake layer after washing by h2o2 the washed membranes possessed similar roughness of 16 6 3 3 13 1 2 6 nm to the clean one indicating the outstanding performance of the cleaning method which was consistent with the results of sem images 3 2 4 proposed mechanisms for membrane cleaning to identify the occurrence of free radicals in feox mnox h2o2 system the epr test with dmpo as spin trapping agent fig 6 a and quenching experiments with tba as free radical scavengers fig 6b were conducted for epr test it could be seen that no distinct signal was detected for h2o2 alone while the strong signal of dmpo oh adduct with αn αh 14 9 g appeared in feox mnox h2o2 system the signal is generally corresponded to the signature of hydroxyl radicals oh liu et al 2021 however previous studies indicated that the unique reaction between high valence metals e g fe iv wang et al 2018 and mn vii xu et al 2017 and water could also result in the formation of dmpo oh adducts jing and chaplin 2017 to make it clear tba was involved as the scavenger for oh k oh tba 3 8 to 7 6 108m 1 s 1 he et al 2020 as shown in fig 6a the intensity of dmpo oh disappeared with the addition of tba indicating that oh rather than the high valence metals dominated the generation of dmpo oh this also implied that there was neither high valence fe iv nor mn vii formed by the pre oxidation step the conclusion was also supported by the quenching experiments as depicted in fig 6b tba could lead to prominent inhibition on membrane flux recovery confirming the contribution of oh to the removal of irreversible membrane resistance the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 on the surface of feox and mnox was complicated the main possible reactions were listed as follows biswas and pal 2020 cao et al 2020 fischbacher et al 2017 fe iii h 2 o 2 fe ii h o 2 h fe ii h 2 o 2 h fe iii oh h 2 o mn iii h 2 o 2 oh o h mn iv oh h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 2 o h o 2 mn iv o 2 h mn iii where fe ii and mn iii represented the active intermediate state of feox and mnox to activate and transfer oh produced from h2o2 as shown in the above reactions oh were the main oxidizing species generated in the system it was reported that oh in h2o2 mno2 system could cause structural changes of ha during membrane cleaning process he et al 2019 in this study ftir spectra of ha before and after the reactions in feox mnox h2o2 system were compared to verify the functional group changes of ha as shown in fig 7 the reactions prominently reduced the intensities of typical hydrophobic groups such as the peak at about 1400 cm 1 representing the c h deformation of aliphatic and ch3 groups yu et al 2005 and between 600 and 700 cm 1 representing c h out of plane deformation fukushima et al 2001 nevertheless the typical hydrophilic groups such as c o stretching vibration of carboxylic acids and esters at about 1600 cm 1 kanokkantapong et al 2006 and o h groups of alcohols phenols and organic acids at about 3360 cm 1 yu et al 2005 were still remained after reactions the results indicated that has became more hydrophilic after membrane cleaning by feox mnox h2o2 system which were easier to be removed from the hydrophobic membrane surface 3 3 pac influence on membrane cleaning process 3 3 1 pac influence on recovery efficiency of membrane flux above experimental results indicated that pac exhibited little influence on the membrane flux recovery for the cases of ha fe and ha fe mn but demonstrated prominent impact on the case of ha mn to explore the reasons concentrations of fe and mn in feed and permeate w o pac were analyzed by icp oes as shown in fig 8 for the case of ha mn the addition of pac presented notable promotion on mn removal by membrane filtration step d due to that the bridging effect between mnox and pac assisted the accumulation of complexes on the membrane cheng et al 2020b naceradska et al 2017 it should be noted that more mnox collected on membrane meant more dramatic catalytic decomposition of h2o2 for membrane cleaning that is the reason why pac could influence the performance of membrane cleaning remarkably for the case of ha mn on the contrary the removal of fe by membrane filtration step d showed almost no change w o pac for the case of ha fe so pac demonstrated almost no influence on membrane cleaning under this condition in order to investigate the reasons why pac exhibited opposite influences on the removal of fe and mn by membrane filtration the particle size analysis was further used to explore the changes of particle size distribution of feox and mnox caused by pac it has been well known that pac as the coagulator can destabilize the particles by reducing the negative charge on the surface of the particles resulting in the formation of flocs with large size to facilitate the separation of them from water yan et al 2008 as shown in fig 9 the average particle sizes of mnox and feox without pac addition were 18 μm and 72 μm respectively the distinct difference of particle size between them accounted for the results shown in fig 8 that most of feox particles could be collected on membrane however for mnox a substantial portion of small sized mnox could permeate through the membrane by adding pac as the coagulator the average particle size of mnox was enhanced greatly from 18 μm to 116 μm however the average particle size of feox which had already been as large as 72 μm after the step of pre oxidation was only further increased to 121 μm by pac addition the results demonstrated that coagulation induced by pac exhibited much more influence on the particle size distribution of mnox than that of feox and it was necessary to add pac to increase the average particle size of mnox in practice with the increase of particle size the mn retention rate by pes membrane was increased which led to the prominent promotion of the membrane flux recovery by membrane cleaning step for the case of ha mn however pac demonstrated relatively less effect on the average particle size of feox actually most of feox could be retained by the membrane even without pac so pac contributed slightly for the membrane flux recovery by membrane cleaning step for the case of ha fe 3 3 2 characterization of membrane foulants in order to better observe the pac influence on foulants morphology sem images of membrane surface fouled by ha mn ha fe and ha fe mn without pac fig 10 a c or with pac fig 10g i were compared with each other the corresponding foulants were also collected separately for further characterization by tem fig 10 d f j l for the cases without pac foulants on membrane surface showed different morphologies as shown in fig 10a sem and d tem the ha mn flocs were loose with fragmented edges and can form compact filtration cake when being collected on the membrane in contrast the ha fe foulants exhibited clear shape fig 10e and the foulants collected on the membrane surface demonstrated relatively separated structure as fig 10b the morphology of ha fe mn foulants collected on membrane showed similar compact morphology with ha fe fig 10c while its edges were more rounded fig 10f for comparison the ha mn pac foulants on membrane surface were much denser fig 10g and j however as shown in fig 10h and k the morphology of ha fe pac foulants on membrane surface showed neglected changes compared to the case without pac which demonstrated that pac might have little effect on the physiochemical properties of ha fe foulants ha mn flocs with rougher and unshaped fine morphology might have larger specific surface area than ha fe with the needle shaped crystal combined with the particle size analysis of flocs shown in fig 9 it could be deduced that the large specific surface area of ha mn flocs could provide more surface to coagulate with pac leading to the great extension of the average particle size in the step of coagulation cheng et al 2020a 2020b to clarify the chemical states of feox and mnox deposited on the membrane surface fe 2p and mn 2p were further investigated by the high resolution xps spectra the respective binding energy of fe 2p 3 2 and fe 2p 1 2 being located at 711 ev and 724 4 ev and the distinguishable high satellite peak observed at 718 8 ev and 732 5 ev which did not overlap either the fe 2p 3 2 or fe 2p 1 2 peaks confirmed the presence of fe3 from fe2o3 fig 11 a tan 2016 the deconvoluted mn 2p spectrum fig 11b showed doublet peaks at 641 5 ev mn 2p 3 2 and 653 3 ev mn 2p 1 2 confirming the existence of mn3 in mn2o3 and the spin energy separation between the two peaks 11 7 ev also belonged to mn2o3 nagamuthu and ryu 2019 shao et al 2017 furthermore mn 2p 3 2 was shifted to a higher binding energy of 642 2 ev indicating the formation of mn4 guo et al 2019 lu et al 2020 xps spectra showed that fe ii was completely oxidized to fe iii while the oxidation of mn ii was not complete only part of them were oxidized to mn iv the degrees of crystallinity for feox and mnox were also different fig 11c displayed that feox exhibited better crystallinity which was well corresponded to fe2o3 while mnox in fig 11d showed lower peak intensities and weaker crystallinity lu et al 2020 the amorphous mnox might provide more active sites liu et al 2018b which was beneficial to the coagulation process so the particle size of mnox could be increased more than that of feox 4 conclusion in this study the common membrane foulants feox mnox was utilized as the in situ membrane cleaning catalysts for the first time the novel membrane cleaning method could achieve above 95 membrane flux recovery and remove almost irreversible membrane foulants under the condition of low chemical dosage and short washing time the outstanding membrane cleaning performance was mainly attributed to the simultaneous generation of active species oh and oxygen bubbles beside the coagulator pac played an important role on the membrane cleaning performance by mnox while it exhibited nearly no promotion on that by feox this might be due to the different degrees of crystallinity for feox and mnox the amorphous mnox was more favorable to coagulate with pac than feox with higher crystallinity resulting in the more enhancement of its mean particle size by coagulation conclusively the feox mnox h2o2 system proposed a new membrane cleaning method by taking advantage of the in situ formed membrane foulants with the advantages of no extra catalysts dosage low concentration of h2o2 demanded short membrane washing time and outstanding performance of membrane cleaning the feox mnox h2o2 system demonstrated high potential for practical application in the membrane treatment process for water containing fe and mn moreover as the first attempt to transfer membrane foulants into useful catalysts this study proposed a new way to reduce the cost of membrane cleaning process and more following researches are expected in this direction for example to investigate whether this cleaning system is also an effective strategy for the practical decentralized water supply the ceramic membranes and hollow fiber membranes used for the filtration of iron and manganese containing water are need to be tested in addition follow up researches are also needed to test whether different types of coagulants will exert various influences on the catalytic activity of feox mnox declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16362,microbial ammonia oxidation is the initial nitrification step used in biological nitrogen removal during water treatment processes and the discovery of complete ammonia oxidizing comammox bacteria added a novel member to this functional group it is important to identify and understand the predominant microorganisms responsible for ammonium removal in biotechnological process design and optimization in this study we used a full scale bioreactor to treat ammonium in groundwater 9 3 0 5 mg nh4 n l and investigated the key ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes present the groundwater ammonium was stably and efficiently oxidized throughout 700 days of bioreactor operation 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing of the bioreactor community showed a high abundance of nitrospira 12 5 45 9 with the dominant sequence variant 3 5 37 8 most closely related to candidatus nitrospira nitrosa furthermore analyses of amoa the marker gene for ammonia oxidation indicated the presence of two distinct comammox nitrospira populations however the relative abundance of only one of these populations was strongly correlated to ammonia oxidation rates and was robustly expressed after 380 days of operation copper wires were immersed into the reactor at 0 04 0 06 m2 m3 tank which caused a gradual abundance increase of one discrete comammox nitrospira population however further increase of the copper dosing 0 08 m2 m3 tank inverted the most abundant ammonia oxidizing population to nitrosomonas sp these results indicate that comammox nitrospira were capable of efficient ammonium removal in groundwater without exogenous nutrients but copper addition can stimulate comammox nitrospira or lead to dominance of nitrosomonas depending on dosage graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater treatment biological ammonia oxidation comammox nitrospira copper dosing 1 introduction 50 of the drinking water produced worldwide originates from groundwater and 2 5 billion people depend on this resource to satisfy their daily water requirements wwap 2015 however groundwater is frequently polluted by ammonium from two major sources i nitrate leaching into aquifers as a result of agricultural fertilization and livestock waste treatment which then is stimulating dissimilatory nitrate or nitrite reduction to ammonium dnra burgin and hamilton 2007 mohamed et al 2003 spalding and exner 1993 sugimoto and hirata 2006 and ii ammonium directly leaking from sewer pipe drainage and landfill leachate böhlke et al 2006 umezawa et al 2008 wakida and lerner 2005 the presence of ammonium in drinking water causes adverse effects such as accumulation of nitrite to toxic levels and promoting growth of heterotrophic bacteria including pathogens chu et al 2005 wilczak et al 1996 additionally when chlorine is used for disinfection of drinking water ammonium can react with it to produce mono di and tri chloroamines that affect the taste and odor of the water and are irritants bernard et al 2003 parrat et al 2012 suffet et al 1996 2004 wang et al 2018 therefore appropriate ammonium removal from raw water sources is required and biological treatment processes have long been applied to obtain biologically stable drinking water de vet et al 2009 2011 kasuga et al 2010 van der wielen et al 2009 generally nitrification occurs in a two step process initiated by the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob kowalchuk and stephen 2001 and archaea aoa stahl and de la torre 2012 followed by nitrite oxidation to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob daims et al 2016 however recently bacteria affiliated with the genus nitrospira were discovered that were capable of complete ammonia oxidation comammox daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 one of the key factors that determines the niches of the different groups of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms is the concentration of available ammonia physiological characterization of comammox nitrospira showed that they have higher ammonia affinities than aob and many non marine aoa jung et al 2021 kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2020 and therefore it has been posited that comammox nitrospira are important for nitrification in groundwater with low ammonium concentrations 1 mg nh4 n l fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 poghosyan et al 2020 however it remains unclear which nitrifiers are best suited for use in reactor systems treating groundwater with elevated ammonium concentrations 1 mg nh4 n l the key enzyme for ammonia oxidation is the ammonia monooxygenase amo which is a copper dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine the first step in nitrification consequently ammonia oxidation is strongly inhibited by copper chelating compounds like allylthiourea bédard and knowles 1989 and the addition of copper to cell extracts of nitrosomonas europaea greatly increases the activity of amo in vitro ensign et al 1993 incomplete ammonia oxidation is a frequently encountered problem for drinking water production processes and it has been demonstrated that poor nitrification performance in biological water treatment systems can be mitigated by adding copper as a micronutrient wagner et al 2016 2018 thus copper deficiency is common in oligotrophic environments like for instance groundwater and anthropogenic copper dosing can effectively promote ammonia oxidation therefore copper is a vital trace element for ammonia oxidizing microorganisms and its availability might constitute an additional niche defining factor for the different clades of ammonia oxidizers in this study ammonium removal in a full scale sponge fluidized bed bioreactor used to treat high ammonium levels in groundwater 10 mg nh4 n l for drinking water production was continuously monitored for 691 days the microbial community at several sampling dates displaying differences in nitrification rates were investigated using both 16s rrna and amoa gene amplicon sequencing and the transcriptional activities of the identified ammonia oxidizers were estimated using rt pcr which indicated comammox nitrospira as the primary nitrifier additionally copper wires immersion into the reactor revealed differential copper stimulation of ammonia oxidation by comammox nitrospira and canonical aob 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation and physicochemical characterization a full scale biological ammonium removal reactor system referred to as bioreactor was constructed to produce drinking water from groundwater in japan the bioreactor

before entering the tank of the bioreactor within the bioreactor the water was fully aerated using air diffusers on day 380 circularly wound copper wires with a diameter of 1 2 mm and a length of 17 m were immersed into the bioreactor to test if the observed incomplete nitrification was caused by copper limitation wagner et al 2016 2018 2019 the flow rate of groundwater through the reactor was varied between 1 8 and 14 9 m3 h allowing a division into eight operational phases each phase was further subdivided depending on the amount of copper wire immersed fig 2 water quality of the in and

bioreactor performance the bioreactor was operated continuously for 691 days to remove ammonium 9 3 0 5 mg n l from groundwater fig 2 during phase i the bioreactor was operated at a reduced flow rate of 1 8 0 4 m3 h corresponding to an ammonium loading rate of 28 5 5 9 mg n l day to allow microbes to attach and grow on the sponge carrier fig 2b after the ammonium removal efficiency had increased gradually to approximately 40 fig 2c phase i the ammonium loading rate was raised to 40 5 4 1 mg n l day on day 113 however the ammonium removal efficiency did not further increase in phase ii so ammonium loading rate was reduced to 31 3 4 0 mg n l day on day 188 during phase iii nitrification slowly began to accrete again and the effluent ammonium concentration decreased from approximately 6 mg l to 2 mg l within 200 days however ammonium removal was still incomplete and the removal efficiency was not stable even after approximately 1 year of bioreactor operation at this stage we considered supplementing the bioreactor with copper which is a co factor of the ammonia monooxygenase amo ensign et al 1993 the copper concentration of the groundwater was 0 30 0 17 µg l and thus ammonia oxidation capacity might be limited by copper availability as has been found for danish full scale drinking water treatment systems wagner et al 2016 2018 2019 therefore after 380 days of operation copper wires at a density of 0 039 m2 m3 tank were immersed into the bioreactor s bulk liquid in phase iv nitrification rates immediately improved after copper was supplied and the effluent ammonium concentration decreased to 0 10 0 03 mg n l corresponding to 99 1 0 5 removal efficiency at this stage the flow rate was increased from 1 9 m3 h to 8 1 m3 h corresponding to 32 1 and 131 0 mg nh4 n l day respectively the effluent ammonium concentration remained stable at 0 07 0 06 mg n l corresponding to a removal efficiency 99 demonstrating that complete ammonium removal from contaminated groundwater was achievable with this reactor setup beginning in phase v we investigated the effect of the amount of copper supply on nitrification to test whether ammonium oxidation remained stable without copper supplementation the flow rate was reduced to 3 7 0 2 m3 h and the immersed copper wires were temporarily removed on day 406 with subsequent monitoring of ammonium in the effluent until day 419 then copper wire was immersed again on day 419 under these conditions the ammonium removal efficiency remained stable 97 fig 2 phase v next we increased the flow rate from 3 7 0 2 m3 h to 9 8 0 2 m3 h resulting in an ammonium loading rate of 165 7 8 6 mg n l day in phase vi and nearly complete ammonium removal was maintained unlike earlier treatments resupply of copper wire 0 058 m2 m3 tank on day 484 phase vi 2 did not aid the recovery of the ammonium removal efficiency consequently in phase vii we replaced the copper wires with new wires 0 039 m2 m3 tank on day 506 and restarted the bioreactor system at a flow rate of 4 0 m3 h the ammonium removal rate quickly improved and after a gradual increase of the flow rate reached approximately 169 4 mg n l day at a flow rate of 10 3 m3 h end of phase vii but ammonium removal efficiency 97 was not achieved to attain complete ammonium conversion the flow rate was further increased to 14 9 2 6 m3 h in phase viii which resulted in removal rates of 251 3 45 7 mg n l day on day 571 we further augmented the copper wire supply to 0 077 m2 m3 tank which caused a gradual ammonium removal rate increase from 160 1 mg n l day to 300 7 mg n l day by day 602 corresponding to 97 ammonium removal efficiency finally as there was a slight decrease in removal efficiency towards the end of phase viii 2 copper wire immersion was increased to 0 116 m2 m3 tank on day 669 to test whether the ammonium removal rates could further be improved while this caused no significant increase of the observed potential nitrification rates it did recuperate complete ammonium removal in summary copper wire immersion effectuated stable and efficient nitrification performance which however declined over time and required repeated copper wire addition and exchange 3 2 microbial community composition the microbial community within the full scale groundwater treatment bioreactor was investigated using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 2 over the complete operational period the community was composed mainly of bacteria with archaea constituting a minor population supplementary fig 2 and supplementary table 3 nitrifying members of the bioreactor community included nitrosomonas 0 5 17 6 nitrosospira 0 0 6 nitrospira 12 5 45 9 and candidatus nitrotoga 0 0 1 while other aob and aoa were not detected supplementary fig 2a the abundances of the top 20 asvs were compared over the time course of bioreactor operation to elucidate fluctuations in relative abundance of especially the nitrifying bacteria in response to the different operational modes applied supplementary fig 2 the genus nitrospira decreased from initially 31 5 to 15 4 relative abundance by day 231 followed by an abundance increase to a maximum of 45 9 on day 404 following an initial decrease and subsequent increased on days 488 and 561 they decreased over the remainder of the experiment on the contrary members of the genus nitrosomonas were of very low abundance 0 1 until day 602 when they accounted for 10 8 of the reads no other nitrifying taxa were among the 20 most abundant asvs therefore nitrospira species appeared to be the dominant nitrifiers in the bioreactor throughout most of the operation and were stimulated by increased copper availability but were quickly outcompeted by nitrosomonas at elevated copper dosing and ammonium loading rates phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene fig 3 a assigned five asvs to the genus nitrospira 16s asv1 16s asv3 16s asv7 16s asv11 and 16s asv310 16s asv1 was most closely related to candidatus nitrospira nitrosa within nitrospira lineage ii indicating that this asv represents a comammox nitrospira also see below 16s asv3 was highly similar to nitrospira lenta while 16s asv7 and 16s asv310 also were affiliated with nitrospira lineage ii but no reference species was closely related 16s asv11 was affiliated with nitrospira lineage i and closely related to nitrospira sp nd1 by day 404 16s asv1 accounted for 37 8 of all 16s rrna gene reads the other nitrospira asvs accounted for 4 5 16s asv3 2 1 16s asv7 and 1 5 16s asv11 while 16s asv310 was not detected fig 3b six aob asvs including five nitrosomonas asvs 16s asv10 16 22 134 and 178 and one nitrosospira asv 16s asv117 were detected in the bioreactor but comprised a minor population less than 0 6 on average during most of the operational period intriguingly nitrospira 16s asv1 abundances decreased from 37 8 at day 404 to 3 5 by day 602 of operation on the contrary aob 16s asv10 16s asv16 and 16s asv22 had increased to 10 8 5 0 and 1 6 by day 602 respectively indicating a switch between predominant ammonia oxidizer after the phase transition to peak copper dosing this corroborates the previously observed effects of copper and ammonium availability on the different members of this functional group i e comammox nitrospira outcompeting the other ammonia oxidizers under ammonia and copper limited conditions thus the observed dominance of putative comammox nitrospira over most of the operational period highlights the importance of this nitrifier lineage for drinking water treatment 3 3 amoa gene based diversity of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed that the major ammonia oxidizers present in the bioreactor system were putative comammox nitrospira and mainly at the latest timepoint nitrosomonadaceae aob to confirm this trend and to substantiate that the dominant nitrospira was a comammox bacterium we used pcr to amplify the nitrosomonadaceae aob nitrososphaerales aoa and nitrospira amoa genes from 9 samples taken between days 96 and 602 of bioreactor operation however no aob or aoa amoa gene amplicons were detected via gel electrophoresis in any of the analyzed samples and we thus focused our analysis on the diversity of comammox nitrospira only the quality filtered comammox specific amoa gene amplicon sequence reads yielded in total 15 coma amoa asvs which all were phylogenetically affiliated with comammox clade a fig 4 a coma amoa asv1 and 15 were affiliated with clade a2 sequences while the remaining coma amoa asvs clustered within clade a1 fig 4a coma amoa asv8 9 12 and 20 were closely related to candidatus nitrospira nitrosa coma amoa asv2 7 were clustered with activated sludge clones and coma amoa asv10 16 and 17 with clones mainly from drinking water production systems fig 4a just two asvs coma amoa asv1 and asv2 accounted for 51 3 94 0 of all reads during the analyzed period fig 4b starting from an initially more diverse comammox nitrospira community coma amoa asv1 increased from initially 51 0 on day 96 to a maximum abundance of 84 2 on day 306 whereas the abundances of all other asvs decreased over this time period subsequently coma amoa asv1 relative abundances slowly declined with a simultaneous increase of coma amoa asv2 from initially 0 3 4 5 between days 96 and 306 to 44 5 of all comammox amoa genes on day 404 becoming nearly equal with coma amoa asv1 49 6 by day 488 coma amoa asv2 59 2 had overcome the previously dominant coma amoa asv1 31 1 and by day 602 completely dominated by accounting for 83 2 of all reads fig 4b interestingly this shift in dominant coma amoa asv corresponded perfectly to the onset of copper dosing on day 380 thus based on their high relative abundances coma amoa asv1 and asv2 correspond to the primary contributors to ammonia oxidation in the bioreactor but apparently react differentially to increases in ammonium loading and copper availability 3 4 correlation between ammonia oxidizing guild and ammonia oxidation rate correlations between the relative abundances of amplicon sequencing reads of each asv and observed ammonia oxidation rates were investigated using pearson s correlation for operational phase i viii 1 up to day 561 the data point at day 602 was excluded because the main ammonia oxidizer drastically changed while the ammonia oxidation rate remained high among the 16s asvs we found the highest correlation coefficient with the observed ammonia oxidation rates for the nitrospira affiliated 16s asv1 r 0 75 fig 5 additionally we examined correlations between the relative abundance of each coma amoa asv and ammonia oxidation rates fig 5 and supplementary fig 4 despite its low initial abundance coma amoa asv2 showed a very strong positive correlation r 0 99 whereas there was a negative correlation for coma amoa asv1 r 0 85 fig 5 and all other amoa asvs supplementary fig 4 after the first addition of copper wire on day 380 the ammonium removal efficiency reached almost 100 and the ammonia oxidation rate thus is limited by the ammonium loading rate and not copper availability any longer although copper limitation was alleviated only 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 were highly correlated with the ammonia oxidation rate fig 5 supplementary fig 4 indicating that other nitrifiers were outcompeted for ammonia and copper by this specific comammox member thus these correlations provide additional evidence that one discrete comammox nitrospira population is the predominant ammonia oxidizing microorganism in this bioreactor at least until day 561 of reactor operation however while this analysis indicates this comammox nitrospira to be represented by 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 these data are insufficient to fully resolve this link as concretely as their presence in the same isolate or genome 3 5 transcriptional activities of ammonia oxidizers based on the amoa gene in order to estimate the transcriptional activity of the different ammonia oxidizing microorganisms detected in the system rt pcr was performed on rna extracted on day 404 of bioreactor operation supplementary fig 5 we used nine primer combinations including the established primer pair targeting the nitrosomonadaceae amoa gene amoa 1f 2r several newly developed primer combinations to cover the majority of nitrosomonadaceae reference sequences supplementary fig 1 as well as two new primer sets specifically targeting the dominant comammox amoa asvs detected in our amplicon analysis supplementary table 1 nitrosomonadaceae amoa genes were undetectable with all primer combinations tested including those specifically designed to have a better coverage of the genera nitrosomonas nsom 1f 1r 2f 2r and 1f 2r primer sets and nitrosospira nsos 1f 1r 2f 2r and 1f 2r primer sets contrastingly the amoa genes of nitrospira asv1 and asv2 could be detected using the specific primer pairs coma amoa asv1 f r and asv2 f r respectively the rt pcr results indicated high levels of expression of coma amoa asv2 much higher than coma amoa asv1 supplementary fig 5 despite the comparable relative abundance levels of these asvs in the amplicon sequencing dataset on day 404 fig 4b thus rt pcr inferred activity levels also suggest that coma amoa asv2 represents the main ammonia oxidizing population in the bioreactor at this time point corroborating its positive correlation with observed ammonia oxidation rates 3 6 effect of copper on ammonia oxidation influent copper concentration was 0 30 0 17 µg l 4 7 2 7 nm during the operational period which we hypnotized to be limiting ammonia oxidation copper wire immersion into the bioreactor markedly changed the observed ammonia oxidation rates and efficiencies fig 2 and also had a strong influence on the dominant nitrifying population in the beginning of the experiment when no copper wires were immersed into the bioreactor the ammonia oxidation rate slowly improved fig 2 but did not exceed 18 0 13 6 mg n l day on average fig 6 a almost immediately after copper wire immersion 0 039 m2 m3 tank the ammonia oxidation rate increased and reached maximally 150 7 64 8 n mg l day as well as near complete removal efficiency 94 1 8 3 these oxidation rates did not change significantly upon an initial addition of wire 0 057 m2 m3 but a further increment in copper wire immersion 0 077 m2 m3 tank did stimulate the ammonia oxidation rate to 246 5 38 0 mg n l day this however could not be further enhanced by the addition of more copper wire 0 116 m2 m3 tank thus consistent with our expectations ammonia oxidation rates increased incrementally with the amount of copper wire immersed we analyzed the relationship between the percentage of nitrifiers and the amount of copper wire immersion based on the phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene asv3 and 11 were regarded as canonical nitrospira asv1 and 310 as comammox nitrospira and asv7 was omitted as its affiliation was not clear fig 6b interestingly also the major nitrifying bacterial population changed in response to the copper dose prior to copper wire immersion one comammox nitrospira species 16s asv1 was the most abundant nitrifier at 9 8 5 4 of the community and increased to 32 0 5 3 following initial copper wire immersion 0 039 m2 m3 tank as also reflected by the observed positive correlation of this asv with ammonia oxidation rates fig 5 however once copper wire immersion reached 0 077 m2 m3 tank there was an apparent shift in the bioreactor community favoring nitrosomonas 16s asv10 16 and canonical nitrospira 16s asv3 11 in this study the increase of ammonium loading rates and copper stimulation were performed simultaneously and their effects on the nitrifier dynamics in the system thus are confounded however the initial increase in loading rates with simultaneous copper stimulation in phase iv resulted in a significant increase in the relative abundance of only the dominant comammox nitrospira within 10 days 16s asv1 24 9 to 37 8 while no other nitrifier increased within the community fig 3 subsequently comammox nitrospira were dominating the system until at least day 561 thus 42 days after increasing ammonium loading to the final rate in phase viii fig 3 supplementary table 2 nitrosomonas like aob only became dominant by day 602 that is 31 days after a further increase of copper dosing fig 3 this strongly indicates that the increased substrate availability due to higher ammonium loading rates was not the determining factor to select for aob but that this shift was caused by the additional copper dosing overall supplying copper to the bioreactor positively influenced the ammonium removal capacity and efficiency and ultimately initiated a shift in the predominant community members driving nitrification in the system 4 discussion 4 1 identification of the major ammonia oxidizer in the groundwater treating bioreactor pearson s correlation analysis between ammonia oxidation rates and relative abundance of 16s rrna or comammox amoa genes showed that the main nitrifiers in the bioreactor are represented by 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 fig 5 correlation analysis of the relative abundances of 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 is high at r 0 77 supplementary fig 6 thus 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 seem to be one nitrospira species however the discrepancy in the abundance patterns especially the apparent dominance of 16s asv1 but absence of coma amoa asv2 on day 96 obscured this connection one possible explanation for the discrepancy in abundance patterns is that 16s asv1 may represent a population consisting of multiple closely related species which corresponded to coma amoa asv3 and 7 at early time points and shifted to coma amoa asv2 at later time points fig 4 this is corroborated by the high degree of sequence identity of coma amoa asv2 3 and 7 nucleotide identity 97 and the increased pearson s correlation coefficient with 16s asv1 when these closely related coma amoa asvs were grouped supplementary fig 6 additionally it seemed that a strong amplification bias could have been caused by mismatches in the primer set ntsp amoa 162f 358r fowler et al 2018 used to amplify the comammox amoa we performed a primer match analysis for near full length amoa sequences with high similarities to the coma amoa asvs obtained in this study see supplemental methods supplementary fig 7 this showed that nitrospira sp st bin4 a close relative of coma amoa asv1 had 0 and 1 mismatches to the forward and reverse f r primers respectively on the contrary nitrospira sp uba5702 which is closely related to coma amoa asv2 had 2 mismatches to both primers this difference in sequence similarity of the primers to their target sequences could result in a more efficient amplification of coma amoa asv1 than coma amoa asv2 thus the initial observation of presence of 16s asv1 fig 3b with concurrent absence of coma amoa asv2 fig 4b may result from this primer bias causing overestimation of coma amoa asv1 abundances and strong underestimation of coma amoa asv2 from day 393 onward there was a strong shift from coma amoa asv1 to coma amoa asv2 which became the dominant amoa asv by day 561 fig 4b while the initial abundance of coma amoa asv1 was likely overestimated due to the observed primer bias this shift still indicates slightly different ecological niches of these two comammox species presumably defined by copper availability as at this stage 16s asv1 was the only nitrospira remaining in the system fig 3b this confirms not only that 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 represent the same comammox nitrospira but also that this comammox nitrospira was the dominant ammonia oxidizer in the bioreactor 4 2 comammox nitrospira are wide spread independent of environmental ammonium concentrations most analyses of the microbial community present in groundwater treatment facilities performed to date reported a dominant role of comammox nitrospira in ammonium removal however their inflow ammonium concentrations usually were 1 mg nh4 l fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 poghosyan et al 2020 wagner et al 2019 which is approximately 1 10th the concentration in this system batch experiments using a range of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms demonstrated that the comammox species nitrospira inopinata has a higher affinity for ammonia than aob and many non marine aoa and are expected to outcompete these other ammonia oxidizers at ammonium concentrations 0 5 mg n l and 0 1 mg n l respectively kits et al 2017 this high ammonia affinity of comammox nitrospira was also confirmed for candidatus nitrospira kreftii recently sakoula et al 2020 despite the relatively high ammonium concentrations of 9 3 0 5 mg nh4 n l in the inflow we found that comammox nitrospira remained the dominant nitrifying microorganisms for 561 days of operation furthermore two independent sequencing datasets indicated the abundance of one specific nitrospira species represented by 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 to be strongly correlated to ammonia oxidation rates making it the probable primary driver of ammonia oxidation in this bioreactor similarly several studies found comammox nitrospira to dominate in certain wastewater treatment plants and agricultural soils with elevated ammonium concentrations 10 mg nh4 l cotto et al 2020 liu et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 together these data suggest that additional factors besides ammonium concentrations like e g oxygen availability and solids retention time may contribute to the ecological success of comammox nitrospira cotto et al 2020 roots et al 2019 shao and wu 2021 4 3 copper concentrations may critically influence the competition between ammonia oxidizers copper is a metal cofactor required for ammonia monooxygenase activity ammonia oxidation by nitrosomonas europaea was stimulated by copper addition at concentrations ranging from 5 0 to 30 0 μg l 78 7 to 472 1 nm loveless and painter 1968 and the aoa candidatus nitrosopumilus maritimus scm1 became growth limited at copper concentrations 10 nm equivalent to 0 6 μg l amin et al 2013 for comammox nitrospira inopinata cultivation the used copper concentration was 20 μg l 117 3 nm daims et al 2015 although the copper affinity of comammox nitrospira has not yet been experimentally determined other studies on comammox nitrospira dominated groundwater treating rapid sand filters that displayed incomplete nitrification reported that ammonia oxidation rates were improved after increasing copper concentrations from native 0 04 μg l 0 6 nm to maximally 1 5 μg l 23 6 nm wagner et al 2018 this increase in nitrification rates appeared with a concurrent increase in abundance of both comammox nitrospira and nitrosomonadaceae aob although nitrosomonas spp increased 10 fold in response to copper dosing while comammox nitrospira abundances remained within the same order of magnitude wagner et al 2019 in this study the influent copper concentration was as low as 0 30 μg l 4 7 nm and thus below the reported copper requirements of aob and aoa and thus we hypothesized copper to be a limiting factor for ammonia oxidation confirming this hypothesis copper wire immersion into the bioreactor rapidly increased ammonia oxidation rate and efficiency fig 2 interestingly despite the presence of multiple different ammonia oxidizing lineages in our bioreactor only the abundance of comammox nitrospira 16s asv1 robustly responded during the initial copper wire immersion of 0 039 m2 m3 tank fig 6 this indicates that comammox nitrospira were copper limited in the system and were more sensitive to small changes in copper concentrations than aob a further increase in copper dosing apparently favored nitrosomonadaceae aob populations with a concurrent decrease of comammox nitrospira 16s asv1 relative abundance fig 6 thus our results provide additional evidence that comammox nitrospira have a lower copper requirement than nitrosomonadaceae aob but comammox nitrospira may still be copper limited at natural groundwater concentrations taken together our data for the first time suggests that copper availability can exert a strong selective pressure on ammonia oxidizing populations and that copper limitation increases the competitiveness of comammox nitrospira in systems with increased ammonium concentrations 5 conclusions we investigated microbial community composition and nitrification efficiency in a bioreactor supplied with groundwater containing 9 3 0 5 mg n l ammonium for approximately 700 days a combination of 16s rrna and amoa gene amplicon sequencing approaches revealed that one comammox nitrospira lineage was strongly correlated with reactor performance during varied ammonium loading and copper dosing intriguingly moderate increases in copper availability led to increased nitrification efficiency together with a dominance of this comammox nitrospira over an initially more diverse ammonia oxidizing community while high copper dosage ultimately inverted the most abundant nitrifying population from comammox nitrospira to nitrosomonadaceae aob and canonical nitrospira while the effect of copper dosing on nitrifier community composition cannot fully be separated from the influence of increased ammonium loading in our experimental setup copper availability appeared to impose a stronger selection for specific nitrifying populations than expected from pure culture studies focusing on affinities for ammonia these results provide new insights for understanding the ecophysiology and niche adaptation of comammox nitrospira as well as for means to control the nitrification process in drinking water production declaration of competing interest the

16362,microbial ammonia oxidation is the initial nitrification step used in biological nitrogen removal during water treatment processes and the discovery of complete ammonia oxidizing comammox bacteria added a novel member to this functional group it is important to identify and understand the predominant microorganisms responsible for ammonium removal in biotechnological process design and optimization in this study we used a full scale bioreactor to treat ammonium in groundwater 9 3 0 5 mg nh4 n l and investigated the key ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes present the groundwater ammonium was stably and efficiently oxidized throughout 700 days of bioreactor operation 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing of the bioreactor community showed a high abundance of nitrospira 12 5 45 9 with the dominant sequence variant 3 5 37 8 most closely related to candidatus nitrospira nitrosa furthermore analyses of amoa the marker gene for ammonia oxidation indicated the presence of two distinct comammox nitrospira populations however the relative abundance of only one of these populations was strongly correlated to ammonia oxidation rates and was robustly expressed after 380 days of operation copper wires were immersed into the reactor at 0 04 0 06 m2 m3 tank which caused a gradual abundance increase of one discrete comammox nitrospira population however further increase of the copper dosing 0 08 m2 m3 tank inverted the most abundant ammonia oxidizing population to nitrosomonas sp these results indicate that comammox nitrospira were capable of efficient ammonium removal in groundwater without exogenous nutrients but copper addition can stimulate comammox nitrospira or lead to dominance of nitrosomonas depending on dosage graphical abstract image graphical abstract

irritants bernard et al 2003 parrat et al 2012 suffet et al 1996 2004 wang et al 2018 therefore appropriate ammonium removal from raw water sources is required and biological treatment processes have long been applied to obtain biologically stable drinking water de vet et al 2009 2011 kasuga et al 2010 van der wielen et al 2009 generally nitrification occurs in a two step process initiated by the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite by ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob kowalchuk and stephen 2001 and archaea aoa stahl and de la torre 2012 followed by nitrite oxidation to nitrate by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob daims et al 2016 however recently bacteria affiliated with the genus nitrospira were discovered that were capable of complete ammonia oxidation comammox daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 one of the key factors that determines the niches of the different groups of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms is the concentration of available ammonia physiological characterization of comammox nitrospira showed that they have higher ammonia affinities than aob and many non marine aoa jung et al 2021 kits et al 2017 sakoula et al 2020 and therefore it has been posited that comammox nitrospira are important for nitrification in groundwater with low ammonium concentrations 1 mg nh4 n l fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 poghosyan et al 2020 however it remains unclear which nitrifiers are best suited for use in reactor systems treating groundwater with elevated ammonium concentrations 1 mg nh4 n l the key enzyme for ammonia oxidation is the ammonia monooxygenase amo which is a copper dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine the first step in nitrification consequently ammonia oxidation is strongly inhibited by copper chelating compounds like allylthiourea bédard and knowles 1989 and the addition of copper to cell extracts of nitrosomonas europaea greatly increases the activity of amo in vitro ensign et al 1993 incomplete ammonia oxidation is a frequently encountered problem for drinking water production processes and it has been demonstrated that poor nitrification performance in biological water treatment systems can be mitigated by adding copper as a micronutrient wagner et al 2016 2018 thus copper deficiency is common in oligotrophic environments like for instance groundwater and anthropogenic copper dosing can effectively promote ammonia oxidation therefore copper is a vital trace element for ammonia oxidizing microorganisms and its availability might constitute an additional niche defining factor for the different clades of ammonia oxidizers in this study ammonium removal in a full scale sponge fluidized bed bioreactor used to treat high ammonium levels in groundwater 10 mg nh4 n l for drinking water production was continuously monitored for 691 days the microbial community at several sampling dates displaying differences in nitrification rates were investigated using both 16s rrna and amoa gene amplicon sequencing and the transcriptional activities of the identified ammonia oxidizers were estimated using rt pcr which indicated comammox nitrospira as the primary nitrifier additionally copper wires immersion into the reactor revealed differential copper stimulation of ammonia oxidation by comammox nitrospira and canonical aob 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation and physicochemical characterization a full scale biological ammonium removal reactor system referred to as bioreactor was constructed to produce drinking water from groundwater in japan the bioreactor setup consisted of 13 5 m3 tank containing 5 mm square polyurethane sponge carriers techno foam japan japan occupying 30 of the reactor volume fig 1 no seed sludge was used for inoculation groundwater

dataset coma amoa asvs 2 5 phylogenetic analysis to identify species closely related to each asv all nitrifier 16s asv sequences nitrosomonas nitrosospira and nitrospira detected in the bioreactor were imported into silva nr99 138 quast et al 2012 and coma amoa asv sequences into a comammox amoa database pjevac et al 2017 using the arb software package ludwig et al 2004 imported sequences were aligned against the silva nr99 138 database or the comammox amoa database using the automatic alignment feature of arb with manually generated pt servers sequence frameshifts due to alignment errors were manually corrected our asvs were then added to the existing tree in the database using the escherichia coli filter for 16s asvs and the coma amoa asv1 filter for coma amoa asvs the most closely related sequences identified in the arb phylogenetic tree were then exported and some additional reference sequences were downloaded from ncbi to reconstruct a new phylogenetic tree asv and reference sequences were aligned using mafft katoh et al 2002 thereafter aligned sequences of the 16s rrna gene or comammox amoa were used for calculating maximum likelihood ml trees using iq tree version 2 1 3

comammox nitrospira and nitrosomonadaceae aob we designed primers specific for comammox amoa representatives asv1 and asv2 and for the nitrosomonas and nitrosospira amoa genes see supplemental methods

bioreactor performance the bioreactor was operated continuously for 691 days to remove ammonium 9 3 0 5 mg n l from groundwater fig 2 during phase i the bioreactor was operated at a reduced flow rate of 1 8 0 4 m3 h corresponding to an ammonium loading rate of 28 5 5 9 mg n l day to allow microbes to attach and grow on the sponge carrier fig 2b after the ammonium removal efficiency had increased gradually to approximately 40 fig 2c phase i the ammonium loading rate was raised to 40 5 4 1 mg n l day on day 113 however the ammonium removal efficiency did not further increase in phase ii so ammonium loading rate was reduced to 31 3 4 0 mg n l day on day 188 during phase iii nitrification slowly began to accrete again and the effluent ammonium concentration decreased from approximately 6 mg l to 2 mg l within 200 days however ammonium removal was still incomplete and the removal efficiency was not stable even after approximately 1 year of bioreactor operation at this stage we considered supplementing the bioreactor with copper which is a co factor of the ammonia monooxygenase amo ensign et al 1993 the copper concentration of the groundwater was 0 30 0 17 µg l and thus ammonia oxidation capacity might be limited by copper availability as has been found for danish full scale drinking water treatment systems wagner et al 2016 2018 2019 therefore after 380 days of operation copper wires at a density of 0 039 m2 m3 tank were immersed into the bioreactor s bulk liquid in phase iv nitrification rates immediately improved after copper was supplied and the effluent ammonium concentration decreased to 0 10 0 03 mg n l corresponding to 99 1 0 5 removal efficiency at this stage the flow rate was increased from 1 9 m3 h to 8 1 m3 h corresponding to 32 1 and 131 0 mg nh4 n l day respectively the effluent ammonium concentration remained stable at 0 07 0 06 mg n l corresponding to a removal efficiency 99 demonstrating that complete ammonium removal from contaminated groundwater was achievable with this reactor setup beginning in phase v we investigated the effect of the amount of copper supply on nitrification to test whether ammonium oxidation remained stable without copper supplementation the flow rate was reduced to 3 7 0 2 m3 h and the immersed copper wires were temporarily removed on day 406 with subsequent monitoring of ammonium in the effluent until day 419 then copper wire was immersed again on day 419 under these conditions the ammonium removal efficiency remained stable 97 fig 2 phase v next we increased the flow rate from 3 7 0 2 m3 h to 9 8 0 2 m3 h resulting in an ammonium loading rate of 165 7 8 6 mg n l day in phase vi and nearly complete ammonium removal was maintained unlike earlier treatments resupply of copper wire 0 058 m2 m3 tank on day 484 phase vi 2 did not aid the recovery of the ammonium removal efficiency consequently in phase vii we replaced the copper wires with new wires 0 039 m2 m3 tank on day 506 and restarted the bioreactor system at a flow rate of 4 0 m3 h the ammonium removal rate quickly improved and after a gradual increase of the flow rate reached approximately 169 4 mg n l day at a flow rate of 10 3 m3 h end of phase vii but ammonium removal efficiency 97 was not achieved to attain complete ammonium conversion the flow rate was further increased to 14 9 2 6 m3 h in phase viii which resulted in removal rates of 251 3 45 7 mg n l day on day 571 we further augmented the copper wire supply to 0 077 m2 m3 tank which caused a gradual ammonium removal rate increase from 160 1 mg n l day to 300 7 mg n l day by day 602 corresponding to 97 ammonium removal efficiency finally as there was a slight decrease in removal efficiency towards the end of phase viii 2 copper wire immersion was increased to 0 116 m2 m3 tank on day 669 to test whether the ammonium removal rates could further be improved while this caused no significant increase of the observed potential nitrification rates it did recuperate complete ammonium removal in summary copper wire immersion effectuated stable and efficient nitrification performance which however declined over time and required repeated copper wire addition and exchange 3 2 microbial community composition the microbial community within the full scale groundwater treatment bioreactor was investigated using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 2 over the complete operational period the community was composed mainly of bacteria with archaea constituting a minor population supplementary fig 2 and supplementary table 3 nitrifying members of the bioreactor community included nitrosomonas 0 5 17 6 nitrosospira 0 0 6 nitrospira 12 5 45 9 and candidatus nitrotoga 0 0 1 while other aob and aoa were not detected supplementary fig 2a the abundances of the top 20 asvs were compared over the time course of bioreactor operation to elucidate fluctuations in relative abundance of especially the nitrifying bacteria in response to the different operational modes applied supplementary fig 2 the genus nitrospira decreased from initially 31 5 to 15 4 relative abundance by day 231 followed by an abundance increase to a maximum of 45 9 on day 404 following an initial decrease and subsequent increased on days 488 and 561 they decreased over the remainder of the experiment on the contrary members of the genus nitrosomonas were of very low abundance 0 1 until day 602 when they accounted for 10 8 of the reads no other nitrifying taxa were among the 20 most abundant asvs therefore nitrospira species appeared to be the dominant nitrifiers in the bioreactor throughout most of the operation and were stimulated by increased copper availability but were quickly outcompeted by nitrosomonas at elevated copper dosing and ammonium loading rates phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene fig 3 a assigned five asvs to the genus nitrospira 16s asv1 16s asv3 16s asv7 16s asv11 and 16s asv310 16s asv1 was most closely related to candidatus nitrospira nitrosa within nitrospira lineage ii indicating that this asv represents a comammox nitrospira also see below 16s asv3 was highly similar to nitrospira lenta while 16s asv7 and 16s asv310 also were affiliated with nitrospira lineage ii but no reference species was closely related 16s asv11 was affiliated with nitrospira lineage i and closely related to nitrospira sp nd1 by day 404 16s asv1 accounted for 37 8 of all 16s rrna gene reads the other nitrospira asvs accounted for 4 5 16s asv3 2 1 16s asv7 and 1 5 16s asv11 while 16s asv310 was not detected fig 3b six aob asvs including five nitrosomonas asvs 16s asv10 16 22 134 and 178 and one nitrosospira asv 16s asv117 were detected in the bioreactor but comprised a minor population less than 0 6 on average during most of the operational period intriguingly nitrospira 16s asv1 abundances decreased from 37 8 at day 404 to 3 5 by day 602 of operation on the contrary aob 16s asv10 16s asv16 and 16s asv22 had increased to 10 8 5 0 and 1 6 by day 602 respectively indicating a switch between predominant ammonia oxidizer after the phase transition to peak copper dosing this corroborates the previously observed effects of copper and ammonium availability on the different members of this functional group i e comammox nitrospira outcompeting the other ammonia oxidizers under ammonia and copper limited conditions thus the observed dominance of putative comammox nitrospira over most of the operational period highlights the importance of this nitrifier lineage for drinking water treatment 3 3 amoa gene based diversity of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed that the major ammonia oxidizers present in the bioreactor system were putative comammox nitrospira and mainly at the latest timepoint nitrosomonadaceae aob to confirm this trend and to substantiate that the dominant nitrospira was a comammox bacterium we used pcr to amplify the nitrosomonadaceae aob nitrososphaerales aoa and nitrospira amoa genes from 9 samples taken between days 96 and 602 of bioreactor operation however no aob or aoa amoa gene amplicons were detected via gel electrophoresis in any of the analyzed samples and we thus focused our analysis on the diversity of comammox nitrospira only the quality filtered comammox specific amoa gene amplicon sequence reads yielded in total 15 coma amoa asvs which all were phylogenetically affiliated with comammox clade a fig 4 a coma amoa asv1 and 15 were affiliated with clade a2 sequences while the remaining coma amoa asvs clustered within clade a1 fig 4a coma amoa asv8 9 12 and 20 were closely related to candidatus nitrospira nitrosa coma amoa asv2 7 were clustered with activated sludge clones and coma amoa asv10 16 and 17 with clones mainly from drinking water production systems fig 4a just two asvs coma amoa asv1 and asv2 accounted for 51 3 94 0 of all reads during the analyzed period fig 4b starting from an initially more diverse comammox nitrospira community coma amoa asv1 increased from initially 51 0 on day 96 to a maximum abundance of 84 2 on day 306 whereas the abundances of all other asvs decreased over this time period subsequently coma amoa asv1 relative abundances slowly declined with a simultaneous increase of coma amoa asv2 from initially 0 3 4 5 between days 96 and 306 to 44 5 of all comammox amoa genes on day 404 becoming nearly equal with coma amoa asv1 49 6 by day 488 coma amoa asv2 59 2 had overcome the previously dominant coma amoa asv1 31 1 and by day 602 completely dominated by accounting for 83 2 of all reads fig 4b interestingly this shift in dominant coma amoa asv corresponded perfectly to the onset of copper dosing on day 380 thus based on their high relative abundances coma amoa asv1 and asv2 correspond to the primary contributors to ammonia oxidation in the bioreactor but apparently react differentially to increases in ammonium loading and copper availability 3 4 correlation between ammonia oxidizing guild and ammonia oxidation rate correlations between the relative abundances of amplicon sequencing reads of each asv and observed ammonia oxidation rates were investigated using pearson s correlation for operational phase i viii 1 up to day 561 the data point at day 602 was excluded because the main ammonia oxidizer drastically changed while the ammonia oxidation rate remained high among the 16s asvs we found the highest correlation coefficient with the observed ammonia oxidation rates for the nitrospira affiliated 16s asv1 r 0 75 fig 5 additionally we examined correlations between the relative abundance of each coma amoa asv and ammonia oxidation rates fig 5 and supplementary fig 4 despite its low initial abundance coma amoa asv2 showed a very strong positive correlation r 0 99 whereas there was a negative correlation for coma amoa asv1 r 0 85 fig 5 and all other amoa asvs supplementary fig 4 after the first addition of copper wire on day 380 the ammonium removal efficiency reached almost 100 and the ammonia oxidation rate thus is limited by the ammonium loading rate and not copper availability any longer although copper limitation was alleviated only 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 were highly correlated with the ammonia oxidation rate fig 5 supplementary fig 4 indicating that other nitrifiers were outcompeted for ammonia and copper by this specific comammox member thus these correlations provide additional evidence that one discrete comammox nitrospira population is the predominant ammonia oxidizing microorganism in this bioreactor at least until day 561 of reactor operation however while this analysis indicates this comammox nitrospira to be represented by 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 these data are insufficient to fully resolve this link as concretely as their presence in the same isolate or genome 3 5 transcriptional activities of ammonia oxidizers based on the amoa gene in order to estimate the transcriptional activity of the different ammonia oxidizing microorganisms detected in the system rt pcr was performed on rna extracted on day 404 of bioreactor operation supplementary fig 5 we used nine primer combinations including the established primer pair targeting the nitrosomonadaceae amoa gene amoa 1f 2r several newly developed primer combinations to cover the majority of nitrosomonadaceae reference sequences supplementary fig 1 as well as two new primer sets specifically targeting the dominant comammox amoa asvs detected in our amplicon analysis supplementary table 1 nitrosomonadaceae amoa genes were undetectable with all primer combinations tested including those specifically designed to have a better coverage of the genera nitrosomonas nsom 1f 1r 2f 2r and 1f 2r primer sets and nitrosospira nsos 1f 1r 2f 2r and 1f 2r primer sets contrastingly the amoa genes of nitrospira asv1 and asv2 could be detected using the specific primer pairs coma amoa asv1 f r and asv2 f r respectively the rt pcr results indicated high levels of expression of coma amoa asv2 much higher than coma amoa asv1 supplementary fig 5 despite the comparable relative abundance levels of these asvs in the amplicon sequencing dataset on day 404 fig 4b thus rt pcr inferred activity levels also suggest that coma amoa asv2 represents the main ammonia oxidizing population in the bioreactor at this time point corroborating its positive correlation with observed ammonia oxidation rates 3 6 effect of copper on ammonia oxidation influent copper concentration was 0 30 0 17 µg l 4 7 2 7 nm during the operational period which we hypnotized to be limiting ammonia oxidation copper wire immersion into the bioreactor markedly changed the observed ammonia oxidation rates and efficiencies fig 2 and also had a strong influence on the dominant nitrifying population in the beginning of the experiment when no copper wires were immersed into the bioreactor the ammonia oxidation rate slowly improved fig 2 but did not exceed 18 0 13 6 mg n l day on average fig 6 a almost immediately after copper wire immersion 0 039 m2 m3 tank the ammonia oxidation rate increased and reached maximally 150 7 64 8 n mg l day as well as near complete removal efficiency 94 1 8 3 these oxidation rates did not change significantly upon an initial addition of wire 0 057 m2 m3 but a further increment in copper wire immersion 0 077 m2 m3 tank did stimulate the ammonia oxidation rate to 246 5 38 0 mg n l day this however could not be further enhanced by the addition of more copper wire 0 116 m2 m3 tank thus consistent with our expectations ammonia oxidation rates increased incrementally with the amount of copper wire immersed we analyzed the relationship between the percentage of nitrifiers and the amount of copper wire immersion based on the phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene asv3 and 11 were regarded as canonical nitrospira asv1 and 310 as comammox nitrospira and asv7 was omitted as its affiliation was not clear fig 6b interestingly also the major nitrifying bacterial population changed in response to the copper dose prior to copper wire immersion one comammox nitrospira species 16s asv1 was the most abundant nitrifier at 9 8 5 4 of the community and increased to 32 0 5 3 following initial copper wire immersion 0 039 m2 m3 tank as also reflected by the observed positive correlation of this asv with ammonia oxidation rates fig 5 however once copper wire immersion reached 0 077 m2 m3 tank there was an apparent shift in the bioreactor community favoring nitrosomonas 16s asv10 16 and canonical nitrospira 16s asv3 11 in this study the increase of ammonium loading rates and copper stimulation were performed simultaneously and their effects on the nitrifier dynamics in the system thus are confounded however the initial increase in loading rates with simultaneous copper stimulation in phase iv resulted in a significant increase in the relative abundance of only the dominant comammox nitrospira within 10 days 16s asv1 24 9 to 37 8 while no other nitrifier increased within the community fig 3 subsequently comammox nitrospira were dominating the system until at least day 561 thus 42 days after increasing ammonium loading to the final rate in phase viii fig 3 supplementary table 2 nitrosomonas like aob only became dominant by day 602 that is 31 days after a further increase of copper dosing fig 3 this strongly indicates that the increased substrate availability due to higher ammonium loading rates was not the determining factor to select for aob but that this shift was caused by the additional copper dosing overall supplying copper to the bioreactor positively influenced the ammonium removal capacity and efficiency and ultimately initiated a shift in the predominant community members driving nitrification in the system 4 discussion 4 1 identification of the major ammonia oxidizer in the groundwater treating bioreactor pearson s correlation analysis between ammonia oxidation rates and relative abundance of 16s rrna or comammox amoa genes showed that the main nitrifiers in the bioreactor are represented by 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 fig 5 correlation analysis of the relative abundances of 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 is high at r 0 77 supplementary fig 6 thus 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 seem to be one nitrospira species however the discrepancy in the abundance patterns especially the apparent dominance of 16s asv1 but absence of coma amoa asv2 on day 96 obscured this connection one possible explanation for the discrepancy in abundance patterns is that 16s asv1 may represent a population consisting of multiple closely related species which corresponded to coma amoa asv3 and 7 at early time points and shifted to coma amoa asv2 at later time points fig 4 this is corroborated by the high degree of sequence identity of coma amoa asv2 3 and 7 nucleotide identity 97 and the increased pearson s correlation coefficient with 16s asv1 when these closely related coma amoa asvs were grouped supplementary fig 6 additionally it seemed that a strong amplification bias could have been caused by mismatches in the primer set ntsp amoa 162f 358r fowler et al 2018 used to amplify the comammox amoa we performed a primer match analysis for near full length amoa sequences with high similarities to the coma amoa asvs obtained in this study see supplemental methods supplementary fig 7 this showed that nitrospira sp st bin4 a close relative of coma amoa asv1 had 0 and 1 mismatches to the forward and reverse f r primers respectively on the contrary nitrospira sp uba5702 which is closely related to coma amoa asv2 had 2 mismatches to both primers this difference in sequence similarity of the primers to their target sequences could result in a more efficient amplification of coma amoa asv1 than coma amoa asv2 thus the initial observation of presence of 16s asv1 fig 3b with concurrent absence of coma amoa asv2 fig 4b may result from this primer bias causing overestimation of coma amoa asv1 abundances and strong underestimation of coma amoa asv2 from day 393 onward there was a strong shift from coma amoa asv1 to coma amoa asv2 which became the dominant amoa asv by day 561 fig 4b while the initial abundance of coma amoa asv1 was likely overestimated due to the observed primer bias this shift still indicates slightly different ecological niches of these two comammox species presumably defined by copper availability as at this stage 16s asv1 was the only nitrospira remaining in the system fig 3b this confirms not only that 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 represent the same comammox nitrospira but also that this comammox nitrospira was the dominant ammonia oxidizer in the bioreactor 4 2 comammox nitrospira are wide spread independent of environmental ammonium concentrations most analyses of the microbial community present in groundwater treatment facilities performed to date reported a dominant role of comammox nitrospira in ammonium removal however their inflow ammonium concentrations usually were 1 mg nh4 l fowler et al 2018 palomo et al 2016 poghosyan et al 2020 wagner et al 2019 which is approximately 1 10th the concentration in this system batch experiments using a range of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms demonstrated that the comammox species nitrospira inopinata has a higher affinity for ammonia than aob and many non marine aoa and are expected to outcompete these other ammonia oxidizers at ammonium concentrations 0 5 mg n l and 0 1 mg n l respectively kits et al 2017 this high ammonia affinity of comammox nitrospira was also confirmed for candidatus nitrospira kreftii recently sakoula et al 2020 despite the relatively high ammonium concentrations of 9 3 0 5 mg nh4 n l in the inflow we found that comammox nitrospira remained the dominant nitrifying microorganisms for 561 days of operation furthermore two independent sequencing datasets indicated the abundance of one specific nitrospira species represented by 16s asv1 and coma amoa asv2 to be strongly correlated to ammonia oxidation rates making it the probable primary driver of ammonia oxidation in this bioreactor similarly several studies found comammox nitrospira to dominate in certain wastewater treatment plants and agricultural soils with elevated ammonium concentrations 10 mg nh4 l cotto et al 2020 liu et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 together these data suggest that additional factors besides ammonium concentrations like e g oxygen availability and solids retention time may contribute to the ecological success of comammox nitrospira cotto et al 2020 roots et al 2019 shao and wu 2021 4 3 copper concentrations may critically influence the competition between ammonia oxidizers copper is a metal cofactor required for ammonia monooxygenase activity ammonia oxidation by nitrosomonas europaea was stimulated by copper addition at concentrations ranging from 5 0 to 30 0 μg l 78 7 to 472 1 nm loveless and painter 1968 and the aoa candidatus nitrosopumilus maritimus scm1 became growth limited at copper concentrations 10 nm equivalent to 0 6 μg l amin et al 2013 for comammox nitrospira inopinata cultivation the used copper concentration was 20 μg l 117 3 nm daims et al 2015 although the copper affinity of comammox nitrospira has not yet been experimentally determined other studies on comammox nitrospira dominated groundwater treating rapid sand filters that displayed incomplete nitrification reported that ammonia oxidation rates were improved after increasing copper concentrations from native 0 04 μg l 0 6 nm to maximally 1 5 μg l 23 6 nm wagner et al 2018 this increase in nitrification rates appeared with a concurrent increase in abundance of both comammox nitrospira and nitrosomonadaceae aob although nitrosomonas spp increased 10 fold in response to copper dosing while comammox nitrospira abundances remained within the same order of magnitude wagner et al 2019 in this study the influent copper concentration was as low as 0 30 μg l 4 7 nm and thus below the reported copper requirements of aob and aoa and thus we hypothesized copper to be a limiting factor for ammonia oxidation confirming this hypothesis copper wire immersion into the bioreactor rapidly increased ammonia oxidation rate and efficiency fig 2 interestingly despite the presence of multiple different ammonia oxidizing lineages in our bioreactor only the abundance of comammox nitrospira 16s asv1 robustly responded during the initial copper wire immersion of 0 039 m2 m3 tank fig 6 this indicates that comammox nitrospira were copper limited in the system and were more sensitive to small changes in copper concentrations than aob a further increase in copper dosing apparently favored nitrosomonadaceae aob populations with a concurrent decrease of comammox nitrospira 16s asv1 relative abundance fig 6 thus our results provide additional evidence that comammox nitrospira have a lower copper requirement than nitrosomonadaceae aob but comammox nitrospira may still be copper limited at natural groundwater concentrations taken together our data for the first time suggests that copper availability can exert a strong selective pressure on ammonia oxidizing populations and that copper limitation increases the competitiveness of comammox nitrospira in systems with increased ammonium concentrations 5 conclusions we investigated microbial community composition and nitrification efficiency in a bioreactor supplied with groundwater containing 9 3 0 5 mg n l ammonium for approximately 700 days a combination of 16s rrna and amoa gene amplicon sequencing approaches revealed that one comammox nitrospira lineage was strongly correlated with reactor performance during varied ammonium loading and copper dosing intriguingly moderate increases in copper availability led to increased nitrification efficiency together with a dominance of this comammox nitrospira over an initially more diverse ammonia oxidizing community while high copper dosage ultimately inverted the most abundant nitrifying population from comammox nitrospira to nitrosomonadaceae aob and canonical nitrospira while the effect of copper dosing on nitrifier community composition cannot fully be separated from the influence of increased ammonium loading in our experimental setup copper availability appeared to impose a stronger selection for specific nitrifying populations than expected from pure culture studies focusing on affinities for ammonia these results provide new insights for understanding the ecophysiology and niche adaptation of comammox nitrospira as well as for means to control the nitrification process in drinking water production declaration of competing interest the

16363,the utilization of natural ores and or mine waste as substrate in constructed wetlands cws to enhance nutrient removal performance has been gaining high popularity recently however the knowledge regarding the long term feasibility and key removal mechanisms particularly the potential negative environmental effects of contaminants leached from mine waste is far insufficient this study for the first time performed a critical assessment by using different cws with three mine waste coal gangue iron ore and manganese ore as substrates in a 385 day experiment treating wastewater with varying nutrient loadings the results showed that the addition of mine waste in cws increased removal of total phosphorus tp by 17 34 and total nitrogen tn by 11 51 the higher removal of tp is mainly attributed to the strong binding mechanism of phosphate with the oxides and hydroxides of mn fe and or al which are leached out of mine waste moreover integration of mine waste in cws also significantly stimulated biofilm establishment and enriched the relative abundance of key functional genes related to the nitrogen cycle supporting the observed high rate nitrogen removal however leaching of heavy metals fe mn cu and cr from the beded mine waste in the experimented cws was monitored which further influenced cytoplasmic enzymes and created oxidative stress damage to plants resulting in a decline of nutrient uptake by plants keywords constructed wetlands mine waste nutrient removal heavy metals environmental risks 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws as a set of recognized green eco technology has been rapidly expanded application from the treatment of traditional sewage to the treatment of landfill leachates various agricultural and industrial effluents due to their low energy input easy operation and robustness wu et al 2019 ma et al 2021 the removal of pollutants in cws is mainly driven by the synergy of the three components including plants substrates and microorganisms yang et al 2018 among those substrates known as filling medium are considered to be the indispensable component in cws because it can support plant growth intercept pollutants and provide reactive substances for pollutant transformation vohla et al 2011 most importantly the surface microenvironment such as specific surface area pore volume and elemental composition of substrates could affect the establishment of biofilms and microbial community structure which has an important impact on the treatment efficiency and sustainability of cws wu et al 2014 deng et al 2021 generally the physical chemical and biological properties of substrates should be considered in the selection for optimizing the treatment performance of cws delgado et al 2020 traditional substrates such as sand and gravel are used mainly for supporting plants in cws brix and arias 2005 but they often has an unsatisfactory treatment capacity especially in nutrient removal yang et al 2018 this shortcoming has thus driven the continued development and application of alternative substrates such as steel slag blanco et al 2016 ceramsite fu et al 2020 attapulgite yin et al 2017 calcite pap et al 2020 and others are usually selected as the substrate of cws to meet the effluent quality requirements these substrates are generally superior to gravel in wastewater treatment mainly because of their high permeability large specific surface area and or as effective carriers for functional microbial and pollutant sorbents however the ensuing restrictions such as steel slag making the cws environment alkaline blanco et al 2016 ceramsite causing unsuitable growth conditions for wetland plants fu et al 2020 the high cost of biochar deng et al 2021 attapulgite and calcite have clogging and other problems yang et al 2018 which makes people worry about the applicability and service life of these substrates in cws therefore there is still a need to developed and evaluated potential environmentally friendly high nutrient removing substitutes with low cost wide sources and high safety as substrates for cws mine waste are the inevitable by product in the mining and milling processes and large quantities of mine waste would cause serious environmental damage such as acidic effluents and toxic metal release zhou et al 2019 according to the chinese academy of land and resources economics china had stored about 20 7 gt mine waste by the end of 2018 zhang et al 2020 among them coal gangue reserves have reached 4 5 5 gt with a growing rate of 0 37 0 55 gt per year zhou et al 2019 similarly more than 10 gt of iron ore wastes have been released as hazardous waste in china luo et al 2020 however the reasonable disposal of these mine waste is particularly challenging because of increasingly strict environmental requirements on the other hand mine waste have been considered extensively as an alternative adsorbent for treating wastewater due to their unique physicochemical properties yin et al 2017 for example coal gangue and iron ore contain higher fe2o3 sio2 and al2o3 which have good affinity with phosphate luo et al 2020 recently natural ores or mine wastes have been shown to be a promising biofilm carrier due to its high hydraulic properties large specific surface area and biological affinity and have been widely used as substrates in cws yang et al 2018 particularly other studies have also found that ore matrix including pyrite and pyrrhotite had the potential to promote autotrophic denitrification and phosphorus precipitation simultaneously in cws ge et al 2019 liang et al 2020 besides yang et al 2019 indicated that manganese mn ore significantly promoted the removal of tn and tp in cws this is because manganese ore by a rich ore mn oxide mainly mno2 and iron oxide having a high oxidation reduction potential of strong oxidants ding et al 2015 the above mentioned research provided valuable insights on enhancing tn and tp removal by using mine waste in wetlands unfortunately there are still some major challenges in the investigation and application of natural ore or mine waste that may have been overlooked before the previous studies have focused on how the addition of mine waste to cws affects the biogeochemical cycling of c n and p marchand et al 2010 but they seem to focus only on improving the performance and capacity of pollutant removal and neglect some environmental risks for instance the long term release behavior of heavy metal ions including beneficial heavy metals and harmful heavy metals in the mine waste substrates is still unclear let alone whether these heavy metal ions will respond to the growth of plants in cws and the evolution of microbial communities meanwhile there have always been controversial on the role of these ore substrates in cws and it is still unclear that matrix adsorption or microorganisms is the key underlying removal mechanism in ore based cws therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to explore the long term feasibility of using mine waste coal gangue iron ore and manganese ore in cws for treating nutrient rich wastewater 2 to elucidate the key underlying mechanism involved in nitrogen and phosphorus removal by mine waste based cws by sorption kinetics physiological responses of wetland plants as well as microbial characteristics and 3 to assess potential environmental risks of heavy metals released from mine waste and it impacts on wetland plants and microbial community in cws 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction and operation of experimental systems four types of cws cw a coal gangue cw b iron ore cw c manganese ore cw d control made of transparent plexiglass cylindrical were used in this study fig s1 the interior of each wetland system 50 15 cm was divided into three layers 5 cm bottom layer of gravel particle size 5 7 cm 40 cm middle layer particle size 1 5 2 cm of gravel and different mine waste substrates mixed at a volume ratio of 1 1 and 5 cm top layer of fine sand particle size 0 1 cm all ore materials were crushed and sieved to a particle size of about 15 20 mm and washed with tap water and then dried for the experiments the element composition of materials was analyzed by xrf spectroscopy table s1 all systems were planted with healthy iris pseudacorus approximately 8 cm in height 35 g in fresh weight at a density of six rhizomes per system with a 2 5 l working volume size zhou et al 2020 after the establishment of each wetland system the plants and microorganisms were acclimated for about one month all experimental systems were operated in a sequencing fill and drain mode and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 7 days in this study simulated wastewater was used and the whole experiment of 385 days was divided into two operating stages stage i and ii according to different influent conditions the characteristics of the influent during the experimental period are listed in table s2 and more details about wetland microcosms and operation are described in text s1 in the supporting information 2 2 experimental procedures the schematic diagram of the experimental design is shown in fig 1 in order to comprehensively investigate the key underlying mechanism involved in mine waste based cws and the potential environmental risks the experiments were performed by evaluating the water quality and responses of plants and substrates for wetland plants the indicators of plant growth biomass nutrient assimilation absorption and physiological and biochemical responses were investigated the substrate was analyzed by measuring the composition of different substrate materials static adsorption experiment microbial community diversity and metabolites in the substrate the cumulative leaching amount and leaching rate of heavy metals and long term nutrient content in effluent were also determined 2 3 sampling and analysis 2 3 1 water sampling and analysis the influent and effluent were sampled every 7 d and then measured immediately in the laboratory all samples were filtered through cellulose acetate membranes with a pore size of 0 45 µm for measurements of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp according to the methods described in the standards apha 2005 the ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured by a dual probe multiparameter meter hq40d hach usa total organic carbon toc were also monitored and the results are shown in fig s2 in addition the contents of heavy metals fe mn cu and cr in the effluent were monitored by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icap rq icp ms thermo scientific usa according to the rule of heavy metal leaching samples was collected every 7 days in the first month and then sampled every 28 days the heavy metals effective release and release rate was calculated text s2 2 3 2 substrates sampling and analysis 2 3 2 1 batch adsorption experiments to further understand the role of four different substrates in the reduction of nutrient batch adsorption tests including kinetic adsorption and isothermal adsorption were performed in this study to evaluate the adsorption complexes of nitrogen and phosphorus pseudo first order pseudo second order langmuir and freundlich models were employed to fit the sorption data in nonlinear fitting all experiments were conducted in triplicates and the detailed experimental procedures are described in text s2 2 3 2 2 microbial community analysis to assess the response of microbial community in wetland systems with different materials appropriate substrate samples were uniformly collected for the extraction of microbial dna in each wetland at the end of the experiment the detailed procedures are illustrated in text s3 2 3 2 3 microbial metabolites analysis in this study the characteristics of extracellular polymeric substances eps including soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly b eps tb eps of biofilms on substrates in wetland systems was analyzed to explore the response of microbial metabolism based on the method by zhou et al 2020 all s eps lb eps and tb eps samples were quantified by measuring dissolved organic carbon doc using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu japan text s4 2 3 3 plant sampling and analysis to investigate the response of plants in different wetland systems the growth height and density in each system was recorded regularly every month during the long term experiment total contents of nitrogen and phosphorus in plant tissue were determined by 3 aa3autoanalyzer bran luebbe inc german and the detailed analytical procedures are described in text s5 additionally plant samples in different wetland systems were collected in different stages and several biochemical indices including superoxide dismutase sod and malondialdehyde mda as indicators of oxidative damage were measured to understand the physiological response of plants wang et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term treatment performance 3 1 1 phosphorus removal as shown in fig 2 d average effluent tp concentrations in four wetland systems ranged from 0 38 mg l 1 to 0 81 mg l 1 with the corresponding removal efficiencies of 57 33 77 47 removal rate 0 02 0 03 g m 2 d 1 at the stage i table s3 specifically cw b and cw c achieved the best phosphorus removal performance in the stage ii average effluent tp concentrations in cw a gradually increased and even exceeded the effluent concentration in the control system at the later stage about 245 d this may be because the adsorption of phosphorus by coal gangue matrix gradually reached saturation state and desorption phenomenon occurred leading to the worse phosphorus removal in coal gangue system however effluent tp concentrations in cw b and cw c systems with iron ore and manganese ore remained stable after 385 days of operation while the control system cw d fluctuated greatly in addition wetland systems with mine waste had a better phosphorus removal with a removal rate of 2 5 times higher than that in the control system which could be related to the physicochemical properties of the selected ore substrates previous studies have shown that 70 87 of phosphorus would be removed by substrates in cws mainly through iron and aluminum fixation in substrates or precipitation of metal ions vohla et al 2011 yang et al 2018 the higher content of free iron colloidal iron and aluminum in the matrix the higher the number of fixed ferric phosphate and aluminum phosphate and thus the higher the ability of phosphorus purification munira et al 2018 liang et al 2020 according to xrf data table s1 the high proportion of fe si mn and al in ore substrates further proved the phosphorus removal performance in wetland systems coupling with ore matrix in this study 3 1 2 nitrogen removal under the low influent loading stage i average removal efficiencies of nh4 n no3 n and tn in mine waste based cws were 42 94 51 96 removal rate 0 07 0 11 g m 2 d 1 55 65 74 93 removal rate 0 15 0 21 g m 2 d 1 and 40 38 51 63 removal rate 0 16 0 25 g m 2 d 1 which was significantly higher than that in control systems fig 2 and table s3 a low nh4 n removal obtained in different cws might be due to the limited oxygenation during intermittent batch influent and the oxygen secretion from the roots of wetland plants wang et al 2019 the poor no3 n and tn removal was also presented in the initial stage owing to the lack of carbon sources the denitrification process was inhibited and resulted in a higher effluent nitrate and nitrite concentration fig s2 and fig s4 jia et al 2020 while under the high influent loading stage ii nh4 n no3 n and tn removal in mine waste based cws were much higher with average removal efficiencies of 41 44 70 89 removal rate 0 12 0 31 g m 2 d 1 96 17 97 74 removal rate 0 228 0 231 g m 2 d 1 and 58 38 79 75 removal rate 0 31 0 54 g m 2 d 1 respectively the nh4 n removal rates especially in manganese ore based cws ascended clearly with the increase of influent loading the best long term nh4 n removal may be attributed to the physical and chemical properties of manganese ore material itself xie et al 2018 ding et al 2015 for the excellent no3 n and tn removal in mine waste based cws in stage ii the possible reasons may be that the high influent loading c n 6 1 supplied the sufficient carbon sources for achieving the complete denitrification process without nitrite nitrogen accumulation fig s2 and fig s4 jia et al 2020 it should be noted that the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and tn in cw a had a little gradual increase with the extension of operation time which may be caused by the gradual saturation of the adsorption capacity of nh4 n by coal gangue substrate on the whole the application of mine waste could enhance nitrogen removal substantially in treating nutrient rich wastewaters and more details of driving mechanism and processes should be discussed for better understand the role of mine wastes in cws 3 2 underlying mechanism 3 2 1 sorption kinetics of substrates in order to evaluate the adsorption capacity the equilibrium adsorption capacity of nh4 n and tp of four selected substrates coal gangue iron ore manganese ore and gravel was systematically studied the static adsorption capacities of nh4 n and tp by four substrates were closely related to their initial concentrations in addition manganese ore had a strong ability to adsorb nh4 n and tp in water followed by coal gangue iron ore gravel fig s5 langmuir and freundlich isothermal models were used to fit the equilibrium data table s4 and langmuir model can well explain the adsorption of nh4 n on four ore substrates r2 0 95 the relevant parameters suggested that ammonium ions conformed to monolayer adsorption on different ore based adsorbents blanco et al 2016 similarly freundlich isothermal model indicated that the phosphate adsorption process of four mineral groups belonged to the multi layer coverage of active sites with non uniform distribution on the surface pap et al 2020 which is consistent with the previous studies karapinar et al 2006 xiao et al 2017 moreover the magnitude of freundlich constant n 1 of four substrates demonstrated that adsorption process was favorable for nh4 n and tp removal in this study fig s5c and fig s5d shows the adsorption kinetics of nh4 n and tp on coal gangue iron ore manganese ore and gravel among different substrates manganese ore had the high adsorption rate of on nh4 n and tp with the maximum adsorption capacity pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso kinetic models based on the experimental data indicated that chemical adsorption rather than diffusion ion exchange may be the rate limiting step of adsorption process of nh4 n and tp in different ores table s5 pap et al 2020 all these results could explain the stronger nutrient adsorption capacity of coal gangue iron ore and manganese ore to a certain extent overall the adsorption capacity of the matrix was basically consistent with the long term decontamination effect of cws so it could be inferred that the good purification effect of ore based cws on tp is mainly attributed to the adsorption capacity of the matrix itself in addition due to the limited do in the system the nitrification reaction of nh4 n was relatively weak fig s3 and s4 therefore the adsorption of substrates in each ore based wetland could be the key for the nh4 n removal 3 2 2 microbial community structure the variation of bacterial community in different cws is shown in fig 3 the number of otus in four different cws was 1521 cw a cw b 1452 cw c 1819 and cw d 1046 respectively similarly there were significant differences in community richness chao1 and species diversity shannon index among different cws table s6 the higher the richness and diversity of microbial community composition in mine waste based cws indicated that the addition of tailings had a positive effect on the microbial community in cws yang et al 2019 which also indirectly confirmed better remove nutrients results obtained in three ore based systems cw a cw b and cw c these results were essentially in agreement with that in previous study which showed that matrix materials containing metal elements promoted chao1 shannon and simpson indexes of cws liang et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 the venn diagram showed a total of 7188 otus for 15 regions and much more specific otus to another region in cw c fig 3c reflected the higher abundance of microbial community and further explained the highest n and p removal rate in wetland systems by adding manganese ore fig 3 a shows the dominant dynamics of the microbial community at the phylum level the dominant bacteria reads of all samples in different cws belonged to 6 phyla of proteobacteria 18 76 53 20 saccharibacteria 9 01 60 39 actinobacteria 8 62 13 28 bacteroidetes 3 62 11 75 respectively proteobacteria has a high level of metabolic diversity of bacteria which is usually associated with the global carbon or nitrogen cycle and dominates the wastewater treatment process jia et al 2020 compared with control systems the relative abundance of proteobacteria in cw a cw b and cw c were 34 90 53 20 indicating that the mine wastes can improve the abundance of nitrogen fixing microorganisms in cws yang et al 2019 in addition the higher abundance of actinobacteria playing a crucial role in the n and c cycles of hydrating bacteria in three ore based systems cw a cw b and cw c suggested that the addition of coal gangue iron ore and manganese ore could enhance the abundance of actinomycetes and thus contribute to a better nutrient removal tian et al 2019 however the addition of tailings would significantly reduce the abundance of saccharibacteria inside the cws resulting in a poor degradation of organic matter fig s2 tomonori et al 2016 the lowest toc concentration in cw d may be attributed to the glucose metabolism of high abundance saccharibacteria 60 37 under anaerobic conditions at the class level the abundance of betaproteobacteria in cw a and cw b 42 55 and 28 45 was much higher fig 3b these results could explain the high tn removal rate in cws with coal gangue and iron ore and the presence of s and fe elements in these substrates may provide electrons for denitrification processes thus driving autogenous denitrification in cws in cw c alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were the dominant bacteria accounting for 33 02 and 11 29 respectively this finding is consistent with previous results xie et al 2018 and gammaproteobacteria could drive the increase of the abundance of manganese oxidizing bacteria and the formation of biogenic manganese oxides blothe et al 2015 in manganese ore based cws mn ii as an electron donor participated in the mn cycle of gammaproteobacteria to accelerate the anaerobic oxidation of pollutants xie et al 2018 therefore an alternative denitrification pathway coupled with anoxic nitrification and mn ii reduction denitrification was finally formed yang et al 2019 3 2 3 functional genes for nitrogen cycling potential nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria and relative abundances of nitrogen cycle s functional genes in different cws are presented in figs 3d and 4 wetland systems with the addition of tailings have significant differences in the enzyme activity of n transformation p 0 05 specifically relative abundances of genes driving nh4 oxidation including ammonooxygenase amo hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and assimilative nitrate reductase nir in cw a cw b and cw c were higher than that in cw d table s7 previous studies have confirmed that microbial nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation enhanced the immobilization of nitrogen in anoxic environment thus improving the nitrogen removal in cws ma et al 2021 in addition relative abundances of membrane binding enzyme nar copper bearing nitrite reductase nirk and cu fe nitric oxide reductase nor are relatively high in cw a and cw b indicating that metal elements contained in tailings can promote the reduction process of nitrate under hypoxia condition in cws for cw c the relative abundance of periplasmic dissimilar nitrate reductase nap and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh was highest this proved that manganese mineral matrix in cws might mediate the direct conversion of nitrite to nitrogen by anammox reaction using nitrite as terminal electron acceptor kuypers et al 2018 in addition cw d had the highest abundance of urease ure c and cyanate esterase cyn which indicated that cw d had the highest intensity of converting nh4 n into organic nitrogen under anaerobic conditions since the adsorption capacity of gravel in cw d was relatively small fig s5 the removal of nh4 n in cws at this time may be mainly due to the conversion of anaerobic bacteria to organic nitrogen for microbial metabolism 3 2 4 co occurrence between community composition and metabolic function and eps components fig 5 a shows that the total eps amount of three ore based systems about 1 58 5 76 times higher than the control system particularly cw c 835 15 mg l 1 was significantly higher than that in cw d previous studies have also showed that microorganisms could produce more eps in the presence of heavy metals aquino and stuckey 2004 this could also explain why the microbial composition of cw a cw b and cw c was relatively rich and diverse which was more conducive to nutrient removal as shown in fig 5a the amount of s eps was the largest in all cws accounting for 49 78 78 25 of the total eps followed by tb eps 13 77 25 26 and lb eps 4 78 24 96 fig 5b shows the relative distribution of parafac components in different types of eps determined by eem parafac modeling and four fluorescent components c1 c4 including tryptophan like uvc humic like uva humic like and tyrosine like were identified table s8 wang et al 2021 among different components in s eps and lb eps relative abundances of c1 c2 and c3 were the highest which can be explained by the absorption of bacterial metabolism and humus along with other dissolved solids or inorganic colloid on the bacterial cell wall table s9 in tb eps c1 and c4 components were dominant previous studies have reported that protein and tryptophan components represented the availability of dom by microorganisms which can be produced or consumed by microorganisms hambly et al 2015 the content of s eps produced by microbial metabolism was higher than that consumed by microbial degradation leading to the accumulation of s eps and more s eps could also adsorb more pollutants on the substrate surface of cws zhou et al 2020 this is due to the presence of different functional groups e g amino carboxyl phosphate and hydroxyl in the polysaccharides and lipid proteins that make up microbial eps and these functional groups act as bio absorbents by generating attraction between pollutants and cell walls siddharth et al 2021 previous studies have also proved that functional properties such as cell aggregation to form biofilms and surface adhesion improve the ability of eps to accumulate nutrients and form protective barriers and water absorption properties on matrix surface more et al 2014 however lb eps and tb eps are usually associated with microbial activity but excessive lb eps and tb eps may cause blockage of cws overall the addition of tailings in cws could achieve higher denitrification performance but more biofilm formation in cws might accelerate the system blockage the metabolic function of bacterial 16s rrna genes was also predicted using picrust fig s6 the results showed that metabolism 67 23 71 70 was the most important functional category text s6 the potential functions of the top 50 bacteria in the functional subclass level 2 were further analyzed fig s6b and relative abundances of amino acid metabolism metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism energy metabolism lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism pathways in mine waste based systems cw a cw b and cw c were relatively rich particularly relative abundances of biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism in cw c system were significantly high p 0 05 indicating that manganese ore addition stimulated these metabolic pathways yang et al 2019 studies have shown that these high abundance microbial metabolic processes were directly related to glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle which in turn would strengthen the electron transport system and the synthesis of atp ma et al 2021 as we all know electron donors and energy support are essential for denitrification therefore this further confirms that the addition of tailings could catalyze the efficient progress of the denitrification process by increasing the abundance of key genes in addition the obvious changes in cellular community indicated that cellular processes in mine waste based systems were also stronger in short the addition of tailings substrate increased the metabolic capacity of microorganisms resulting in significant changes in the bacterial community within cws and eps production resulting in an increase in dominant functional genes thereby enhancing the ability of cws for removing nutrients 3 3 release behavior and risk assessment of heavy metals 3 3 1 risk assessment of effluent quality most of mine wastes contain a variety of heavy metal elements so it is of great significance to study the long term leaching behavior of heavy metals from cws for the safety and sustainability of wetlands as shown in fig 6 we found that the leaching content of fe in cw b 23 95 µg kg 1 was much higher than that in other cws a weak leaching in cw a and cw c was found with the cumulative leaching after 110 days the leaching rate gradually reaches a stable value of 0 18 0 26 µg kg 1d 1 fig 6b shows that the leaching amount of mn in cw c was maximum followed by cw a and cw b their cumulative leaching amounts varied in 0 17 0 45 µg kg 1 and the leaching rate of mn in wetlands basically reaches a stable level after 80 days fig 6c reflects that the cumulative leaching amount of cu 1 81ug kg 1 in cw b was 2 8 times higher than that of control systems while reveals the maximum leaching amount of cr 0 23 µg kg 1 obtained in cw c fig 6d similarly and the leaching rate of cr and cu in each system had a slightly gradual decrease on the whole the cumulative leaching amount and leaching rate of heavy metals in mine waste based cws were greater than that in control systems especially in the initial 28 days of the experiment from the perspective of dynamics the leaching of most metals in tailings was mainly dominated by scouring and dissolution processes ohki et al 2004 on the other hand it may be because the growth of microbial membrane and eps in the later stage enveloped the substrate and blocked the leaching of heavy metals du et al 2016 or the heavy metals released from the ore are absorbed by eps thus reducing the content of heavy metals in the effluent benedetta et al 2021 early studies showed that among various types of binding sites on eps molecules on biofilms sulfhydryl sites sh are particularly important because they have high affinity for hg as cd cu pb and other metals and can bind and fix heavy metals yu and fein 2016 3 3 2 toxic responses of wetland plants fig 7 a shows the variation of plant height in different mine waste based cws during the operation period and the total height of above ground and below ground sections of plants in different systems ranged in 54 51 100 98 cm this result indicated that the addition of mine wastes could promote the growth of plants significantly which may be resulted from the proper supplements of some essential trace elements fe cu mn etc from tailings in cws similarly there were significant differences in total dry weight biomass among different cws p 0 05 and iron ore based cws reached the higher aboveground and underground biomass table s10 in addition nitrogen storage in plants was highest 32 70 g kg 1 in coal gangue based systems while the highest phosphorus storage in plants was obtained in iron ore based systems 3 39 g kg 1 on the whole nitrogen accumulation in wetland plants was than phosphorus accumulation the mass balance calculation also showed that the amount of nutrient uptake by plant accounted for 9 08 14 36 n and 7 72 11 49 p of the total nutrient removal in cws during the experiment table 1 however it was low compared with some published results this variation may be caused by different plant species nutrient load rates and climatic factors in different studies vymazal and ezinová 2016 interestingly it should be noted that the higher biomass did not have the greater nutrient storage in plants which may be resulted from harmful heavy metals leached from ore substrates in cws previous studies have shown that the presence of heavy metals such as cr cu etc can inhibit the absorption transport and utilization of several elements n p ca mg and k etc by plants riaz et al 2021 in this study the potential heavy metal release from tailings in cws might cause direct or indirect toxic effects which would change the normal metabolism of nutrient in plants ambika et al 2016 it has been found that iron is one of the basic elements in wetland plants and is involved in various growth processes such as respiration photosynthesis and cellular dna synthesis however iron rich substrates may produce iron toxicity to wetland plants both high concentration of reductive iron ions fe2 and low bioavailability of iron ions can cause serious health symptoms of wetland plants thus affecting the role of constructed wetlands in wastewater treatment wu et al 2019 to further determine the influence of cytoplasmic enzymes and oxidative stress damage to plants the changes of sod activity and mda content in plants in cws with four different substrates are exhibited in fig 7b it can be found that sod activity and mda content in plants in mine waste based systems were significantly different from those in control wetland during the stage i and ii it is well known that plant tolerance to oxidative stress is usually associated with high sod activity which is an o2 scavenging enzyme that can resist intracellular reactive oxygen species to combat oxidative stress wang et al 2021 the lower level of sod activity in mine waste based systems cw a cw b and cw c indicated that plants in these systems were subjected to different degrees of adverse environmental stress jia et al 2020 reported that adding cr and pb into cws would cause serious damage to the development and function of plants and this effect was irreversible at least in a short period of time as an indicator of reactive oxygen species ros mda as the main cytotoxic product of lipid peroxidation can be used to evaluate the damage degree of plant membranes in wetland plants wang et al 2021 mda contents of plants in mine waste based cws particularly cw a was significantly higher than that in control systems p 0 05 which indicated the tailings might cause serious ros induced damage in wetland plant tissues due to the leaching of some components such as cu cr and s from the coal gangue ravanbakhsh et al 2019 the excessive accumulation of ros exceeded the elimination capacity or had a negative impact on the synthesis of related proteins ma et al 2021 these results could partly explain the inefficient utilization of nutrients by plants in cws with mine waste substrates in this study knowledge about the interaction between trace elements and plant health and nutrient uptake in constructed wetlands is still insufficient and more research is needed 4 conclusion and application perspectives this study evaluated the long term feasibility 385 d of using three common mine waste as a substrate in cws for treating nutrient rich wastewater the results indicated that the nutrient treatment performance of manganese ore and iron ore based cws were relatively stable while that of coal gangue based cws gradually declined the results indicated that manganese ore and iron ore based cws have the best and relatively stable treatment performance for n and p while the decontamination effect of coal gangue based cws gradually declined fe and mn elements in mine waste can enhance microbial process and media storage thus improving the tn and tp removal performance in cws si and al elements can also be beneficial for the tp reduction in cws application of mine wastes shifted the microbial community structure and richness and diversity of microorganism and promoted the biomass growth of wetland plants resulting in the enhanced nutrient removal in addition the addition of mine waste further increased the metabolic capacity of microorganisms and the adsorption capacity of nutrients however heavy metals leached from the mine waste would affect the water quality of the effluent and decrease the nutrient uptake by plants the increased eps may also accelerate the clogging of cws the use of mine waste as an alternative substrate in cws to remove various pollutants from wastewater has many attractive benefits especially its contribution to reducing the cost of wastewater treatment and enhancing the removal of nutrients while achieving sustainable management of mine waste however it should be noted that the principle of adapting measures to local conditions should be considered in engineering application through energy consumption economic assessment text s7 some tailings landfill sites and remote mountainous areas where mine waste is easily obtained may be more suitable while it would not be appropriate in urban landscape areas because the transportation costs of mine waste and other factors will weaken the sustainability of cws as a green eco technology in addition the chemical reduction of metal ions released from the mine waste may consume oxygen in the wetland and adversely affect aerobic biological processes which needed to be controlled timely and effectively for a sustainable wastewater treatment furthermore the release risk of heavy metals from mine waste could be significantly affected by the addition ratio in cws however another major problem associated with them is the capacity to bio magnify for animals and plants are also worthy of attention therefore it is necessary to further optimize the operation of waste based cws by exploring the dynamic transformation and eco toxicity of heavy metal leaching from mine waste in short the use of waste based cws should be reconsidered dialectically in the future engineering application it is worth exploring in the future to develop combined processes with their own advantages to deal with different polluted water quality and environmental impacts declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16363,the utilization of natural ores and or mine waste as substrate in constructed wetlands cws to enhance nutrient removal performance has been gaining high popularity recently however the knowledge regarding the long term feasibility and key removal mechanisms particularly the potential negative environmental effects of contaminants leached from mine waste is far insufficient this study for the first time performed a critical assessment by using different cws with three mine waste coal gangue iron ore and manganese ore as substrates in a 385 day experiment treating wastewater with varying nutrient loadings the results showed that the addition of mine waste in cws increased removal of total phosphorus tp by 17 34 and total nitrogen tn by 11 51 the higher removal of tp is mainly attributed to the strong binding mechanism of phosphate with the oxides and hydroxides of mn fe and or al which are leached out of mine waste moreover integration of mine waste in cws also significantly stimulated biofilm establishment and enriched the relative abundance of key functional genes related to the nitrogen cycle supporting the observed high rate nitrogen removal however leaching of heavy metals fe mn cu and cr from the beded mine waste in the experimented cws was monitored which further influenced cytoplasmic enzymes and created oxidative stress damage to plants resulting in a decline of nutrient uptake by plants keywords constructed wetlands mine waste nutrient removal heavy metals environmental risks 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws as a set of recognized green eco technology has been rapidly expanded application from the treatment of traditional sewage to the treatment of landfill leachates various agricultural and industrial effluents due to their low energy input easy operation and robustness wu et al 2019 ma et al 2021 the removal of pollutants in cws is mainly driven by the synergy of the three components including plants substrates and microorganisms yang et al 2018 among those substrates known as filling medium are considered to be the indispensable component in cws because it can support plant growth intercept pollutants and provide reactive substances for pollutant transformation vohla et al 2011 most importantly the surface microenvironment such as specific surface area pore volume and elemental composition of substrates could affect the establishment of biofilms and microbial community structure which has an important impact on the treatment efficiency and sustainability of cws wu et al 2014 deng et al 2021 generally the physical chemical and biological properties of substrates should be considered in the selection for optimizing the treatment performance of cws delgado et al 2020 traditional substrates such as sand and gravel are used mainly for supporting plants in cws brix and arias 2005 but they often has an unsatisfactory treatment capacity especially in nutrient removal yang et al 2018 this shortcoming has thus driven the continued development and application of alternative substrates such as steel slag blanco et al 2016 ceramsite fu et al 2020 attapulgite yin et al 2017 calcite pap et al 2020 and others are usually selected as the substrate of cws to meet the effluent quality requirements these substrates are generally superior to gravel in wastewater treatment mainly because of their high permeability large specific surface area and or as effective carriers for functional microbial and pollutant sorbents however the ensuing restrictions such as steel slag making the cws environment alkaline blanco et al 2016 ceramsite causing unsuitable growth conditions for wetland plants fu et al 2020 the high cost of biochar deng et al 2021 attapulgite and calcite have clogging and other problems yang et al 2018 which makes people worry about the applicability and service life of these substrates in cws therefore there is still a need to developed and evaluated potential environmentally friendly high nutrient removing substitutes with low cost wide sources and high safety as substrates for cws mine waste are the inevitable by product in the mining and milling processes and large quantities of mine waste would cause serious environmental damage such as acidic effluents and toxic metal release zhou et al 2019 according to the chinese academy of land and resources economics china had stored about 20 7 gt mine waste by the end of 2018 zhang et al 2020 among them coal gangue reserves have reached 4 5 5 gt with a growing rate of 0 37 0 55 gt per year zhou et al 2019 similarly more than 10 gt of iron ore wastes have been released as hazardous waste in china luo et al 2020 however the reasonable disposal of these mine waste is particularly challenging because of increasingly strict environmental requirements on the other hand mine waste have been considered extensively as an alternative adsorbent for treating wastewater due to their unique physicochemical properties yin et al 2017 for example coal gangue and iron ore contain higher fe2o3 sio2 and al2o3 which have good affinity with phosphate luo et al 2020 recently natural ores or mine wastes have been shown to be a promising biofilm carrier due to its high hydraulic properties large specific surface area and biological affinity and have been widely used as substrates in cws yang et al 2018 particularly other studies have also found that ore matrix including pyrite and pyrrhotite had the potential to promote autotrophic denitrification and phosphorus precipitation simultaneously in cws ge et al 2019 liang et al 2020 besides yang et al 2019 indicated that manganese mn ore significantly promoted the removal of tn and tp in cws this is because manganese ore by a rich ore mn oxide mainly mno2 and iron oxide having a high oxidation reduction potential of strong oxidants ding et al 2015 the above mentioned research provided valuable insights on enhancing tn and tp removal by using mine waste in wetlands unfortunately there are still some major challenges in the investigation and application of natural ore or mine waste that may have been overlooked before the previous studies have focused on how the addition of mine waste to cws affects the biogeochemical cycling of c n and p marchand et al 2010 but they seem to focus only on improving the performance and capacity of pollutant removal and neglect some environmental risks for instance the long term release behavior of heavy metal ions including beneficial heavy metals and harmful heavy metals in the mine waste substrates is still unclear let alone whether these heavy metal ions will respond to the growth of plants in cws and the evolution of microbial communities meanwhile there have always been controversial on the role of these ore substrates in cws and it is still unclear that matrix adsorption or microorganisms is the key underlying removal mechanism in ore based cws therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to explore the long term feasibility of using mine waste coal gangue iron ore and manganese ore in cws for treating nutrient rich wastewater 2 to elucidate the key underlying mechanism involved in nitrogen and phosphorus removal by mine waste based cws by sorption kinetics physiological responses of wetland plants as well as microbial characteristics and 3 to assess potential environmental risks of heavy metals released from mine waste and it impacts on wetland plants and microbial community in cws 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction and operation of experimental systems four types of cws cw a coal gangue cw b iron ore cw c manganese ore cw d control made of transparent plexiglass cylindrical were used in this study fig s1 the interior of each wetland system 50 15 cm was divided into three layers 5 cm bottom layer of gravel particle size 5 7 cm 40 cm middle layer particle size 1 5 2 cm of gravel and different mine waste substrates mixed at a volume ratio of 1 1 and 5 cm top layer of fine sand particle size 0 1 cm all ore materials were crushed and sieved to a particle size of about 15 20 mm and washed with tap water and then dried for the experiments the element composition of materials was analyzed by xrf spectroscopy table s1 all systems were planted with healthy iris pseudacorus approximately 8 cm in height 35 g in fresh weight at a density of six rhizomes per system with a 2 5 l working volume size zhou et al 2020 after the establishment of each wetland system the plants and microorganisms were acclimated for about one month all experimental systems were operated in a sequencing fill and drain mode and the hydraulic retention time hrt was 7 days in this study simulated wastewater was used and the whole experiment of 385 days was divided into two operating stages stage i and ii according to different influent conditions the characteristics of the influent during the experimental period are listed in table s2 and more details about wetland microcosms and operation are described in text s1 in the supporting information 2 2 experimental procedures the schematic diagram of the experimental design is shown in fig 1 in order to comprehensively investigate the key underlying mechanism involved in mine waste based cws and the potential environmental risks the experiments were performed by evaluating the water quality and responses of plants and substrates for wetland plants the indicators of plant growth biomass nutrient assimilation absorption and physiological and biochemical responses were investigated the substrate was analyzed by measuring the composition of different substrate materials static adsorption experiment microbial community diversity and metabolites in the substrate the cumulative leaching amount and leaching rate of heavy metals and long term nutrient content in effluent were also determined 2 3 sampling and analysis 2 3 1 water sampling and analysis the influent and effluent were sampled every 7 d and then measured immediately in the laboratory all samples were filtered through cellulose acetate membranes with a pore size of 0 45 µm for measurements of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp according to the methods described in the standards apha 2005 the ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured by a dual probe multiparameter meter hq40d hach usa total organic carbon toc were also monitored and the results are shown in fig s2 in addition the contents of heavy metals fe mn cu and cr in the effluent were monitored by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icap rq icp ms thermo scientific usa according to the rule of heavy metal leaching samples was collected every 7 days in the first month and then sampled every 28 days the heavy metals effective release and release rate was calculated text s2 2 3 2 substrates sampling and analysis 2 3 2 1 batch adsorption experiments to further understand the role of four different substrates in the reduction of nutrient batch adsorption tests including kinetic adsorption and isothermal adsorption were performed in this study to evaluate the adsorption complexes of nitrogen and phosphorus pseudo first order pseudo second order langmuir and freundlich models were employed to fit the sorption data in nonlinear fitting all experiments were conducted in triplicates and the detailed experimental procedures are described in text s2 2 3 2 2 microbial community analysis to assess the response of microbial community in wetland systems with different materials appropriate substrate samples were uniformly collected for the extraction of microbial dna in each wetland at the end of the experiment the detailed procedures are illustrated in text s3 2 3 2 3 microbial metabolites analysis in this study the characteristics of extracellular polymeric substances eps including soluble eps s eps loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly b eps tb eps of biofilms on substrates in wetland systems was analyzed to explore the response of microbial metabolism based on the method by zhou et al 2020 all s eps lb eps and tb eps samples were quantified by measuring dissolved organic carbon doc using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu japan text s4 2 3 3 plant sampling and analysis to investigate the response of plants in different wetland systems the growth height and density in each system was recorded regularly every month during the long term experiment total contents of nitrogen and phosphorus in plant tissue were determined by 3 aa3autoanalyzer bran luebbe inc german and the detailed analytical procedures are described in text s5 additionally plant samples in different wetland systems were collected in different stages and several biochemical indices including superoxide dismutase sod and malondialdehyde mda as indicators of oxidative damage were measured to understand the physiological response of plants wang et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term treatment performance 3 1 1 phosphorus removal as shown in fig 2 d average effluent tp concentrations in four wetland systems ranged from 0 38 mg l 1 to 0 81 mg l 1 with the corresponding removal efficiencies of 57 33 77 47 removal rate 0 02 0 03 g m 2 d 1 at the stage i table s3 specifically cw b and cw c achieved the best phosphorus removal performance in the stage ii average effluent tp concentrations in cw a gradually increased and even exceeded the effluent concentration in the control system at the later stage about 245 d this may be because the adsorption of phosphorus by coal gangue matrix gradually reached saturation state and desorption phenomenon occurred leading to the worse phosphorus removal in coal gangue system however effluent tp concentrations in cw b and cw c systems with iron ore and manganese ore remained stable after 385 days of operation while the control system cw d fluctuated greatly in addition wetland systems with mine waste had a better phosphorus removal with a removal rate of 2 5 times higher than that in the control system which could be related to the physicochemical properties of the selected ore substrates previous studies have shown that 70 87 of phosphorus would be removed by substrates in cws mainly through iron and aluminum fixation in substrates or precipitation of metal ions vohla et al 2011 yang et al 2018 the higher content of free iron colloidal iron and aluminum in the matrix the higher the number of fixed ferric phosphate and aluminum phosphate and thus the higher the ability of phosphorus purification munira et al 2018 liang et al 2020 according to xrf data table s1 the high proportion of fe si mn and al in ore substrates further proved the phosphorus removal performance in wetland systems coupling with ore matrix in this study 3 1 2 nitrogen removal under the low influent loading stage i average removal efficiencies of nh4 n no3 n and tn in mine waste based cws were 42 94 51 96 removal rate 0 07 0 11 g m 2 d 1 55 65 74 93 removal rate 0 15 0 21 g m 2 d 1 and 40 38 51 63 removal rate 0 16 0 25 g m 2 d 1 which was significantly higher than that in control systems fig 2 and table s3 a low nh4 n removal obtained in different cws might be due to the limited oxygenation during intermittent batch influent and the oxygen secretion from the roots of wetland plants wang et al 2019 the poor no3 n and tn removal was also presented in the initial stage owing to the lack of carbon sources the denitrification process was inhibited and resulted in a higher effluent nitrate and nitrite concentration fig s2 and fig s4 jia et al 2020 while under the high influent loading stage ii nh4 n no3 n and tn removal in mine waste based cws were much higher with average removal efficiencies of 41 44 70 89 removal rate 0 12 0 31 g m 2 d 1 96 17 97 74 removal rate 0 228 0 231 g m 2 d 1 and 58 38 79 75 removal rate 0 31 0 54 g m 2 d 1 respectively the nh4 n removal rates especially in manganese ore based cws ascended clearly with the increase of influent loading the best long term nh4 n removal may be attributed to the physical and chemical properties of manganese ore material itself xie et al 2018 ding et al 2015 for the excellent no3 n and tn removal in mine waste based cws in stage ii the possible reasons may be that the high influent loading c n 6 1 supplied the sufficient carbon sources for achieving the complete denitrification process without nitrite nitrogen accumulation fig s2 and fig s4 jia et al 2020 it should be noted that the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and tn in cw a had a little gradual increase with the extension of operation time which may be caused by the gradual saturation of the adsorption capacity of nh4 n by coal gangue substrate on the whole the application of mine waste could enhance nitrogen removal substantially in treating nutrient rich wastewaters and more details of driving mechanism and processes should be discussed for better understand the role of mine wastes in cws 3 2 underlying mechanism 3 2 1 sorption kinetics of substrates in order to evaluate the adsorption capacity the equilibrium adsorption capacity of nh4 n and tp of four selected substrates coal gangue iron ore manganese ore and gravel was systematically studied the static adsorption capacities of nh4 n and tp by four substrates were closely related to their initial concentrations in addition manganese ore had a strong ability to adsorb nh4 n and tp in water followed by coal gangue iron ore gravel fig s5 langmuir and freundlich isothermal models were used to fit the equilibrium data table s4 and langmuir model can well explain the adsorption of nh4 n on four ore substrates r2 0 95 the relevant parameters suggested that ammonium ions conformed to monolayer adsorption on different ore based adsorbents blanco et al 2016 similarly freundlich isothermal model indicated that the phosphate adsorption process of four mineral groups belonged to the multi layer coverage of active sites with non uniform distribution on the surface pap et al 2020 which is consistent with the previous studies karapinar et al 2006 xiao et al 2017 moreover the magnitude of freundlich constant n 1 of four substrates demonstrated that adsorption process was favorable for nh4 n and tp removal in this study fig s5c and fig s5d shows the adsorption kinetics of nh4 n and tp on coal gangue iron ore manganese ore and gravel among different substrates manganese ore had the high adsorption rate of on nh4 n and tp with the maximum adsorption capacity pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso kinetic models based on the experimental data indicated that chemical adsorption rather than diffusion ion exchange may be the rate limiting step of adsorption process of nh4 n and tp in different ores table s5 pap et al 2020 all these results could explain the stronger nutrient adsorption capacity of coal gangue iron ore and manganese ore to a certain extent overall the adsorption capacity of the matrix was basically consistent with the long term decontamination effect of cws so it could be inferred that the good purification effect of ore based cws on tp is mainly attributed to the adsorption capacity of the matrix itself in addition due to the limited do in the system the nitrification reaction of nh4 n was relatively weak fig s3 and s4 therefore the adsorption of substrates in each ore based wetland could be the key for the nh4 n removal 3 2 2 microbial community structure the variation of bacterial community in different cws is shown in fig 3 the number of otus in four different cws was 1521 cw a cw b 1452 cw c 1819 and cw d 1046 respectively similarly there were significant differences in community richness chao1 and species diversity shannon index among different cws table s6 the higher the richness and diversity of microbial community composition in mine waste based cws indicated that the addition of tailings had a positive effect on the microbial community in cws yang et al 2019 which also indirectly confirmed better remove nutrients results obtained in three ore based systems cw a cw b and cw c these results were essentially in agreement with that in previous study which showed that matrix materials containing metal elements promoted chao1 shannon and simpson indexes of cws liang et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 the venn diagram showed a total of 7188 otus for 15 regions and much more specific otus to another region in cw c fig 3c reflected the higher abundance of microbial community and further explained the highest n and p removal rate in wetland systems by adding manganese ore fig 3 a shows the dominant dynamics of the microbial community at the phylum level the dominant bacteria reads of all samples in different cws belonged to 6 phyla of proteobacteria 18 76 53 20 saccharibacteria 9 01 60 39 actinobacteria 8 62 13 28 bacteroidetes 3 62 11 75 respectively proteobacteria has a high level of metabolic diversity of bacteria which is usually associated with the global carbon or nitrogen cycle and dominates the wastewater treatment process jia et al 2020 compared with control systems the relative abundance of proteobacteria in cw a cw b and cw c were 34 90 53 20 indicating that the mine wastes can improve the abundance of nitrogen fixing microorganisms in cws yang et al 2019 in addition the higher abundance of actinobacteria playing a crucial role in the n and c cycles of hydrating bacteria in three ore based systems cw a cw b and cw c suggested that the addition of coal gangue iron ore and manganese ore could enhance the abundance of actinomycetes and thus contribute to a better nutrient removal tian et al 2019 however the addition of tailings would significantly reduce the abundance of saccharibacteria inside the cws resulting in a poor degradation of organic matter fig s2 tomonori et al 2016 the lowest toc concentration in cw d may be attributed to the glucose metabolism of high abundance saccharibacteria 60 37 under anaerobic conditions at the class level the abundance of betaproteobacteria in cw a and cw b 42 55 and 28 45 was much higher fig 3b these results could explain the high tn removal rate in cws with coal gangue and iron ore and the presence of s and fe elements in these substrates may provide electrons for denitrification processes thus driving autogenous denitrification in cws in cw c alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were the dominant bacteria accounting for 33 02 and 11 29 respectively this finding is consistent with previous results xie et al 2018 and gammaproteobacteria could drive the increase of the abundance of manganese oxidizing bacteria and the formation of biogenic manganese oxides blothe et al 2015 in manganese ore based cws mn ii as an electron donor participated in the mn cycle of gammaproteobacteria to accelerate the anaerobic oxidation of pollutants xie et al 2018 therefore an alternative denitrification pathway coupled with anoxic nitrification and mn ii reduction denitrification was finally formed yang et al 2019 3 2 3 functional genes for nitrogen cycling potential nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria and relative abundances of nitrogen cycle s functional genes in different cws are presented in figs 3d and 4 wetland systems with the addition of tailings have significant differences in the enzyme activity of n transformation p 0 05 specifically relative abundances of genes driving nh4 oxidation including ammonooxygenase amo hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and assimilative nitrate reductase nir in cw a cw b and cw c were higher than that in cw d table s7 previous studies have confirmed that microbial nitrate dependent fe ii oxidation enhanced the immobilization of nitrogen in anoxic environment thus improving the nitrogen removal in cws ma et al 2021 in addition relative abundances of membrane binding enzyme nar copper bearing nitrite reductase nirk and cu fe nitric oxide reductase nor are relatively high in cw a and cw b indicating that metal elements contained in tailings can promote the reduction process of nitrate under hypoxia condition in cws for cw c the relative abundance of periplasmic dissimilar nitrate reductase nap and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh was highest this proved that manganese mineral matrix in cws might mediate the direct conversion of nitrite to nitrogen by anammox reaction using nitrite as terminal electron acceptor kuypers et al 2018 in addition cw d had the highest abundance of urease ure c and cyanate esterase cyn which indicated that cw d had the highest intensity of converting nh4 n into organic nitrogen under anaerobic conditions since the adsorption capacity of gravel in cw d was relatively small fig s5 the removal of nh4 n in cws at this time may be mainly due to the conversion of anaerobic bacteria to organic nitrogen for microbial metabolism 3 2 4 co occurrence between community composition and metabolic function and eps components fig 5 a shows that the total eps amount of three ore based systems about 1 58 5 76 times higher than the control system particularly cw c 835 15 mg l 1 was significantly higher than that in cw d previous studies have also showed that microorganisms could produce more eps in the presence of heavy metals aquino and stuckey 2004 this could also explain why the microbial composition of cw a cw b and cw c was relatively rich and diverse which was more conducive to nutrient removal as shown in fig 5a the amount of s eps was the largest in all cws accounting for 49 78 78 25 of the total eps followed by tb eps 13 77 25 26 and lb eps 4 78 24 96 fig 5b shows the relative distribution of parafac components in different types of eps determined by eem parafac modeling and four fluorescent components c1 c4 including tryptophan like uvc humic like uva humic like and tyrosine like were identified table s8 wang et al 2021 among different components in s eps and lb eps relative abundances of c1 c2 and c3 were the highest which can be explained by the absorption of bacterial metabolism and humus along with other dissolved solids or inorganic colloid on the bacterial cell wall table s9 in tb eps c1 and c4 components were dominant previous studies have reported that protein and tryptophan components represented the availability of dom by microorganisms which can be produced or consumed by microorganisms hambly et al 2015 the content of s eps produced by microbial metabolism was higher than that consumed by microbial degradation leading to the accumulation of s eps and more s eps could also adsorb more pollutants on the substrate surface of cws zhou et al 2020 this is due to the presence of different functional groups e g amino carboxyl phosphate and hydroxyl in the polysaccharides and lipid proteins that make up microbial eps and these functional groups act as bio absorbents by generating attraction between pollutants and cell walls siddharth et al 2021 previous studies have also proved that functional properties such as cell aggregation to form biofilms and surface adhesion improve the ability of eps to accumulate nutrients and form protective barriers and water absorption properties on matrix surface more et al 2014 however lb eps and tb eps are usually associated with microbial activity but excessive lb eps and tb eps may cause blockage of cws overall the addition of tailings in cws could achieve higher denitrification performance but more biofilm formation in cws might accelerate the system blockage the metabolic function of bacterial 16s rrna genes was also predicted using picrust fig s6 the results showed that metabolism 67 23 71 70 was the most important functional category text s6 the potential functions of the top 50 bacteria in the functional subclass level 2 were further analyzed fig s6b and relative abundances of amino acid metabolism metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism energy metabolism lipid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism pathways in mine waste based systems cw a cw b and cw c were relatively rich particularly relative abundances of biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism in cw c system were significantly high p 0 05 indicating that manganese ore addition stimulated these metabolic pathways yang et al 2019 studies have shown that these high abundance microbial metabolic processes were directly related to glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle which in turn would strengthen the electron transport system and the synthesis of atp ma et al 2021 as we all know electron donors and energy support are essential for denitrification therefore this further confirms that the addition of tailings could catalyze the efficient progress of the denitrification process by increasing the abundance of key genes in addition the obvious changes in cellular community indicated that cellular processes in mine waste based systems were also stronger in short the addition of tailings substrate increased the metabolic capacity of microorganisms resulting in significant changes in the bacterial community within cws and eps production resulting in an increase in dominant functional genes thereby enhancing the ability of cws for removing nutrients 3 3 release behavior and risk assessment of heavy metals 3 3 1 risk assessment of effluent quality most of mine wastes contain a variety of heavy metal elements so it is of great significance to study the long term leaching behavior of heavy metals from cws for the safety and sustainability of wetlands as shown in fig 6 we found that the leaching content of fe in cw b 23 95 µg kg 1 was much higher than that in other cws a weak leaching in cw a and cw c was found with the cumulative leaching after 110 days the leaching rate gradually reaches a stable value of 0 18 0 26 µg kg 1d 1 fig 6b shows that the leaching amount of mn in cw c was maximum followed by cw a and cw b their cumulative leaching amounts varied in 0 17 0 45 µg kg 1 and the leaching rate of mn in wetlands basically reaches a stable level after 80 days fig 6c reflects that the cumulative leaching amount of cu 1 81ug kg 1 in cw b was 2 8 times higher than that of control systems while reveals the maximum leaching amount of cr 0 23 µg kg 1 obtained in cw c fig 6d similarly and the leaching rate of cr and cu in each system had a slightly gradual decrease on the whole the cumulative leaching amount and leaching rate of heavy metals in mine waste based cws were greater than that in control systems especially in the initial 28 days of the experiment from the perspective of dynamics the leaching of most metals in tailings was mainly dominated by scouring and dissolution processes ohki et al 2004 on the other hand it may be because the growth of microbial membrane and eps in the later stage enveloped the substrate and blocked the leaching of heavy metals du et al 2016 or the heavy metals released from the ore are absorbed by eps thus reducing the content of heavy metals in the effluent benedetta et al 2021 early studies showed that among various types of binding sites on eps molecules on biofilms sulfhydryl sites sh are particularly important because they have high affinity for hg as cd cu pb and other metals and can bind and fix heavy metals yu and fein 2016 3 3 2 toxic responses of wetland plants fig 7 a shows the variation of plant height in different mine waste based cws during the operation period and the total height of above ground and below ground sections of plants in different systems ranged in 54 51 100 98 cm this result indicated that the addition of mine wastes could promote the growth of plants significantly which may be resulted from the proper supplements of some essential trace elements fe cu mn etc from tailings in cws similarly there were significant differences in total dry weight biomass among different cws p 0 05 and iron ore based cws reached the higher aboveground and underground biomass table s10 in addition nitrogen storage in plants was highest 32 70 g kg 1 in coal gangue based systems while the highest phosphorus storage in plants was obtained in iron ore based systems 3 39 g kg 1 on the whole nitrogen accumulation in wetland plants was than phosphorus accumulation the mass balance calculation also showed that the amount of nutrient uptake by plant accounted for 9 08 14 36 n and 7 72 11 49 p of the total nutrient removal in cws during the experiment table 1 however it was low compared with some published results this variation may be caused by different plant species nutrient load rates and climatic factors in different studies vymazal and ezinová 2016 interestingly it should be noted that the higher biomass did not have the greater nutrient storage in plants which may be resulted from harmful heavy metals leached from ore substrates in cws previous studies have shown that the presence of heavy metals such as cr cu etc can inhibit the absorption transport and utilization of several elements n p ca mg and k etc by plants riaz et al 2021 in this study the potential heavy metal release from tailings in cws might cause direct or indirect toxic effects which would change the normal metabolism of nutrient in plants ambika et al 2016 it has been found that iron is one of the basic elements in wetland plants and is involved in various growth processes such as respiration photosynthesis and cellular dna synthesis however iron rich substrates may produce iron toxicity to wetland plants both high concentration of reductive iron ions fe2 and low bioavailability of iron ions can cause serious health symptoms of wetland plants thus affecting the role of constructed wetlands in wastewater treatment wu et al 2019 to further determine the influence of cytoplasmic enzymes and oxidative stress damage to plants the changes of sod activity and mda content in plants in cws with four different substrates are exhibited in fig 7b it can be found that sod activity and mda content in plants in mine waste based systems were significantly different from those in control wetland during the stage i and ii it is well known that plant tolerance to oxidative stress is usually associated with high sod activity which is an o2 scavenging enzyme that can resist intracellular reactive oxygen species to combat oxidative stress wang et al 2021 the lower level of sod activity in mine waste based systems cw a cw b and cw c indicated that plants in these systems were subjected to different degrees of adverse environmental stress jia et al 2020 reported that adding cr and pb into cws would cause serious damage to the development and function of plants and this effect was irreversible at least in a short period of time as an indicator of reactive oxygen species ros mda as the main cytotoxic product of lipid peroxidation can be used to evaluate the damage degree of plant membranes in wetland plants wang et al 2021 mda contents of plants in mine waste based cws particularly cw a was significantly higher than that in control systems p 0 05 which indicated the tailings might cause serious ros induced damage in wetland plant tissues due to the leaching of some components such as cu cr and s from the coal gangue ravanbakhsh et al 2019 the excessive accumulation of ros exceeded the elimination capacity or had a negative impact on the synthesis of related proteins ma et al 2021 these results could partly explain the inefficient utilization of nutrients by plants in cws with mine waste substrates in this study knowledge about the interaction between trace elements and plant health and nutrient uptake in constructed wetlands is still insufficient and more research is needed 4 conclusion and application perspectives this study evaluated the long term feasibility 385 d of using three common mine waste as a substrate in cws for treating nutrient rich wastewater the results indicated that the nutrient treatment performance of manganese ore and iron ore based cws were relatively stable while that of coal gangue based cws gradually declined the results indicated that manganese ore and iron ore based cws have the best and relatively stable treatment performance for n and p while the decontamination effect of coal gangue based cws gradually declined fe and mn elements in mine waste can enhance microbial process and media storage thus improving the tn and tp removal performance in cws si and al elements can also be beneficial for the tp reduction in cws application of mine wastes shifted the microbial community structure and richness and diversity of microorganism and promoted the biomass growth of wetland plants resulting in the enhanced nutrient removal in addition the addition of mine waste further increased the metabolic capacity of microorganisms and the adsorption capacity of nutrients however heavy metals leached from the mine waste would affect the water quality of the effluent and decrease the nutrient uptake by plants the increased eps may also accelerate the clogging of cws the use of mine waste as an alternative substrate in cws to remove various pollutants from wastewater has many attractive benefits especially its contribution to reducing the cost of wastewater treatment and enhancing the removal of nutrients while achieving sustainable management of mine waste however it should be noted that the principle of adapting measures to local conditions should be considered in engineering application through energy consumption economic assessment text s7 some tailings landfill sites and remote mountainous areas where mine waste is easily obtained may be more suitable while it would not be appropriate in urban landscape areas because the transportation costs of mine waste and other factors will weaken the sustainability of cws as a green eco technology in addition the chemical reduction of metal ions released from the mine waste may consume oxygen in the wetland and adversely affect aerobic biological processes which needed to be controlled timely and effectively for a sustainable wastewater treatment furthermore the release risk of heavy metals from mine waste could be significantly affected by the addition ratio in cws however another major problem associated with them is the capacity to bio magnify for animals and plants are also worthy of attention therefore it is necessary to further optimize the operation of waste based cws by exploring the dynamic transformation and eco toxicity of heavy metal leaching from mine waste in short the use of waste based cws should be reconsidered dialectically in the future engineering application it is worth exploring in the future to

16364,water diversion has been widely used to address water shortages and security issues however its long term ecological impacts particularly on the biodiversity and structure of the local community have often been neglected due to limitations of conventional biomonitoring taking the water diversion projects from yangtze river to tai lake wdyt as examples environmental dna edna metabarcoding was used to investigate the potential ecological impact of water diversion on the connected basins firstly 136 phytoplankton genera species including 31 cyanobacteria and 105 eukaryotic phytoplankton euk phytoplankton were identified from 26 sites by metabarcoding of 16s rdna v3 and 18s rdna v9 regions edna metabarcoding showed an obvious advantage in detecting nano pico plankton 20 μm in size compared with the morphological approach secondly more shared taxa and higher similarity of community composition were observed in gonghu bay zhushan bay with its connected river than with the center of tai lake indicating that water diversions were accelerating the biotic homogenization between different waterbodies skeletonema potamos the native species of yangtze river 4 04 of the total euk phytoplankton reads was detected in different connecting regions of tai lake 0 03 0 54 of the total euk phytoplankton reads where its relative abundance was consistent with the influence of water diversion from yangtze river furthermore the introduction of s potamos significantly affected the local community compositions of phytoplankton in tai lake finally the ecological effect e g taxa richness community composition and species invasion of the wdyt on phytoplankton in the west of tai lake was more significant than that in the east which was consistent with the scale volume and duration of the water diversion projects overall this study highlights the value of edna biomonitoring in the ecological impact assessment of water transfer projects graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water diversion edna metabarcoding biotic homogenization species invasion community compositions 1 introduction water diversion projects have been implemented globally to address the issues of water shortages and poor water quality caused by climate change and human activities transporting water artificially from surplus clean to deficit polluted watersheds water diversion projects have been built to meet geographically unbalanced water supply needs generate hydropower and improve water quality gallardo and aldridge 2018 liu et al 2017 for instance the south to north water diversion snwd in china the world s largest inter basin water transfer project was designed to alleviate water supply problems in northern china by transferring water from the yangtze river in southern china and directly benefiting 110 million people liu et al 2017 in addition many water diversion projects have been engineered to dilute pollution and restore the ecosystems of receiving waterbodies for example seasonal water diversion activities from yangtze river significantly reduced the concentrations of antibiotics in gonghu bay qin et al 2018 cyanobacteria decreased in the urban river due to water diversions from the yangtze river yang et al 2021 furthermore the water diversion project also temporarily effectively restored the arid oasis ecosystem of the heihe river basin shen and ma 2020 although water diversions have made great contributions to local social and economic development increasing concerns have arisen regarding their adverse ecological consequences daga et al 2020 gallardo and aldridge 2018 guo et al 2020a liu et al 2017 zhan et al 2015 water diversion projects could result in a large number of ecological effects including the alternation of natural habitats expansion of invasive species and biotic homogenization the interconnectivity of waterways allows the dispersal of isolated taxa between historically separated basins and the establishment of an invasion highway for the spread of a range of nonnative species such as parasites algae aquatic plants zooplankton macroinvertebrates and fish gallardo and aldridge 2018 liang et al 2012 liu et al 2017 macedo et al 2021 qin et al 2019 walsh et al 2016 which has been recognized as one of the dominant pathways of species invasion liu et al 2017 zhan et al 2015 furthermore the introduction of nonindigenous species and modification of habitat conditions by water diversion projects would accelerate the multi trophic biotic homogenization process between basins including the alteration of α diversity and reduction of β diversity which might result in the degradation of ecosystem functions and services daga et al 2020 gamez virues et al 2015 gossner et al 2016 guo et al 2020a mori et al 2018 therefore tracking dynamic changes in the structure and diversity of aquatic organisms especially early and rapid detection of new invasions and secondary spread is critical to characterize the ecological impacts of water diversion projects however the current monitoring of the impacts of water diversion is mainly for physicochemical characteristics that are responsible for the alternation of habitat conditions such as water flow water transparency oxygenation pollution and eutrophication dai et al 2020 li et al 2011 qin et al 2018 qu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the comprehensive ecological effects of water diversion projects have long been neglected due to the limitations of traditional methods since traditional morphological methods are time consuming labor intensive high cost and difficulty in identifying cryptic and rare species it s still very difficult to carry out effective biomonitoring at a large spatial scale environmental dna edna technologies provide powerful tools for large scale and high spatial resolution biomonitoring and can potentially be used in the assessment and early warning of ecological impact by water diversion projects combining dna based identification and high throughput sequencing technology edna metabarcoding has been successfully applied for the detection of multiple communities covering trees of life li et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 and revealed intraspecific genetic diversity for population studies tsuji et al 2020 edna metabarcoding has been shown to have a precise spatial resolution to discriminate community compositions from different habitats bista et al 2017 jeunen et al 2019 west et al 2020 furthermore edna metabarcoding has been proven to be sensitive for the detection of rare species and is considered a valuable tool for early warning and management of invasive species hardulak et al 2020 sepulveda et al 2020 westfall et al 2020 zaiko et al 2020 however it is largely unexplored how to apply the edna approach in assessing ecological effects by water diversions across basins here taking the water diversions from yangtze river to tai lake wdyt as an example fig 1 the spatial distributions of biodiversity and community structures of phytoplankton were analyzed by edna metabarcoding to assess the ecological impact of water diversion tai lake is the third largest shallow lake in china and is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river dai et al 2020 since the 1980s toxic cyanobacterial blooms dominated by microcystis have frequently occurred in tai lake and even triggered a drinking water crisis in 2007 wang et al 2013 to mitigate eutrophication and meet the water supplies of the tai lake basin wdyt projects were initiated in 2002 it has been demonstrated that wdyt significantly improved the general water quality of tai lake but increased the nutrient pollution of phosphate dai et al 2020 li et al 2013 qin et al 2018 however increasing concerns have recently arisen regarding the adverse ecological consequences of wdyt projects phytoplankton not only play a pivotal role in the carbon cycle and energy flow of the whole ecosystem but are also particularly sensitive to environmental changes e g hydrologic exchange therefore phytoplankton are recommended as valuable indicators for the alternation of aquatic ecosystems induced by external disturbances dai et al 2018 hongjun and yinxin 2006 this study aimed to 1 investigate the biodiversity and community compositions of phytoplankton in different habitats of yangtze river wangyu river taige canal tai lake 2 evaluate the effects of water diversions from the eastern and western routes on phytoplankton communities in tai lake and 3 identify the potentially invasive species introduced into tai lake from the yangtze river and the impact of species invasion on local phytoplankton community structure and species abundance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the east and west lines of the wdyt projects wangyu river gonghu bay and taige canal zhushan bay were examined in this study fig 1 water diversions between yangtze river and tai lake consist of the eastern and western routes fig 1 in the east wangyu river is the only artificial channel directly connecting yangtze river and tai lake it has been mainly used for water diversion from yangtze river to tai lake but also for drainage during the flood period dai et al 2020 in the west taige canal is one of the main rivers to indirectly connect yangtze river and tai lake through the river dendritic network and existing water conservancy projects although no artificial channel has been built to directly connect western tai lake and yangtze river jiang et al 2021 mei et al 2020 a total of 26 stations included 1 site in yangtze river 5 sites in wangyu river 10 sites in gonghu bay 4 sites in taige canal 5 sites in zhushan bay and 1 site in central lake 1 5 l surface water was collected at each site from a depth of less than 0 5 m

according to the manufacturer s protocols 2 5 bioinformatics low quality reads with an average q score below 20 or that contained nucleotide ambiguities were removed from raw sequences following the qiime pipeline the clean fastq files were converted into fasta and corresponding quality files by using mothur software sequences were assigned to each sample using the split libraries py script with w 50 s 25 l 100 m 3 e 2 parameters unique sequences were identified dereplication using the derep fulllength command in vsearch sequencing errors and chimeras were removed from the dereplicated fasta file using the usearch command unoise3 to produce amplicon sequence variants asvs the asvs were taxonomically assigned against the local cyanobacteria database for the 16s and pr2 release 4 12 0 databases for 18s at the genus species level using the align seqs py script 2 6 statistical analysis only asvs with relative abundances 0 01 were kept as high confidence taxa at first the edna metabarcoding data are summarized in a separate asv table only asvs identified as chinese phytoplankton were kept for further analysis hongjun and yinxin 2006 the reads of asvs present simultaneously in at least two replicates were averaged as the actually detected reads of each asv at one site cell length was used as a size descriptor of phytoplankton stemmann and boss 2012 and calculated at genus level text s1 phytoplankton size classification microplankton 20 200 μm nanoplankton 2 20 μm picoplankton 0 2 2 μm was performed based on the size data li 2007 the variation in community composition among sites was visualized using nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds based on bray curtis dissimilarity using the metamds function in the r package vegan and the trend lines among sites were added by ggplot the use of rank orders by nmds omits the issues associated with using absolute distance e g sensitivity to transformation and is much more flexible for different types of data the significant community differences among habitats were tested by permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova with 999 permutations using adonis2 in vegan furthermore the relationship between bray curtis similarity and geographical distance was fitted using linear regression models and visualized in graphpad prism 8 which is one of the most popular methods li et al 2020 indval analysis was used to calculate the indicator value fidelity and relative abundance of taxa in a specific habitat a t test was performed to statically show the differences in environmental variables between rivers and lakes the environmental variables were standardized as zero mean and unit variance for statistical analyses the spearman correlation test was used to assess the relationships between environmental variables the forward selection distance based linear distlm based on r2 selection criteria was used to select environmental variables and species invasion in contributing to the variation in local phytoplankton moreover the significance levels of the variables were assessed by monte carlo permutation 999 permutations species co occurrence patterns between invasive species and other identified taxa were analyzed using spearman correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 sequencing results and taxonomic diversity a total of 10 467 prokaryotic asvs and 6571 eukaryotic asvs were identified from the 8 494 377 reads 16s v3 and 9 645 498 reads 18s v9 respectively following quality filtering the edna samples achieved sufficient sequencing depths from the generated rarefaction curves fig s1 the number of reads per sample was 76 526 22 063 mean se for 16s v3 assays and 87 686 27 818 mean se for 18s v9 assays no reads from all dna extraction negative blanks and pcr negative controls were returned after strict quality control and filtering 136 distinct phytoplankton taxa were detected across all sampling sites covering 8 phyla 13 classes and 51 families 31 cyanobacteria species genus were identified from 196 asvs and 24 of them were identified as potential toxic algae the majority of reads and asvs of cyanobacteria belonged to aphanothece microcystis and synechococcus accounting for 38 75 25 67 and 19 46 of the total cyanobacteria reads respectively fig 2 105 distinct genera of chinese eukaryotic phytoplankton were detected from 1467 asvs of 18s v9 assays bacillariophyta 36 90 of reads 21 9 of genus and chlorophyta 30 88 of reads 48 57 of genus dominated the eukaryotic phytoplankton communities the dominant genera were cyclotella 7 15 of reads cryptomonas 4 24 of reads nitzschia 3 15 of reads and aulacoseira 2 65 of reads fig s2 much more species and higher resolution of the spatial biodiversity dynamics were detected by edna metabarcoding compared with morphological analysis 101 and 89 taxa were identified by the edna approach from 4 sites in wangyu river and 3 sites in gonghu bay respectively which were 3 3 and 3 1 times those identified by morphological identification 18 and 17 taxa were identified in wangyu river and gonghu bay respectively by both methods fig 3 b c capturing 60 0 and 58 6 of morphological taxa and accounting for 87 6 and 89 4 of morphological biomass edna identified phytoplankton with sizes ranging from 2 μm to 1000 μm covering the whole size range of taxa by microscopic analysis and showed obvious advantages over microscopy in detecting nanoplankton 2 20 μm and picoplankton 0 2 2 μm fig 3a furthermore the nmds plot by edna revealed a more pronounced partition of phytoplankton communities between wangyu river and gonghu bay than by morphology edna f 4 0027 p 0 05 morphology f 2 2844 p 0 165 permanova fig s3 3 2 distinct biodiversity patterns among habitats distinct biodiversity patterns were observed among the sampled habitats of yangtze river tai lake and connected rivers firstly the number of taxa and asvs detected varied among sampled habitats the taxonomic richness of rivers were much higher than that in lakes fig 4 the highest number of genera species 113 was detected in yangtze river although the highest number of asvs 878 was detected in taige canal fig s4 the lowest number of asvs 412 and genera species 83 were observed in the center of tai lake figs 4 s4 secondly the community structure among connecting habitats demonstrated a clear partitioning of biota fig 5 the differences in phytoplankton communities in the river ecosystems of yangtze river taige canal and wangyu river were generally smaller whereas the separations in the lake ecosystems of gonghu bay zhushan bay and the center of lake were more explicit nmds analysis of the cyanobacteria and euk phytoplankton communities separately supported similar findings fig s7 strong separation between different habitats was shown by permanova phytoplankton f 49 115 p 0 001 cyanobacteria f 71 9 p 0 001 eukaryotic phytoplankton f 30 522 p 0 001 furthermore 17 of 136 taxa were identified as significant indicators associated with the habitats by the indval analysis fischerella and geminella were identified as indicators of yangtze river for gonghu bay 10 indicator taxa were identified and the top three indicators were gloeocapsa fragilaria and rhodomonas amphora epithemia rhopalodia and pandorina were indicator taxa of central lake asterococcus was the only indicator of taige canal no significantly dominant taxa were identified in wangyu river or zhushan bay table s1 finally the 15 asvs of the microcystis genus showed habitat preferred distribution patterns the distributions of microcystis asvs were similar among wangyu river taige river and zhushan bay but significantly different from those of the yangtze river gonghu bay and the center of tai lake fig s8 asv 10 678 and asv 1950 showed higher abundances in yangtze river however the relative abundances of asv 250 and asv 784 were much higher in gonghu bay than in other habitats 3 3 biotic homogenization between water donating receiving areas accelerated by water diversion higher taxon overlap and similarity of community composition between gonghu bay zhushan bay and its connected river than that with the center of tai lake more than 44 1 of the taxa 60 136 were found across all sampled habitats whereas 6 6 of them 9 136 detected were unique to a particular habitat fig 4 there were 82 taxa shared between gonghu bay and its connecting channel wangyu river which was higher than the 77 shared taxa between gonghu bay and the center of tai lake fig s5 additionally 84 taxa were shared between zhushan bay and its connecting channel taige canal which was higher than the 67 shared taxa between zhushan bay and central lake fg s6 as demonstrated by the nmds plot edna samples from gonghu bay were grouped closely with those from wangyu river especially with wy 05 which is geographically closer to the estuary a similar phenomenon was found between zhushan bay and taige canal the samples of zhushan bay especially z m1 and z m2 were clustered together with samples from taige canal but far away from the center of tai lake fig 5 the direction of water diversion shaped the spatial distributions of phytoplankton community across habitats in the wdyt projects figs 5 s7 nmds analysis showed that samples in taige canal clustered together however samples in zhushan bay were separated from each other furthermore the community similarities of samples from zhushan bay and the taige canal decreased with increasing geographical distance by nmds fig 5a and linear regression analysis fig 5c these patterns were consistent with the fact that water from taige canal was flowing into tai lake through zhushan bay while water from tai lake was flowing into wangyu river through gonghu bay during the investigation the relative abundances of indicators such as dolichospermum and merismopedia in zhushan bay also showed a decreasing trend with increasing distance from the inlet of taige canal fig s9 while pairwise site comparisons in wangyu river varied samples from gonghu bay were grouped together the community similarities between samples from wangyu river and gonghu bay decreased prominently with increasing geographical distance by nmds fig 5a and the linear regression model fig 5b the abundances of aphanothece sp and synechococcus in gonghu bay were much higher than those in the wangyu river and gradually decreased with the distance from the estuary of wangyu river fig s10 these results showed that the taige canal inflow had a significant effect on the phytoplankton communities in zhushan bay whereas the community compositions in wangyu river were significantly affected by the outflow of gonghu bay 3 4 skeletonema potamos invaded the water receiving area of tai lake by water diversion skeletonema potamos invaded tai lake from yangtze river through connected rivers and demonstrated higher abundance in the west of tai lake than that in the east fig 6 s potamos asv 75 is a native species in yangtze river accounting for 4 04 of the total euk phytoplankton reads but has not been previously reported in tai lake shuai et al 2017 here edna results showed that s potamos was detected across all sampled sites and its relative abundance in taige canal zhushan bay wangyu river and gonghu bay accounted for 29 86 7 32 8 42 5 57 7 53 7 33 and 1 11 0 38 of that in yangtze river respectively fig 6 the abundance of s potamos in the center of tai lake was almost the lowest 0 04 of the total euk phytoplankton reads the confidence in taxonomic assignment was strong because the sequence of asv 75 text s2 had 100 similarity and 100 query coverage to the sequence of s potamos in ncbi accession number ab728775 1 but the next closet matching species was s costatum with only 99 31 similarity table s2 we also recently identified s potamos under the microscope in gonghu bay fig 6 which strongly supported the edna biomonitoring results species invasion significantly affected the phytoplankton community together with habitat related environmental factors particularly the cyanobacteria community the total nitrogen tn was significantly correlated with total phosphate tp and was not used in the subsequent analysis spearman s correlation r 0 75 p 0 05 fig s12 the effects of tp species invasion and temperature on phytoplankton were greater than those of other environmental variables p 0 05 permutations 999 which explained 71 85 41 08 15 69 and 15 08 and 67 53 42 60 8 57 and 16 36 of the variation in cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton compositions respectively tables s3 s4 fig s13 the temperature in the wangyu river was significantly lower than that in gonghu bay which was probably associated with the waterbody differences of rivers and lakes fig s11 t test p 0 01 significantly higher concentrations of total nitrogen but lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen fig s11 t test p 0 05 were found in the wangyu river than in gonghu bay which was similar to the results in previous studies dai et al 2020 and demonstrated that physicochemical variables were probably changed by water diversion and furthermore contributed to phytoplankton community variations the occurrence of s potamos was significantly correlated with the abundances of 37 native taxa in tai lake r 0 75 p 0 05 particularly being negatively associated with 10 eukaryotic phytoplankton a total of 26 taxa were significantly positively correlated with the relative abundances of s potamos including 6 cyanobacteria 14 chlorophyta and 6 other euk phytoplankton r 0 75 p 0 05 herein cyclotella hyella fontana and planktothrix suspense were the most relevant taxa r 0 94 in addition 1 cyanobacteria gloeocapsa 3 diatoms fragilaria synedra and discostella and 7 other phytoplankton showed negative associations with the abundance of s potamos fig 7 4 discussion the high spatial resolution of biodiversity dynamics by edna metabarcoding revealed distinct biodiversity patterns e g alpha diversity community structure and the abundances of indicator species of phytoplankton among different habitats of yangtze river channel rivers and tai lake the alpha diversity in rivers was higher than that of lakes the richness of yangtze river and taige canal was the highest but that of tai lake was the lowest high biodiversity in the yangtze river can be explained by flows through different geomorphic units different watersheds and different artificial projects in china gao et al 2021 the rich biodiversity in taige canal may be related to the biota of its upstream river network and lakes jiang et al 2021 compared with the community differences among different rivers the differences in phytoplankton community among the east west and center of lake were larger which might be not only related to the habitat differences but also associated with the surrounding rivers entering the lake the genetic composition of the microcystis genus indicated by asv structure was distinct between the inlet of yangtze river and other habitats connecting tai lake which suggested that the microcystis bloom in tai lake might not be directly introduced from yangtze river fig s8 this study together with other recent works verifies that edna metabarcoding can be a powerful tool to capture a localized signal and reveal habitat specific biodiversity in lentic systems brys et al 2020 lotic systems and marine environments jeunen et al 2019 west et al 2020 water diversion increases the consistency of phytoplankton communities between connected waterbodies and drives biotic homogenization our research showed high similarities of phytoplankton communities between connected basins by water diversions similar effects were also revealed in other water diversion projects for instance high similarities of fish communities were revealed among impounded lakes along the chinese snwd path guo et al 2020a the previous study also showed that the planned nicaragua canal would cause genetic homogenization of previously differentiated gene pools by breaking down the geographic barrier between the punta gorda and san juan basins haerer et al 2017 additionally the composition similarities encompassing multiple trophic levels between historical isolated basins increased due to the construction of water diversion projects in brazil daga et al 2020 biotic homogenization might be caused directly through the loss of rare or specialized endemic species and or the gain of cosmopolitan species which are usually caused by anthropogenic filtering and the associated environmental homogenization e g nutrients ph and pollutants gossner et al 2016 mori et al 2018 functional homogenization usually occurs simultaneously with biotic homogenization which heavily affects ecosystem function and consequently decreases the stability of the ecosystem gossner et al 2016 for the first time our research identified the invasion of a nonnative species s potamos into tai lake from yangtze river by water diversion as one of the smallest centric diatoms in river ecosystems s potamos is easily overlooked in samples by light microscopy due to its thin frustule small chloroplast and easy damage during the preparation of permanent slides this may explain why this species was not previously identified by traditional morphology based monitoring dai et al 2020 kiss et al 1994 s potamos has been recorded in the lists of invasive species of many important aquatic ecosystems such as the great lakes in the united states mills et al 1993 the river danube in hungary kiss et al 1994 the river loire in france descy et al 2012 and the elbe river in the czech republic kastovsky et al 2010 although its ecological impacts are still limited skeletonema are widely known as bloom forming taxa in the ocean and s potamos has also been identified as a key taxon involved in algae blooms in virginia rivers due to its high growth potential marshall et al 2012 furthermore skeletonema species have a negative impact on zooplankton by disturbing the filtration process of cladocera or inhibiting the egg hatching success rate of some copepod consumers duleba et al 2014 muller solger et al 2002 the relative abundance of s potamos showed a prominently positive correlation with the concentrations of tp and tn in tai lake fig 7 which was consistent with previous results that s potamos is distributed widely in eutrophic waters kastovsky et al 2010 torgan et al 2009 otherwise s potamos has been reported as a thermophilic and pollution tolerant species kiss et al 2012 torgan et al 2009 global warming and increasing human activities might further increase the risk of successful establishment and spread of s potamos across tai lake the occurrence of invasive species adversely affected the local biodiversity and community compositions of phytoplankton in tai lake the community compositions of cyanobacteria mantel s r 0 242 p 0 05 and euk phytoplankton mantel s r 0 257 p 0 05 in tai lake were significantly affected by species invasion such changes in community structure usually lead to changes in important ecosystem functions such as biomass supply and nutrient cycling gallardo and aldridge 2018 only 1 cyanobacteria but 10 euk phytoplankton such as fragilaria synedra and discostella were negatively correlated with the abundance of s potamos which might be explained by that euk phytoplankton especially diatom are particularly vulnerable to the introduction of s potamos probably due to the much more intensive competition between species the decline of euk phytoplankton species by invasion of s potamos could reduce carbon fixation field et al 1998 in summary the introduction of s potamos may cause serious consequences on the local food web and hence damage ecosystem function therefore future long term monitoring should be particularly cautious toward this species the ecological effect of the water diversion project on phytoplankton in the west of tai lake is higher than that in the east firstly 96 55 84 87 of taxa in western tai lake zhushan bay were detected simultaneously in the connecting waterbody of taige canal which was higher than that between gonghu bay and wangyu river accounting for 88 17 82 93 of the taxa of algae in gonghu bay fig s5 s6 secondly the community compositions significantly differed among the sampling sites of zhushan bay and the community differences between zhushan bay and the taige canal decreased with decreasing distances from the taige canal however there were no significant differences among the different sampling sites in gonghu bay fig 5 finally the relative abundance of the invasive species s potamos in zhushan bay was 7 times greater than that in gonghu bay according to the monthly report of the water regime in the tai lake basin http www tba gov cn the water of the taige canal consistently flowed into zhushan bay and the cumulative inflow volume from april to august in 2020 was more than 721 million m3 20 of the inflow volume of western rivers into tai lake guosong and zunle 2015 wenli et al 2018 however in eastern tai lake the water of the wangyu river flowed into gonghu bay in only 3 stages january may and june with a cumulative time of 30 days and cumulative inflow volume of 86 84 million m3 therefore the greater impact of water transfer to the west of tai lake compared to the east may be due to the larger scale volume and duration of the water diversion projects the higher nutrient loadings in western tai lake than in eastern tai lake also promote the colonization of s potamos guo et al 2020b wu et al 2019 5 conclusion the ecological impact of water diversion projects was evaluated by edna metarbarcoding technology biotic homogenization of phytoplankton between connecting waterbodies was accelerated by water diversions especially in the western part which provided a pathway for the transfer of invasive species such as s potamos into tai lake the species invasion would threaten endemic species and alter community structures this study highlights the importance of ecological

16364,water diversion has been widely used to address water shortages and security issues however its long term ecological impacts particularly on the biodiversity and structure of the local community have often been neglected due to limitations of conventional biomonitoring taking the water diversion projects from yangtze river to tai lake wdyt as examples environmental dna edna metabarcoding was used to investigate the potential ecological impact of water diversion on the connected basins firstly 136 phytoplankton genera species including 31 cyanobacteria and 105 eukaryotic phytoplankton euk phytoplankton were identified from 26 sites by metabarcoding of 16s rdna v3 and 18s rdna v9 regions edna metabarcoding showed an obvious advantage in detecting nano pico plankton 20 μm in size compared with the morphological approach secondly more shared taxa and higher similarity of community composition were observed in gonghu bay zhushan bay with its connected river than with the center of tai lake indicating that water diversions were accelerating the biotic homogenization between different waterbodies skeletonema potamos the native species of yangtze river 4 04 of the total euk phytoplankton reads was detected in different connecting regions of tai lake 0 03 0 54 of the total euk phytoplankton reads where its relative abundance was consistent with the influence of water diversion from yangtze river furthermore the introduction of s potamos significantly affected the local community compositions of phytoplankton in tai lake finally the ecological effect e g taxa richness community composition and species invasion of the wdyt on phytoplankton in the west of tai lake was more significant than that in the east which was consistent with the scale volume and duration of the water diversion projects overall this study highlights the value of edna biomonitoring in the ecological impact assessment of water transfer projects graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water diversion edna metabarcoding biotic homogenization species invasion community compositions 1 introduction water diversion projects have been implemented globally to address the issues of water shortages and poor water quality caused by climate change and human activities transporting water artificially from surplus clean to deficit polluted watersheds water diversion projects have been built to meet geographically unbalanced water supply needs generate hydropower and improve water quality gallardo and aldridge 2018 liu et al 2017 for instance the south to north water diversion snwd in china the world s largest inter basin water transfer project was designed to alleviate water supply problems in northern china by transferring water from the yangtze river in southern china and directly benefiting 110 million people liu et al 2017 in addition many water diversion projects have been engineered to dilute pollution and restore the ecosystems of receiving waterbodies for example seasonal water diversion activities from yangtze river significantly reduced the concentrations of antibiotics in gonghu bay qin et al 2018 cyanobacteria decreased in the urban river due to water diversions from the yangtze river yang et al 2021 furthermore the water diversion project also temporarily effectively restored the arid oasis ecosystem of the heihe river basin shen and ma 2020 although water diversions have made great contributions to local social and economic development increasing concerns have arisen regarding their adverse ecological consequences daga et al 2020 gallardo and aldridge 2018 guo et al 2020a liu et al 2017 zhan et al 2015 water diversion projects could result in a large number of ecological effects including the alternation of natural habitats expansion of invasive species and biotic homogenization the interconnectivity of waterways allows the dispersal of isolated taxa between historically separated basins and the establishment of an invasion highway for the spread of a range of nonnative species such as parasites algae aquatic plants zooplankton macroinvertebrates and fish gallardo and aldridge 2018 liang et al 2012 liu et al 2017 macedo et al 2021 qin et al 2019 walsh et al 2016 which has been recognized as one of the dominant pathways of species invasion liu et al 2017 zhan et al 2015 furthermore the introduction of nonindigenous species and modification of habitat conditions by water diversion projects would accelerate the multi trophic biotic homogenization process between basins including the alteration of α diversity and reduction of β diversity which might result in the degradation of ecosystem functions and services daga et al 2020 gamez virues et al 2015 gossner et al 2016 guo et al 2020a mori et al 2018 therefore tracking dynamic changes in the structure and diversity of aquatic organisms especially early and rapid detection of new invasions and secondary spread is critical to characterize the ecological impacts of water diversion projects however the current monitoring of the impacts of water diversion is mainly for physicochemical characteristics that are responsible for the alternation of habitat conditions such as water flow water transparency oxygenation pollution and eutrophication dai et al 2020 li et al 2011 qin et al 2018 qu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the comprehensive ecological effects of water diversion projects have long been neglected due to the limitations of traditional methods since traditional morphological methods are time consuming labor intensive high cost and difficulty in identifying cryptic and rare species it s still very difficult to carry out effective biomonitoring at a large spatial scale environmental dna edna technologies provide powerful tools for large scale and high spatial resolution biomonitoring and can potentially be used in the assessment and early warning of ecological impact by water diversion projects combining dna based identification and high throughput sequencing technology edna metabarcoding has been successfully applied for the detection of multiple communities covering trees of life li et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 and revealed intraspecific genetic diversity for population studies tsuji et al 2020 edna metabarcoding has been shown to have a precise spatial resolution to discriminate community compositions from different habitats bista et al 2017 jeunen et al 2019 west et al 2020 furthermore edna metabarcoding has been proven to be sensitive for the detection of rare species and is considered a valuable tool for early warning and management of invasive species hardulak et al 2020 sepulveda et al 2020 westfall et al 2020 zaiko et al 2020 however it is largely unexplored how to apply the edna approach in assessing ecological effects by water diversions across basins here taking the water diversions from yangtze river to tai lake wdyt as an example fig 1 the spatial distributions of biodiversity and community structures of phytoplankton were analyzed by edna metabarcoding to assess the ecological impact of water diversion tai lake is the third largest shallow lake in china and is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river dai et al 2020 since the 1980s toxic cyanobacterial blooms dominated by microcystis have frequently occurred in tai lake and even triggered a drinking water crisis in 2007 wang et al 2013 to mitigate eutrophication and meet the water supplies of the tai lake basin wdyt projects were initiated in 2002 it has been demonstrated that wdyt significantly improved the general water quality of tai lake but increased the nutrient pollution of phosphate dai et al 2020 li et al 2013 qin et al 2018 however increasing concerns have recently arisen regarding the adverse ecological consequences of wdyt projects phytoplankton not only play a pivotal role in the carbon cycle and energy flow of the whole ecosystem but are also particularly sensitive to environmental changes e g hydrologic exchange therefore phytoplankton are recommended as valuable indicators for the alternation of aquatic ecosystems induced by external disturbances dai et al 2018 hongjun and yinxin 2006 this study aimed to 1 investigate the biodiversity and community compositions of phytoplankton in different habitats of yangtze river wangyu river taige canal tai lake 2 evaluate the effects of water diversions from the eastern and western routes on phytoplankton communities in tai lake and 3 identify the potentially invasive species introduced into tai lake from the yangtze river and the impact of species invasion on local phytoplankton community structure and species abundance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling the east and west lines of the wdyt projects wangyu river gonghu bay and taige canal zhushan bay were examined in this study fig 1 water diversions between yangtze river and tai lake consist of the eastern and western routes fig 1 in the east wangyu river is the only artificial channel directly connecting yangtze river and tai lake it has been mainly used for water diversion from yangtze river to tai lake but also for drainage during the flood period dai et al 2020 in the west taige canal is one of the main rivers to indirectly connect yangtze river and tai lake through the river dendritic network and existing water conservancy projects although no artificial channel has been built to directly connect western tai lake and yangtze river jiang et al 2021 mei et al 2020 a total of 26 stations included 1 site in yangtze river 5 sites in wangyu river 10 sites in gonghu bay 4 sites in taige canal 5 sites in zhushan bay and 1 site in central lake 1 5 l surface water was collected at each site from a depth of less than 0 5 m

according to the manufacturer s protocols 2 5 bioinformatics low quality reads with an average q score below 20 or that contained nucleotide ambiguities were removed from raw sequences following the qiime pipeline the clean fastq files were converted into fasta and corresponding quality files by using mothur software sequences were assigned to each sample using the split libraries py script with w 50 s 25 l 100 m 3 e 2 parameters unique sequences were identified dereplication using the derep fulllength command in vsearch sequencing errors and chimeras were removed from the dereplicated fasta file using the usearch command unoise3 to produce amplicon sequence variants asvs the asvs were taxonomically assigned against the local cyanobacteria database for the 16s and pr2 release 4 12 0 databases for 18s at the genus species level using the align seqs py script 2 6 statistical analysis only asvs with relative abundances 0 01 were kept as high confidence taxa at first the edna metabarcoding data are summarized in a separate asv table only asvs identified as chinese phytoplankton were kept for further analysis hongjun and yinxin 2006 the reads of asvs present simultaneously in at least two replicates were averaged as the actually detected reads of each asv at one site cell length was used as a size descriptor of phytoplankton stemmann and boss 2012 and calculated at genus level text s1 phytoplankton size classification microplankton 20 200 μm nanoplankton 2 20 μm picoplankton 0 2 2 μm was performed based on the size data li 2007 the variation in community composition among sites was visualized using nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds based on bray curtis dissimilarity using the metamds function in the r package vegan and the trend lines among sites were added by ggplot the use of rank orders by nmds omits the issues associated with using absolute distance e g sensitivity to transformation and is much more flexible for different types of data the significant community differences among habitats were tested by permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova with 999 permutations using adonis2 in vegan furthermore the relationship between bray curtis similarity and geographical distance was fitted using linear regression models and visualized in graphpad prism 8 which is one of the most popular methods li et al 2020 indval analysis was used to calculate the indicator value fidelity and relative abundance of taxa in a specific habitat a t test was performed to statically show the differences in environmental variables between rivers and lakes the environmental variables were standardized as zero mean and unit variance for statistical analyses the spearman correlation test was used to assess the relationships between environmental variables the forward selection distance based linear distlm based on r2 selection criteria was used to select environmental variables and species invasion in contributing to the variation in local phytoplankton moreover the significance levels of the variables were assessed by monte carlo permutation 999 permutations species co occurrence patterns between invasive species and other identified taxa were analyzed using spearman correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 sequencing results and taxonomic diversity a total of 10 467 prokaryotic asvs and 6571 eukaryotic asvs were identified from the 8 494 377 reads 16s v3 and 9 645 498 reads 18s v9 respectively following quality filtering the edna samples achieved sufficient sequencing depths from the generated rarefaction curves fig s1 the number of reads per sample was 76 526 22 063 mean se for 16s v3 assays and 87 686 27 818 mean se for 18s v9 assays no reads from all dna extraction negative blanks and pcr negative controls were returned after strict quality control and filtering 136 distinct phytoplankton taxa were detected across all sampling sites covering 8 phyla 13 classes and 51 families 31 cyanobacteria species genus were identified from 196 asvs and 24 of them were identified as potential toxic algae the majority of reads and asvs of cyanobacteria belonged to aphanothece microcystis and synechococcus accounting for 38 75 25 67 and 19 46 of the total cyanobacteria reads respectively fig 2 105 distinct genera of chinese eukaryotic phytoplankton were detected from 1467 asvs of 18s v9 assays bacillariophyta 36 90 of reads 21 9 of genus and chlorophyta 30 88 of reads 48 57 of genus dominated the eukaryotic phytoplankton communities the dominant genera were cyclotella 7 15 of reads cryptomonas 4 24 of reads nitzschia 3 15 of reads and aulacoseira 2 65 of reads fig s2 much more species and higher resolution of the spatial biodiversity dynamics were detected by edna metabarcoding compared with morphological analysis 101 and 89 taxa were identified by the edna approach from 4 sites in wangyu river and 3 sites in gonghu bay respectively which were 3 3 and 3 1 times those identified by morphological identification 18 and 17 taxa were identified in wangyu river and gonghu bay respectively by both methods fig 3 b c capturing 60 0 and 58 6 of morphological taxa and accounting for 87 6 and 89 4 of morphological biomass edna identified phytoplankton with sizes ranging from 2 μm to 1000 μm covering the whole size range of taxa by microscopic analysis and showed obvious advantages over microscopy in detecting nanoplankton 2 20 μm and picoplankton 0 2 2 μm fig 3a furthermore the nmds plot by edna revealed a more pronounced partition of phytoplankton communities between wangyu river and gonghu bay than by morphology edna f 4 0027 p 0 05 morphology f 2 2844 p 0 165 permanova fig s3 3 2 distinct biodiversity patterns among habitats distinct biodiversity patterns were observed among the sampled habitats of yangtze river tai lake and connected rivers firstly the number of taxa and asvs detected varied among sampled habitats the taxonomic richness of rivers were much higher than that in lakes fig 4 the highest number of genera species 113 was detected in yangtze river although the highest number of asvs 878 was detected in taige canal fig s4 the lowest number of asvs 412 and genera species 83 were observed in the center of tai lake figs 4 s4 secondly the community structure among connecting habitats demonstrated a clear partitioning of biota fig 5 the differences in phytoplankton communities in the river ecosystems of yangtze river taige canal and wangyu river were generally smaller whereas the separations in the lake ecosystems of gonghu bay zhushan bay and the center of lake were more explicit nmds analysis of the cyanobacteria and euk phytoplankton communities separately supported similar findings fig s7 strong separation between different habitats was shown by permanova phytoplankton f 49 115 p 0 001 cyanobacteria f 71 9 p 0 001 eukaryotic phytoplankton f 30 522 p 0 001 furthermore 17 of 136 taxa were identified as significant indicators associated with the habitats by the indval analysis fischerella and geminella were identified as indicators of yangtze river for gonghu bay 10 indicator taxa were identified and the top three indicators were gloeocapsa fragilaria and rhodomonas amphora epithemia rhopalodia and pandorina were indicator taxa of central lake asterococcus was the only indicator of taige canal no significantly dominant taxa were identified in wangyu river or zhushan bay table s1 finally the 15 asvs of the microcystis genus showed habitat preferred distribution patterns the distributions of microcystis asvs were similar among wangyu river taige river and zhushan bay but significantly different from those of the yangtze river gonghu bay and the center of tai lake fig s8 asv 10 678 and asv 1950 showed higher abundances in yangtze river however the relative abundances of asv 250 and asv 784 were much higher in gonghu bay than in other habitats 3 3 biotic homogenization between water donating receiving areas accelerated by water diversion higher taxon overlap and similarity of community composition between gonghu bay zhushan bay and its connected river than that with the center of tai lake more than 44 1 of the taxa 60 136 were found across all sampled habitats whereas 6 6 of them 9 136 detected were unique to a particular habitat fig 4 there were 82 taxa shared between gonghu bay and its connecting channel wangyu river which was higher than the 77 shared taxa between gonghu bay and the center of tai lake fig s5 additionally 84 taxa were shared between zhushan bay and its connecting channel taige canal which was higher than the 67 shared taxa between zhushan bay and central lake fg s6 as demonstrated by the nmds plot edna samples from gonghu bay were grouped closely with those from wangyu river especially with wy 05 which is geographically closer to the estuary a similar phenomenon was found between zhushan bay and taige canal the samples of zhushan bay especially z m1 and z m2 were clustered together with samples from taige canal but far away from the center of tai lake fig 5 the direction of water diversion shaped the spatial distributions of phytoplankton community across habitats in the wdyt projects figs 5 s7 nmds analysis showed that samples in taige canal clustered together however samples in zhushan bay were separated from each other furthermore the community similarities of samples from zhushan bay and the taige canal decreased with increasing geographical distance by nmds fig 5a and linear regression analysis fig 5c these patterns were consistent with the fact that water from taige canal was flowing into tai lake through zhushan bay while water from tai lake was flowing into wangyu river through gonghu bay during the investigation the relative abundances of indicators such as dolichospermum and merismopedia in zhushan bay also showed a decreasing trend with increasing distance from the inlet of taige canal fig s9 while pairwise site comparisons in wangyu river varied samples from gonghu bay were grouped together the community similarities between samples from wangyu river and gonghu bay decreased prominently with increasing geographical distance by nmds fig 5a and the linear regression model fig 5b the abundances of aphanothece sp and synechococcus in gonghu bay were much higher than those in the wangyu river and gradually decreased with the distance from the estuary of wangyu river fig s10 these results showed that the taige canal inflow had a significant effect on the phytoplankton communities in zhushan bay whereas the community compositions in wangyu river were significantly affected by the outflow of gonghu bay 3 4 skeletonema potamos invaded the water receiving area of tai lake by water diversion skeletonema potamos invaded tai lake from yangtze river through connected rivers and demonstrated higher abundance in the west of tai lake than that in the east fig 6 s potamos asv 75 is a native species in yangtze river accounting for 4 04 of the total euk phytoplankton reads but has not been previously reported in tai lake shuai et al 2017 here edna results showed that s potamos was detected across all sampled sites and its relative abundance in taige canal zhushan bay wangyu river and gonghu bay accounted for 29 86 7 32 8 42 5 57 7 53 7 33 and 1 11 0 38 of that in yangtze river respectively fig 6 the abundance of s potamos in the center of tai lake was almost the lowest 0 04 of the total euk phytoplankton reads the confidence in taxonomic assignment was strong because the sequence of asv 75 text s2 had 100 similarity and 100 query coverage to the sequence of s potamos in ncbi accession number ab728775 1 but the next closet matching species was s costatum with only 99 31 similarity table s2 we also recently identified s potamos under the microscope in gonghu bay fig 6 which strongly supported the edna biomonitoring results species invasion significantly affected the phytoplankton community together with habitat related environmental factors particularly the cyanobacteria community the total nitrogen tn was significantly correlated with total phosphate tp and was not used in the subsequent analysis spearman s correlation r 0 75 p 0 05 fig s12 the effects of tp species invasion and temperature on phytoplankton were greater than those of other environmental variables p 0 05 permutations 999 which explained 71 85 41 08 15 69 and 15 08 and 67 53 42 60 8 57 and 16 36 of the variation in cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton compositions respectively tables s3 s4 fig s13 the temperature in the wangyu river was significantly lower than that in gonghu bay which was probably associated with the waterbody differences of rivers and lakes fig s11 t test p 0 01 significantly higher concentrations of total nitrogen but lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen fig s11 t test p 0 05 were found in the wangyu river than in gonghu bay which was similar to the results in previous studies dai et al 2020 and demonstrated that physicochemical variables were probably changed by water diversion and furthermore contributed to phytoplankton community variations the occurrence of s potamos was significantly correlated with the abundances of 37 native taxa in tai lake r 0 75 p 0 05 particularly being negatively associated with 10 eukaryotic phytoplankton a total of 26 taxa were significantly positively correlated with the relative abundances of s potamos including 6 cyanobacteria 14 chlorophyta and 6 other euk phytoplankton r 0 75 p 0 05 herein cyclotella hyella fontana and planktothrix suspense were the most relevant taxa r 0 94 in addition 1 cyanobacteria gloeocapsa 3 diatoms fragilaria synedra and discostella and 7 other phytoplankton showed negative associations with the abundance of s potamos fig 7 4 discussion the high spatial resolution of biodiversity dynamics by edna metabarcoding revealed distinct biodiversity patterns e g alpha diversity community structure and the abundances of indicator species of phytoplankton among different habitats of yangtze river channel rivers and tai lake the alpha diversity in rivers was higher than that of lakes the richness of yangtze river and taige canal was the highest but that of tai lake was the lowest high biodiversity in the yangtze river can be explained by flows through different geomorphic units different watersheds and different artificial projects in china gao et al 2021 the rich biodiversity in taige canal may be related to the biota of its upstream river network and lakes jiang et al 2021 compared with the community differences among different rivers the differences in phytoplankton community among the east west and center of lake were larger which might be not only related to the habitat differences but also associated with the surrounding rivers entering the lake the genetic composition of the microcystis genus indicated by asv structure was distinct between the inlet of yangtze river and other habitats connecting tai lake which suggested that the microcystis bloom in tai lake might not be directly introduced from yangtze river fig s8 this study together with other recent works verifies that edna metabarcoding can be a powerful tool to capture a localized signal and reveal habitat specific biodiversity in lentic systems brys et al 2020 lotic systems and marine environments jeunen et al 2019 west et al 2020 water diversion increases the consistency of phytoplankton communities between connected waterbodies and drives biotic homogenization our research showed high similarities of phytoplankton communities between connected basins by water diversions similar effects were also revealed in other water diversion projects for instance high similarities of fish communities were revealed among impounded lakes along the chinese snwd path guo et al 2020a the previous study also showed that the planned nicaragua canal would cause genetic homogenization of previously differentiated gene pools by breaking down the geographic barrier between the punta gorda and san juan basins haerer et al 2017 additionally the composition similarities encompassing multiple trophic levels between historical isolated basins increased due to the construction of water diversion projects in brazil daga et al 2020 biotic homogenization might be caused directly through the loss of rare or specialized endemic species and or the gain of cosmopolitan species which are usually caused by anthropogenic filtering and the associated environmental homogenization e g nutrients ph and pollutants gossner et al 2016 mori et al 2018 functional homogenization usually occurs simultaneously with biotic homogenization which heavily affects ecosystem function and consequently decreases the stability of the ecosystem gossner et al 2016 for the first time our research identified the invasion of a nonnative species s potamos into tai lake from yangtze river by water diversion as one of the smallest centric diatoms in river ecosystems s potamos is easily overlooked in samples by light microscopy due to its thin frustule small chloroplast and easy damage during the preparation of permanent slides this may explain why this species was not previously identified by traditional morphology based monitoring dai et al 2020 kiss et al 1994 s potamos has been recorded in the lists of invasive species of many important aquatic ecosystems such as the great lakes in the united states mills et al 1993 the river danube in hungary kiss et al 1994 the river loire in france descy et al 2012 and the elbe river in the czech republic kastovsky et al 2010 although its ecological impacts are still limited skeletonema are widely known as bloom forming taxa in the ocean and s potamos has also been identified as a key taxon involved in algae blooms in virginia rivers due to its high growth potential marshall et al 2012 furthermore skeletonema species have a negative impact on zooplankton by disturbing the filtration process of cladocera or inhibiting the egg hatching success rate of some copepod consumers duleba et al 2014 muller solger et al 2002 the relative abundance of s potamos showed a prominently positive correlation with the concentrations of tp and tn in tai lake fig 7 which was consistent with previous results that s potamos is distributed widely in eutrophic waters kastovsky et al 2010 torgan et al 2009 otherwise s potamos has been reported as a thermophilic and pollution tolerant species kiss et al 2012 torgan et al 2009 global warming and increasing human activities might further increase the risk of successful establishment and spread of s potamos across tai lake the occurrence of invasive species adversely affected the local biodiversity and community compositions of phytoplankton in tai lake the community compositions of cyanobacteria mantel s r 0 242 p 0 05 and euk phytoplankton mantel s r 0 257 p 0 05 in tai lake were significantly affected by species invasion such changes in community structure usually lead to changes in important ecosystem functions such as biomass supply and nutrient cycling gallardo and aldridge 2018 only 1 cyanobacteria but 10 euk phytoplankton such as fragilaria synedra and discostella were negatively correlated with the abundance of s potamos which might be explained by that euk phytoplankton especially diatom are particularly vulnerable to the introduction of s potamos probably due to the much more intensive competition between species the decline of euk phytoplankton species by invasion of s potamos could reduce carbon fixation field et al 1998 in summary the introduction of s potamos may cause serious consequences on the local food web and hence damage ecosystem function therefore future long term monitoring should be particularly cautious toward this species the ecological effect of the water diversion project on phytoplankton in the west of tai lake is higher than that in the east firstly 96 55 84 87 of taxa in western tai lake zhushan bay were detected simultaneously in the connecting waterbody of taige canal which was higher than that between gonghu bay and wangyu river accounting for 88 17 82 93 of the taxa of algae in gonghu bay fig s5 s6 secondly the community compositions significantly differed among the sampling sites of zhushan bay and the community differences between zhushan bay and the taige canal decreased with decreasing distances from the taige canal however there were no significant differences among the different sampling sites in gonghu bay fig 5 finally the relative abundance of the invasive species s potamos in zhushan bay was 7 times greater than that in gonghu bay according to the monthly report of the water regime in the tai lake basin http www tba gov cn the water of the taige canal consistently flowed into zhushan bay and the cumulative inflow volume from april to august in 2020 was more than 721 million m3 20 of the inflow volume of western rivers into tai lake guosong and zunle 2015 wenli et al 2018 however in eastern tai lake the water of the wangyu river flowed into gonghu bay in only 3 stages january may and june with a cumulative time of 30 days and cumulative inflow volume of 86 84 million m3 therefore the greater impact of water transfer to the west of tai lake compared to the east may be due to the larger scale volume and duration of the water diversion projects the higher nutrient loadings in western tai lake than in eastern tai lake also promote the colonization of s potamos guo et al 2020b wu et al 2019 5 conclusion the ecological impact of water diversion projects was evaluated by edna metarbarcoding technology biotic homogenization of phytoplankton between connecting waterbodies was accelerated by water diversions especially in the western part which provided a pathway for the transfer of invasive species such as s potamos into tai lake the species invasion would threaten endemic species and alter community structures this study highlights the importance of ecological
