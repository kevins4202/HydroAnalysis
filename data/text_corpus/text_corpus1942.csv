9710,reasonable estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto requires some climatic inputs which might be missing in areas with sparse data recording this study aimed to assess performance of fao56 penman monteith pm eto fed by era5 merra2 and gldas2 outputs in estimating daily and monthly eto under data limitation the accuracy of pm eto calculated by interpolated factors and the temperature based pm eto pmt was also studied additionally performance of pm eto fed by the bias corrected reanalysis products against the pmt with updated constant i e recalibrated pmt was investigated climatic data required to run pm eto were collected from 146 stations over iran for 25 years results revealed that era5 provides more realistic daily and monthly eto estimates relative to merra2 and gldas2 in 84 of cases furthermore era5 surpassed the others in producing daily and monthly wind speed vapor pressure deficit and mean temperature for the majority of locations the average relative mean bias error rmbe of 7 3 and 8 1 at monthly scale and of 11 1 and 9 8 at daily scale were found for merra2 and gldas2 estimated eto respectively indicating eto overestimation and underestimation by merra2 and gldas2 respectively the era5 provided more satisfactory results with normalized root mean square error of 15 2 and 22 7 for daily and monthly steps respectively relative to pmt for approximately 70 of sites moreover eto estimated by era5 had a smaller nrmse than that simulated using the interpolated variables in around 60 of the sites therefore under temperature data availability or existence of nearby sites application of era5 is better suited to estimate eto in our study area the pm eto fed by bias corrected era5 outputs also outperformed recalibrated pmt illustrating that bias correction seems to be a more accurate modification when complete datasets are available at least for a limited time overall era5 products are robust surrogates for simulating eto under data limitation on different temporal resolutions which is needed for decision making and planning processes keywords bias correction data assimilations data poor areas era5 temperature based eto 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration eto is greatly required for agricultural water management particularly irrigation scheduling as one of the main components of water and energy balances crop evapotranspiration etc returns approximately 60 of terrestrial precipitated water back to the atmosphere hirschi et al 2017 despite the enhancement in etc measurement particularly for more homogeneous systems it is still a primary challenge for hydrological and agricultural applications allen et al 2011 ortega farias et al 2009 therefore the fao56 dual method was developed to estimate et on the basis of a reference value called reference crop evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 the daily eto is a key variable contributing to determining irrigation water requirement allen et al 1998 2006 since agricultural sector accounts for more than two third of water withdrawal worldwide kayatz et al 2019 determining crop water requirement is of eminent significance for national water resources management all strategies guaranteeing food and water security in the present and future such as virtual water trading water productivity improvement and land expansion fader et al 2013 thus require accurate eto estimates for agrohydrological purposes monthly et can be estimated using eto data by using budyko framework it should be noted that the physical basis behind the budyko approach is that the ratio of etc to precipitation etc p is restricted by water energy balances which can be represented by the long term inverse aridity index i e eto p guo et al 2019 wang and hejazi 2011 the budyko hypothesis is mostly applied to evaluate the climatic and anthropogenic impacts on hydrological processes wang and hejazi 2011 in addition monthly eto and etc can be of help for more robust drought and heat wave monitoring nouri and homaee 2020 2021 vicente serrano et al 2010 furthermore as eto is independent of soil physical properties and soil moisture level and is only controlled by climatic factors the eto trend analysis sheds light on the climate change and variability impacts bannayan et al 2020 li et al 2012 nouri et al 2018 among all proposed eto equations the penman monteith a physically based model incorporating thermodynamic and aerodynamic concepts is the most solid approach for eto estimation monteith 1965 allen et al 1998 parameterized the penman monteith equation for the reference surface hereafter referred as to the fao56 penman monteith pm eto as defined by allen et al 1998 eto is the evapotranspiration from a hypothetical reference crop having height of 12 cm a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 without suffering disease water and nutrition stress and achieving full production the pm eto needs solar radiation sr relative humidity rh or dew point temperature tdew minimum and maximum temperature tmin and tmax and wind speed at 2 m height u2 despite its superb performance in modeling eto and water requirement worldwide allen et al 2006 pereira et al 2015 pm eto requires substantial inputs restricting its application in data scarce areas except tmin and tmax the above climatic factors may be unavailable or of poor quality jensen et al 1997 nouri and homaee 2018 there are different scenarios of data unavailability when some data are missing but at least tmin and tmax are measured alternative models such as temperature based hargreaves samani and radiation based priestley taylor can be used nouri and homaee 2018 paredes et al 2020 trajkovic 2005 allen et al 1998 also recommended using some equations known as the fao56 approximations to estimate sr and vapor pressure deficit vpd and assuming u2 2 m s 1 to compute pm eto when at least in situ tmin and tmax data are available the temperature based pm eto is hereafter denoted as pmt paredes et al 2020 such alternatives seem however unable to give realistic results in windy u2 2 5 m s 1 and non windy u2 1 5 m s 1 environments and coastal regions chen et al 2005 jensen and allen 2016 moratiel et al 2020 nouri and homaee 2018 if all data needed for calculating eto based on pm eto are available at least for a limited time period the empirical coefficients of such alternatives can be updated against pm eto gavilán et al 2006 martı nez cob and tejero juste 2004 paredes et al 2017b tabari and talaee 2011 this may improve the performance of the alternatives and result in a more reliable eto estimation if complete datasets are available in nearby areas interpolating the meteorological factors and or directly interpolating eto series are common approaches employed to obtain eto for a desired area where no in situ measurements exist pelosi et al 2020 tomas burguera et al 2018 2017 the performance of geostatistical techniques greatly depends on spatial density and accuracy of data in neighboring areas another approach to estimate eto under absolute data unavailability is applying other alternative datasets such as remote sensed ones the emergence of long term assimilated reanalysis products has generated invaluable tools facilitating pure climatology and applied studies under data limitation dee et al 2014 gelaro et al 2017 these gridded datasets are freely available covering a wide range of spatiotemporal resolutions which make them suitable surrogates for observations at data poor regions the global land data assimilation system noah version 2 gldas2 co produced by national aeronautics and space administration nasa goddard space flight center gsfc the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and national centers for environmental prediction ncep rodell et al 2004 and the modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra2 generated by nasa gelaro et al 2017 are two well known reanalysis datasets applied in a variety of fields such as agrometeorology anderson et al 2017 talacuece et al 2016 hydrology breña naranjo et al 2017 qi et al 2015 and renewable energy gueymard et al 2019 ohlendorf and schill 2020 the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf has also recently developed a new state of the art of reanalysis data i e era5 as a substitution for era interim hersbach et al 2020 despite existing limited references on era5 the superiority of era5 has been ascertained in the literature dong et al 2020 mahto and mishra 2019 olauson 2018 tarek et al 2020 the reanalysis simulations however have bias type uncertainties therefore the reanalysis outputs necessitate to be bias corrected prior to application gruber et al 2019 paredes et al 2018 pelosi and chirico 2021 like for updating empirical coefficients of temperature based models the bias correction also needs in situ meteorological records at least for a limited time slice the era interim boulard et al 2015 paredes et al 2018 era5 land pelosi et al 2020 uerra mescan surfex pelosi et al 2020 and ncep ncar martins et al 2017 raziei and parehkar 2021 reanalysis datasets have been applied to simulate eto series over different spatiotemporal scales some studies also used a specific product to calculate temperature based models or fill data gap ghalami et al 2020 employed nex gddp temperature products to feed pmt and found acceptable performance of pmt except for coastal regions in iran paredes et al 2021 also used era5 and lsa saf to fill the sr data gap and estimate eto in portugal they concluded that pm eto fed by combination of rh u2 and temperature records and the reanalysis sr products provides accurate eto estimates pelosi and chirico 2021 applied a blended datasets consisting of the satellite based sr retrieved from cm saf and the era5 land minimum maximum and dew point temperature and wind speed products to model eto in southern italy and concluded that this hybrid dataset provides highly accurate eto estimates compared with extensive literature on the eto estimation using different models with reduced datasets there are relatively few investigations addressing eto modeling based on alternative datasets additionally most studies have merely used a set of data and lacked intercomparison between eto simulated by different datasets accordingly the current study aims at assessing i the accuracy of glads2 merra2 and era5 in estimating daily and monthly eto as well as mean temperature tmean vpd sr and u2 ii the performance of pm eto computed by the reanalysis packages relative to the performance of pm eto calculated by the interpolated variables and pmt and iii the accuracy of eto estimated by bias corrected reanalysis products against the pmt with updated constant 2 methodology 2 1 the study area and data limitation iran is one the largest countries located in the middle east with a broad range of climatic regimes varying from humid to hyper arid the iran ministry of energy moe and meteorological organization irimo are two major authorities responsible for recording and archiving climate data the moe provides temperature pan evaporation and precipitation data at monthly scale the moe datasets are however of low quality with considerable missing data and also lack daily series on the other hand the irimo records and collects a wide range of climatic and meteorological data with acceptable quality at hourly resolution however the irimo provides reliable long term data for merely 146 locations fig 1 the sites name and number in fig 1 are given table 1 for each site shown in fig 1 rh tmin and tmax wind speed at 10 m height u10 and sunshine hour were collected over 1993 2017 from irimo additionally the precipitation data were retrieved to calculate the aridity index ai the annual ratio of precipitation to eto as can be seen from fig 1 the irimo stations lying in the dasht e kavir and the dasht e lot deserts are highly sparsely distributed for instance there is only one site neighboring the case no 66 in the dasht e kavir with around 100 km of distance from each other moreover for some areas close to the international boundaries such as cases no 118 117 101 82 59 96 and 73 the nearest neighboring site is located within the distance of more than 130 km fig 1 the data unavailability is a challenging issue for the agricultural and hydrological studies and planning for such data sparse regions thus proposing novel methods to overcome data scarcity is of high importance for decision makers and scholars 2 2 eto modeling the pm eto model applied in both monthly and daily scales is presented as allen et al 1998 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t m e a n 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et o denotes reference crop evapotranspiration mm δ is the slope of saturation vapor pressure curve kpa oc 1 r n is the net radiation at reference surface mj m 2 d 1 g represents the soil heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 t mean denotes mean air temperature at 2 m height oc u 2 is the average wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 e s represents the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a denotes the actual vapor pressure kpa e s e a is vpd kpa and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa oc 1 table 1 in the supplementary material gives the equations presented by allen et al 1998 to determine es ea rn tmean γ and δ allen et al 1998 suggested some equations to approximate vpd and rn merely based on temperature data when only tmin and tmax are recorded in order to estimate vpd based on temperature records ea can be considered to be equal to e0 tmin under the absence of data on rh and tdew table 1 in supplementary material the tmin tdew assumption is only valid at moist sub humid environments a modification is however needed for the above mentioned assumption based on the aridity of a given location the relationships of tdew tmin 4 tdew tmin 2 tdew tmin 1 tdew tmin and tdew tmean 2 have been proposed in the literature for hyper arid arid semi arid dry sub humid moist sub humid and humid regimes respectively paredes and pereira 2019 todorovic et al 2013 the climate classification is based on ai introduced by unep 1997 the ai values of 0 05 0 05 0 20 0 20 0 50 0 50 0 65 0 65 1 00 and 1 00 represent the hyper arid arid semi arid dry sub humid moist sub humid and humid climatic regimes respectively the sr needed to calculate rn can be also approximated by tmin and tmax based on the hargreaves radiation equation 2 s r k r s t max t min 0 5 r a where r a is the extraterrestrial radiation and k rs is a constant suggested to be 0 16 for interior cases or 0 19 oc 0 5 for the coastal regions affected by the vast water bodies when no data is available allen et al 1998 samani 2000 allen et al 1998 also pointed out that when there is no u2 measured this factor can be considered to be 2 m s 1 however this seems to cause over under estimation in low high wind environments chen et al 2005 jensen and allen 2016 moratiel et al 2020 nouri and homaee 2018 therefore using local or regional u2 is recommended in the literature nouri and homaee 2018 paredes et al 2017b raziei and pereira 2013 trajkovic and gocic 2021 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009a in the current study the long term average u2 for each site was applied to compute pmt in lieu of simply considering the approximation of u2 2 m s 1 the performance of pmt can be improved in case of partial availability of in situ measurements as mentioned earlier krs varied in the range of 0 16 0 19 under data limitation this coefficient however depends on elevation temperature difference relative humidity and wind speed paredes et al 2017a 2017b 2020 hence it seems to vary further than the above mentioned range if a reliable set of data is available to estimate eto by pm eto krs can be updated by regressing pmt against pm eto in this study the generalized reduced gradient nonlinear optimization algorithm developed by lasdon et al 1978 was utilized to readjust krs we estimated eto using pmt and pmt with updated constant hereinafter referred as to recalibrated pmt for the scenarios of availability of only temperature and average local u2 and availability of complete dataset for a period of time respectively 2 3 the reanalysis datasets the era5 merra2 and gldas2 products were applied to calculate eto at monthly and daily steps the reanalysis datasets are reprocessed and assimilated over different temporal and spatial resolutions here era5 gldas2 and merra2 were retrieved over hourly and monthly scales the era5 data were dew point temperature tdew k tmin and tmax k the eastward and northward wind speed at 10 m height m s 1 the surface solar radiation downwards sr j m 2 over 1993 2017 at the 0 25o 0 25o spatial scales https cds climate copernicus eu the data for merra2 included the eastward and northward wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 surface tdew tmin and tmax k and sr w m 2 in 1993 2017 for the spatial resolution of 0 5o 0 625o https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets the specific humidity kg kg 1 surface air pressure pa sr w m 2 tmin and tmax k u10 m s 1 were also retrieved for gldas2 gldas2 0 for 1993 1999 and gldas2 1 in 2000 2017 at the 0 25o 0 25o scale https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets the gldas2 specific humidity and surface air pressure were applied to approximate rh needed for vpd 3 r h 26 3 s h p exp 17 67 t 273 16 t 29 65 1 where p sh and t are respectively surface air pressure pa specific humidity kg kg 1 and mean air temperature k the uz was also computed by 4 u z u c o m z 2 v c o m z 2 0 5 where u com and v com are the eastward and northward components of wind at z height respectively these data were used to obtain eto by using pm eto model at both daily and monthly scales 2 4 bias correction in order to decrease the bias error of the eto obtained by the reanalysis outputs two bias correction approaches were conducted 1 the bias correction of the contributing factors i e u2 sr tmin tmax and vpd and 2 the bias correction of the eto series as the positivity is not a limitation for temperature the additive correction was undertaken for tmin and tmax hempel et al 2013 the difference between the reanalysis temperature outputs and the observed temperature data i e cadd tobs treanalysis was calculated at each month for the calibration subset and then cadd was added to the reanalysis data during the validation period since the negative values are not physically acceptable for u2 eto sr and vpd the multiplicative approach was utilized for these variables for the latter correction the reanalysis u2 eto sr and vpd series in the verification subset were multiplied by a constant obtained by cmult tobs treanalysis during the calibration duration for each 12 months hempel et al 2013 in the present study the cross validation was carried out for the bias elimination hofer et al 2012 paredes et al 2018 the whole series 1993 2017 for most locations was divided into two subsets i e calibration and validation at the first round of cross validation the additive and multiplicative constants were determined in 1993 2005 the fitting subset for the first step and then applied for 2006 2017 the verification period in the first round for the second step the training and verification subsets were considered to be 2006 2017 and 1993 2005 respectively the statistics introduced in the section 2 5 were then obtained and averaged for two validation subsets similar to recalibration implementation of bias correction requires a set of data available at least for a period of time therefore the accuracy of bias corrected eto estimates was evaluated against recalibrated pmt estimated eto 2 5 geostatistical interpolation overall two rational schemes i e directly interpolating eto determined by pm eto and interpolating the factors and then calculating eto based on pm eto for an unmonitored site are available to estimate eto based on interpolation techniques tomas burguera et al 2017 concluded that interpolating factors and then estimating eto using interpolated variables seems to be a more reliable method in the present study rh u2 and sr were first interpolated using ordinary kriging and then fed to pm eto the ordinary kriging is a linear geostatistical scheme estimating the semivariance of some dependent variables using distance between measured sites the inter site semivariances obtained based on in situ measurements create linear equations predicting the semivariance in an unmeasured site this scheme has been already used to spatially interpolate u2 rh and sr baydaroğlu and koçak 2019 jeong et al 2017 komoto et al 2020 luo et al 2008 pelosi et al 2020 further mathematical information on ordinary kriging can be found in wackernagel 1995 and isaaks and srivastava 1989 as for the factors such as temperature which are correlated with independent variables considering ancillary variable s can improve the accuracy of interpolation pelosi et al 2020 tomas burguera et al 2017 the regression kriging is a geostatistical tool mathematically equivalent to universal kriging and kriging with external drift combining regression model with ordinary kriging technique hengl et al 2007 2004 pelosi et al 2020 therefore the regression kriging approach was applied to interpolate tmin tmax and tmean by using elevation data as the explanatory variable the association between temperature related factors and elevation was modeled using regression and the regression residuals were then kriged cross validation was used to evaluate the performance of the interpolation the interpolated outputs obtained based on cross validation were then used to compute pm eto 2 6 statistical assessment the accuracy of eto estimates was examined by calculating the normalized root mean square error nrmse and relative means bias error rmbe 5 n r m s e 100 o i 1 n s i o i 2 n 6 r m b e 100 o 1 n i 1 n s i o i where s i represents the eto simulated by different approaches under data limitation o i is the pm eto estimated eto by use of the in situ observations o is the average of o i values and n is the number of comparisons the nrmse is an index quantifying the absolute error nouri et al 2016 the performance of a model is considered perfect if nrmse is less than 10 good if this metric varies from 10 to 20 fair if nrmse is between 20 and 30 and poor unreliable if the metric surpasses 30 dettori et al 2011 ku et al 2018 the rmbe is mostly applied to evaluate the model bias and systematic error the negative positive rmbe denotes the model underestimation overestimation nouri et al 2017 the 0 0 value of rmbe and nrmse indicates the best performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the reanalysis datasets at monthly scales 3 1 1 the contributing factors the era5 merra2 and gldas2 provided unreliable monthly u2 estimates i e nrmse 30 for 69 2 99 3 and 85 6 of sites respectively demonstrating poor u2 estimates based on the reanalysis products for most locations fig 2a c the era5 and gldas2 tended to overestimate u2 for 58 9 and 90 6 of sites respectively fig 3a and c underestimation of u2 was however observed for merra2 at 82 2 of stations fig 3b the era5 outperformed merra2 and gldas2 in simulating u2 in approximately 78 1 of sites fig 4a the reanalysis u2 products had a better accuracy in windy areas relative to non windy cases fig 1a b and c in supplementary material the u2 was simulated more realistically using era5 and gldas2 in the most investigated sites with average u2 of 2 m s 1 fig 1a and c in supplementary material this is highlighted for the hyper arid highly windy cases i e zabol no 141 and zahak no 142 located in southeastern iran with average u2 exceeding 3 7 m s 1 and notable seasonal u2 variation as a consequence of extreme winds known as wind of 120 days alizadeh choobari et al 2014 the satisfactory eto estimates based on era5 fig 5a can be attributed to the accurate monthly u2 simulations in these windy sites overall the applied reanalysis datasets did not give accurate monthly u2 estimates in the majority of sites surveyed raziei and parehkar 2021 and molaei and lashkari 2020 also reported poor agreement between the in situ u2 records and reanalysis u2 products across iran the used reanalysis packages simulated monthly tmean series with sufficient accuracy i e nrmse of 30 for more than 94 of studied sites fig 2d e and f however the calculated error in the reanalysis tmean outputs was larger for some northwestern cold mountainous and non coastal northern locations acceptable accuracy of merra2 and gldas2 temperature outputs at monthly scale in iran has been already reported by miri et al 2018 faraji et al 2017 ahmadi et al 2019 and alibakhshi et al 2019 raziei and parehkar 2021 mentioned that ncep ncar had a nrmse lower than 30 in simulating tmin and tmax for the majority of areas in iran ghalami et al 2020 also concluded that the nex gddp temperature simulations had less agreement with ground observations in coastal regions relative to inland areas of iran for more than two third of stations tmean was underestimated by gldas2 era5 and merra2 fig 3d f more reliable tmean simulation was found for warmer sites fig 1d f in supplementary material at more than half of the locations era5 produced more realistic tmean series as compared with merra2 and gldas2 fig 4b the nrmse of merra2 estimated sr was larger than 30 for only four northern coastal stations at monthly scale fig 2h the gldas2 and era5 however simulated sr with acceptable accuracy i e nrmse of 30 for all surveyed stations fig 2g and i moreover sr was overestimated for 56 1 100 and 97 3 of studied sites using gldas2 merra2 and era5 respectively fig 3g i fig 4c demonstrates that gldas2 sr outputs were superior to the sr produced by era5 and merra2 at most studied locations given the fact that sr or sunshine hour is the most common missing climate variable in iran gldas2 sr products can be employed to fill up the missing data particularly for the period of 1979 1982 and prior to 1966 when sr is not available or of questionable quality the gldas2 sr simulations are also likely to be useful for assessing solar power potential mokhtari et al 2018a mokhtari et al 2018b and ahmadibaseri et al 2020 reported the good agreement between gldas2 sr products and ground observations across iran the nrmse of monthly vpd estimated by era5 merra2 and gldas2 exceeded 30 for 19 2 28 8 and 38 1 of stations respectively fig 2j k and l therefore the studied reanalysis datasets estimated vpd with acceptable accuracy for the majority of sites raziei and parehkar 2021 however found high error in ncep ncar monthly rh products i e nrmse 30 across iran the vpd underestimation was observed for more than 62 of sites by using the reanalysis datasets fig 3j k and l the era5 surpassed the other two reanalysis packages in modeling vpd at around 57 of cases fig 4d the gldas2 and merra2 provided inaccurate vpd estimates nrmse of 30 for the most southern and northern coastal stations furthermore monthly vpd simulated by the reanalysis datasets had a nrmse above 30 for the most northwestern locations with average vpd less than 0 7 kpa figs 2j l and 1j l in supplementary material overall era5 outperforms the other reanalysis datasets in producing u2 tmean and vpd at most studied locations the era5 datasets have been also reported to yield better results for near surface wind speed dong et al 2020 graham et al 2019 olauson 2018 ramon et al 2019 humidity related factors graham et al 2019 solar radiation babar et al 2019 sianturi et al 2020 and temperature graham et al 2019 johannsen et al 2019 tarek et al 2020 3 1 2 eto the average nrmse values for monthly eto calculated using era5 merra2 and gldas2 outputs were obtained to be 15 2 22 3 and 24 1 respectively the nrmse values for era5 based eto were 10 in range of 10 to 20 between 20 and 30 and over 30 for 15 1 69 2 13 0 and 2 7 of the studied sites respectively fig 5a the merra2 estimated eto had a nrmse lower that 10 ranging from 10 20 varying between 20 and 30 and more than 30 at 1 4 45 2 35 6 and 17 8 of the locations respectively fig 5b the nrmse obtained for gldas2 estimated eto was found to be 10 between 10 and 20 in range of 20 30 and greater than 30 at 0 7 44 6 35 3 and 19 4 of sites respectively fig 5c therefore era5 merra2 and gldas2 eto simulations were poor i e nrmse 30 for 4 26 and 27 locations respectively at monthly scale fig 5a c the merra2 datasets seem not to accurately estimate eto at northern coastal sites and the stations lying around the dasht e lot and the dasht e kavir deserts in addition gldas2 modeled eto inaccurately for the most sites located along the coastal strip of the caspian sea the persian gulf and the gulf of oman as well as the locations surrounding the dasht e kavir desert raziei and parehkar 2021 stated that the ncep ncar reanalysis outputs did not produce satisfactory eto estimates i e nrmse 30 for northern and southern coastal regions and southern and eastern inland areas of iran they found that aggregation of error in estimating tmin tmax and sr products seems to contribute greatly to error in ncep ncar simulated eto ghalami et al 2020 also reported that pmt fed by nex gddp gridded datasets estimated eto less accurately in coastal areas of iran which was ascribed to higher absolute and systematic error in nex gddp tmin and tmax products in these areas the era5 however seems to be a reliable surrogate of ground measurements for estimating eto in coastal stations fig 5a at about 84 of stations eto was estimated more accurately based on era5 datasets rather than gldas2 and merra2 fig 7a note that these results do not necessarily illustrate the accuracy of era5 in estimating eto but simply demonstrate era5 s superiority with respect to merra2 and gldas2 the three reanalysis datasets provided unsatisfactory eto estimates for four sites of kashan no 67 khoor biabanak no 76 jolfa no 61 and manjil no 86 fig 5a c this might be explained by the climatic complexity in particular for u2 due mainly to geographical settings here it is focused specifically upon u2 as it displays the largest variability and controls the eto dynamics for most water limited environments such as the majority of the surveyed sites mcvicar et al 2012 nouri and bannayan 2019 nouri et al 2018 xie et al 2015 you et al 2013 the reanalysis products may not be able to estimate eto with acceptable accuracy at low high wind speed regions surrounded by high low wind speed areas owing to their spatial resolution limitation for instance kashan and khoor biabanak the non windy cases situated around the dasht e kavir desert with u2 of 0 59 and 0 84 m s 1 are neighbored by the sites with average u2 of 2 24 and 1 81 m s 1 respectively on the contrary manjil with average u2 of 4 4 m s 1 is surrounded by the sites having average u2 of 1 68 m s 1 besides spatial variations the reanalysis datasets performance is also influenced by seasonality on monthly scale an average nrmse of 18 2 13 0 13 1 and 15 7 for era5 estimated eto 24 6 17 5 18 7 and 23 2 for merra2 estimated eto and 31 4 20 7 21 0 and 25 5 for gldas2 simulated eto was calculated during the december january february djf march april may mam june july august jja and september october november son seasons respectively the djf mam jja and son eto was also modeled with nrmse exceeding 30 using era5 in 6 8 1 4 2 7 and 2 7 merra2 in 17 8 9 6 8 9 and 21 9 and gldas2 in 41 1 11 6 14 4 and 19 9 of cases studied respectively fig 2 in supplementary material the gldas2 estimated djf eto with relatively larger error in northwestern iran the mountainous region characterized with cold snowy winters fig 2c in supplementary material accordingly the used reanalysis datasets provided less accurate eto estimates during djf and more reliable eto results in mam nouri and homaee 2018 also highlighted the challenge of wintertime eto estimation often required for agroclimatological and winter hydrological modeling the monthly eto was under and overestimated using merra2 and gldas2 for more than two third of the investigated sites respectively fig 6b and c however era5 did not exhibit an overall tendency to over or underestimation fig 6a the eto underestimation was observed for the majority of cold semi arid sites located in northwestern and western iran however eto was mostly overestimated based on the reanalysis datasets for the humid northern cases the eto overestimation has been frequently reported for high humidity and well irrigated environments under data scarcity temesgen et al 1999 trajkovic 2007 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009b the rmbe values obtained for the seasonal eto are also presented in fig 3 of supplementary material we regressed the rmbe values of tmean u2 sr and vpd products against rmbe obtained for eto estimated by reanalysis products fig 4 in supplementary material the r2 values obtained between rmbe of eto estimates and rmbe of contributing factors imply that the u2 bias has the strongest association with bias in eto estimates fig 4 in supplementary material raziei and parehkar 2021 stated that bias in tmax and u2 contributed the most to the bias error in ncep ncar simulated eto ghalami et al 2020 also explained large bias in eto results obtained using pmt fed by nex gddp temperature outputs with high bias error in tmax products over coastal locations of iran 3 2 eto estimated by reanalysis products pmt and interpolation as can be seen from fig 7b era5 merra2 gldas2 pmt based eto estimates had a relatively higher accuracy smaller nrmse for 68 5 5 5 4 1 and 21 9 of the sites respectively thus era5 appears to be a more accurate surrogate of in situ records for most cases even when temperature and average local u2 are observed the pmt estimated eto with nrmse larger than 30 for 7 out of 11 locations having average u2 over 3 m s 1 despite long term average u2 was used pmt still provided unsatisfactory eto estimates under windy conditions nouri and homaee 2018 have underlined the poor performance of pmt computed by average u2 in windy conditions application of gridded reanalysis products resulted in more accurate eto for 8 out of 11 windy sites therefore they seem to be more preferable for windy environments this is more highlighted for the southeastern hyper arid sites e g zabol and zahak in particular during summertime in which average u2 exceeds 6 m s 1 the pm eto fed by era5 merra2 gldas2 and interpolated inputs simulated eto more successfully lower nrmse in 59 6 2 7 4 1 and 33 6 of locations studied respectively fig 7c thus for two third of cases application of reanalysis products is better suited to model eto under data scarcity even if the neighboring sites have complete datasets to compute pm eto the accuracy of outputs generated by classic interpolation techniques such as kriging which are based on distance weighting heavily depends on density and distribution of neighboring sites tomas burguera et al 2018 tomas burguera et al 2018 concluded that increment in density of observations applied for interpolation decreases the uncertainty in interpolated wind speed and relative humidity and consequently improves the eto estimation therefore lower accuracy of interpolation based eto estimates may be attributed to high distance between the sites and data sparsity in the majority of cases in addition to data sparsity considerable u2 variability appears to explain higher nrmse of interpolation based estimates in hyper arid southeastern windy locations the interpolation however gave more reliable eto estimates in northeastern iran pelosi et al 2020 found a nrmse of 14 and 17 for eto obtained by using kriging interpolation method and era5 land reanalysis datasets respectively during irrigation season in southern italy with an area of 14 000 km2 lying between the tyrrhenian sea coastline and the southern apennines they used 18 weather stations with complete datasets indicating availability of one dataset for each 778 km2 the guilan province shown in fig 1 with an area of 14 042 km2 and considerable geographic complexity bounded between the caspian sea and the alborz mountains resembles the study area of pelosi et al 2020 only four sites of rasht anzali astara and manjil with long term complete datasets were available for this province indicating spatial data density of one site per each 3510 km2 the era5 gave better eto estimates for these four stations fig 7c this comparison explicitly implies that the accuracy of interpolation based techniques highly depends on data density and the distance between neighboring sites therefore pm eto computed by era5 may provide more satisfactory results as compared with that fed by interpolated factors in data sparse regions 3 3 evaluation of the bias correction and recalibration approaches fig 8a c indicates an improvement in nrmse of the monthly eto estimates due to the bias correction of individual products i e vpd tmean sr and u2 at approximately half of the stations studied bias correcting the individual factors improved the average nrmse of monthly eto estimation from 15 4 to 14 3 for era5 22 1 20 0 for merra2 and 18 9 18 6 for gldas2 the application of unbiased era5 merra2 gldas2 factors for calculating eto decreased nrmse to less than 30 for 3 14 and 11 sites with poor eto estimates i e nrmse of 30 it should be noted that despite a small decrease 1 1 for era5 2 1 for merra2 and 0 3 for gldas2 in average nrmse occurred the decline in nrmse for some sites exceeded 10 illustrating a great improvement in accuracy of monthly eto estimates in some cases fig 8a c a reduction in nrmse was observed for 74 7 89 0 and 44 6 of locations as a result of the bias correction of the era5 merra2 and gldas2 based eto series respectively fig 8a c moreover bias correcting the monthly eto series reduced the average nrmse of era5 and merra2 simulated eto by 4 1 and 7 3 respectively on the contrary after correcting bias of gldas2 based monthly eto estimates a small increase in average nrmse 0 7 occurred no site with nrmse surpassing 30 was found after bias correcting the eto estimated by era5 and merra2 products as can be followed from fig 8d f the rmbe of the most sites with overestimation underestimation declined increased denoting that the bias correction approaches improved the systematic estimation error overall removing bias of individual factors seems to be a more robust approach for gldas2 whereas bias correction of eto series is likely to be a more preferable alternative for era5 and merra2 paredes et al 2018 have also suggested bias correcting eto series computed by pm eto fed by era interim outputs fig 7d indicates the performance of pm eto fed by bias corrected reanalysis products against recalibrated pmt when the complete datasets are available for a given location at least for a limited period the updated krs is given in table 2 of supplementary material note that these updated krs values differ from those given by raziei and pereira 2013 due to the fact that we used the long term local average instead of a constant value 2 m s 1 for u2 this explains high krs values for some cases therefore a caution needs to be exercised when using the krs listed in table 2 of supplementary material it should be noted that the most accurate bias correction approach bias correction of individual factors for gldas2 and bias correction of eto series for era5 and merra2 was considered in fig 7d the results demonstrate that monthly eto was modeled more accurately by pm eto fed by bias corrected era5 merra2 gldas2 and recalibrated pmt in 56 2 8 1 6 2 and 29 5 of sites respectively therefore in case of availability of required data for a limited period bias correction of era5 estimated eto seems to be a more reliable approach under data limitation however unbiased era5 datasets did not produce the most accurate estimates for the sites surrounding the dasht e kavir and central iran recalibrated pmt is likely to be better suited for estimating eto in the dasht e kavir regions the alternative models such as hargreaves samani and pmt are often applied for the case of temperature data availability in case of availability of data for a limited time the empirical constant of such models can be updated in order to improve the eto results however our results showed that bias correcting eto simulated by using reanalysis packages is more suited in case of data availability for a limited time slice in spite of the usefulness of these modifications these methods should be applied with great care in some cases substantial difference between the values of a specific variable for calibration and validation durations is likely to increase the eto estimation error after bias correction for instance ghochan no 49 in which both bias correction methods resulted in an increased nrmse had average u2 of 1 0 and 2 4 m s 1 for the periods of 1993 2005 and 2006 2017 respectively if abrupt climatic changes and anomalies take place bias correction may thus worsen the estimation accuracy a recalibrated factor may also deteriorate the performance of temperature based models particularly for the geographically complex areas ravazzani et al 2012 temporal variability caused by climatic changes and anomalies is also another uncertainty source of readjustment nouri and homaee 2018 need for large reliable datasets which are often unavailable in data poor areas is another drawback to the recalibration of coefficients and bias correction moreover one can simply apply observations to calculate pm eto instead of using imperfect temperature based formulae or reanalysis products if reliable in situ records exist droogers and allen 2002 nouri and homaee 2018 consequently any modification to acquire better eto estimates should be tested prior to application in a data poor area to avoid accuracy deterioration this has also been stressed by tomas burguera et al 2017 and nouri and homaee 2018 3 4 daily contributing factors and eto simulated using reanalysis products similar to monthly u2 estimation there was a poor agreement nrmse 30 between reanalysis u2 products and ground observations for the majority of sites fig 9a c the tmean reanalysis products had nrmse values ranging from 10 to 20 for most cases demonstrating acceptable accuracy of the reanalysis packages for estimating daily tmean fig 9d f the era5 and gldas2 provided sr estimates with nrmse varying from 10 to 20 for more than 85 of cases at daily scale fig 9g and i however there was a nrmse between 20 and 30 for daily merra2 sr estimates in more than half of the studied stations fig 9h the merra2 also provided poor daily sr estimates nrmse 30 for northern coastal stations fig 9h the era5 merra2 and gldas2 produced daily vpd with acceptable accuracy i e nrmse 30 for 62 3 56 8 and 42 7 of cases respectively similar to monthly comparisons era5 outperformed the other reanalysis packages in producing daily tmean u2 and vpd in 54 8 78 1 and 56 8 of stations respectively it is worth mentioning that despite era5 provided relatively better daily u2 estimates but failed to give reliable daily u2 estimates for the majority of sites the sr gldas2 products had a lower nrmse for around 87 of investigated cases the merra2 and gldas2 tended to underestimate and overestimate daily u2 for the most cases fig 10b and c the daily tmean was also underestimated by the reanalysis packages for more than two third of studied sites fig 10d e and f the era5 and merra2 had a tendency to overestimate daily sr for almost all stations fig 10g and h an underestimated daily vpd was also found for more than 60 of sites fig 10j l the nrmse values of daily eto modeled by applying era5 merra2 and gldas2 ranged between 10 and 20 at 41 1 5 5 and 2 9 of sites varied from 20 to 30 for 47 9 39 7 and 36 7 of locations and surpassed 30 for 10 9 54 8 and 60 4 of cases respectively fig 11 the cases with erroneous estimates of daily eto i e nrmse of 30 mostly had a nrmse larger than 20 for monthly eto figs 5 and 11 therefore it can be concluded that when nrmse of monthly eto is below 20 reanalysis datasets are likely to provide daily eto with reasonable accuracy the daily eto was overestimated and underestimated by gldas2 and merra2 for more than two third of sites respectively fig 12b and c the era5 outputs can be reliably used for the most cases when daily eto is required the era5 gave more reliable eto estimates with respect to meera2 and gldas2 in around 84 of cases on both monthly and daily scales fair daily eto estimates using era interim simulations have been also reported by paredes et al 2018 an increase in nrmse from 15 2 22 2 and 24 1 for eto simulated based on era5 merra2 and gldas2 at monthly resolution to 22 7 31 0 and 33 8 on daily scale respectively seems to be linked to the high dynamics of daily eto significantly owing to large variation in daily u2 there are some approaches to reduce the error in daily eto modeling based on reanalysis datasets averaging or smoothing daily eto quantities e g 10 day is an approach frequently applied to decline the error in eto estimates for agrometeorological and irrigation applications under data scarcity jensen and allen 2016 the average nrmse of the era5 estimated eto dropped from 22 7 for daily step to 17 2 for 10 day step fig 13a in addition unreliable 10 day era5 simulated eto i e nrmse of 30 was found only in 8 sites fig 13a therefore using 10 daily eto appears to provide more satisfactory results for irrigation scheduling and crop modeling requiring eto in finer temporal resolutions the bias correction is also another option to diminish error in daily eto estimates paredes et al 2018 fig 13b indicates the overall improvement in nrmse of the daily era5 simulated eto as a result of bias correcting eto series it is noteworthy that only bias correction of the eto series as a more effective method for era5 was conducted on daily resolution the average nrmse of daily eto fell from 21 8 to 19 1 after the bias was corrected note that removing the bias needs some years of gauged data in case of no data the 10 day average era5 estimated eto appears therefore to be a more reasonable alternative in circumstances requiring higher temporal resolution of eto 4 conclusions and remarks in this study we attempted to assess the accuracy of eto estimates based on the reanalysis products under different scenarios of data unavailability results reveal that era5 provided more realistic daily and monthly eto values compared to gldas2 and merra2 in 84 of studied sites this illustrates that era5 estimated eto can be reliably applied when there is absolutely no data available at both monthly and daily scales moreover application of original era5 yields more reliable eto estimates in most cases in respect to pmt consequently more reliable eto results are expected to be obtained by using pm eto fed by era5 in case of temperature and average local u2 availability this is more highlighted for hyper arid windy regions where the alternatives not including u2 dynamics fail to accurately simulate eto additionally pm eto calculated by the interpolated factors had less accuracy compared to that fed by era5 at around 60 of cases implying that the application of era5 is more suited to estimate eto in our study area when nearby stations having complete datasets are available no site with poor eto estimates nrmse 30 was observed in the entire studied area after bias correcting era5 and merra2 modeled eto as for gldas2 bias correction of individual factors led to better results we further observed an improvement in nrmse of daily era5 estimated eto as a result of 10 day averaging and bias correction the pm eto computed by bias corrected era5 provided more accurate eto estimates as compared with recalibrated pmt therefore in case of having limited data for instance 5 year dataset more accurate simulations can be obtained by using bias corrected era5 in some cases the eto estimation based on reanalysis datasets should be treated with great care there may be a large bias in reanalysis datasets at highly data sparse regions data assimilation might be carried out in the absence of ground observations in these areas adding large uncertainties to the results moreover reanalysis outputs are given in specific scales e g approximately 28 28 km2 for era5 therefore for a given case lying in a climatically and or geographically complex region estimating eto based on reanalysis products may be erroneous manjil no 86 a mountainous windy site surrounded with non windy areas is a climatologically and geographically complex case in which all products and alternative techniques had a high bias error there in such cases reanalysis datasets must be evaluated and bias corrected prior to application accordingly reanalysis datasets seem to produce better results for more homogenous plains with no abrupt climatic and topographic variability the era5 also gave less accurate eto estimates for wintertime this is of significance for determining the water requirement of autumn sown crops and winter hydrological processes considering the era5 s superiority in monthly and daily resolutions it appears to be a better option for hydrological and crop modeling purposes and agricultural irrigation scheduling under data scarcity an intercomparison analysis is however needed to be conducted to evaluate the accuracy of hydrological and crop models run by different sources of data including era5 given the fact that era5 generates reliable sr and u2 in some highly windy cases simulations era5 can be also applied to evaluate potential renewable energy resources at data poor regions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

9710,reasonable estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto requires some climatic inputs which might be missing in areas with sparse data recording this study aimed to assess performance of fao56 penman monteith pm eto fed by era5 merra2 and gldas2 outputs in estimating daily and monthly eto under data limitation the accuracy of pm eto calculated by interpolated factors and the temperature based pm eto pmt was also studied additionally performance of pm eto fed by the bias corrected reanalysis products against the pmt with updated constant i e recalibrated pmt was investigated climatic data required to run pm eto were collected from 146 stations over iran for 25 years results revealed that era5 provides more realistic daily and monthly eto estimates relative to merra2 and gldas2 in 84 of cases furthermore era5 surpassed the others in producing daily and monthly wind speed vapor pressure deficit and mean temperature for the majority of locations the average relative mean bias error rmbe of 7 3 and 8 1 at monthly scale and of 11 1 and 9 8 at daily scale were found for merra2 and gldas2 estimated eto respectively indicating eto overestimation and underestimation by merra2 and gldas2 respectively the era5 provided more satisfactory results with normalized root mean square error of 15 2 and 22 7 for daily and monthly steps respectively relative to pmt for approximately 70 of sites moreover eto estimated by era5 had a smaller nrmse than that simulated using the interpolated variables in around 60 of the sites therefore under temperature data availability or existence of nearby sites application of era5 is better suited to estimate eto in our study area the pm eto fed by bias corrected era5 outputs also outperformed recalibrated pmt illustrating that bias correction seems to be a more accurate modification when complete datasets are available at least for a limited time overall era5 products are robust surrogates for simulating eto under data limitation on different temporal resolutions which is needed for decision making and planning processes keywords bias correction data assimilations data poor areas era5 temperature based eto 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration eto is greatly required for agricultural water management particularly irrigation scheduling as one of the main components of water and energy balances crop evapotranspiration etc returns approximately 60 of terrestrial precipitated water back to the atmosphere hirschi et al 2017 despite the enhancement in etc measurement particularly for more homogeneous systems it is still a primary challenge for hydrological and agricultural applications allen et al 2011 ortega farias et al 2009 therefore the fao56 dual method was developed to estimate et on the basis of a reference value called reference crop evapotranspiration eto allen et al 1998 the daily eto is a key variable contributing to determining irrigation water requirement allen et al 1998 2006 since agricultural sector accounts for more than two third of water withdrawal worldwide kayatz et al 2019 determining crop water requirement is of eminent significance for national water resources management all strategies guaranteeing food and water security in the present and future such as virtual water trading water productivity improvement and land expansion fader et al 2013 thus require accurate eto estimates for agrohydrological purposes monthly et can be estimated using eto data by using budyko framework it should be noted that the physical basis behind the budyko approach is that the ratio of etc to precipitation etc p is restricted by water energy balances which can be represented by the long term inverse aridity index i e eto p guo et al 2019 wang and hejazi 2011 the budyko hypothesis is mostly applied to evaluate the climatic and anthropogenic impacts on hydrological processes wang and hejazi 2011 in addition monthly eto and etc can be of help for more robust drought and heat wave monitoring nouri and homaee 2020 2021 vicente serrano et al 2010 furthermore as eto is independent of soil physical properties and soil moisture level and is only controlled by climatic factors the eto trend analysis sheds light on the climate change and variability impacts bannayan et al 2020 li et al 2012 nouri et al 2018 among all proposed eto equations the penman monteith a physically based model incorporating thermodynamic and aerodynamic concepts is the most solid approach for eto estimation monteith 1965 allen et al 1998 parameterized the penman monteith equation for the reference surface hereafter referred as to the fao56 penman monteith pm eto as defined by allen et al 1998 eto is the evapotranspiration from a hypothetical reference crop having height of 12 cm a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 without suffering disease water and nutrition stress and achieving full production the pm eto needs solar radiation sr relative humidity rh or dew point temperature tdew minimum and maximum temperature tmin and tmax and wind speed at 2 m height u2 despite its superb performance in modeling eto and water requirement worldwide allen et al 2006 pereira et al 2015 pm eto requires substantial inputs restricting its application in data scarce areas except tmin and tmax the above climatic factors may be unavailable or of poor quality jensen et al 1997 nouri and homaee 2018 there are different scenarios of data unavailability when some data are missing but at least tmin and tmax are measured alternative models such as temperature based hargreaves samani and radiation based priestley taylor can be used nouri and homaee 2018 paredes et al 2020 trajkovic 2005 allen et al 1998 also recommended using some equations known as the fao56 approximations to estimate sr and vapor pressure deficit vpd and assuming u2 2 m s 1 to compute pm eto when at least in situ tmin and tmax data are available the temperature based pm eto is hereafter denoted as pmt paredes et al 2020 such alternatives seem however unable to give realistic results in windy u2 2 5 m s 1 and non windy u2 1 5 m s 1 environments and coastal regions chen et al 2005 jensen and allen 2016 moratiel et al 2020 nouri and homaee 2018 if all data needed for calculating eto based on pm eto are available at least for a limited time period the empirical coefficients of such alternatives can be updated against pm eto gavilán et al 2006 martı nez cob and tejero juste 2004 paredes et al 2017b tabari and talaee 2011 this may improve the performance of the alternatives and result in a more reliable eto estimation if complete datasets are available in nearby areas interpolating the meteorological factors and or directly interpolating eto series are common approaches employed to obtain eto for a desired area where no in situ measurements exist pelosi et al 2020 tomas burguera et al 2018 2017 the performance of geostatistical techniques greatly depends on spatial density and accuracy of data in neighboring areas another approach to estimate eto under absolute data unavailability is applying other alternative datasets such as remote sensed ones the emergence of long term assimilated reanalysis products has generated invaluable tools facilitating pure climatology and applied studies under data limitation dee et al 2014 gelaro et al 2017 these gridded datasets are freely available covering a wide range of spatiotemporal resolutions which make them suitable surrogates for observations at data poor regions the global land data assimilation system noah version

2019 ohlendorf and schill 2020 the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf has also recently developed a new state of the art of reanalysis data i e era5 as a substitution for era interim hersbach et al 2020 despite existing limited references on era5 the superiority of era5 has been ascertained in the literature dong et al 2020 mahto and mishra 2019 olauson 2018 tarek et al 2020 the reanalysis simulations however have bias type uncertainties therefore the reanalysis outputs necessitate to be bias corrected prior to application gruber et al 2019 paredes et al 2018 pelosi and chirico 2021 like for updating empirical coefficients of temperature based models the bias correction also needs in situ meteorological records at least for a limited time slice the era interim boulard et al 2015 paredes et al 2018 era5 land pelosi et al 2020 uerra mescan surfex pelosi et al 2020 and ncep ncar martins et al 2017 raziei and parehkar 2021 reanalysis datasets have been applied to simulate eto series over different spatiotemporal scales some studies also used a specific product to calculate temperature based models or fill data gap ghalami et al 2020 employed nex gddp temperature products to feed pmt and found acceptable performance of pmt except for coastal regions in iran paredes et al 2021 also used era5 and lsa saf to fill the sr data gap and estimate eto in portugal they concluded that pm eto fed by combination of rh u2 and temperature records and the reanalysis sr products provides accurate eto estimates pelosi and chirico 2021 applied a blended datasets consisting of the satellite based sr retrieved from cm saf and the era5 land minimum maximum and dew point temperature and wind speed products to model eto in southern italy and concluded that this hybrid dataset provides highly accurate eto estimates compared with extensive literature on the eto estimation using different models with reduced datasets there are relatively few investigations addressing eto modeling based on alternative datasets additionally most studies have merely used a set of data and lacked intercomparison between eto simulated by different datasets accordingly the current study aims at assessing i the accuracy of glads2 merra2 and era5 in estimating daily and monthly eto as well as mean temperature tmean vpd sr and u2 ii the performance of pm eto computed by the reanalysis packages relative to the performance of pm eto calculated by the interpolated variables and pmt and iii the accuracy of eto estimated by bias corrected reanalysis products against the pmt with updated constant 2 methodology 2 1 the study area and data limitation iran is one the largest countries located in the middle east with a broad range of climatic regimes varying from humid to hyper arid the iran ministry of energy moe and meteorological organization irimo are two major authorities responsible for recording and archiving climate data the moe provides temperature pan evaporation and precipitation data at monthly scale the moe datasets are however of low quality with considerable missing data and also lack daily series on the other hand the irimo records and collects a wide range of climatic and meteorological data with acceptable quality at hourly resolution however the irimo provides reliable long term data for merely 146 locations fig 1 the sites name and number in fig 1 are given table 1 for each site shown in fig 1 rh tmin and tmax wind speed at 10 m height u10 and sunshine hour were collected over 1993 2017 from irimo additionally the precipitation data were retrieved to calculate the aridity index ai the annual ratio of precipitation to eto as can be seen from fig 1 the irimo stations lying in the dasht e kavir and the dasht e lot deserts are highly sparsely distributed for instance there is only one site neighboring the case no 66 in the dasht e kavir with around 100 km of distance from each other moreover for some areas close to the international boundaries such as cases no 118 117 101 82 59 96 and 73 the nearest neighboring site is located within the distance of more than 130 km fig 1 the data unavailability is a challenging issue for the agricultural and hydrological studies and planning for such data sparse regions thus proposing novel methods to overcome data scarcity is of high importance for decision makers and scholars 2 2 eto modeling the pm eto model applied in both monthly and daily scales is presented as allen et al 1998 1 e t o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t m e a n 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2

can be considered to be equal to e0 tmin under the absence of data on rh and tdew table 1 in supplementary material the tmin tdew assumption is only valid at moist sub humid environments a modification is however needed for the above mentioned assumption based on the aridity of a given location the relationships of tdew tmin 4 tdew tmin 2 tdew tmin 1 tdew tmin and tdew tmean 2 have been proposed in the literature for hyper arid arid semi arid dry sub humid moist sub humid and humid regimes respectively paredes and pereira 2019 todorovic et al 2013 the climate classification is based on ai introduced by unep 1997 the ai values of 0 05 0 05 0 20 0 20 0 50 0 50 0 65 0 65 1 00 and 1 00 represent the hyper arid arid semi arid dry sub humid moist sub humid and humid climatic regimes respectively the sr needed to calculate rn can be also approximated by tmin and tmax based on the hargreaves radiation equation 2 s r k r s t max t min 0 5 r a where r a is the extraterrestrial radiation and k rs is a constant suggested to be 0 16 for interior cases or 0 19 oc 0 5 for the coastal regions affected by the vast water bodies when no data is available allen et al 1998 samani 2000 allen et al 1998 also pointed out that when there is no u2 measured this factor can be considered to be 2 m s 1 however this seems to cause over under estimation in low high wind environments chen et al 2005 jensen and allen 2016 moratiel et al 2020 nouri and homaee 2018 therefore using local or regional u2 is recommended in the literature nouri and homaee 2018 paredes et al 2017b raziei and pereira 2013 trajkovic and gocic 2021 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009a in the current study the long term average u2 for each site was applied to compute pmt in lieu of simply considering the approximation of u2 2 m s 1 the performance of pmt can be improved in case of partial availability of in situ measurements as mentioned earlier krs varied in the range of 0 16 0 19 under data limitation this coefficient however depends on elevation temperature difference relative humidity and wind speed paredes et al 2017a 2017b 2020 hence it seems to vary further than the above mentioned range if a reliable set of data is available to estimate eto by pm eto krs can be updated by regressing pmt against pm eto in this study the generalized reduced gradient nonlinear optimization algorithm developed by lasdon et al 1978 was utilized to readjust krs we estimated eto using pmt and pmt with updated constant hereinafter referred as to recalibrated pmt for the scenarios of availability of only temperature and average local u2 and availability of complete dataset for a period of time respectively 2 3 the reanalysis datasets the era5 merra2 and gldas2 products were

also computed by 4 u z u c o m z 2 v c o m z 2 0 5 where u com and v com are the eastward and northward components of wind at z height respectively these data were used to obtain eto by using pm eto model at both daily and monthly scales 2 4 bias correction in order to decrease the bias error of the eto obtained by the reanalysis outputs two bias correction approaches were conducted 1 the bias correction of the contributing factors i e u2 sr tmin tmax and vpd and 2 the bias correction of the eto series as the positivity is not a limitation for temperature the additive correction was undertaken for tmin and tmax hempel et al 2013 the difference between the reanalysis temperature outputs and the observed temperature data i e cadd tobs treanalysis was calculated at each month for the calibration subset and then cadd was added to the reanalysis data during the validation period since the negative values are not physically acceptable for u2 eto sr and vpd the multiplicative approach was utilized for these variables for the latter correction the reanalysis u2 eto sr and vpd series in the verification subset were multiplied by a constant obtained by cmult tobs treanalysis during the calibration duration for each 12 months hempel et al 2013 in the present study the cross validation was carried out for the bias elimination hofer et al 2012 paredes et al 2018 the whole series 1993 2017 for most locations was divided into two subsets i e calibration and validation at the first round of cross validation the additive and multiplicative constants were determined in 1993 2005 the fitting subset for the first step and then applied for 2006 2017 the verification period in the first round for the second step the training and verification subsets were considered to be 2006 2017 and 1993 2005 respectively the statistics introduced in the section 2 5 were then obtained and averaged for two validation subsets similar to recalibration implementation of bias correction requires a set of data available at least for a period of time therefore the accuracy of bias corrected eto estimates was evaluated against recalibrated pmt estimated eto 2 5 geostatistical interpolation overall two rational schemes i e directly interpolating eto determined by pm eto and interpolating the factors and then calculating eto based on pm eto for an unmonitored site are available to estimate eto based on interpolation techniques tomas burguera et al 2017 concluded that interpolating factors and then estimating eto using interpolated variables seems to be a more reliable method in the present study rh u2 and sr were first interpolated using ordinary kriging and then fed to pm eto the ordinary kriging is a linear geostatistical scheme estimating the semivariance of some dependent variables using distance between measured sites the inter site semivariances obtained based on in situ measurements create linear equations predicting the semivariance in an unmeasured site this scheme has been already used to spatially interpolate u2 rh and sr baydaroğlu and koçak 2019 jeong et al 2017 komoto et al 2020 luo et al 2008 pelosi et al 2020 further mathematical information on ordinary kriging can be found in wackernagel 1995 and isaaks and srivastava 1989 as for the factors such as temperature which are correlated with independent variables considering ancillary variable s can improve the accuracy of interpolation pelosi et al 2020 tomas burguera et al 2017 the regression kriging is a geostatistical tool mathematically equivalent to universal kriging and kriging with external drift combining regression model with ordinary kriging technique hengl et al 2007 2004 pelosi et al 2020 therefore the regression kriging approach was applied to interpolate tmin tmax and tmean by using elevation data as the explanatory variable the association between temperature related factors and elevation was modeled using regression and the regression residuals were then kriged cross validation was used to evaluate the performance of the interpolation the interpolated outputs obtained based on cross validation were then used to compute pm eto 2 6 statistical assessment the accuracy of eto estimates was examined by calculating the normalized root mean square error nrmse and relative means bias error rmbe 5 n r m s e 100 o i 1 n s i o i 2 n 6 r m b e 100 o 1 n i 1 n s i o i where s i represents the eto simulated by different approaches under data limitation o i is the pm eto estimated eto by use of the in situ observations o is the average of o i values and n is the number of comparisons the nrmse is an index quantifying the absolute error nouri et al 2016 the performance of a model is considered perfect if nrmse is less than 10 good if this metric varies from 10 to 20 fair if nrmse is between 20 and 30 and poor unreliable if the metric surpasses 30 dettori et al 2011 ku et al 2018 the rmbe is mostly applied to evaluate the model bias and systematic error the negative positive rmbe denotes the model underestimation overestimation nouri et al 2017 the 0 0 value of rmbe and nrmse indicates the best performance 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the reanalysis datasets at monthly scales 3 1 1 the contributing factors the era5 merra2 and gldas2 provided unreliable monthly u2 estimates i e nrmse 30 for 69 2 99 3 and 85 6 of sites respectively demonstrating poor u2 estimates based on the reanalysis products for most locations fig 2a c the era5 and gldas2 tended to overestimate u2 for 58 9 and 90 6 of sites respectively fig 3a and c underestimation of u2 was however observed for merra2 at 82 2 of stations fig 3b the era5 outperformed merra2 and gldas2 in simulating u2 in approximately 78 1 of sites fig 4a the reanalysis u2 products had a better accuracy in windy areas relative to non windy cases fig 1a b and c in supplementary material the u2 was simulated more realistically using era5 and gldas2 in the most investigated sites with average u2 of 2 m s 1 fig 1a and c in supplementary material this is highlighted for the hyper arid highly windy cases i e zabol no 141 and zahak no 142 located in southeastern iran with average u2 exceeding 3 7 m s 1 and notable seasonal u2 variation as a consequence of extreme winds known as wind of 120 days alizadeh choobari et al 2014 the satisfactory eto estimates based on era5 fig 5a can be attributed to the accurate monthly u2 simulations in these windy sites overall the applied reanalysis datasets did not give accurate monthly u2 estimates in the majority of sites surveyed raziei and parehkar 2021 and molaei and lashkari 2020 also reported poor agreement between the in situ u2 records and reanalysis u2 products across iran the used reanalysis packages simulated monthly tmean series with sufficient accuracy i e nrmse of 30 for more than 94 of studied sites fig 2d e and f however the calculated error in the reanalysis tmean outputs was larger for some northwestern cold mountainous and non coastal northern locations acceptable accuracy of merra2 and gldas2 temperature outputs at monthly scale in iran has been already reported by miri et al 2018 faraji et al 2017 ahmadi et al 2019 and alibakhshi et al 2019 raziei and parehkar 2021 mentioned that ncep ncar had a nrmse lower than 30 in simulating tmin and tmax for the majority of areas in iran ghalami et al 2020 also concluded that the nex gddp temperature simulations had less agreement with ground observations in coastal regions relative to inland areas of iran for more than two third of stations tmean was underestimated by gldas2 era5 and merra2 fig 3d f more reliable tmean simulation was found for warmer sites fig 1d f in supplementary material at more than half of the locations era5 produced more realistic tmean series as compared with merra2 and gldas2 fig 4b the nrmse of merra2 estimated sr was larger than 30 for only four northern coastal stations at monthly scale fig 2h the gldas2 and era5 however simulated sr with acceptable accuracy i e nrmse of 30 for all surveyed stations fig 2g and i moreover sr was overestimated for 56 1 100 and 97 3 of studied sites using gldas2 merra2 and era5 respectively fig 3g i fig 4c demonstrates that gldas2 sr outputs were superior to the sr produced by era5 and merra2 at most studied locations given the fact that sr or sunshine hour is the most common missing climate variable in iran gldas2 sr products can be employed to fill up the missing data particularly for the period of 1979 1982 and prior to 1966 when sr is not available or of questionable quality the gldas2 sr simulations are also likely to be useful for assessing solar power potential mokhtari et al 2018a mokhtari et al 2018b and ahmadibaseri et al 2020 reported the good agreement between gldas2 sr products and ground observations across iran the nrmse of monthly vpd estimated by era5 merra2 and gldas2 exceeded 30 for 19 2 28 8 and 38 1 of stations respectively fig 2j k and l therefore the studied reanalysis datasets estimated vpd with acceptable accuracy for the majority of sites raziei and parehkar 2021 however found high error in ncep ncar monthly rh products i e nrmse 30 across iran the vpd underestimation was observed for more than 62 of sites by using the reanalysis datasets fig 3j k and l the era5 surpassed the other two reanalysis packages in modeling vpd at around 57 of cases fig 4d the gldas2 and merra2 provided inaccurate vpd estimates nrmse of 30 for the most southern and northern coastal stations furthermore monthly vpd simulated by the reanalysis datasets had a nrmse above 30 for the most northwestern locations with average vpd less than 0 7 kpa figs 2j l and 1j l in supplementary material overall era5 outperforms the other reanalysis datasets in producing u2 tmean and vpd at most studied locations the era5 datasets have been also reported to yield better results for near surface wind speed dong et al 2020 graham et al 2019 olauson 2018 ramon et al 2019 humidity related factors graham et al 2019 solar radiation babar et al 2019 sianturi et al 2020 and temperature graham et al 2019 johannsen et al 2019 tarek et al 2020 3 1 2 eto the average nrmse values for monthly eto calculated using era5 merra2 and gldas2 outputs were obtained to be 15 2 22 3 and 24 1 respectively the nrmse values for era5 based eto were 10 in range of 10 to 20 between 20 and 30 and over 30 for 15 1 69 2 13 0 and 2 7 of the studied sites respectively fig 5a the merra2 estimated eto had a nrmse lower that 10 ranging from 10 20 varying between 20 and 30 and more than 30 at 1 4 45 2 35 6 and 17 8 of the locations respectively fig 5b the nrmse obtained for gldas2 estimated eto was found to be 10 between 10 and 20 in range of 20 30 and greater than 30 at 0 7 44 6 35 3 and 19 4 of sites respectively fig 5c therefore era5 merra2 and gldas2 eto simulations were poor i e nrmse 30 for 4 26 and 27 locations respectively at monthly scale fig 5a c the merra2 datasets seem not to accurately estimate eto at northern coastal sites and the stations lying around the dasht e lot and the dasht e kavir deserts in addition gldas2 modeled eto inaccurately for the most sites located along the coastal strip of the caspian sea the persian gulf and the gulf of oman as well as the locations surrounding the dasht e kavir desert raziei and parehkar 2021 stated that the ncep ncar reanalysis outputs did not produce satisfactory eto estimates i e nrmse 30 for northern and southern coastal regions and southern and eastern inland areas of iran they found that aggregation of error in estimating tmin tmax and sr products seems to contribute greatly to error in ncep ncar simulated eto ghalami et al 2020 also reported that pmt fed by nex gddp gridded datasets estimated eto less accurately in coastal areas of iran which was ascribed to higher absolute and systematic error in nex gddp tmin and tmax products in these areas the era5 however seems to be a reliable surrogate of ground measurements for estimating eto in coastal stations fig 5a at about 84 of stations eto was estimated more accurately based on era5 datasets rather than gldas2 and merra2 fig 7a note that these results do not necessarily illustrate the accuracy of era5 in estimating eto but simply demonstrate era5 s superiority with respect to merra2 and gldas2 the three reanalysis datasets provided unsatisfactory eto estimates for four sites of kashan no 67 khoor biabanak no 76 jolfa no 61 and manjil no 86 fig 5a c this might be explained by the climatic complexity in particular for u2 due mainly to geographical settings here it is focused specifically upon u2 as it displays the largest variability and controls the eto dynamics for most water limited environments such as the majority of the surveyed sites mcvicar et al 2012 nouri and bannayan 2019 nouri et al 2018 xie et al 2015 you et al 2013 the reanalysis products may not be able to estimate eto with acceptable accuracy at low high wind speed regions surrounded by high low wind speed areas owing to their spatial resolution limitation for instance kashan and khoor biabanak the non windy cases situated around the dasht e kavir desert with u2 of 0 59 and 0 84 m s 1 are neighbored by the sites with average u2 of 2 24 and 1 81 m s 1 respectively on the contrary manjil with average u2 of 4 4 m s 1 is surrounded by the sites having average u2 of 1 68 m s 1 besides spatial variations the reanalysis datasets performance is also influenced by seasonality on monthly scale an average nrmse of 18 2 13 0 13 1 and 15 7 for era5 estimated eto 24 6 17 5 18 7 and 23 2 for merra2 estimated eto and 31 4 20 7 21 0 and 25 5 for gldas2 simulated eto was calculated during the december january february djf march april may mam june july august jja and september october november son seasons respectively the djf mam jja and son eto was also modeled with nrmse exceeding 30 using era5 in 6 8 1 4 2 7 and 2 7 merra2 in 17 8 9 6 8 9 and 21 9 and gldas2 in 41 1 11 6 14 4 and 19 9 of cases studied respectively fig 2 in supplementary material the gldas2 estimated djf eto with relatively larger error in northwestern iran the mountainous region characterized with cold snowy winters fig 2c in supplementary material accordingly the used reanalysis datasets provided less accurate eto estimates during djf and more reliable eto results in mam nouri and homaee 2018 also highlighted the challenge of wintertime eto estimation often required for agroclimatological and winter hydrological modeling the monthly eto was under and overestimated using merra2 and gldas2 for more than two third of the investigated sites respectively fig 6b and c however era5 did not exhibit an overall tendency to over or underestimation fig 6a the eto underestimation was observed for the majority of cold semi arid sites located in northwestern and western iran however eto was mostly overestimated based on the reanalysis datasets for the humid northern cases the eto overestimation has been frequently reported for high humidity and well irrigated environments under data scarcity temesgen et al 1999 trajkovic 2007 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009b the rmbe values obtained for the seasonal eto are also presented in fig 3 of supplementary material we regressed the rmbe values of tmean u2 sr and vpd products against rmbe obtained for eto estimated by reanalysis products fig 4 in supplementary material the r2 values obtained between rmbe of eto estimates and rmbe of contributing factors imply that the u2 bias has the strongest association with bias in eto estimates fig 4 in supplementary material raziei and parehkar 2021 stated that bias in tmax and u2 contributed the most to the bias error in ncep ncar simulated eto ghalami et al 2020 also explained large bias in eto results obtained using pmt fed by nex gddp temperature outputs with high bias error in tmax products over coastal locations of iran 3 2 eto estimated by reanalysis products pmt and interpolation as can be seen from fig 7b era5 merra2 gldas2 pmt based eto estimates had a relatively higher accuracy smaller nrmse for 68 5 5 5 4 1 and 21 9 of the sites respectively thus era5 appears to be a more accurate surrogate of in situ records for most cases even when temperature and average local u2 are observed the pmt estimated eto with nrmse larger than 30 for 7 out of 11 locations having average u2 over 3 m s 1 despite long term average u2 was used pmt still provided unsatisfactory eto estimates under windy conditions nouri and homaee 2018 have underlined the poor performance of pmt computed by average u2 in windy conditions application of gridded reanalysis products resulted in more accurate eto for 8 out of 11 windy sites therefore they seem to be more preferable for windy environments this is more highlighted for the southeastern hyper arid sites e g zabol and zahak in particular during summertime in which average u2 exceeds 6 m s 1 the pm eto fed by era5 merra2 gldas2 and interpolated inputs simulated eto more successfully lower nrmse in 59 6 2 7 4 1 and 33 6 of locations studied respectively fig 7c thus for two third of cases application of reanalysis products is better suited to model eto under data scarcity even if the neighboring sites have complete datasets to compute pm eto the accuracy of outputs generated by classic interpolation techniques such as kriging which are based on distance weighting heavily depends on density and distribution of neighboring sites tomas burguera et al 2018 tomas burguera et al 2018 concluded that increment in density of observations applied for interpolation decreases the uncertainty in interpolated wind speed and relative humidity and consequently improves the eto estimation therefore lower accuracy of interpolation based eto estimates may be attributed to high distance between the sites and data sparsity in the majority of cases in addition to data sparsity considerable u2 variability appears to explain higher nrmse of interpolation based estimates in hyper arid southeastern windy locations the interpolation however gave more reliable eto estimates in northeastern iran pelosi et al 2020 found a nrmse of 14 and 17 for eto obtained by using kriging interpolation method and era5 land reanalysis datasets respectively during irrigation season in southern italy with an area of 14 000 km2 lying between the tyrrhenian sea coastline and the southern apennines they used 18 weather stations with complete datasets indicating availability of one dataset for each 778 km2 the guilan province shown in fig 1 with an area of 14 042 km2 and considerable geographic complexity bounded between the caspian sea and the alborz mountains resembles the study area of pelosi et al 2020 only four sites of rasht anzali astara and manjil with long term complete datasets were available for this province indicating spatial data density of one site per each 3510 km2 the era5 gave better eto estimates for these four stations fig 7c this comparison explicitly implies that the accuracy of interpolation based techniques highly depends on data density and the distance between neighboring sites therefore pm eto computed by era5 may provide more satisfactory results as compared with that fed by interpolated factors in data sparse regions 3 3 evaluation of the bias correction and recalibration approaches fig 8a c indicates an improvement in nrmse of the monthly eto estimates due to the bias correction of individual products i e vpd tmean sr and u2 at approximately half of the stations studied bias correcting the individual factors improved the average nrmse of monthly eto estimation from 15 4 to 14 3 for era5 22 1 20 0 for merra2 and 18 9 18 6 for gldas2 the application of unbiased era5 merra2 gldas2 factors for calculating eto decreased nrmse to less than 30 for 3 14 and 11 sites with poor eto estimates i e nrmse of 30 it should be noted that despite a small decrease 1 1 for era5 2 1 for merra2 and 0 3 for gldas2 in average nrmse occurred the decline in nrmse for some sites exceeded 10 illustrating a great improvement in accuracy of monthly eto estimates in some cases fig 8a c a reduction in nrmse was observed for 74 7 89 0 and 44 6 of locations as a result of the bias correction of the era5 merra2 and gldas2 based eto series respectively fig 8a c moreover bias correcting the monthly eto series reduced the average nrmse of era5 and merra2 simulated eto by 4 1 and 7 3 respectively on the contrary after correcting bias of gldas2 based monthly eto estimates a small increase in average nrmse 0 7 occurred no site with nrmse surpassing 30 was found after bias correcting the eto estimated by era5 and merra2 products as can be followed from fig 8d f the rmbe of the most sites with overestimation underestimation declined increased denoting that the bias correction approaches improved the systematic estimation error overall removing bias of individual factors seems to be a more robust approach for gldas2 whereas bias correction of eto series is likely to be a more preferable alternative for era5 and merra2 paredes et al 2018 have also suggested bias correcting eto series computed by pm eto fed by era interim outputs fig 7d indicates the performance of pm eto fed by bias corrected reanalysis products against recalibrated pmt when the complete datasets are available for a given location at least for a limited period the updated krs is given in table 2 of supplementary material note that these updated krs values differ from those given by raziei and pereira 2013 due to the fact that we used the long term local average instead of a constant value 2 m s 1 for u2 this explains high krs values for some cases therefore a caution needs to be exercised when using the krs listed in table 2 of supplementary material it should be noted that the most accurate bias correction approach bias correction of individual factors for gldas2 and bias correction of eto series for era5 and merra2 was considered in fig 7d the results demonstrate that monthly eto was modeled more accurately by pm eto fed by bias corrected era5 merra2 gldas2 and recalibrated pmt in 56 2 8 1 6 2 and 29 5 of sites respectively therefore in case of availability of required data for a limited period bias correction of era5 estimated eto seems to be a more reliable approach under data limitation however unbiased era5 datasets did not produce the most accurate estimates for the sites surrounding the dasht e kavir and central iran recalibrated pmt is likely to be better suited for estimating eto in the dasht e kavir regions the alternative models such as hargreaves samani and pmt are often applied for the case of temperature data availability in case of availability of data for a limited time the empirical constant of such models can be updated in order to improve the eto results however our results showed that bias correcting eto simulated by using reanalysis packages is more suited in case of data availability for a limited time slice in spite of the usefulness of these modifications these methods should be applied with great care in some cases substantial difference between the values of a specific variable for calibration and validation durations is likely to increase the eto estimation error after bias correction for instance ghochan no 49 in which both bias correction methods resulted in an increased nrmse had average u2 of 1 0 and 2 4 m s 1 for the periods of 1993 2005 and 2006 2017 respectively if abrupt climatic changes and anomalies take place bias correction may thus worsen the estimation accuracy a recalibrated factor may also deteriorate the performance of temperature based models particularly for the geographically complex areas ravazzani et al 2012 temporal variability caused by climatic changes and anomalies is also another uncertainty source of readjustment nouri and homaee 2018 need for large reliable datasets which are often unavailable in data poor areas is another drawback to the recalibration of coefficients and bias correction moreover one can simply apply observations to calculate pm eto instead of using imperfect temperature based formulae or reanalysis products if reliable in situ records exist droogers and allen 2002 nouri and homaee 2018 consequently any modification to acquire better eto estimates should be tested prior to application in a data poor area to avoid accuracy deterioration this has also been stressed by tomas burguera et al 2017 and nouri and homaee 2018 3 4 daily contributing factors and eto simulated using reanalysis products similar to monthly u2 estimation there was a poor agreement nrmse 30 between reanalysis u2 products and ground observations for the majority of sites fig 9a c the tmean reanalysis products had nrmse values ranging from 10 to 20 for most cases demonstrating acceptable accuracy of the reanalysis packages for estimating daily tmean fig 9d f the era5 and gldas2 provided sr estimates with nrmse varying from 10 to 20 for more than 85 of cases at daily scale fig 9g and i however there was a nrmse between 20 and 30 for daily merra2 sr estimates in more than half of the studied stations fig 9h the merra2 also provided poor daily sr estimates nrmse 30 for northern coastal stations fig 9h the era5 merra2 and gldas2 produced daily vpd with acceptable accuracy i e nrmse 30 for 62 3 56 8 and 42 7 of cases respectively similar to monthly comparisons era5 outperformed the other reanalysis packages in producing daily tmean u2 and vpd in 54 8 78 1 and 56 8 of stations respectively it is worth mentioning that despite era5 provided relatively better daily u2 estimates but failed to give reliable daily u2 estimates for the majority of sites the sr gldas2 products had a lower nrmse for around 87 of investigated cases the merra2 and gldas2 tended to underestimate and overestimate daily u2 for the most cases fig 10b and c the daily tmean was also underestimated by the reanalysis packages for more than two third of studied sites fig 10d e and f the era5 and merra2 had a tendency to overestimate daily sr for almost all stations fig 10g and h an underestimated daily vpd was also found for more than 60 of sites fig 10j l the nrmse values of daily eto modeled by applying era5 merra2 and gldas2 ranged between 10 and 20 at 41 1 5 5 and 2 9 of sites varied from 20 to 30 for 47 9 39 7 and 36 7 of locations and surpassed 30 for 10 9 54 8 and 60 4 of cases respectively fig 11 the cases with erroneous estimates of daily eto i e nrmse of 30 mostly had a nrmse larger than 20 for monthly eto figs 5 and 11 therefore it can be concluded that when nrmse of monthly eto is below 20 reanalysis datasets are likely to provide daily eto with reasonable accuracy the daily eto was overestimated and underestimated by gldas2 and merra2 for more than two third of sites respectively fig 12b and c the era5 outputs can be reliably used for the most cases when daily eto is required the era5 gave more reliable eto estimates with respect to meera2 and gldas2 in around 84 of cases on both monthly and daily scales fair daily eto estimates using era interim simulations have been also reported by paredes et al 2018 an increase in nrmse from 15 2 22 2 and 24 1 for eto simulated based on era5 merra2 and gldas2 at monthly resolution to 22 7 31 0 and 33 8 on daily scale respectively seems to be linked to the high dynamics of daily eto significantly owing to large variation in daily u2 there are some approaches to reduce the error in daily eto modeling based on reanalysis datasets averaging or smoothing daily eto quantities e g 10 day is an approach frequently applied to decline the error in eto estimates for agrometeorological and irrigation applications under data scarcity jensen and allen 2016 the average nrmse of the era5 estimated eto dropped from 22 7 for daily step to 17 2 for 10 day step fig 13a in addition unreliable 10 day era5 simulated eto i e nrmse of 30 was found only in 8 sites fig 13a therefore using 10 daily eto appears to provide more satisfactory results for irrigation scheduling and crop modeling requiring eto in finer temporal resolutions the bias correction is also another option to diminish error in daily eto estimates paredes et al 2018 fig 13b indicates the overall improvement in nrmse of the daily era5 simulated eto as a result of bias correcting eto series it is noteworthy that only bias correction of the eto series as a more effective method for era5 was conducted on daily resolution the average nrmse of daily eto fell from 21 8 to 19 1 after the bias was corrected note that removing the bias needs some years of gauged data in case of no data the 10 day average era5 estimated eto appears therefore to be a more reasonable alternative in circumstances requiring higher temporal resolution of eto 4 conclusions and remarks in this study we attempted to assess the accuracy of eto estimates based on the reanalysis products under different scenarios of data unavailability results reveal that era5 provided more realistic daily and monthly eto values compared to gldas2 and merra2 in 84 of studied sites this illustrates that era5 estimated eto can be reliably applied when there is absolutely no data available at both monthly and daily scales moreover application of original era5 yields more reliable eto estimates in most cases in respect to pmt consequently more reliable eto results are expected to be obtained by using pm eto fed by era5 in case of temperature and average local u2 availability this is more highlighted for hyper arid windy regions where the alternatives not including u2 dynamics fail to accurately simulate eto additionally pm eto calculated by the interpolated factors had less accuracy compared to that fed by era5 at around 60 of cases implying that the application of era5 is more suited to estimate eto in our study area when nearby stations having complete datasets are available no site with poor eto estimates nrmse 30 was observed in the entire studied area after bias correcting era5 and merra2 modeled eto as for gldas2 bias correction of individual factors led to better results we further observed an improvement in nrmse of daily era5 estimated eto as a result of 10 day averaging and bias correction the pm eto computed by bias corrected era5 provided more accurate eto estimates as compared with recalibrated pmt therefore in case of having limited data for instance 5 year dataset more accurate simulations can be obtained by using bias corrected era5 in some cases the eto estimation based on reanalysis datasets should be treated with great care there may be a large bias in reanalysis datasets at highly data sparse regions data assimilation might be carried out in the absence of ground observations in these areas adding large uncertainties to the results moreover reanalysis outputs are given in specific scales e g approximately 28 28 km2 for era5 therefore for a given case lying in a climatically and or geographically complex region estimating eto based on reanalysis products may be erroneous manjil no 86 a mountainous windy site surrounded with non windy areas is a climatologically and geographically complex case in which all products and alternative techniques had a high bias error there in such cases reanalysis datasets must be evaluated and bias corrected prior to application accordingly reanalysis datasets seem to produce better results for more homogenous plains with no abrupt climatic and topographic variability the era5 also gave less accurate eto estimates for wintertime this is of significance for determining the water requirement of autumn sown crops and winter hydrological processes considering the era5 s superiority in monthly and daily resolutions it appears to be a better option for hydrological and crop modeling purposes and agricultural irrigation scheduling under data scarcity an intercomparison analysis is however needed to be conducted to evaluate the accuracy of hydrological and crop models run by different sources of data including era5 given the fact that era5 generates reliable sr and u2 in some highly windy cases simulations era5 can be also applied to

continuous ponding cp alternate wetting and drying awd and saturation sat and three popular local rice varieties iet 4786 ir 36 and gb 1 laid out in a factorial randomized block design with three replications on growth yield water and energy productivity and economics of winter rice grown at farmers field results of the study showed that all the growth parameters yield attributes and yield were significantly higher in cp followed by awd method among the varieties gb 1 was superior in both cp and awd conditions to produce higher yields and yield variables than iet 4786 and ir 36 crop

benefit cost ratio keywords irrigation rice yield water productivity energy use efficiency 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is one of the most important cereal crops in the world in terms of area and food production niamatullah et al 2010 more than 90 of world s rice is produced and consumed in mainland south and south east asia it is a nutritionally rich staple food for more than half of the world s population godfray et al 2010 with an average annual per capita consumption of 80 kg rice faostat 2013 rice is the main source of protein 15 and energy 21 for human diet depar et al 2011 with 35 60 of total calorie supply fageria 2007 both china and india are the largest rice producing and consuming countries in the world the indo gangetic plains igp of south asia occupying about 13 5 mha areas under rice wheat cropping system provides staple food for more than a billion people kumar et al 2018 the demand for food particularly rice will be mounting as the world population will reach 9 15 billion by 2050 and the increased cultivation area for this crop will reach approximately 29 9 million ha crossette 2010 food security and livelihood in asian countries largely depend upon irrigated rice saha at al 2014 about 75 of rice harvested globally from 79 million hectares is produced by transplanted technology this technique involves conventional method of puddling and continuous flooding in the main field for first 15 20 days for establishment of rice seedlings and continues for the majority of the growing season which results in higher water requirement kumar and ladha 2011 brar et al 2012 rice plants consume about 800 5000 l of water with an average of 2500 l to produce one kg of rough or unmilled rice grain bouman 2009 in continuously flooded rice environment no proportional increase in water productivity is noticed however there is every possibility for reduction of grain yield due to some unfavorable effects on soil fertility bouman and tuong 2001 irrigated rice is the leading consumer of global fresh water accounting for 24 30 of the world s developed fresh water resources iwmi 2007 singh 2013 however the pace of economic development due to rapid industrialization and urbanization and improved standard of living of burgeoning population for the last few decades the share of fresh water for agriculture sector has reduced by 8 10 dhiman et al 2015 which makes water a crucial limiting input in farm production decreasing water availability for agriculture threatens the sustainability of the irrigated rice ecosystem sun et al 2012 water is now considered an expensive economic commodity for rice production and in many cases it may incur enormous environmental hazards if being used irrationally and injudiciously loeve et al 2003 the increasing costs and scarcity of water brings in mind to think about virtual trade water at the national and international levels liu et al 2007 however under current level of water scarcity the limited available water should be used more prudently in any agricultural system by adopting precise deficit irrigation strategy during some non critical periods or all along the growth stages so as to obtain higher yield and increased use efficiency of water bessembinder et al 2005 conventional cultivation of rice keeping the fields under continuously submerged condition with 5 10 cm standing water across the growing season is wasteful as it uses excessive irrigation water than crop requirement where substantial amounts of water is lost through seepage and deep percolationand results in lower yields and environmental hazards this aggravated problem has increasingly become more prominent in many water scarce resource rice growing regions in addition water productivity of rice crop has been found to be much lower 0 6 1 6 kg m 3 when compared with other cereals such as maize and wheat zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 therefore water saving in rice is of great concern because of high water use in conventional irrigated rice fields gleick 1993 tuong and bouman 2003 different irrigation management approaches or practices such as alternate wetting and drying bouman and tuong 2001 belder 2004 carrijo et al 2017 direct seeded rice vijayakumar et al 2019 aerobic rice system maheswari et al 2007 continuous soil saturation tabbal et al 2002 sun et al 2012 raised bed cultivation ockerby and fukai 2001 system of rice intensification saha et al 2014 and non flooded mulching condition lin et al 2002 have been introduced to reduce water consumption and improve crop water productivity in lowland rice environments alternate wetting and drying is a controlled water saving technology where the field is submerged and allowed to dry for 2 7 days after the disappearance of ponded water before it is resubmerged again when plants show visual symptoms of water stress or when hairline cracks appear on the soil surface tuong et al 2005 bouman et al 2007 however the duration for the resubmergence depends on the level of soil water potential hira et al 2002 type of soil depth of groundwater and number of days elapsed after disappearance of ponded water bouman et al 2007 simultaneously the actual frequency duration and level of water stress during the non submerged periods are the deciding factor affecting yield belder et al 2004 during the drying period the soil pores get filled with oxygen which helps in root mass development since the roots get oxygen from both the soil and aerenchyma cells for respiration thereby increases water and nutrients availabilities in soil and plant accumulation for increasing grain yield yang et al 2009 in agriculture it is aimed to produce higher yields with less water consumption jonubi et al 2018 water saving irrigation technology is a modern concept of irrigation management strategy which provides a means of reducing water consumption while minimizing adverse effects on yield kirda 2002 panda et al 2003 zhang et al 2004 the potential benefits of deficit irrigation derive from three factors increased irrigation efficiency reduced cost of irrigation and the opportunity cost of water english and raja 1996 however some previous studies have reported significant yield losses in awd management due to reduced soil moisture borrell et al 1997 yang and zhang 2010 the evidence shows that imposition of intermittent ponding during 46 60 or 61 75 days after transplanting dat significantly reduced the grain yield of rice sarkar 2001 there is very little information available on the crop performance between aerobic and flooded traditional conditions and the optimum threshold for re irrigation when cultivars are adapted to grow under aerobic condition matsuo and mochizuki 2009 furthermore the physiological basis of the yield gap between aerobic and flooded rice has not been explored extensively such information is a prerequisite to identify the morphological and physiological traits for the selection and breeding of high yielding aerobic rice cultivars matsuo and mochizuki 2009 a comprehensive knowledge on agronomical physiological and biochemical aspects of rice varieties particularly in water deficit stress environment is crucial for identifying water deficit stress resistant varieties kumar et al 2017 agricultural procedures and energy expenditures are well related in terms of energy consumer as well as supplier in the form of bio energy alam et al 2005 a considerable amount of non commercial energy inputs like seed farmyard manure and animate energy and commercial energy inputs in the form of electricity diesel fuel chemical fertilizers plant protections irrigation water and farm machinery have extensively been used in farming sectors kizilaslan 2009 this usage has recently been intensified with the growing population to obtain higher yields and economical return this is serious as additional usage of energy is responsible for considerable adverse effects of environmental and ecological concerns rafiee et al 2010 in the context of rapidly decreasing natural resources esengun et al 2007 implementations of energy efficient production systems may cut off green house gas emissions efficient expenditure of energy resources often comes under consideration as one of the prime requirements of sustainability in agricultural productions therefore an attempt is needed to maximize crop yield with minimum energy usage without much affecting the quality of the output singh et al 2004 in our region the farmers generally follow the traditional transplanted rice farming under continuous soil submergence using the local rice varieties which are quite inefficient in water utilization with decreased crop yield and water productivity they are still unaware about the techno economic feasibility of less water use in rice cultivation and potential benefit accrued from it in the light of the above considerations the objective of the present farmer s field study was to investigate the effects of different water saving irrigation methods on growth yield water and energy productivities and economics of three popular locally grown high yielding rice varieties the hypothesis behind this study was to select the best water saving irrigation method along with suitable rice variety that can be recommended to the farmers of the lower gangetic plains of eastern india for achieving higher grain yield water and energy productivities and economic gain 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site climate and soil characteristic the present study was carried out in a farmer s field for two consecutive winter seasons january may of 2016 and 2017 at ghetugachi village of chakdah block in nadia district belonging to new alluvial

mean monthly meteorological parameters during two experimental seasons are depicted in fig 1 amount of rainfall during crop growing period was recorded as 161 0 and 81 7 mm during 2016 and 2017 respectively average pan evaporation loss was within the range of 1 67 4 80 mm day 1 during january may 2 2 experimental treatments and design the imposition of irrigation treatments was consisted of three management practices accommodating one traditional water intensive technique and two water saving techniques which were accessible and usually preferable to the local farmers three irrigation regimes viz i1 continuous ponding cp which is treated as the control treatment i2 alternate wetting and drying awd and i3 saturation sat assigned in main plots and three high yielding rice varieties viz v1 shatabdi iet 4786 v2 ir 36 and v3 gontra bidhan 1 gb 1 allotted in sub plots were laid out in a factorial randomized block design with three replications the selective cultivars are popularly grown by the farmers in this locality the unit plot size was 5 m 4 m with 1 0 m buffer strip area between and across the neighboring plots to avoid intrusion of seepage and irrigation water from the neighboring plots to overcome the effect of conveyance losses on treatments two buffering strip each of 1 0 m width on either side of the irrigation channel were made and water was carried only in irrigation channel 2 3 crop management and agronomic manipulations three separate seed beds were prepared for raising rice seedlings with a seed rate of 15 kg ha 1 the seeds of each cultivar were treated with trichoderma viride at 4 g kg 1 seeds to control or suppress the different fungal diseases for enhancing seed germination and seedling vigor and broadcasted in nursery beds during 6th january in each experimental year in all irrigation treatments the field was plowed criss cross wise repeatedly with a tractor drawn plow flooded with good amount of irrigation water puddled with the help of power tiller and levelled properly by laddering thirty days old seedlings were transplanted at a spacing of 20 cm 10 cm keeping one seedling per hill on 4th february in each year the recommended dose of fertilizers used for each rice variety was 120 60 60 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 and k2o respectively neem cake at 1 5 t ha 1 was applied during final land preparation one fourth dose of n excluding n from neem cake and full dose of p2o5 and k2o were applied as basal before transplanting in the form of urea single superphosphate and muriate of potash respectively the remaining portion of n was top dressed as half n dose at maximum tillering and quarter n dose at panicle initiation stage the routine agronomic manipulations and standard plant protection measures were adopted uniformly in all the treatments for improving soil physical properties and protecting the plants from pest infestation in order to maintain healthy plant stand the rice varieties were harvested according to its maturity where iet 4786 ir 36 and gb 1 were harvested on 22 april 5 may and 11 may respectively in each experimental year 2 4 assessment of agronomic parameters ten plants were randomly selected from central rows of each plot for recording observations the growth parameters viz plant height dry matter yield leaf area index lai and root length and yield attributing characters like effective tillers m 2 grains panicle 1 and 1000 grain weight from five centrally tagged plants were recorded at harvest prior to that five selected whole tagged plants from each plot were uprooted carefully frequently washed and air dried at 60 dat to measure the lai and root length plant height of randomly selected five plants from each plot was determined from ground level to the tip of the plant using a measuring tape and their average value was computed lai was calculated by the methods as given by yoshida et al 1976 as 1 lai leaf area of the plants cm 2 land area covered by plants cm 2 crop was harvested plot wise threshed manually to separate grain and straw cleaned sun dried for 5 6 days the grain yield by adjusting 14 moisture content and straw yield were recorded separately and expressed in t ha 1 the biological yield z was obtained as the summation of grain yield x and straw yield y the harvest index hi was calculated by using the formula given by donald 1963 as 2 hi x z 100 2 5 irrigation scheduling about 2 cm depth of water was maintained throughout the nursery period for seedling emergence after transplanting all the plots were irrigated at 5 cm depth at 3 day interval up to two week for proper establishment of seedling and then watered according to the proposed irrigation treatments depth of irrigation under continuous ponding cp usually followed by the traditional farming practice was 5 1 cm at 3 4 days interval from transplanting until ripening in awd regime where irrigation water was applied when soil matric potential ψm at 20 cm depth reached to 0 03 mpa after disappearance of ponded water sarkar et al 2012 irrigation at 4 1 cm depth was continued up to one week before flowering and then 5 1 cm depth was maintained from flowering to two weeks before harvesting mercury tensiometers were installed at a depth of 20 cm in the soil to monitor ψm and calculation was made as suggested by hillel 1998 in saturation sat treatment where saturated state was maintained at 0 500 mm soil profile in respective plots by irrigating to about 1 cm water depth one day after the subsidence of ponded water tabbal et al 2002 the amount of water applied in different irrigation treatments was measured and regulated by water meter 2 6 computation of irrigation water requirement the mean depth of water at 10 selected spots of each plot was measured with a millimeter scale after every irrigation and their mean value was determined irrigation water use and total water use during whole crop growing season were calculated by the following formula given by saha et al 2014 3 irrigation water use mm mean depth of each irrigation number of irrigation applied 4 total water use mm irrigation water use rainfall drainage water the portion of rainfall r retained in the active root zone of rice plant which was used to meet the crop evaporative demand was considered effective rainfall er in our study er was calculated by field soil moisture balance method fao 1974 as 5 er m 2 m 1 et c where m2 and m1 were the moisture value taken in the effective root zone 0 50 cm before and 24 h after cessation of rainfall and etc was the crop evapotranspiration between the sampling dates etc was calculated using the equation as 6 et c e p k p k c where ep is the pan evaporation mm kp is the pan factor and kc is the crop coefficient the evaporation data was obtained from a usda weather bureau class a pan located inside the experimental site and readings were recorded daily the pan factor was taken as 0 75 doorenbos and kassam 1979 the estimated kc values for paddy was chosen as 1 15 1 23 1 14 and 1 02 for initial crop development reproductive and maturity stages respectively tyagi et al 2000 the drainage component d data not shown was calculated indirectly by the equation as 7 d r er the depth of irrigation for awd was calculated by the following relationship as proposed by sarkar et al 2012 8 di θ s θ i dr ds where di is the depth of irrigation water to be applied mm dr is the depth of root zone mm ds is the depth of submergence mm the value was 50 mm in the present study θs is the average volumetric moisture content m3 m 3 of the root zone at saturation and θi is the average volumetric soil water content m3 m 3 at the time of irrigation both θs and θi are expressed as fractions the term θs θi gives the volume of water required to raise the water content of a unit volume of soil to saturation 2 7 crop water productivity crop water productivity cwp is considered one of the key water use indicators for sustainability of irrigated agriculture it was calculated as the ratio of grain yield per unit land area y to total water use by crop wu howell 2000 9 cwp kg m 3 y kg ha 1 wu m 3 ha 1 2 8 irrigation

irrigation method on three popular local high yielding rice varieties the actual prices of inputs available in the market at the time of their use were considered for computing the production cost pc this cost accommodated all the expenses incurred in nursery bed and main field preparation sowing transplanting intercultural operation crop harvesting threshing and processing and cost of seed fertilizers crop protection chemicals variable irrigation water cost including application charges during the period of investigation the gross revenue gr was worked out by accounting the prevailing average market price of the main and by product during the experimental period and summation of their values the net revenue nr was estimated by deducting the pc from the gr the benefit cost ratio bcr of each treatment was calculated by the equation as 15 bcr gr us ha 1 pc us ha 1 2 12 statistical analysis all the data generated for different irrigation methods and varietal treatments imposed were subjected to analysis of variance using software packages of ms excel spss 23 0 version and origin pro 2021 version statistical significance between means of individual treatments and their interactions were assessed using the least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 gomez and gomez 1984 and the mean values were adjusted by tukey s hsd honest significant difference test method since variation in data across the experimental years and the interactions between irrigation method and variety were statistically similar hence only pooled values of two consecutive seasons were presented to draw the inferences a number of statistical methods including principle component analysis pearson s correlation and scatter plot diagrams in origin pro version 2021 have been done to represent the changes of energy indices well as their influence on grain yield of rice therefore it is important to understand the rationale behind using these techniques for this study the principle component analysis jolliffe and cadima 2016 has been done as a way of identifying patterns in the dataset highlighting their similarities and differences through their distances among themselves pearson s correlation study has been conducted to indicates the strength of relationship of two observed characters gogtay and thatte 2017 which means how much one component changes with a significant change of another component in relation through a specific direction the deflections are important in predicting the effect of that particular parameter over dependent variable however it is still unknown how the sampling points behave according to these parameters with the scatter plot diagrams created using the treatment points the role of each point with respect to the dependent variable and the predictor is observed 3 results 3 1 effects of different irrigation methods and varietal selection on growth and yield attributes the effects of different irrigation methods and varietal selection on growth components and yield attributes of rice viz plant height ph dry matter accumulation dma leaf area index lai root length number of effective tillers seed panicle 1 and 1000 grain weight varied significantly p 0 05 table 3 all the parameters except root length and 1000 grain weight were significantly and consistently decreased with increasing limited moisture condition significant reduction was more conspicuous in saturation sat followed by alternate wetting and drying awd as compared to continuous ponding cp there was no significant difference in 1000 seed weight due to various water management interventions significant variation in root length was recorded among the different irrigation methods however maximum root length at 60 dat was found in sat 28 49 cm which was 16 7 and 7 7 higher over that of cp 24 41 cm and awd 26 45 cm respectively similarly plant height 100 68 cm was significantly higher under cp which was 5 2 and 9 2 more than awd and sat regimes respectively significant reduction in dry matter yield to the extent of 6 8 and 11 5 was noticed when the crop was exposed to awd and sat method of irrigation respectively in comparison with cp and all the three irrigation treatments differed significantly p 0 05 likewise number of effectives tiller was significantly higher by 7 3 and 13 0 in cp 323 44 over that of awd and sat respectively lai also showed maximum value in cp 323 44 t which was significantly superior to that of the remaining two irrigation regimes number of grains panicle 1 was significantly reduced by 11 1 and 7 2 in sat and awd respectively over the corresponding value in cp all the three tested varieties had significant impacts on promoting growth and yield constituents the variety gb 1 was statistically superior in registering maximum growth and yield parameters followed by iet 4786 and ir 36 except number of effective tillers where ir 36 showed highest value and being statistically at par with gb 1 plant height and dry matter yield differed significantly which were relatively higher by 23 5 27 6 and 7 3 21 6 in gb 1 ph 111 28 cm and dma 904 73 g m 2 over iet 4786 ph 90 13 cm and dma 843 39 g m 2 and ir 36 ph 87 18 cm and dma 744 06 g m 2 respectively gb 1 displayed 4 9 6 8 higher lai than other two tested varieties which was significantly superior over them root length showed significant differences among the varieties and it was reduced by 8 9 in iet 4786 26 37 cm and 17 0 in ir 36 24 04 cm in comparison with gb 1 28 95 cm there was significant variation in the number of grains panicle 1 where gb 1 furnished 43 8 and 57 9 more increase than iet 4786 and ir 36 respectively test weight irrespective of irrigation methods showed significantly highest value with gb 1 and lowest with ir 36 interaction effects of irrigation methods and varieties also showed statistical variations in all the growth and yield attributes table 3 the observed parametric values were significantly higher when the plants were subjected to irrigation under cp regime with gb 1 ph 118 32 cm dma 992 16 g m 2 number of effective tillers 330 60 number of grains panicle 1 261 33 barring root length at 60 dat where the same variety exhibited significantly highest value 31 03 cm under sat the next best treatment combination was gb 1 in awd condition in terms of plant height 110 42 cm dry matter accumulation 891 g m 2 lai 4 22 number of seeds panicle 1 241 38 and 1000 seed weight 23 10 g lower values of all these parameters were recorded under sat with ir 36 except root length which was found to be significantly lowest in cp there was significant improvement of plant height 6 7 29 0 dry matter accumulation 10 2 28 0 number of effective tillers m 2 0 7 14 5 and number of grains panicle 1 7 6 44 0 when the variety gb 1 was exposed in cp with respect to remaining irrigation regime and varietal combinations examined awd and sat irrigation practices regardless of varieties had negative impacts on growth and yield components 3 2 effects of different irrigation methods and varietal selection on grain and straw yields grain and straw yields of three selected rice varieties were significantly p 0 05 affected by irrigation methods table 4 highest grain yield was obtained with cp 4 56 t ha 1 which was superior to awd 4 30 t ha 1 and sat 3 97 t ha 1 limited irrigation regime through awd and sat resulted 5 7 and 12 9 decrease in grain yield respectively as compared with cp straw yield was found maximum under awd 6 23 t ha 1 which did not find any statistical difference with cp 6 20 t ha 1 but both showed significant differences with sat method of irrigation 5 97 t ha 1 irrigation through sat method reduced the straw yield by 3 7 and 4 2 over cp and awd respectively harvest index hi of plant under different irrigation regimes was statistically non significant however the value was marginally higher in cp followed by awd and lower in sat variable differences in grain and straw yields and hi of the varieties averaging over the irrigation regimes were observed table 4 significantly maximum grain yield was found in gb 1 4 69 t ha 1 which was 11 9 and 18 7 higher than iet 4786 4 19 t ha 1 and ir 36 3 95 t ha 1 respectively straw yield followed almost the similar trend although the values recorded in ir 36 and iet 4786 were statistically non significant hi showed maximum value in gb 1 closely followed by iet 4786 however but both values were statistically at par with each other but significantly superior to ir 36 the coupling effects of irrigation methods and varieties tested on grain and straw yields were statistically significant table 5 in general curtailment of irrigation regimes irrespective of varieties consistently decreased the grain and straw yields likewise regardless of irrigation methods the cultivar gb 1 exhibited higher grain and straw yields followed by iet 4786 and ir 36 the pooled data revealed that the irrigation regime of cp coupled with gb 1 was the best treatment combination recording maximum grain yield 5 10 t ha 1 whereas awd regime along with gb 1 was superior in producing maximum straw yield 6 72 t ha 1 although the data being at par with cp coupled with gb 1 6 68 t ha 1 significantly lowest grain 3 74 t ha 1 and straw 5 80 t ha 1 yield was recorded with ir 36 when irrigation was applied through sat method imposing restricted irrigations of awd and sat together accounted for 5 4 9 8 5 5 10 1 and 6 3 17 8 reduction in grain yield in relation to cp method of irrigation adopted on iet 4786 ir 36 and gb 1 respectively 3 3 effects of different irrigation methods and varietal selection on water use and water productivity of rice the amount of irrigation water applied in awd 1065 mm and sat 856 7 mm was 85 and 68 4 of cp 1252 5 mm method of irrigation table 6 the estimated effective rainfall was 75 3 mm for each irrigation regime contributing 5 7 for cp 6 6 for awd and 8 1 for sat towards the total water use low level of irrigation management could save 14 1 in awd and 29 8 in sat of total water requirement in comparison with conventional cp among the selected varieties gb 1 used higher amount of total water 1232 2 mm followed by ir 36 1122 2 mm and iet 4786 1055 7 mm the use of irrigation water as well as effective rainwater followed the same pattern there was a saving of irrigation water and total water to the tune of 15 0 and 14 1 for awd and 31 6 and 29 8 for sat respectively when compared with the corresponding values for cp method of irrigation similarly iet 4786 and ir 36 could save 8 7 and 14 3 and 8 2 and 8 9 of irrigation water and total water respectively than the corresponding values for gb 1 crop water productivity cwp and irrigation water productivity iwp were significantly influenced by different irrigation methods and varieties adopted fig 2 increasing lower irrigation regime significantly improved the cwp as well as iwp over that of traditional cp irrigation method the cwp varied from 0 343 to 0 428 kg m 3 and iwp from 0 363 to 0 464 kg m 3 in different irrigation methods significantly highest cwp was registered in sat 0 428 kg m 3 which was 13 5 and 24 9 higher than awd 0 377 kg m 3 and cp 0 343 kg m 3 respectively almost similar statistical variation was observed in iwp where there was a reduction of iwp by 12 9 in awd and 21 8 in cp when compared with sat method three tested rice varieties responded differently in terms of cwp and iwp significantly highest cwp was noticed in iet 4786 0 403 kg m 3 whereas iwp was with gb 1 0 431 kg m 3 there was a reduction of 11 4 cwp in ir 36 than iet 4786 and 4 0 than gb 1 iwp also showed significantly minimum value in ir 36 0 380 kg m 3 which was 9 7 and 11 8 lesser than iet 4786 and gb 1 respectively among the various interactive effects of irrigation method and variety combination significantly highest cwp was recorded in iet 4786 0 465 kg m 3 followed by gb 1 0 413 kg m 3 and ir 36 0 406 kg m 3 under sat method of irrigation table 7 on the other hand significantly lowest cwp 0 317 kg m 3 was found in ir 36 under cp regime lower irrigation regime of sat followed by awd enhanced the cwp and iwp in all the varieties examined while reverse observation was noted in prevailing conventional cp method however maximum iwp 0 489 kg m 3 was found in iet 4786 under sat condition whereas minimum 0 332 kg m 3 in ir 36 under cp condition and both combination differed significantly the variety gb 1 showed intermediate values of iwp in awd and sat regimes and significantly highest value in cp method a calculation was made to estimate the irrigation water or total water requirement for production of one kilogram of rice grain due to variations in irrigation methods and varieties chosen fig 3 it has been observed that for producing per kg rice grain irrigation water used in awd 2491 l kg 1 and sat 2159 l kg 1 was 90 and 78 of cp 2768 l kg 1 respectively the results showed significant differences among the various irrigation treatments this implies that there was a saving of 22 and 10 irrigation water in sat and awd method of irrigation respectively for producing one kilogram of rice grain total water use for producing one kilogram of rice grain followed the similar trends but water requirement was a little higher there were significant variations among the different test varieties in the utilization of irrigation water and total water towards production of one kg of rice grain however ir 36 2672 l kg 1 was found to use 10 8 and 14 5 more irrigation water for one kilogram of rice grain production than that of iet 4786 and gb 1 respectively similarly total water requirement for producing per kilogram rice grain in ir 36 was 12 7 more than iet 4786 and 9 1 more than gb 1 fig 3 for producing one kilogram of rice grain the total water use was found to be significantly lowest in iet 4786 2513 l kg 1 which was 3 2 lesser than gb 1 3 4 effect of different irrigation methods and varietal selection on energy indices the common energy consumption was computed by summing up the entire energy equivalent for inputs used for cultivating three transplanted rice varieties exposed under three irrigation methods table 8 the energy consumption as recorded in table 9 showed the comparatively higher value in cp 41 6 103 mj ha 1 limited irrigation practices reduced the energy consumption by 10 1 in sat and 4 6 in awd than traditional cp the energy output in different irrigation practices varied significantly with each other and was in the order of cp awd sat there was no significant variation in net energy gain between cp and awd but both were statistically superior to sat which resulted in 7 7 lower net energy gain than cp and 6 5 than awd the energy use efficiency eue was significant with varied irrigation regimes and exhibited relatively higher value in limited irrigation method of awd 359 4 and sat 356 1 than normal irrigation at cp energy productivity ep was found to be higher in cp 109 6 g grain mj 1 energy input but the result was non significant with awd 108 3 g grain mj 1 energy input in contrast specific energy se followed the reverse trend with increasing lower irrigation regime however se value in sat was superior over cp but statistically at par with awd the principal component bi plot fig 6 in the principle component analysis having percentage wise most contributed two of the three components with eigen values 1 00 table 10 reveals the relationship within the energy components it is fairly depicted fig 6 that the grain yield gy is much more influenced by the energy components like output energy oe net energy ne energy use efficiency eue energy productivity ep straw yield sy while input energy ie has less and specific energy se has far lesser influence on grain yield gy as these two parameters resides far from the gy cluster in the component plot the pearson s correlation fig 7 amongst these parameters also supports this information on the grain yield gy having significant positive correlations with output energy oe 0 98 net energy ne 0 96 energy use efficiency eue 0 72 energy productivity ep 0 90 straw yield sy 0 91 while input energy ie has less positive correlation 0 69 and specific energy se has even negative influence 0 88 on grain yield gy after drawing scatter plot diagram with these variables the response of each experimental variable in relation with the grain yield can be obtained and the predictors can easily be diagnosed in the diagrammatic changes of input energy ie output energy oe net energy ne energy use efficiency eue fig 8 and energy productivity ep fig 9 with the changes of grain yield gy have significant positive trend possessing having the treatment numbers 3 i1v3 and 6 i2v3 to be highest in terms of the grain yield and the energy component analysis among the varieties the energy consumption was varied a little but gb 1 was more consumer of energy 40 0 103 mj ha 1 than the other two varieties the energy components like energy output net energy gain eue and ep was found more in gb 1 followed by iet 4786 although the se was relatively higher in ir 36 10 02 mj energy input kg 1 of grain 3 5 effect of different irrigation methods and varietal selection on economics economic appraisal of several water management approaches in general indicated that various cost components viz total cost of production gross revenue and net revenue followed in the sequence of cp awp sat table 10 gross revenue was found maximum in cp us 999 2 ha 1 which was statistically superior to awd us 945 1 ha 1 and sat us 874 9 ha 1 net revenue was highest in cp us 266 6 ha 1 and on parity with awd us 253 0 ha 1 but both being statistically superior over sat us 198 1 ha 1 awd displayed higher bcr 1 37 but competitive with cp 1 36 while sat achieved lowest bcr 1 29 as regards to the varietal selection gb 1 accomplished maximum gross revenue net revenue and bcr gb 1 witnessed net revenue increase by 50 5 over iet 4786 and 94 5 over ir 36 least gross revenue net revenue and bcr were recorded with ir 36 interaction effects of irrigation methods and varieties showed large variations in respect of gross return net return and bcr table 11 although iet 4786 and gb 1 under cp regime showed higher gross and net return respectively but bcr values were comparable with gb 1 under irrigation imposition at cp and awd table 12 4 discussion higher groundwater utilization for irrigated rice during post winter season february to april using the conventional irrigation practices necessitates the site specific water saving managements approaches and selection of locally adaptable rice varieties to mitigate progressive decline in groundwater table and water scarcity for sustainable rice production and increasing farmers profitability sarkar et al 2012 4 1 growth parameter in our experiment plant height was shortened with decreasing water supply through irrigation regimes of awd and sat as compared to water intensive conventional transplanted rice cp this was mainly due to lower absorption of water causing inhibition of cell division or cell enlargement under reduced soil water availability choudhary 2015 tallest plant under adequate soil water condition due to cp regime could help in better maintenance of turgid pressure of plant cells higher accumulation of photosynthates during early stage and subsequent partition to other plant parts in later stage for promoting growth and development bouman and tuong 2001 chai et al 2016 a significant reduction in plant height of all the varieties as a consequence of constant and intermittent water stress exposure across the physiological stages under restricted irrigation regimes as compared to continuous flooded condition might be due to limitation in cell division and elongation resulted in reduction of internodal length thereby affected plant height patel et al 2010 the gradual reduction in lai with decreasing irrigation level could be ascribed to sustenance of decreased soil water accessibility especially during tillering stage which significantly reduced the leaf attributes number of leaves leaf length and breadth resulting in lower leaf area and ultimately lai choudhary 2015 nguyen et al 2015 irrespective of irrigation regime and varietal chosen dry matter accumulation dma in plant was best fitted in a second degree polynomial equation with lai fig 4a with high coefficient of determination r2 0 834 in this modular approach cp produced higher dry matter yield by 7 3 over awd and 13 0 over sat the reduction in lai was associated with lower dma of plant which was chiefly due to reduced photosynthetic surface emmam et al 2010 optimum water availability in soil and plant system enhanced cell division promoted secondary wall formation and increased the large photosynthetic area water shortage on the other hand causes negative effect on various plant physiological restrictions on transpiration stomatal opening reduced co2 fixation and nutrients uptake leading to low rate of photosynthesis and other biochemical reactions which inhibited the growth parameters nemeskeri and helyes 2019 lower soil moisture also restricted stem and leaf growth despite complete maintenance of cell turgidity in the growing tips as a result of osmotic adjustment anjum et al 2003 our results supported the earlier findings which showed lowest dma in plants under lower irrigation regime than continuous moisture condition emmam et al 2010 patel et al 2010 anning et al 2018 root length was comparatively higher in limited irrigation methods as compared with continuous ponding which might be due to improved root elongation and proliferation of the plant under lower water supply to extract more moisture from the deeper layers of soil another plausible reason for increase in root growth with decrease in moisture condition was ascribed to decrease in shoot growth because of changes in carbohydrate partitioning richards 2008 yoshimura et al 2008 and translocation of assimilates from upper to lower portion for osmotic adjustment of root system saidi et al 2010 which support in maintaining same level of turgidity and re establishment of water potential gradient for water uptake these adjustments are responsible for the growth of root mass under low water potential hsiao and xu 2000 in field crops with inadequate soil moisture the root growth is enhanced by the reduction in soil water potential which makes development of root system better than soil with sufficient moisture hirasawa et al 2005 nakagami et al 2004 while studying the effect of intermittent irrigation on root growth won et al 2005 found more root concentration in deeper soil when irrigated at water depth below 2 cm 4 2 yield attributes higher yield attributes had direct bearing on the improvement of yield and amongst them number of effective tillers was most important one to encourage yield the quantum of effective tillers in plant was associated with the availability of soil moisture regime this was found higher with cp while awd accounted for 93 2 and sat for 88 5 of effective tillers obtained with cp soil moisture deficit prevailing for longer period of time in rice has accommodated the plants to cope with the adverse condition and most of the photosynthates were partitioned accordingly thereby resulted in lower percentage panicle bearing tillers sayed 2003 our results are in agreement with the findings of previous studies which showed that moisture limitation during crop period significantly reduced the productive tillers bouman and tough 2001 norton et al 2017 zubaer et al 2007 the number of grains panicle 1 was considerably lower in reduced irrigation regime contributing 7 2 for awd and 11 1 for sat of normal irrigation cp this was observable to acute soil moisture constraint which prominently decreases plant reproduction pollen grain count pollen size pollen germination and pollen tube development insufficient assimilates production and its translocation to storage organ of grains resulting in decreased number of filled grains per panicle zubaer et al 2007 the variation in 1000 grain weight among irrigation methods was non significant however it was statistically significant among the tested varieties because of variable genetic make up mohammad et al 2002 in the present study gb 1 performed well under cp and awd condition too in terms of producing higher plant height biomass production lai and number of effective tillers iet 4786 was the alternative option in achieving moderate growth and yield attributing characters whereas ir 36 performed the least this is particularly due to variability of the genetic configurations of the varieties which enable them to perform in different moisture conditions and utilize the available resources accordingly for growth and development mannan et al 2009 garba et al 2013 gagandeep and gandhi 2015 the vegetative growth of rice is significantly influenced by the type of varieties used and the genetic constitution of the varieties which help in obtaining different yields under various moisture regimes kumar et al 2017 ben et al 2017 our findings are in close conformity with these reported studies 4 3 crop productivity imposition of water savings irrigation practices had negative impact on rice yield this could be attributed to moderate to severe soil water stress as a result of declined water availability in root zone at higher tension which proved to be detrimental for rice plants as regards to hastened senescence reduced photosynthetically active surfaces and sharp drop in the photosynthesis rate leading to lower production jaffar et al 2017 choudhary 2015 reported that under moisture stress condition there was restricted supply of assimilates from source to the sink thereby causing limited production of reproductive organs or developing grains in rice plants in the present study exposing water loving rice crop to higher degree of water stress like restricted irrigation and continuous flooded condition have resulted negative impact on various physiological processes thereby causing differentiation in dry matter accumulation and effective tillers and partly number of grains panicle 1 and 1000 grain weight ultimately leading to variable yield status dry matter production irrespective of irrigation regime and variety had been best fitted in a second degree polynomial equation with grain yield fig 4b with high coefficient of determination r2 0 91 where cp produced higher dma as compared with awd and sat methods since the differences between limited and flooded rice condition as regard to harvest index was not significant it is obvious that yield differences under these water management practices was due to the differences in genetic characters of the varieties for biomass production decrease in the relative yield in transplanted rice due to lower irrigation regime to continuous flooding was reported by kumar et al 2017 choudhary 2015 patel et al 2010 achieving high yields under irrigated condition requires high yielding characteristics of lowland varieties but aerobic soil conditions require new aerobic rice varieties resistant to drought in upland condition lafitte et al 2002 in our experiment gb 1 was found to accord higher yield under normal cp method but it had to sacrifice about 6 3 grain yield when it was exposed under lower irrigation regime of awd brar et al 2015 was of the view that there was a decreasing trend in grain yield of rice with increase in waiting period after disappearance of ponded water 4 4 water productivity our results demonstrated that there was 17 6 and 46 2 more irrigation water requirement in cp when compared with awd and sat method respectively these findings could be comparable with carrijo et al 2017 who also found that rice cultivation under awd has the potential to reduce water input by 23 4 in comparison to cp the variable saving of irrigation water as well as total water use in both the constrained irrigation management practices was due to different irrigation frequency and or duration of drying period followed in awd and sat methods according to the type of experimental soil bouman and tuong 2001 belder et al 2004 however joshi et al 2009 opined that aerobic rice system was much better to reduce water input than other alternate methods of rice cultivation like awd and sat present study indicated a consistent increase in grain yield with incremental irrigation water application however the yield increase was not always proportional to the amount of irrigation water applied because all the water applied was not consumed by crop some fraction being lost which eventually reflected in crop water productivity cwp highest cwp was found under sat where lowest amount of water 932 mm was applied to the crop likewise moderate cwp was displayed by awd using moderate amount of water 1140 3 mm and the value was 9 9 higher in comparison to cp which exhibited lowest cwp with highest water use 1327 8 mm a decreasing non linear trend of cwp was observed with increasing amount of irrigation water fig 5a saha et al 2015 noticed the reduced evaporation rates from dry aerobic soil may be responsible for high cwp under aerobic rice conditions because unsaturated field conditions offer greater opportunities to save precarious water bouman et al 2002 conversely conventional farming cf is much less efficient at saving water relative to awd and aerobic rice as there are greater water losses due to increased seepage and percolation puddling and evaporative losses bouman et al 2007 higher wue or cwp under limited irrigation management in rice compared to conventional flooding methods has also been reported by patel et al 2010 and singh et al 2017 the amount of irrigation water saving under awd compared to cp in our experimental condition was too less 15 while almost a double value 28 under same irrigation treatment compared to traditional water management in rice was noticed by chapagain and yamaji 2010 similar amount of water saving 15 18 in alternately submerged nonsubmerged system than under continuous submergence was demonstrated by belder et al 2004 in lowland rice among the varieties evaluated gb 1 125 days used relatively more water because of its longer duration than iet 4786 106 days and ir 36 119 days rainfall occurred during first week of may in both the years hence there was no requirement of irrigation water for the last two varieties after ripening the cwp in iet 4786 and gb 1 was found competitive but too variation did prevail for iwp while ir 36 furnished significantly lowest cwp and iwp table 7 fig 3 the enhancement of 61 water productivity in rice cultivars by applying 50 deficit irrigation was noted by jonubi et al 2018 the irrigation water requirement for producing per kilogram of rice grain was more in gb 1 because of its higher yield ability in both non flooded and flooded conditions than other two varieties higher cwp in different lowland rice varieties following limited irrigation practices was reported earlier by patel et al 2010 ullah et al 2018 and anning et al 2018 4 5 economics accomplishing higher yields with increased water productivity is economical only when an increase in crop yield is not offset by an increase in the costs of other inputs jonubi et al 2018 higher cost of production with higher gross and net revenues resulted in a greater bcr in cp method whereas in awd with modest cost of production and modest monetary returns displayed nominally a higher bcr significantly higher total cost of production in flood irrigation system than awd was reported by karim et al 2014 similarly highest gross revenue net revenue and bcr were found in gb 1 because of its higher yield achievement in awd and cp condition thus in terms of competitive net revenue and bcr values with highest cwp obtained awd can be superior over cp as higher cost of production and lowest cwp is involved in the later irrigation method hassen et al 2017 also reported similar kind of result where economic performances of traditional and modern rice varieties under different water management systems were assessed in the present study the variety gb 1 performed well under lower irrigation water particularly at awd not only in terms marked increase in yield but also in deriving maximum bcr cwp and energy utilization the variety iet 4786 followed the next in terms of physical and economical achievements better performance of these two varieties under lower irrigation regime was evident from the minimum differences in yield growth and yield attributes water productivity and energy use efficiency under three different water management practices there is a necessity to explore nutrient uptake pattern in different physiological stages in response to graded fertilization under variable water management scenario to optimize fertilizer water management technology sustainable for irrigated rice in the lower indo gangetic plains 4 6 energy indices energy is used in every stage of crop production process commencing from land preparation to harvesting hence identifying sustainable rice cultivation methods is a decisive factor to ensure food security for growing population htwe et al 2021 in this study grain yield gy of the test crop is highly associated with the energy components output energy oe net energy ne energy use efficiency eue energy productivity ep straw yield sy input energy ie and specific energy se as revealed in the principal component bi plot fig 6 systems of cropping and related cultivation managements have forward influence on energy expenditure hence comes energy productivity tuti et al 2012 which is significantly correlated 0 90 with grain yield fig 7 and also can be found within the yield clusters of pca bi plot fig 6 energy inputs are also crucial in achieving higher yields in a crop production system which is facing interesting fabrications dhaliwal and kler 1995 cultivation of rice requires fairly high inputs of energy due to higher amount of fertilizer and irrigation water requirement complied with associated labor intensive management practices thereby increasing demand of suitable treatments for converting maximum energy into yield returns as high as possible kachroo et al 2012 differences in energy input and energy output resulted in less variation of energy balance in limited irrigation and varietal selection experiment in rice cultivation energy use efficiency eue was comparatively higher in awd method indicating less water utilization to save more energy energy productivity ep was higher in cp but it was almost identical with awd this points out an another indication of less energy utilization incurred by restricted water management which can be glanced through the fig 5b where the grain yield accorded a very high positive regression coefficient with ep r2 0 859 higher grain yield with lower input particularly irrigation water employing constrained irrigation management schedules resulted in greater ep and specific energy lower irrigation practices by allowing irrigation 3 days after disappearance of ponded water can improve the eue and se as earlier reported by brar et al 2015 all the energy input and output related parameters were considerably higher in gb 1 because of higher grain and straw yield attainment although awd method of irrigation with gb 1 had the better result in terms of eue and ep calculation energy calculation in rice by means of different cultivation methods or various irrigation or nutrient management practices had been observed by different researchers truong et al 2017 htwe et al 2021 singh et al 2019 pathak and bining 1985 pointed out that the energy consumption in paddy production is much higher than that of wheat production primarily due to the high irrigation requirements of rice hence it is important to obtain a sustainable yield with maximum utilization of energy expended from the scatter plot diagrams fig 8 and fig 9 it is evident that higher values in energy components like output energy oe net energy ne energy use efficiency eue input energy ie and energy productivity ep with respect to grain yield gy is favorable however it is interesting to notice that treatment numbers 3 i1v3 and 6 i2v3 comprising of rice variety gb 1 under irrigation regimes cp and awd respectively have also been identified with lower specific energy along with higher yield return from the scatter plot diagram of specific energy se and grain yield gy depicting negative trend unlike other scatter plots fig 9 this supports previous pca and pearson s correlation analysis and signifies that the treatments identified can deliver higher grain yield with minimal input energy and maximum output energy gains 5 conclusion the results of the present study indicated that cultivation of gb 1 variety in normal continuous flooding as well as limited irrigation of awd is techno economically feasible for the lowland rice farmers of lower indo gangetic plains in eastern india or similar agro ecological regions for obtaining higher yield cwp eue and economics under scarce availability of irrigation water imposition of lower irrigation regime of awd using variety gb 1 can be advocated as the nominal grain yield loss due to intermittent exposure to water constraint condition is being compensated with highest cwp eue and bcr followed by cp with the variety gb 1 in case of sufficient water availability more number of locally adaptable high yield potential genotypes needs to be screened to identify the location specific

9711,water is the major environmental constraint for sustainable rice cultivation a field experiment was conducted during 2016 and 2017 to evaluate the effects of three irrigation methods viz continuous ponding cp alternate wetting and drying awd and saturation sat and three popular local rice varieties iet 4786 ir 36 and gb 1 laid out in a factorial randomized block design with three replications on growth yield water and energy productivity and economics of winter rice grown at farmers field results of the study showed that all the growth parameters yield attributes and yield

and food production niamatullah et al 2010 more than 90 of world s rice is produced and consumed in mainland south and south east asia it is a nutritionally rich staple food for more than half of the world s population godfray et al 2010 with an average annual per capita consumption of 80 kg rice faostat 2013 rice is the main source of protein 15 and energy 21 for human diet depar et al 2011 with 35 60 of total calorie supply fageria 2007 both china and india are the largest rice producing and consuming countries in the world the indo gangetic plains igp of south asia occupying about 13 5 mha areas under rice wheat cropping system provides staple food for more than a billion people kumar et al 2018 the demand for food particularly rice will be mounting as the world population will reach 9 15 billion by 2050 and the increased cultivation area for this crop will reach approximately 29 9 million ha crossette 2010 food security and livelihood in asian countries largely depend upon irrigated rice saha at al 2014 about 75 of rice harvested globally from 79 million hectares is produced by transplanted technology this technique involves conventional method of puddling and continuous flooding in the main field for first 15 20 days for establishment of rice seedlings and continues for the majority of the growing season which results in higher water requirement kumar and ladha 2011 brar et al 2012 rice plants consume about 800 5000 l of water with an average of 2500 l to produce one kg of rough or unmilled rice grain bouman 2009 in continuously flooded rice environment no proportional increase in water productivity is noticed however there is every possibility for reduction of grain yield due to some unfavorable effects on soil fertility bouman and tuong 2001 irrigated rice is the leading consumer of global fresh water accounting for 24 30 of the world s developed fresh water resources iwmi 2007 singh 2013 however the pace of economic development due to rapid industrialization and urbanization and improved standard of living of burgeoning population for the last few decades the share of fresh water for agriculture sector has reduced by 8 10 dhiman et al 2015 which makes water a crucial limiting input in farm production decreasing water availability for agriculture threatens the sustainability of the irrigated rice ecosystem sun et al 2012 water is now considered an expensive economic commodity for rice production and in many cases it may incur enormous environmental hazards if being used irrationally and injudiciously loeve et al 2003 the increasing costs and scarcity of water brings in mind to think about virtual trade water at the national and international levels liu et al 2007 however under current level of water scarcity the limited available water should be used more prudently in any agricultural system by adopting precise deficit irrigation strategy during some non critical periods or all along the growth stages so as to obtain higher yield and increased use efficiency of water bessembinder et al 2005 conventional cultivation of rice keeping the fields under continuously submerged condition with 5 10 cm standing water across the growing season is wasteful as it uses excessive irrigation water than crop requirement where substantial amounts of water is lost through seepage and deep percolationand results in lower yields and environmental hazards this aggravated problem has increasingly become more prominent in many water scarce resource rice growing regions in addition water productivity of rice crop has been found to be much lower 0 6 1 6 kg m 3 when compared with other cereals such as maize and wheat zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 therefore water saving in rice is of great concern because of high water use in conventional irrigated rice fields gleick 1993 tuong and bouman 2003 different irrigation management approaches or practices such as alternate wetting and drying bouman and tuong 2001 belder 2004 carrijo et al 2017 direct seeded rice vijayakumar et al 2019 aerobic rice system maheswari et al 2007 continuous soil saturation tabbal et al 2002 sun et al 2012 raised bed cultivation ockerby and fukai 2001 system of rice intensification saha et al 2014 and non flooded mulching condition lin et al 2002 have been introduced to reduce water consumption and improve crop water productivity in lowland rice environments alternate wetting and drying is a controlled water saving technology where the field is submerged and allowed to dry for 2 7 days after the disappearance of ponded water before it is resubmerged again when plants show visual symptoms of water stress or when hairline cracks appear on the soil surface tuong et al 2005 bouman et al 2007 however the duration for the resubmergence depends on the level of soil water potential hira et al 2002 type of soil depth of groundwater and number of days elapsed after disappearance of ponded water bouman et al 2007 simultaneously the actual frequency duration and level of water stress during the non submerged periods are the deciding factor affecting yield belder et al 2004 during the drying period the soil pores get filled with oxygen which helps in root mass development since the roots get oxygen from both the soil and aerenchyma cells for respiration thereby increases water and nutrients availabilities in soil and plant accumulation for increasing grain yield yang et al 2009 in agriculture it is aimed to produce higher yields with less water consumption jonubi et al 2018 water saving irrigation technology is a modern concept of irrigation management strategy which provides a means of reducing water consumption while minimizing adverse effects on yield kirda 2002 panda et al 2003 zhang et al 2004 the potential benefits of deficit irrigation derive from three factors increased irrigation efficiency reduced cost of irrigation and the opportunity cost of water english and raja 1996 however some previous studies have reported significant yield losses in awd management due to reduced soil moisture borrell et al 1997 yang and zhang 2010 the evidence shows that imposition of intermittent ponding during 46 60 or 61 75 days after transplanting dat significantly reduced the grain yield of rice sarkar 2001 there is very little information available on the crop performance between aerobic and flooded traditional conditions and the optimum threshold for re irrigation when cultivars are adapted to grow under aerobic condition matsuo and mochizuki 2009 furthermore the physiological basis of the yield gap between aerobic and flooded rice has not been explored extensively such information is a prerequisite to identify the morphological and physiological traits for the selection and breeding of high yielding aerobic rice cultivars matsuo and mochizuki 2009 a comprehensive knowledge on agronomical physiological and biochemical aspects of rice varieties particularly in water deficit stress environment is crucial for identifying water deficit stress resistant varieties kumar et al 2017 agricultural procedures and energy expenditures are well related in terms of energy consumer as well as supplier in the form of bio energy alam et al 2005 a considerable amount of non commercial energy inputs like seed farmyard manure and animate energy and commercial energy inputs in the form of electricity diesel fuel chemical fertilizers plant protections irrigation water and farm machinery have extensively been used in farming sectors kizilaslan 2009 this usage has recently been intensified with the growing population to obtain higher yields and economical return this is serious as additional usage of energy is responsible for considerable adverse effects of environmental and ecological concerns rafiee et al 2010 in the context of rapidly decreasing natural resources esengun et al 2007 implementations of energy efficient production systems may cut off green house gas emissions efficient expenditure of energy resources often comes under consideration as one of the prime requirements of sustainability in agricultural productions therefore an attempt is needed to maximize crop yield with minimum energy usage without much affecting the quality of the output singh et al 2004 in our region the farmers generally follow the traditional transplanted rice farming under continuous soil submergence using the local rice varieties which are quite inefficient in water utilization with decreased crop yield and water productivity they are still unaware about the techno economic feasibility of less water use in rice cultivation and potential benefit accrued from it in the light of the above considerations the objective of the present farmer s field study was to investigate the effects of different water saving irrigation methods on growth yield water and energy productivities and economics of three popular locally grown high yielding rice varieties the hypothesis behind this study was to select the best water saving irrigation method along with suitable rice variety that can be recommended to the farmers of the lower gangetic plains of eastern india for achieving higher grain yield water and energy productivities and economic gain 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site climate and soil characteristic the

grown by the farmers in this locality the unit plot size was 5 m 4 m with 1 0 m buffer strip area between and across the neighboring plots to avoid intrusion of seepage and irrigation water from the neighboring plots to overcome the effect of conveyance losses on treatments two buffering strip each of 1 0 m width on either side of the irrigation channel were made and water was carried only in irrigation channel 2 3 crop management and agronomic manipulations three separate seed beds were prepared for raising rice seedlings with a seed rate of 15 kg ha 1 the seeds of each cultivar were treated with trichoderma viride at 4 g kg 1 seeds to control or suppress the different fungal diseases for enhancing seed germination and seedling vigor and broadcasted in nursery beds during 6th january in each experimental year in all irrigation treatments the field was plowed criss cross wise repeatedly with a tractor drawn plow flooded with good amount of irrigation water puddled with the help of power tiller and levelled properly by laddering thirty days old seedlings were transplanted at a spacing of 20 cm 10 cm keeping one seedling per hill on 4th february in each year the recommended dose of fertilizers used for each rice variety was 120 60 60 kg ha 1 of n p2o5 and k2o respectively neem cake at 1 5 t ha 1 was applied during final land preparation one fourth dose of n excluding n from neem cake and full dose of p2o5 and k2o were applied as basal before transplanting in the form of urea single superphosphate and muriate of potash respectively the remaining portion of n was top dressed as half n dose at maximum tillering and quarter n dose at panicle initiation stage the routine agronomic manipulations and standard plant protection measures were adopted uniformly in all the treatments for improving soil physical properties and protecting the plants from pest infestation in order to maintain healthy plant stand the rice varieties were harvested according to its maturity where iet 4786 ir 36 and gb 1 were harvested on 22 april 5 may and 11 may respectively in each experimental year 2 4 assessment of agronomic parameters ten plants were randomly selected from central rows of each plot for recording observations the growth parameters viz plant height dry matter yield leaf area index lai and root length and yield attributing characters like effective tillers m 2 grains panicle 1 and 1000 grain weight from five centrally tagged plants were recorded at harvest prior to that five selected whole tagged plants from each plot were uprooted carefully frequently washed and air dried at 60 dat to measure the lai and root length plant height of randomly selected five plants from each plot was determined from ground level to the tip of the plant using a measuring tape and their average value was computed lai was calculated by the methods as given by yoshida et al 1976 as 1 lai leaf area of the plants cm 2 land area covered by plants cm 2 crop was harvested plot wise threshed manually to separate grain and straw cleaned sun dried for 5 6 days the grain yield by adjusting 14 moisture content and straw yield were recorded separately and expressed in t ha 1 the biological yield z was obtained as the summation of grain yield x and straw yield y the harvest index hi was calculated by using the formula given by donald 1963 as 2 hi x z 100 2 5 irrigation scheduling about 2 cm depth of water was maintained throughout the nursery period for seedling emergence after transplanting all the plots were irrigated at 5 cm depth at 3 day interval up to two week for proper establishment of seedling and then watered according to the proposed irrigation treatments depth of irrigation under continuous ponding cp usually followed by the traditional farming practice was 5 1 cm at 3 4 days interval from transplanting until ripening in awd regime where irrigation water was applied when soil matric potential ψm at 20 cm depth reached to 0 03 mpa after disappearance of ponded water sarkar et al 2012 irrigation at 4 1 cm depth was continued up to one week before flowering and then 5 1 cm depth was maintained from flowering to two weeks before harvesting mercury tensiometers were installed at a depth of 20 cm in the soil to monitor ψm and calculation was made as suggested by hillel 1998 in saturation sat treatment where saturated state was maintained at 0 500 mm soil profile in respective plots by irrigating to about 1 cm water depth one day after the subsidence of ponded water tabbal et al 2002 the amount of water applied in different irrigation treatments was measured and regulated by water meter 2 6 computation of irrigation water requirement the mean depth of water at 10 selected spots of each plot was measured with a millimeter scale after every irrigation and their mean value was determined irrigation water use and total water use during whole crop growing season were calculated by the following formula given by saha et al 2014 3 irrigation water use mm mean depth of each irrigation number of irrigation applied 4 total water use mm irrigation water use rainfall drainage water the portion of rainfall r retained in the active root zone of rice plant which was used to meet the crop evaporative demand was considered effective rainfall er in our study er was calculated by field soil moisture balance method fao 1974 as 5 er m 2 m 1 et c where m2 and m1 were the moisture value taken in the effective root zone 0 50 cm before and 24 h after cessation of rainfall and etc was the crop evapotranspiration between the sampling dates etc was calculated using the equation as 6 et c e p k p k c where ep is the pan evaporation mm kp is the pan factor and kc is the crop coefficient the evaporation data was obtained from a usda weather bureau class a pan located inside the experimental site and readings were recorded daily the pan factor was taken as 0 75 doorenbos and kassam 1979 the estimated kc values for paddy was chosen as 1 15 1 23 1 14 and 1 02 for initial crop development reproductive and maturity stages respectively tyagi et al 2000 the drainage component d data not shown was calculated indirectly by the equation as 7 d r er the depth of irrigation for awd was calculated by the following relationship as proposed by sarkar et al 2012 8 di θ s θ i dr ds where di is the depth of irrigation water to be applied mm dr is the depth of root zone mm ds is the depth of submergence mm the value was 50 mm in the present study θs is the average volumetric moisture content m3 m 3 of the root zone at saturation and θi is the average volumetric soil water content m3 m 3 at the time of irrigation both θs and θi are expressed as fractions the term θs θi gives the volume of water required to raise the water content of a unit volume of soil to saturation 2 7 crop water productivity crop water productivity cwp is considered one of the key water use indicators for

irrigation method on three popular local high yielding rice varieties the actual prices of inputs available in the market at the time of their use were considered for computing the production cost pc this cost accommodated all the expenses incurred in nursery bed and main field preparation sowing transplanting intercultural operation crop harvesting threshing and processing and cost of seed fertilizers crop protection chemicals variable irrigation water cost including application charges during the period of investigation the gross revenue gr was worked out by accounting the prevailing average market price of the main and by product during the experimental period and summation of their values the net revenue nr was estimated by deducting the pc from the gr the benefit cost ratio bcr of each treatment was calculated by the equation as 15 bcr gr us ha 1 pc us ha 1 2 12 statistical analysis all the data generated for different irrigation methods and varietal treatments imposed were subjected to analysis of variance using software packages of ms excel spss 23 0 version and origin pro 2021 version statistical significance between means of individual treatments and their interactions were assessed using the least significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 gomez and gomez 1984 and the mean values were adjusted by tukey s hsd honest significant difference test method since variation in data across the experimental years and the interactions between irrigation method and variety were statistically similar hence only pooled values of two consecutive seasons were presented to draw the inferences a number of statistical methods including principle component analysis pearson s correlation and scatter plot diagrams in origin pro version 2021 have been done to represent the changes of energy indices well as their influence on grain yield of rice therefore it is important to understand the rationale behind using these techniques for this study the principle component analysis jolliffe and cadima 2016 has been done as a way of identifying patterns in the dataset highlighting their similarities and differences through their distances among themselves pearson s correlation study has been conducted to indicates the strength of relationship of two observed characters gogtay and thatte 2017 which means how much one component changes with a significant change of another component in relation through a specific direction the deflections are important in predicting the effect of that particular parameter over dependent variable however it is still unknown how the sampling points behave according to these parameters with the scatter plot diagrams created using the treatment points the role of each point with respect to the dependent variable and the predictor is observed 3 results 3 1 effects of different irrigation methods and varietal selection on growth and yield attributes the effects of different irrigation methods and varietal selection on growth components and yield attributes of rice viz plant height ph dry matter accumulation dma leaf area index lai root length number of effective tillers seed panicle 1 and 1000 grain weight varied significantly p 0 05 table 3 all the parameters except root length and 1000 grain weight were significantly and consistently decreased with increasing limited moisture condition significant reduction was more conspicuous in saturation sat followed by alternate wetting and drying awd as compared to continuous ponding cp there was no significant difference in 1000 seed weight due to various water management interventions significant variation in root length was recorded among the different irrigation methods however maximum root length at 60 dat was found in sat 28 49 cm which was 16 7 and 7 7 higher over that of cp 24 41 cm and awd 26 45 cm respectively similarly plant height 100 68 cm was significantly higher under cp which was 5 2 and 9 2 more than awd and sat regimes respectively significant reduction in dry matter yield to the extent of 6 8 and 11 5 was noticed when the crop was exposed to awd and sat method of irrigation respectively in comparison with cp and all the three irrigation treatments differed significantly p 0 05 likewise number of effectives tiller was significantly higher by 7 3 and 13 0 in cp 323 44 over that of awd and sat respectively lai also showed maximum value in cp 323 44 t which was significantly superior to that of the remaining two irrigation regimes number of grains panicle 1 was significantly reduced by 11 1 and 7 2 in sat and awd respectively over the corresponding value in cp all the three tested varieties had significant impacts on promoting growth and yield constituents the variety gb 1 was statistically superior in registering maximum growth and yield parameters followed by iet 4786 and ir 36 except number of effective tillers where ir 36 showed highest value and being statistically at par with gb 1 plant height and dry matter yield differed significantly which were relatively higher by 23 5 27 6 and 7 3 21 6 in gb 1 ph 111 28 cm and dma 904 73 g m 2 over iet 4786 ph 90 13 cm and dma 843 39 g m 2 and ir 36 ph 87 18 cm and dma 744 06 g m 2 respectively gb 1 displayed 4 9 6 8 higher lai than other two tested varieties which was significantly superior over them root length showed significant differences among the varieties and it was reduced by 8 9 in iet 4786 26 37 cm and 17 0 in ir 36 24 04 cm in comparison with gb 1 28 95 cm there was significant variation in the number of grains panicle 1 where gb 1 furnished 43 8 and 57 9 more increase than iet 4786 and ir 36 respectively test weight irrespective of irrigation methods showed significantly highest value with gb 1 and lowest with ir 36 interaction effects of irrigation methods and varieties also showed statistical variations in all the growth and yield attributes table 3 the observed parametric values were significantly higher when the plants were subjected to irrigation under cp regime with gb 1 ph 118 32 cm dma 992 16 g m 2 number of effective tillers 330 60 number of grains panicle 1 261 33 barring root length at 60 dat where the same variety exhibited significantly highest value 31 03 cm under sat the next best treatment combination was gb 1 in awd condition in terms of plant height 110 42 cm dry matter accumulation 891 g m 2 lai 4 22 number of seeds panicle 1 241 38 and 1000 seed weight 23 10 g lower values of all these parameters were recorded under sat with ir 36 except root length which was found to be significantly lowest in cp there was significant improvement of plant height 6 7 29 0 dry matter accumulation 10 2 28 0 number of effective tillers m 2 0 7 14 5 and number of grains panicle 1 7 6 44 0 when the variety gb 1 was exposed in cp with respect to remaining irrigation regime and varietal combinations examined awd and sat irrigation practices regardless of varieties had negative impacts on growth and yield components 3 2 effects of different irrigation methods and varietal selection on grain and straw yields grain and straw yields of three selected rice varieties were significantly p 0 05 affected by irrigation methods table 4 highest grain yield was obtained with cp 4 56 t ha 1 which was superior to awd 4 30 t ha 1 and sat 3 97 t ha 1 limited irrigation regime through awd and sat resulted 5 7 and 12 9 decrease in grain yield respectively as compared with cp straw yield was found maximum under awd 6 23 t ha 1 which did not find any statistical difference with cp 6 20 t ha 1 but both showed significant differences with sat method of irrigation 5 97 t ha 1 irrigation through sat method reduced the straw yield by 3 7 and 4 2 over cp and awd respectively harvest index hi of plant under different irrigation regimes was statistically non significant however the value was marginally higher in cp followed by awd and lower in sat variable differences in grain and straw yields and hi of the varieties averaging over the irrigation regimes were observed table 4 significantly maximum grain yield was found in gb 1 4 69 t ha 1 which was 11 9 and 18 7 higher than iet 4786 4 19 t ha 1 and ir 36 3 95 t ha 1 respectively straw yield followed almost the similar trend although the values recorded in ir 36 and iet 4786 were statistically non significant hi showed maximum value in gb 1 closely followed by iet 4786 however but both values were statistically at par with each other but significantly superior to ir 36 the coupling effects of irrigation methods and varieties tested on grain and straw yields were statistically significant table 5 in general curtailment of irrigation regimes irrespective of varieties consistently decreased the grain and straw yields likewise regardless of irrigation methods the cultivar gb 1 exhibited higher grain and straw yields followed by iet 4786 and ir 36 the pooled data revealed that the irrigation regime of cp coupled with gb 1 was the best treatment combination recording maximum grain yield 5 10 t ha 1 whereas awd regime along with gb 1 was superior in producing maximum straw yield 6 72 t ha 1 although the data being at par with cp coupled with gb 1 6 68 t ha 1 significantly lowest grain 3 74 t ha 1 and straw 5 80 t ha 1 yield was recorded with ir 36 when irrigation was applied through sat method imposing restricted irrigations of awd and sat together accounted for 5 4 9 8 5 5 10 1 and 6 3 17 8 reduction in grain yield in relation to cp method of irrigation adopted on iet 4786 ir 36 and gb 1 respectively 3 3 effects of different irrigation methods and varietal selection on water use and water productivity of rice the amount of irrigation water applied in awd 1065 mm and sat 856 7 mm was 85 and 68 4 of cp 1252 5 mm method of irrigation table 6 the estimated effective rainfall was 75 3 mm for each irrigation regime contributing 5 7 for cp 6 6 for awd and 8 1 for sat towards the total water use low level of irrigation management could save 14 1 in awd and 29 8 in sat of total water requirement in comparison with conventional cp among the selected varieties gb 1 used higher amount of total water 1232 2 mm followed by ir 36 1122 2 mm and iet 4786 1055 7 mm the use of irrigation water as well as effective rainwater followed the same pattern there was a saving of irrigation water and total water to the tune of 15 0 and 14 1 for awd and 31 6 and 29 8 for sat respectively when compared with the corresponding values for cp method of irrigation similarly iet 4786 and ir 36 could save 8 7 and 14 3 and 8 2 and 8 9 of irrigation water and total water respectively than the corresponding values for gb 1 crop water productivity cwp and irrigation water productivity iwp were significantly influenced by different irrigation methods and varieties adopted fig 2 increasing lower irrigation regime significantly improved the cwp as well as iwp over that of traditional cp irrigation method the cwp varied from 0 343 to 0 428 kg m 3 and iwp from 0 363 to 0 464 kg m 3 in different irrigation methods significantly highest cwp was registered in sat 0 428 kg m 3 which was 13 5 and 24 9 higher than awd 0 377 kg m 3 and cp 0 343 kg m 3 respectively almost similar statistical variation was observed in iwp where there was a reduction of iwp by 12 9 in awd and 21 8 in cp when compared with sat method three tested rice varieties responded differently in terms of cwp and iwp significantly highest cwp was noticed in iet 4786 0 403 kg m 3 whereas iwp was with gb 1 0 431 kg m 3 there was a reduction of 11 4 cwp in ir 36 than iet 4786 and 4 0 than gb 1 iwp also showed significantly minimum value in ir 36 0 380 kg m 3 which was 9 7 and 11 8 lesser than iet 4786 and gb 1 respectively among the various interactive effects of irrigation method and variety combination significantly highest cwp was recorded in iet 4786 0 465 kg m 3 followed by gb 1 0 413 kg m 3 and ir 36 0 406 kg m 3 under sat method of irrigation table 7 on the other hand significantly lowest cwp 0 317 kg m 3 was found in ir 36 under cp regime lower irrigation regime of sat followed by awd enhanced the cwp and iwp in all the varieties examined while reverse observation was noted in prevailing conventional cp method however maximum iwp 0 489 kg m 3 was found in iet 4786 under sat condition whereas minimum 0 332 kg m 3 in ir 36 under cp condition and both combination differed significantly the variety gb 1 showed intermediate values of iwp in awd and sat regimes and significantly highest value in cp method a calculation was made to estimate the irrigation water or total water requirement for production of one kilogram of rice grain due to variations in irrigation methods and varieties chosen fig 3 it has been observed that for producing per kg rice grain irrigation water used in awd 2491 l kg 1 and sat 2159 l kg 1 was 90 and 78 of cp 2768 l kg 1 respectively the results showed significant differences among the various irrigation treatments this implies that there was a saving of 22 and 10 irrigation water in sat and awd method of irrigation respectively for producing one kilogram of rice grain total water use for producing one kilogram of rice grain followed the similar trends but water requirement was a little higher there were significant variations among the different test varieties in the utilization of irrigation water and total water towards production of one kg of rice grain however ir 36 2672 l kg 1 was found to use 10 8 and 14 5 more irrigation water for one kilogram of rice grain production than that of iet 4786 and gb 1 respectively similarly total water requirement for producing per kilogram rice grain in ir 36 was 12 7 more than iet 4786 and 9 1 more than gb 1 fig 3 for producing one kilogram of rice grain the total water use was found to be significantly lowest in iet 4786 2513 l kg 1 which was 3 2 lesser than gb 1 3 4 effect of different irrigation methods and varietal selection on energy indices the common energy consumption was computed by summing up the entire energy equivalent for inputs used for cultivating three transplanted rice varieties exposed under three irrigation methods table 8 the energy consumption as recorded in table 9 showed the comparatively higher value in cp 41 6 103 mj ha 1 limited irrigation practices reduced the energy consumption by 10 1 in sat and 4 6 in awd than traditional cp the energy output in different irrigation practices varied significantly with each other and was in the order of cp awd sat there was no significant variation in net energy gain between cp and awd but both were statistically superior to sat which resulted in 7 7 lower net energy gain than cp and 6 5 than awd the energy use efficiency eue was significant with varied irrigation regimes and exhibited relatively higher value in limited irrigation method of awd 359 4 and sat 356 1 than normal irrigation at cp energy productivity ep was found to be higher in cp 109 6 g grain mj 1 energy input but the result was non significant with awd 108 3 g grain mj 1 energy input in contrast specific energy se followed the reverse trend with increasing lower irrigation regime however se value in sat was superior over cp but statistically at par with awd the principal component bi plot fig 6 in the principle component analysis having percentage wise most contributed two of the three components with eigen values 1 00 table 10 reveals the relationship within the energy components it is fairly depicted fig 6 that the grain yield gy is much more influenced by the energy components like output energy oe net energy ne energy use efficiency eue energy productivity ep straw yield sy while input energy ie has less and specific energy se has far lesser influence on grain yield gy as these two parameters resides far from the gy cluster in the component plot the pearson s correlation fig 7 amongst these parameters also supports this information on the grain yield gy having significant positive correlations with output energy oe 0 98 net energy ne 0 96 energy use efficiency eue 0 72 energy productivity ep 0 90 straw yield sy 0 91 while input energy ie has less positive correlation 0 69 and specific energy se has even negative influence 0 88 on grain yield gy after drawing scatter plot diagram with these variables the response of each experimental variable in relation with the grain yield can be obtained and the predictors can easily be diagnosed in the diagrammatic changes of input energy ie output energy oe net energy ne energy use efficiency eue fig 8 and energy productivity ep fig 9 with the changes of grain yield gy have significant positive trend possessing having the treatment numbers 3 i1v3 and 6 i2v3 to be highest in terms of the grain yield and the energy component analysis among the varieties the energy consumption was varied a little but gb 1 was more consumer of energy 40 0 103 mj ha 1 than the other two varieties the energy components like energy output net energy gain eue and ep was found more in gb 1 followed by iet 4786 although the se was relatively higher in ir 36 10 02 mj energy input kg 1 of grain 3 5 effect of different irrigation methods and varietal selection on economics economic appraisal of several water management approaches in general indicated that various cost components viz total cost of production gross revenue and net revenue followed in the sequence of cp awp sat table 10 gross revenue was found maximum in cp us 999 2 ha 1 which was statistically superior to awd us 945 1 ha 1 and sat us 874 9 ha 1 net revenue was highest in cp us 266 6 ha 1 and on parity with awd us 253 0 ha 1 but both being statistically superior over sat us 198 1 ha 1 awd displayed higher bcr 1 37 but competitive with cp 1 36 while sat achieved lowest bcr 1 29 as regards to the varietal selection gb 1 accomplished maximum gross revenue net revenue and bcr gb 1 witnessed net revenue increase by 50 5 over iet 4786 and 94 5 over ir 36 least gross revenue net revenue and bcr were recorded with ir 36 interaction effects of irrigation methods and varieties showed large variations in respect of gross return net return and bcr table 11 although iet 4786 and gb 1 under cp regime showed higher gross and net return respectively but bcr values were comparable with gb 1 under irrigation imposition at cp and awd table 12 4 discussion higher groundwater utilization for irrigated rice during post winter season february to april using the conventional irrigation practices necessitates the site specific water saving managements approaches and selection of locally adaptable rice varieties to mitigate progressive decline in groundwater table and water scarcity for sustainable rice production and increasing farmers profitability sarkar et al 2012 4 1 growth parameter in our experiment plant height was shortened with decreasing water supply through irrigation regimes of awd and sat as compared to water intensive conventional transplanted rice cp this was mainly due to lower absorption of water causing inhibition of cell division or cell enlargement under reduced soil water availability choudhary 2015 tallest plant under adequate soil water condition due to cp regime could help in better maintenance of turgid pressure of plant cells higher accumulation of photosynthates during early stage and subsequent partition to other plant parts in later stage for promoting growth and development bouman and tuong 2001 chai et al 2016 a significant reduction in plant height of all the varieties as a consequence of constant and intermittent water stress exposure across the physiological stages under restricted irrigation regimes as compared to continuous flooded condition might be due to limitation in cell division and elongation resulted in reduction of internodal length thereby affected plant height patel et al 2010 the gradual reduction in lai with decreasing irrigation level could be ascribed to sustenance of decreased soil water accessibility especially during tillering stage which significantly reduced the leaf attributes number of leaves leaf length and breadth resulting in lower leaf area and ultimately lai choudhary 2015 nguyen et al 2015 irrespective of irrigation regime and varietal chosen dry matter accumulation dma in plant was best fitted in a second degree polynomial equation with lai fig 4a with high coefficient of determination r2 0 834 in this modular approach cp produced higher dry matter yield by 7 3 over awd and 13 0 over sat the reduction in lai was associated with lower dma of plant which was chiefly due to reduced photosynthetic surface emmam et al 2010 optimum water availability in soil and plant system enhanced cell division promoted secondary wall formation and increased the large photosynthetic area water shortage on the other hand causes negative effect on various plant physiological restrictions on transpiration stomatal opening reduced co2 fixation and nutrients uptake leading to low rate of photosynthesis and other biochemical reactions which inhibited the growth parameters nemeskeri and helyes 2019 lower soil moisture also restricted stem and leaf growth despite complete maintenance of cell turgidity in the growing tips as a result of osmotic adjustment anjum et al 2003 our results supported the earlier findings which showed lowest dma in plants under lower irrigation regime than continuous moisture condition emmam et al 2010 patel et al 2010 anning et al 2018 root length was comparatively higher in limited irrigation methods as compared with continuous ponding which might be due to improved root elongation and proliferation of the plant under lower water supply to extract more moisture from the deeper layers of soil another plausible reason for increase in root growth with decrease in moisture condition was ascribed to decrease in shoot growth because of changes in carbohydrate partitioning richards 2008 yoshimura et al 2008 and translocation of assimilates from upper to lower portion for osmotic adjustment of root system saidi et al 2010 which support in maintaining same level of turgidity and re establishment of water potential gradient for water uptake these adjustments are responsible for the growth of root mass under low water potential hsiao and xu 2000 in field crops with inadequate soil moisture the root growth is enhanced by the reduction in soil water potential which makes development of root system better than soil with sufficient moisture hirasawa et al 2005 nakagami et al 2004 while studying the effect of intermittent irrigation on root growth won et al 2005 found more root concentration in deeper soil when irrigated at water depth below 2 cm 4 2 yield attributes higher yield attributes had direct bearing on the improvement of yield and amongst them number of effective tillers was most important one to encourage yield the quantum of effective tillers in plant was associated with the availability of soil moisture regime this was found higher with cp while awd accounted for 93 2 and sat for 88 5 of effective tillers obtained with cp soil moisture deficit prevailing for longer period of time in rice has accommodated the plants to cope with the adverse condition and most of the photosynthates were partitioned accordingly thereby resulted in lower percentage panicle bearing tillers sayed 2003 our results are in agreement with the findings of previous studies which showed that moisture limitation during crop period significantly reduced the productive tillers bouman and tough 2001 norton et al 2017 zubaer et al 2007 the number of grains panicle 1 was considerably lower in reduced irrigation regime contributing 7 2 for awd and 11 1 for sat of normal irrigation cp this was observable to acute soil moisture constraint which prominently decreases plant reproduction pollen grain count pollen size pollen germination and pollen tube development insufficient assimilates production and its translocation to storage organ of grains resulting in decreased number of filled grains per panicle zubaer et al 2007 the variation in 1000 grain weight among irrigation methods was non significant however it was statistically significant among the tested varieties because of variable genetic make up mohammad et al 2002 in the present study gb 1 performed well under cp and awd condition too in terms of producing higher plant height biomass production lai and number of effective tillers iet 4786 was the alternative option in achieving moderate growth and yield attributing characters whereas ir 36 performed the least this is particularly due to variability of the genetic configurations of the varieties which enable them to perform in different moisture conditions and utilize the available resources accordingly for growth and development mannan et al 2009 garba et al 2013 gagandeep and gandhi 2015 the vegetative growth of rice is significantly influenced by the type of varieties used and the genetic constitution of the varieties which help in obtaining different yields under various moisture regimes kumar et al 2017 ben et al 2017 our findings are in close conformity with these reported studies 4 3 crop productivity imposition of water savings irrigation practices had negative impact on rice yield this could be attributed to moderate to severe soil water stress as a result of declined water availability in root zone at higher tension which proved to be detrimental for rice plants as regards to hastened senescence reduced photosynthetically active surfaces and sharp drop in the photosynthesis rate leading to lower production jaffar et al 2017 choudhary 2015 reported that under moisture stress condition there was restricted supply of assimilates from source to the sink thereby causing limited production of reproductive organs or developing grains in rice plants in the present study exposing water loving rice crop to higher degree of water stress like restricted irrigation and continuous flooded condition have resulted negative impact on various physiological processes thereby causing differentiation in dry matter accumulation and effective tillers and partly number of grains panicle 1 and 1000 grain weight ultimately leading to variable yield status dry matter production irrespective of irrigation regime and variety had been best fitted in a second degree polynomial equation with grain yield fig 4b with high coefficient of determination r2 0 91 where cp produced higher dma as compared with awd and sat methods since the differences between limited and flooded rice condition as regard to harvest index was not significant it is obvious that yield differences under these water management practices was due to the differences in genetic characters of the varieties for biomass production decrease in the relative yield in transplanted rice due to lower irrigation regime to continuous flooding was reported by kumar et al 2017 choudhary 2015 patel et al 2010 achieving high yields under irrigated condition requires high yielding characteristics of lowland varieties but aerobic soil conditions require new aerobic rice varieties resistant to drought in upland condition lafitte et al 2002 in our experiment gb 1 was found to accord higher yield under normal cp method but it had to sacrifice about 6 3 grain yield when it was exposed under lower irrigation regime of awd brar et al 2015 was of the view that there was a decreasing trend in grain yield of rice with increase in waiting period after disappearance of ponded water 4 4 water productivity our results demonstrated that there was 17 6 and 46 2 more irrigation water requirement in cp when compared with awd and sat method respectively these findings could be comparable with carrijo et al 2017 who also found that rice cultivation under awd has the potential to reduce water input by 23 4 in comparison to cp the variable saving of irrigation water as well as total water use in both the constrained irrigation management practices was due to different irrigation frequency and or duration of drying period followed in awd and sat methods according to the type of experimental soil bouman and tuong 2001 belder et al 2004 however joshi et al 2009 opined that aerobic rice system was much better to reduce water input than other alternate methods of rice cultivation like awd and sat present study indicated a consistent increase in grain yield with incremental irrigation water application however the yield increase was not always proportional to the amount of irrigation water applied because all the water applied was not consumed by crop some fraction being lost which eventually reflected in crop water productivity cwp highest cwp was found under sat where lowest amount of water 932 mm was applied to the crop likewise moderate cwp was displayed by awd using moderate amount of water 1140 3 mm and the value was 9 9 higher in comparison to cp which exhibited lowest cwp with highest water use 1327 8 mm a decreasing non linear trend of cwp was observed with increasing amount of irrigation water fig 5a saha et al 2015 noticed the reduced evaporation rates from dry aerobic soil may be responsible for high cwp under aerobic rice conditions because unsaturated field conditions offer greater opportunities to save precarious water bouman et al 2002 conversely conventional farming cf is much less efficient at saving water relative to awd and aerobic rice as there are greater water losses due to increased seepage and percolation puddling and evaporative losses bouman et al 2007 higher wue or cwp under limited irrigation management in rice compared to conventional flooding methods has also been reported by patel et al 2010 and singh et al 2017 the amount of irrigation water saving under awd compared to cp in our experimental condition was too less 15 while almost a double value 28 under same irrigation treatment compared to traditional water management in rice was noticed by chapagain and yamaji 2010 similar amount of water saving 15 18 in alternately submerged nonsubmerged system than under continuous submergence was demonstrated by belder et al 2004 in lowland rice among the varieties evaluated gb 1 125 days used relatively more water because of its longer duration than iet 4786 106 days and ir 36 119 days rainfall occurred during first week of may in both the years hence there was no requirement of irrigation water for the last two varieties after ripening the cwp in iet 4786 and gb 1 was found competitive but too variation did prevail for iwp while ir 36 furnished significantly lowest cwp and iwp table 7 fig 3 the enhancement of 61 water productivity in rice cultivars by applying 50 deficit irrigation was noted by jonubi et al 2018 the irrigation water requirement for producing per kilogram of rice grain was more in gb 1 because of its higher yield ability in both non flooded and flooded conditions than other two varieties higher cwp in different lowland rice varieties following limited irrigation practices was reported earlier by patel et al 2010 ullah et al 2018 and anning et al 2018 4 5 economics accomplishing higher yields with increased water productivity is economical only when an increase in crop yield is not offset by an increase in the costs of other inputs jonubi et al 2018 higher cost of production with higher gross and net revenues resulted in a greater bcr in cp method whereas in awd with modest cost of production and modest monetary returns displayed nominally a higher bcr significantly higher total cost of production in flood irrigation system than awd was reported by karim et al 2014 similarly highest gross revenue net revenue and bcr were found in gb 1 because of its higher yield achievement in awd and cp condition thus in terms of competitive net revenue and bcr values with highest cwp obtained awd can be superior over cp as higher cost of production and lowest cwp is involved in the later irrigation method hassen et al 2017 also reported similar kind of result where economic performances of traditional and modern rice varieties under different water management systems were assessed in the present study the variety gb 1 performed well under lower irrigation water particularly at awd not only in terms marked increase in yield but also in deriving maximum bcr cwp and energy utilization the variety iet 4786 followed the next in terms of physical and economical achievements better performance of these two varieties under lower irrigation regime was evident from the minimum differences in yield growth and yield attributes water productivity and energy use efficiency under three different water management practices there is a necessity to explore nutrient uptake pattern in different physiological stages in response to graded fertilization under variable water management scenario to optimize fertilizer water management technology sustainable for irrigated rice in the lower indo gangetic plains 4 6 energy indices energy is used in every stage of crop production process commencing from land preparation to harvesting hence identifying sustainable rice cultivation methods is a decisive factor to ensure food security for growing population htwe et al 2021 in this study grain yield gy of the test crop is highly associated with the energy components output energy oe net energy ne energy use efficiency eue energy productivity ep straw yield sy input energy ie and specific energy se as revealed in the principal component bi plot fig 6 systems of cropping and related cultivation managements have forward influence on energy expenditure hence comes energy productivity tuti et al 2012 which is significantly correlated 0 90 with grain yield fig 7 and also can be found within the yield clusters of pca bi plot fig 6 energy inputs are also crucial in achieving higher yields in a crop production system which is facing interesting fabrications dhaliwal and kler 1995 cultivation of rice requires fairly high inputs of energy due to higher amount of fertilizer and irrigation water requirement complied with associated labor intensive management practices thereby increasing demand of suitable treatments for converting maximum energy into yield returns as high as possible kachroo et al 2012 differences in energy input and energy output resulted in less variation of energy balance in limited irrigation and varietal selection experiment in rice cultivation energy use efficiency eue was comparatively higher in awd method indicating less water utilization to save more energy energy productivity ep was higher in cp but it was almost identical with awd this points out an another indication of less energy utilization incurred by restricted water management which can be glanced through the fig 5b where the grain yield accorded a very high positive regression coefficient with ep r2 0 859 higher grain yield with lower input particularly irrigation water employing constrained irrigation management schedules resulted in greater ep and specific energy lower irrigation practices by allowing irrigation 3 days after disappearance of ponded water can improve the eue and se as earlier reported by brar et al 2015 all the energy input and output related parameters were considerably higher in gb 1 because of higher grain and straw yield attainment although awd method of irrigation with gb 1 had the better result in terms of eue and ep calculation energy calculation in rice by means of different cultivation methods or various irrigation or nutrient management practices had been observed by different researchers truong et al 2017 htwe et al 2021 singh et al 2019 pathak and bining 1985 pointed out that the energy consumption in paddy production is much higher than that of wheat production primarily due to the high irrigation requirements of rice hence it is important to obtain a sustainable yield with maximum utilization of energy expended from the scatter plot diagrams fig 8 and fig 9 it is evident that higher values in energy components like output energy oe net energy ne energy use efficiency eue input energy ie and energy productivity ep with respect to grain yield gy is favorable however it is interesting to notice that treatment numbers 3 i1v3 and 6 i2v3 comprising of rice variety gb 1 under irrigation regimes cp and awd respectively have also been identified with lower specific energy along with higher yield return from the scatter plot diagram of specific energy se and grain yield gy depicting negative trend unlike other scatter plots fig 9 this supports previous pca and pearson s correlation analysis and signifies that the treatments identified can deliver higher grain yield with minimal input energy and maximum output energy gains 5 conclusion the results of the present study indicated that cultivation of gb 1 variety in normal continuous flooding as well as limited irrigation of awd is techno economically feasible for the lowland rice farmers of lower indo gangetic plains in eastern india or similar agro ecological regions for obtaining higher yield cwp eue and economics under scarce availability of irrigation water imposition of lower irrigation regime of awd using variety gb 1 can be advocated as the nominal grain yield loss due to intermittent exposure to water constraint condition is being compensated with highest cwp eue and bcr followed by cp with the variety gb 1 in case of sufficient water availability more number of locally adaptable high yield potential genotypes needs to be screened to identify the location specific

9712,fertigation management of olive grove is highly complex especially when reclaimed water is used for irrigation nitrogen n is the main nutrient component of olive trees which traditionally has led to an excessive use in fertilization programs this problem can be exacerbated if reclaimed water is used since it already contains n for this reason water quality must be considered in the fertilization plan both total content and n form arriving to the trees have implications in olive tree nutrient requirements as well as the environment if reclaimed water particularities and the length of the pipes of water distribution networks are considered the form and total concentration of n can change over space and time in this work both spatial and temporal analysis of the n content and form in a water distribution network using reclaimed water for irrigating olive trees was performed this study proved that changes in n were evident both over time and across the irrigation water distribution network seasonally n content was reduced during the summer period spatially a clear nitrification occurred from the pumping station to the farms these variations demonstrate the importance of a continuous water quality control in order to adjust the fertilization plan according to the n content in water keywords reclaimed water fertigation scheduling precision irrigation nitrogen changes water quality olive tree fertigation 1 introduction arid and semi arid areas such as mediterranean countries are already facing significant pressure on water resources in the context of climate change with the resulting increase in extreme weather events and with the predicted growth in food demand an exponential rise in that pressure is predicted bisselink et al 2018 the use of non conventional water sources such as wastewater and more specifically reclaimed water rw is one of the most sustainable alternatives to cope with water shortages and a key way to approach this problem iglesias and garrote 2015 maestre valero et al 2019b treated wastewater is water from any combination of domestic industrial or commercial sources that has been processed in a wastewater treatment plant to remove contaminants international organization for standardization 2018 however to make it appropriate for reuse an additional treatment is necessary then the former wastewater is called reclaimed or recycled water and it can be used for irrigation enhancing water bodies among other uses raschid sally and jayakody 2008 worldwide the countries that according to sato et al 2013 reuse treated water the most are the usa 6 4 hm3 day egypt 1 9 hm3 day syria 1 5 hm3 day spain 1 4 hm3 day israel 0 7 hm3 day and saudi arabia 0 4 hm3 day uses of rw vary largely even within the same country depending on the country s development climate main economic activities etc in general it is estimated that in developed countries and after secondary treatment the main destination of these waters is agricultural irrigation 33 followed by the irrigation of green areas 20 and industrial uses 8 prats rico 2016 in a context where the agricultural sector is responsible for 70 of water abstractions worldwide the use of treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation constitutes one of the basic strategies to manage imbalances between resource availability and demand this also contributes to the promotion of the circular economy by recovering nutrients from the rw and applying them to crops by means of fertigation techniques thus water reuse could potentially reduce the need for supplemental applications of conventional fertilizers due to increasing interest the application of this type of water to irrigate has already been evaluated by different authors some of them have focused their studies from a safety and environmental perspective chen et al 2013 kalavrouziotis et al 2012 lopez galvez et al 2014 others have paid more attention to the nutritional aspects maestre valero et al 2019a pereira et al 2011 there are also authors who have studied how rw could influence the development or quality of the crop lu et al 2016 all of them agree with the fact that rw used as an irrigation water resource if properly managed does not result in adverse impacts and is safe for human health and the environment at the same time it could lead to significant fertilizer savings since the application of additional fertilizers is reduced increasing the yield and quality of the crops additionally it may be essential for addressing both the water scarcity problem and irrigated agriculture sustainability enhancement olive trees the most iconic crop in the mediterranean basin have to adapt to the new political and institutional framework both at national and international level where a synergy between agricultural and environmental policies and the conservation of natural resources is taking place in this sense this crop represents a typical example of irrigation using rw resources and several authors have investigated its potential and effects for example ashrafi et al 2015 assessed the olive tree response in terms of growth photosynthesis rates and nutrient content they concluded that thanks to the higher nutrient concentrations plant development was improved erel et al 2019 conducted a long term study which demonstrated that olive nutrient requirements were covered using rw they found that the olive trees nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k needs were met by irrigating with rw and without the use of additional fertilizer thanks to these nutrients the rw irrigated trees also obtained higher fruit yields however they indicated that special attention must be paid to the soil which over the long term could suffer negative effects such as an increase in the ratio of sodium absorption salinity problems nevertheless were not found either in the soil or the olive trees pedrero et al 2020 conducted a review considering different water sources and qualities analyzing their benefits and limitations for olive tree irrigation they affirmed that in mediterranean countries and over a long period olive trees irrigated with rw are likely to improve their yield however they highlighted that although n contribution through rw could be essential to achieve this greater production it may also generate negative impacts on both olive yield and oil quality if given in excess in addition even though rw already contains n alcaide zaragoza et al 2019 confirmed that farmers keep applying significant fertilizer quantities without considering the negative environmental impacts and additional costs n is the main nutritional component of any crop and therefore of olive trees for this reason n has traditionally been the main mineral element used in olive fertilization plans however these plans are frequently based on farmer s experience which can lead to inappropriate n applications and in many cases over fertilization fernández escobar 2011 this can cause negative effects on crop health quality and also the environment fernández escobar et al 2006 due to this importance the n cycle and its implications in olive tree nutrition have been studied in the past for example fernández escobar et al 2012 estimated a n balance for olives determining that an olive orchard had lower n requirements than historically thought traditionally it was thought that annual n fertilizer applications were required for maintaining high yields this research proved that depending on different factors irrigation water quality rainwater inputs organic matter etc n applications may not be necessary the form in which n is applied is another important aspect to consider fertilizers can be in organic form inorganic form nh4 n or no3 n or as a combination of both organic and inorganic depending on the crop n is assimilated in one of its soluble forms i e inorganic forms in the case of the olive tree it is able to assimilate n in both nh4 n or no3 n however differences in olive nutrition and impacts on the environment under the application of different n forms have been found for instance tsabarducas et al 2017 found differences in growth and photosynthesis rates in olive trees depending on the n form applied fernández escobar et al 2004 also detected variations in n leaching depending on the n form used for fertilizing however all of them considered that the form of n arriving to the crop was the same as they were applying in other words none of them considered the influence of water quality parameters or the irrigation network characteristics on n form changes irrigation district distribution networks usually cover large areas which involve big pipe lengths sometimes particularly in areas devoted to one single crop fertilizers are applied in the pumping station and distributed along the irrigation district through the water distribution network consequently the travel time from the pump station to the plot hydrant is important particularly to the furthest farms this could entail unequal nutrient distribution to users this effect was confirmed by jimenez bello et al 2011 at irrigation district level they found considerable differences depending on the farm location but they focused their attention on the irrigation network and considered that all the fertilizers injected in the network were received at farm level without changes in the water quality and concentration of nutrients however due to the rw particularities some studies have proved that water quality changes inside the pipes for example yu et al 2020 studied the variability of the water quality parameters in river water replenished by rw they found modifications in both the total n content and its inorganic forms nh4 n or no3 n both wang et al 2016 2020 conducted experiments under controlled conditions in order to investigate the relationship between the rw quality parameters and pipe length they detected that pipe length had an important effect on the nitrification process however there are no studies that have assessed these effects on pressurized irrigation networks under real conditions n concentration in rw changes throughout the irrigation season and during the travel time within the irrigation network as a result of oxidation reduction reactions plot elevation differences pipe length etc the n form which arrives at the farm influences both crop nutrition and n leaching in this work a spatial temporal analysis of the n form changes in a water distribution network using rw for irrigation was carried out its implications in olive production and soil pollution were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the study was carried out in the tintín irrigation district tid located in montilla córdoba southern spain this region has a typical mediterranean climate with an average annual rainfall of 590 mm mostly during spring and autumn while they are almost negligible in summer the daily mean temperature is 16 9 ºc and the mean reference evapotranspiration et0 3 mm day however et0 ranges from 0 5 mm day during winter to 8 mm day in summer the water distributed for irrigation comes from the montilla wastewater treatment plant wwtp secondary treated wastewater by extended aeration and settled is diverted to the reclamation train initially composed by a settling reservoir subsequently the water is sent by communicating vessels to a larger reservoir for storage where two ultrasound treatment units are installed for microalgae reduction before its distribution the water by floating intake is sent to the filtration process composed of several automatic filter units 130 µm self cleaning by opening the ring pack fig 1 finally some disinfectant treatments are applied potassium permanganate kmno4 was applied in both settling and storage reservoirs and peracetic acid c2h4o3 in the irrigation network particularly 500 l of kmno4 were applied bimonthly and 900 l of c2h4o3 were applied at the end of june thus the water quality required for the irrigation of olive trees is achieved according to the spanish regulation for water reuse spain government 2007 the tid water distribution network irrigates 150 ha within the guadalquivir river basin where mainly olive is the cultivated crop the average plot size is 1 5 ha all the fields have the same irrigation system subsurface drip irrigation with 2 2 l h 1 pressure compensating drippers spaced at 1 m and installed at a depth of 30 cm the water allocation is 1500 m3 year 1 ha 1 the irrigation season usually lasts between five and seven months depending on the rainfall of the year irrigation events are scheduled at district level by the irrigation district s manager and all the fields are irrigated simultaneously the irrigation schedule consisted of applications four times a week for 8 h during the entire irrigation season irrigation was carried out every tuesday thursday saturday and sunday 2 2 sampling collection water quality analysis was carried out once a month during the 2019 irrigation season to assess the fluctuations in the n chemical forms throughout the year temporal scale they were measured before and after the filtration system filtration system inlet fsi and filtration system outlet fso well as in two tid farms f2 and f5 later the sample point number was extended in order to assess the spatial variability then six strategic points across the irrigation network f1 to f6 were selected to analyze the water quality they receive and the differences in the chemical forms of n spatial scale the farm points were selected according to their distance from the pumping station elevation and pressure criteria the characteristics of each sampling point are shown in table 1 differences between fsi and fso made it possible to determine if additional fertilizer was being applied on the sampling days as well as the changes of n forms in the farms with respect to the pumping station tid irrigation network and the selected points are shown in fig 2 in each sample the total n nt and different n forms were measured ammoniacal nitrogen nh4 n nitric nitrogen no3 n and the n total kjeldhal ntk organic n norg n was obtained as the difference between ntk and nh4 n some other water quality parameters were also selected to be analyzed since they could influence the oxidation reduction reactions and therefore the n form some particular bacteria are required for these reactions to take place which are highly susceptible to certain environmental factors specifically to dissolved oxygen do temperature t and ph brion and billen 2000 shammas 1986 all of them need to be at optimal values for the reaction to occur the chlorophyll a chl a content is another important parameter to analyze it is related to the microalgae biomass which could affect the n content because of the microalgae consumption of n kuenzler et al 1982 finally organic matter content can also affect the n form stein and klotz 2016 and for that reason the chemical oxygen demand cod and the biochemical oxygen demand bod5 were measured these parameters are indirect indicators of the organic matter content in the water the description and reference methods used for the analysis of the mentioned parameters in water samples are shown in table 2 2 3 data analysis means and standard errors were obtained for each data a pearson correlation was performed to assess the relationships of the water quality parameters then one way repeated measures analysis of variance rm anova was carried out for the temporal analysis this analysis is suitable for data in which the same variables are measured more than once davis 2002 rm anova must fulfill the sphericity condition which was analyzed using the maulchy test when the sphericity condition was not confirmed the greenhouse geisser correction was applied to be able to continue with the rm anova for spatial analysis the difference between the n concentration on the farms and the n concentration at fso was performed for each n form and each period all the analysis were performed in r programming language using rstudio as the integrated development environment ide for windows van der loo and de jonge 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality characterization results of the water quality parameters analyzed in the eight sampling points during the 2019 irrigation season in tid are shown in table 3 nt ranged from 21 8 mg l 1 to 3 3 mg l 1 which implied an important difference between some water samples this quantity of nt was similar to other rw used for olive tree irrigation bourazanis et al 2016 petousi et al 2015 segal et al 2011 on average the nh4 n concentration was higher than no3 n as for n in nitrite form this was not found during the experiment being the rest of the nt in organic form the value of the ph during the whole season was considered as slightly alkaline with an average value of 7 8 do and chl a also changed largely during the experiment these parameters can affect both the amount of nt and also its form cira et al 2016 espinosa rodríguez et al 2014 in the case of water temperature its variation may be caused by the fluctuation in the environment temperature the results of both cod and bod5 met the minimum quality requirements for water reuse established in the eu regulation the european parliament and the council of the european union 2020 which are 125 mg l o2 and 25 mg l o2 respectively table 4 shows the pearson correlation applied to the water quality parameters analyzed nt was positive correlated to both nh4 n and no3 n all the analyzed parameters except for do were significantly correlated to the n content or its form although no correlation was observed between either cod or bod5 and the total n content different correlations were found with the different chemical forms specifically both showed a significant positive correlation with norg n which is expected since these parameters are indicators of the organic matter in the water in addition a significant positive correlation between bod5 and no3 n was found as well as a significant negative correlation with nh4 n which may indicate that bod5 could be affecting nitrification chl a is used as an indicator of microalgae biomass desortová 1981 which could explain its negative correlation with n content due to the consumption of this nutrient by microalgae kuenzler et al 1982 both ph and t were also influential parameters for nt and nh4 n this may indicate that nitrification was occurring shammas 1986 finally there was not a noticeable correlation between the pipe length and the total content in n however a positive significant correlation was found between pipe length and no3 n in contrast with the negative correlation found for nh4 n this may suggest that a nitrification process was occurring throughout the irrigation network which matches the information given by wang et al 2016 3 2 temporal analysis fig 3 a shows the results for the different n forms at the inlet and the outlet of the filtration system according to this graph no substantial differences between fsi and fso were detected except in may in this month there was a decrease of nt after the filtration treatment this reduction was mainly caused by an organic n drop in all other cases neither nt nor the n forms changed meaningfully no additional fertilizer was applied during the sampling days and therefore the irrigation water quality was only determined by the water source quality however changes in nt and the n forms can be observed over time during may june and july a higher nt concentration was found in these months n was mostly in ammonium form with a concentration around 30 higher than in the remaining months no3 n concentration had approximately the same value during all the season excluding october when it was nearly zero finally for the remaining n i e norg n its concentration was not steady throughout the season as mentioned before the chl a content is related to the phytoplanktonic biomass the highest values of chl a were obtained in august september and october which matched the lowest nt contents fig 3 b this confirmed that the absorption and utilization of phytoplankton in the storage reservoir was an important reason for nt reduction throughout the irrigation season this is consistent with previous results found by yu et al 2020 regarding the chl a trend over time it is important to highlight that phytoplankton growing is promoted by light and temperatures geider 1987 because of that a growing content was determined from may to september however during july when temperatures were highest the chl a concentration dropped to values of nearly zero it is important to highlight that in order to increase filtration system efficiency potassium permanganate was applied to the storage reservoir this treatment was complemented with the ultrasound treatment which according to numerous scientific studies has an important anti algae effect jachlewski et al 2013 joyce et al 2010 wu et al 2011 rm anova was calculated for the water quality parameters of the samples collected at the farms as a result p value was less than 0 05 for all the parameters analyzed in other words all the water quality variables measured at farm level changed significantly throughout the 2019 irrigation season fig 4 showed the mean and standard error of the different n form at the analyzed farms if both fig 3 a and fig 4 are compared it is observed that the nt remained steady from fso to the farms this implies that the total n content was mainly determined by the water quality source the nt concentration peaked in june amounting to 19 7 mg l 1 fig 3 a a 63 higher than in august when the lowest nt content was measured 7 1 mg l 1 the average nitrate concentration detected at farm level was around 3 4 mg l 1 except in june with a maximum average concentration of 6 8 mg l 1 and in october with a minimal of 0 6 mg l 1 fig 4 as for ammonium its concentration varied largely in the irrigation season this variation matched with the variation at fso highest concentration in may june and july medium content in october and nearly zero in august and september besides the parameter itself the proportion of each n form also changed over time fig 3 shows that during may june and october the majority of the n was in ammonium form in contrast to july and august when the no3 n and norg n proportions were higher however june was the only month in which the proportion was similar for the three n forms these results highlight the importance of a regular control when rw is used for irrigating olive trees the fertilization plan must be adjusted and modified depending on the water quality 3 3 spatial analysis total inorganic n nh4 n and no3 n arriving at the farms is shown in table 5 modifications in inorganic n across the tid network were also determined fig 5 a these modifications were calculated as the difference between concentrations arriving at the farms and concentrations at fso nitrate concentration increased across the irrigation network in contrast to the reduction observed in the ammoniacal forms these modifications are usually interrelated which confirms a nitrification process is occurring nitrification is a very complex process in which the nitrifying bacteria transform the ammonium ion into nitrate ion rittmann and mccarty 2001 rw generally has an elevated content of these bacteria which are highly susceptible to certain environmental factors specifically to ph do and t brion and billen 2000 shammas 1986 the modifications in these parameters during 2019 are also shown in fig 5 b c and d respectively in general table 5 shows that in may june july and october the reduced forms ammonium were in higher concentration than the oxidized ones nitrates only in august and september is this pattern reversed fig 5 a shows an uneven nitrification throughout the irrigation season for that reason the influential parameters were analyzed previously regarding ph fig 5 b shows that ph varied from 9 to 7 the optimal value for the nitrification process is 8 while ph values below 6 5 reduce the nitrification rate significantly shammas 1986 therefore ph values in tid were suitable for the nitrification process this reaction consumes alkalinity since it reduces the hco3 content and increases h2co3 which decreases the ph rittmann and mccarty 2001 this is consistent with the information observed in fig 5 a and b in which the ph decreased at farms where nh4 n transformation into no3 n occurred this ph reduction was around 1 as average from fso as for t the nitrification process can occur from 15 to 35 ºc with 30 ºc being the optimal temperature shammas 1986 fig 5 c shows that during july august and september water temperatures were higher around 26 5 ºc compared to may june or october when temperatures were 22 ºc on average there were no important modifications in t from fso and the farms finally considering do concentrations values below 4 mg l 1 indicates a slowdown of nitrification rate until less than 2 mg l 1 when this rate drops significantly espinosa rodríguez et al 2014 fig 5 d shows that at fso do concentration were above 4 mg l 1 in may june august and september in contrast with july and october when its value was about 4 which can compromise the nitrification process do arriving at the farms also decreased when nitrification occurred due to its use during this reaction therefore during may and june part of the nh4 n turned into no3 n from fso to the farms fig 5 a and table 5 information related to the farm distances are shown in table 1 in june this transformation was probably higher because of the higher temperature and do content than in may in both cases nitrification was higher in f5 which was further than f2 which may indicate the influence of distance and therefore the travel time of the water in the n form arriving at farms this matches the results found by wang et al 2020 who found a clear relationship between nitrification and pipes length during august and september the ammonium transformations to nitrate were more similar between the farms t do and ph were in appropriate ranges in t these months for the nitrifying bacteria however these were the months in which nt was lower and nitrification occurred until the entire nh4 n removal as shown in table 5 finally in july and october the nitrification process was irregular along the farms in both months do concentration at fso was significantly lower than in other months around 4 mg l 1 which compromised the oxidation reaction in october t was also lower which can also affect this reaction 3 4 implications of using rw for olive tree irrigation the n form arriving at the farm affects both the olive grove growth and the environment this work proved that important changes in both n form and total n content took place in tid during the 2019 irrigation season removal of n and nitrification were produced both temporally and spatially considering the irrigation schedule of tid and the results of the water quality analyses the total n applied was estimated at 19 6 kg ha 1 during the irrigation season according to fernández escobar et al 2012 who estimated the n extractions and inputs in olive grove that quantity was enough to cover olive n requirements this means that in this particular case no additional fertilizers would be needed however farmers applied additional fertilizers as their fertilization management is based on traditional methods and they do not consider the nutrients carried in water alcaide zaragoza et al 2019 this results in overfertilization which causes numerous negative effects reduction in yield oil quality and frost tolerance as well as water pollution problems fernández escobar et al 2009 2006 as for n distribution different authors affirmed that the more distributed the n applications the higher the n efficiency fernández escobar et al 2004 thanks to the nutrients going through rw the n application was continuous and distributed over time however the total quantity arriving at the farms was not steady this proved the importance of a periodic water quality control and of a real time fertilization dose adjustment to that quality the supply of n through rw must be considered when carrying out additional fertilization programs since if necessary they should supplement the n already dissolved in the water this could be a complex task for farmers on a day to day basis however thanks to advances in technology nowadays there are tools or apps for mobiles that can help farmers to do that in an easy way such as that developed by alcaide zaragoza et al 2020 considering n form this work also proved that pipe length and abiotic factors could influence the final form arriving at the farms fernández escobar et al 2004 affirmed that the olive tree growth was adequate regardless the n form used as long as the applied dose of fertilizer was correct however if n form did not change it could create some problems for example excessive application in the ammonium form could acidify the rhizosphere and cause ca mg or k absorption problems fernández escobar 2017 tsabarducas et al 2017 also found that an excess in ammonium use inhibited the photosynthetic ratio of olive trees on the other hand nitrate is easily used by the olive trees when the application dose is low but given in excess it can cause a drop in p fe mn and zn concentrations as well as leaching problems in fact no3 n is the main form of n leaching which is one of the major concerns facing sustainable agriculture n leaching is exacerbated by rain events however in this work the highest amount of nitrate reached the farms during the summer months when rain fall is less likely which entailed less nitrate leaching risk during the rainy season in any case the nitrate concentration did not exceed the harmful quantity to the environment spanish government 1996 influence of the farm distance in the arriving n form could be valuable guidance for managers in order to avoid leaching or other nutrient absorption problems in this particular case the changes produced in n temporally and spatially prevented the aforementioned problems related to the constant n form finally the nitrification process also entailed modifications in some other water quality parameters which could influence the olive irrigation particularly ph the water ph could influence the emergence of plugging problems in the irrigation system garcía zamorano et al 2004 established the chemical plugging risk as high when ph was higher than 8 then in those farms in which nitrification occurred the plugging risk was reduced without the need to apply additional products 4 conclusions a spatial and temporal analysis of n content and form in reclaimed water used for olive tree irrigation was carried out this study proved that due to the characteristics of the rw changes in n were produced both over time and across the irrigation water distribution network the temporal changes were strongly linked to the content in chl a which was not related to the distribution network but to the storage reservoir the concentration of algal biomass in the water was one of the regulatory factors of the total content of n arriving at the farms spatially a clear nitrification occurred from the pumping station to the farms this reaction was determined by the ph t and do values of the water in the pumping station in most cases part or the totality of the ammonium was converted into nitrate this study confirmed that due to the quantity of n found in the rw olive tree requirements were covered the temporal and spatial changes of n form allowed for the avoidance of problems related to the same n form in olives trees in addition these changes demonstrate the importance of a continuous water quality control to adjust the fertilization plan to the n content in

9712,fertigation management of olive grove is highly complex especially when reclaimed water is used for irrigation nitrogen n is the main nutrient component of olive trees which traditionally has led to an excessive use in fertilization programs this problem can be exacerbated if reclaimed water is used since it already contains n for this reason water quality must be considered in the fertilization plan both total content and n form arriving to the trees have implications in olive tree nutrient requirements as well as the environment if reclaimed water particularities and the length of the pipes of water distribution networks are considered the form and total concentration of n can change over space and time in this work both spatial and temporal analysis of the n content and form in a water distribution network using reclaimed water for irrigating olive trees was performed this study proved that changes in n were evident both over time and across the irrigation water distribution network seasonally n content was reduced during the summer period spatially a clear nitrification occurred from the pumping station to the farms these variations demonstrate the importance of a continuous water quality control in order to adjust the fertilization plan according to the n content in water keywords reclaimed water fertigation scheduling precision irrigation nitrogen changes water quality olive tree fertigation 1 introduction arid and semi arid areas such as mediterranean countries are already facing significant pressure on water resources in the context of climate change with the resulting increase in extreme weather events and with the predicted growth in food demand an exponential rise in that pressure is predicted bisselink et al 2018 the use of non conventional water sources such as wastewater and more specifically reclaimed water rw is one of the most sustainable alternatives to cope with water shortages and a key way to approach this problem iglesias and garrote 2015 maestre valero et al 2019b treated wastewater is water from any combination of domestic industrial or commercial sources that has been processed in a wastewater treatment plant to remove contaminants international organization for standardization 2018 however to make it appropriate for reuse an additional treatment is necessary then the former wastewater is called reclaimed or recycled water and it can be used for irrigation enhancing water bodies among other uses raschid sally and jayakody 2008 worldwide the countries that according to sato et al 2013 reuse treated water the most are the usa 6 4 hm3 day egypt 1 9 hm3 day syria 1 5 hm3 day spain 1 4 hm3 day israel 0 7 hm3 day and saudi arabia 0 4 hm3 day uses of rw vary largely even within the same country depending on the country s development climate main economic activities etc in general it is estimated that in developed countries and after secondary treatment the main destination of these waters is agricultural irrigation 33 followed by the irrigation of green areas 20 and industrial uses 8 prats rico 2016 in a context where the agricultural sector is responsible for 70 of water abstractions worldwide the use of treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation constitutes one of the basic strategies to manage imbalances between resource availability and demand this also contributes to the promotion of the circular economy by recovering nutrients from the rw and applying them to crops by means of fertigation techniques thus water reuse could potentially reduce the need for supplemental applications of conventional fertilizers due to increasing interest the application of this type of water to irrigate has already been evaluated by different authors some of them have focused their studies from a safety and environmental perspective chen et al 2013 kalavrouziotis et al 2012 lopez galvez et al 2014 others have paid more attention to the nutritional aspects maestre valero et al 2019a pereira et al 2011 there are also authors who have studied how rw could influence the development or quality of the crop lu et al 2016 all of them agree with the fact that rw used as an irrigation water resource if properly managed does not result in adverse impacts and is safe for human health and the environment at the same time it could lead to significant fertilizer savings since the application of additional fertilizers is reduced increasing the yield and quality of the crops additionally it may be essential for addressing both the water scarcity problem and irrigated agriculture sustainability enhancement olive trees the most iconic crop in the mediterranean basin have to adapt to the new political and institutional framework both at national and international level where a synergy between agricultural and environmental policies and the conservation of natural resources is taking place in this sense this crop represents a typical example of irrigation using rw resources and several authors have investigated its potential and effects for example ashrafi et al 2015 assessed the olive tree response in terms of growth photosynthesis rates and nutrient content they concluded that thanks to the higher nutrient concentrations plant development was improved erel et al 2019 conducted a long term study which demonstrated that olive nutrient requirements were covered using rw they found that the olive trees nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k needs were met by irrigating with rw and without the use of additional fertilizer thanks to these nutrients the rw irrigated trees also obtained higher fruit yields however they indicated that special attention must be paid to the soil which over the long term could suffer negative effects such as an increase in the ratio of sodium absorption salinity problems nevertheless were not found either in the soil or the olive trees pedrero et al 2020 conducted a review considering different water sources and qualities analyzing their benefits and limitations for olive tree irrigation they affirmed that in mediterranean countries and over a long period olive trees irrigated with rw are likely to improve their yield however they highlighted that although n contribution through rw could be essential to achieve this greater production it may also generate negative impacts on both olive yield and oil quality if given in excess in addition even though rw already contains n alcaide zaragoza et al 2019 confirmed that farmers keep applying significant fertilizer quantities without considering the negative environmental impacts and additional costs n is the main nutritional component of any crop and therefore of olive trees for this reason n has traditionally been the main mineral element used in olive fertilization plans however these plans are frequently based on farmer s experience which can lead to inappropriate n applications and in many cases over fertilization fernández escobar 2011 this can cause negative effects on crop health quality and also the environment fernández escobar et al 2006 due to this importance the n cycle and its implications in olive tree nutrition have been studied in the past for example fernández escobar et al 2012 estimated a n balance for olives determining that an olive orchard had lower n requirements than historically thought traditionally it was thought that annual n fertilizer applications were required for maintaining high yields this research proved that depending on different factors irrigation water quality rainwater inputs organic matter etc n applications may not be necessary the form in which n is applied is another important aspect to consider fertilizers can be in organic form inorganic form nh4 n or no3 n or as a combination of both organic and inorganic depending on the crop n is assimilated in one of its soluble forms i e inorganic forms in the case of the olive tree it is able to assimilate n in both nh4 n or no3 n however differences in olive nutrition and impacts on the environment under the application of different n forms have been found for instance tsabarducas et al 2017 found differences in growth and photosynthesis rates in olive trees depending on the n form applied fernández escobar et al 2004 also detected variations in n leaching depending on the n form used for fertilizing however all of them considered that the form of n arriving to the crop was the same as they were applying in other words none of them considered the influence of water quality parameters or the irrigation network characteristics on n form changes irrigation district distribution networks usually cover large areas which involve big pipe lengths sometimes particularly in areas devoted to one single crop fertilizers are applied in the pumping station and distributed along the irrigation district through the water distribution network consequently the travel time from the pump station to the plot hydrant is important particularly to the furthest farms this could entail unequal nutrient distribution to users this effect was confirmed by jimenez bello et al 2011 at irrigation district level they found considerable differences depending on the farm location but they focused their attention on the irrigation network and considered that all the fertilizers injected in the network were received at farm level without changes in the water quality and concentration of nutrients however due to the rw particularities some studies have proved that water quality changes inside the pipes for example yu et al 2020 studied the variability of the water quality parameters in river water replenished by rw they found modifications in both the total n content and its inorganic forms nh4 n or no3 n both wang et al 2016 2020 conducted experiments under controlled conditions in order to investigate the relationship between the rw quality parameters and pipe length they detected that pipe length had an important effect on the nitrification process however there are no studies that have assessed these effects on pressurized irrigation networks under real conditions n concentration in rw changes throughout the irrigation season and during the travel time within the irrigation network as a result of oxidation reduction reactions plot elevation differences pipe length etc the n form which arrives at the farm influences both crop nutrition and n leaching in this work a spatial temporal analysis of the n form changes in a water distribution network using rw for irrigation was carried out its implications in olive production and soil pollution were discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study the study was carried out in the tintín irrigation district tid located in montilla córdoba southern spain this region has a typical mediterranean climate with an average annual rainfall of 590 mm mostly during spring and autumn while they are almost negligible in summer the daily mean temperature is 16 9 ºc and the mean reference evapotranspiration et0 3 mm day however et0 ranges from 0 5 mm day during winter to 8 mm day in summer the water distributed for irrigation comes from the montilla wastewater treatment plant wwtp secondary treated wastewater by extended aeration and settled is diverted to the reclamation train initially composed by a settling reservoir subsequently the water is sent by communicating vessels to a larger reservoir for storage where two ultrasound treatment units are installed for microalgae reduction before its distribution the water by floating intake is sent to the filtration process composed of several automatic filter units 130 µm self cleaning by opening the ring pack fig 1 finally some disinfectant treatments are applied potassium permanganate kmno4 was applied in both settling and storage reservoirs and peracetic acid c2h4o3 in the irrigation network particularly 500 l of kmno4 were applied bimonthly and 900 l of c2h4o3 were applied at the end of june thus the water quality required for the irrigation of olive trees is achieved according to the spanish regulation for water reuse spain government 2007 the tid water distribution network irrigates 150 ha within the guadalquivir river basin where mainly olive is the cultivated crop the average plot size is 1 5 ha all the fields have the same irrigation system subsurface drip irrigation with 2 2 l h 1 pressure compensating drippers spaced at 1 m and installed at a depth of 30 cm the water allocation is 1500 m3 year 1 ha 1 the irrigation season usually lasts between five and seven months depending on the rainfall of the year irrigation events are scheduled at district level by the irrigation district s manager and all the fields are irrigated simultaneously the irrigation schedule consisted of applications four times a week for 8 h during the entire irrigation season irrigation was carried out every tuesday thursday saturday and sunday 2 2 sampling collection water quality analysis was carried out once a month during the 2019 irrigation season to assess the fluctuations in the n chemical forms throughout the year temporal scale they were measured before and after the filtration system filtration system inlet fsi and filtration system outlet fso well as in two tid farms f2 and f5 later the sample point number was extended in order to assess the spatial variability then six strategic points across the irrigation network f1 to f6 were selected to analyze the water quality they receive and the differences in the chemical forms of n spatial scale the farm points were selected according to their distance from the pumping station elevation and pressure criteria the characteristics of each sampling point are shown in table 1 differences between fsi and fso made it possible to determine if additional fertilizer was being applied on the sampling days as well as the changes of n forms in the farms with respect to the pumping station tid irrigation network and the selected points are shown in fig 2 in each sample the total n nt and different n forms were measured ammoniacal nitrogen nh4 n nitric nitrogen no3 n and the n total kjeldhal ntk organic n norg n was obtained as the difference between ntk and nh4 n some other water quality parameters were also selected to be analyzed since they could influence the oxidation reduction reactions and therefore the n form some particular bacteria are required for these reactions to take place which are highly susceptible to certain environmental factors specifically to dissolved oxygen do temperature t and ph brion and billen 2000 shammas 1986 all of them need to be at optimal values for the reaction to occur the chlorophyll a chl a content is another important parameter to analyze it is related to the microalgae biomass which could affect the n content because of the microalgae consumption of n kuenzler et al 1982 finally organic matter content can also affect the n form stein and klotz 2016 and for that reason the chemical oxygen demand cod and the biochemical oxygen demand bod5 were measured these parameters are indirect indicators of the organic matter content in the water the description and reference methods used for the analysis of the mentioned parameters in water samples are shown in table 2 2 3 data analysis means and standard errors were obtained for each data a pearson correlation was performed to assess the relationships of the water quality parameters then one way repeated measures analysis of variance rm anova was carried out for the temporal analysis this analysis is suitable for data in which the same variables are measured more than once davis 2002 rm anova must fulfill the sphericity condition which was analyzed using the maulchy test when the sphericity condition was not confirmed the greenhouse geisser correction was applied to be able to continue with the rm anova for spatial analysis the difference between the n concentration on the farms and the n concentration at fso was performed for each n form and each period all the analysis were performed in r programming language using rstudio as the integrated development environment ide for windows van der loo and de jonge 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality characterization results of the water quality parameters analyzed in the eight sampling points during the 2019 irrigation season in tid are shown in table 3 nt ranged from 21 8 mg l 1 to 3 3 mg l 1 which implied an important difference between some water samples this quantity of nt was similar to other rw used for olive tree irrigation bourazanis et al 2016 petousi et al 2015 segal et al 2011 on average the nh4 n concentration was higher than no3 n as for n in nitrite form this was not found during the experiment being the rest of the nt in organic form the value of the ph during the whole season was considered as slightly alkaline with an average value of 7 8 do and chl a also changed largely during the experiment these parameters can affect both the amount of nt and also its form cira et al 2016 espinosa rodríguez et al 2014 in the case of water temperature its variation may be caused by the fluctuation in the environment temperature the results of both cod and bod5 met the minimum quality requirements for water reuse established in the eu regulation the european parliament and the council of the european union 2020 which are 125 mg l o2 and 25 mg l o2 respectively table 4 shows the pearson correlation applied to the water quality parameters analyzed nt was positive correlated to both nh4 n and no3 n all the analyzed parameters except for do were significantly correlated to the n content or its form although no correlation was observed between either cod or bod5 and the total n content different correlations were found with the different chemical forms specifically both showed a significant positive correlation with norg n which is expected since these parameters are indicators of the organic matter in the water in addition a significant positive correlation between bod5 and no3 n was found as well as a significant negative correlation with nh4 n which may indicate that bod5 could be affecting nitrification chl a is used as an indicator of microalgae biomass desortová 1981 which could explain its negative correlation with n content due to the consumption of this nutrient by microalgae kuenzler et al 1982 both ph and t were also influential parameters for nt and nh4 n this may indicate that nitrification was occurring shammas 1986 finally there was not a noticeable correlation between the pipe length and the total content in n however a positive significant correlation was found between pipe length and no3 n in contrast with the negative correlation found for nh4 n this may suggest that a nitrification process was occurring throughout the irrigation network which matches the information given by wang et al 2016 3 2 temporal analysis fig 3 a shows the results for the different n forms at the inlet and the outlet of the filtration system according to this graph no substantial differences between fsi and fso were detected except in may in this month there was a decrease of nt after the filtration treatment this reduction was mainly caused by an organic n drop in all other cases neither nt nor the n forms changed meaningfully no additional fertilizer was applied during the sampling days and therefore the irrigation water quality was only determined by the water source quality however changes in nt and the n forms can be observed over time during may june and july a higher nt concentration was found in these months n was mostly in ammonium form with a concentration around 30 higher than in the remaining months no3 n concentration had approximately the same value during all the season excluding october when it was nearly zero finally for the remaining n i e norg n its concentration was not steady throughout the season as mentioned before the chl a content is related to the phytoplanktonic biomass the highest values of chl a were obtained in august september and october which matched the lowest nt contents fig 3 b this confirmed that the absorption and utilization of phytoplankton in the storage reservoir was an important reason for nt reduction throughout the irrigation season this is consistent with previous results found by yu et al 2020 regarding the chl a trend over time it is important to highlight that phytoplankton growing is promoted by light and temperatures geider 1987 because of that a growing content was determined from may to september however during july when temperatures were highest the chl a concentration dropped to values of nearly zero it is important to highlight that in order to increase filtration system efficiency potassium permanganate was applied to the storage reservoir this treatment was complemented with the ultrasound treatment which according to numerous scientific studies has an important anti algae effect jachlewski et al 2013 joyce et al 2010 wu et al 2011 rm anova was calculated for the water quality parameters of the samples collected at the farms as a result p value was less than 0 05 for all the parameters analyzed in other words all the water quality variables measured at farm level changed significantly throughout the 2019 irrigation season fig 4 showed the mean and standard error of the different n form at the analyzed farms if both fig 3 a and fig 4 are compared it is observed that the nt remained steady from fso to the farms this implies that the total n content was mainly determined by the water quality source the nt concentration peaked in june amounting to 19 7 mg l 1 fig 3 a a 63 higher than in august when the lowest nt content was measured 7 1 mg l 1 the average nitrate concentration detected at farm level was around 3 4 mg l 1 except in june with a maximum average concentration of 6 8 mg l 1 and in october with a minimal of 0 6 mg l 1 fig 4 as for ammonium its concentration varied largely in the irrigation season this variation matched with the variation at fso highest concentration in may june and july medium content in october and nearly zero in august and september besides the parameter itself the proportion of each n form also changed over time fig 3 shows that during may june and october the majority of the n was in ammonium form in contrast to july and august when the no3 n and norg n proportions were higher however june was the only month in which the proportion was similar for the three n forms these results highlight the importance of a regular control when rw is used for irrigating olive trees the fertilization plan must be adjusted and modified depending on the water quality 3 3 spatial analysis total inorganic n nh4 n and no3 n arriving at the farms is shown in table 5 modifications in inorganic n across the tid network were also determined fig 5 a these modifications were calculated as the difference between concentrations arriving at the farms and concentrations at fso nitrate concentration increased across the irrigation network in contrast to the reduction observed in the ammoniacal forms these modifications are usually interrelated which confirms a nitrification process is occurring nitrification is a very complex process in which the nitrifying bacteria transform the ammonium ion into nitrate ion rittmann and mccarty 2001 rw generally has an elevated content of these bacteria which are highly susceptible to certain environmental factors specifically to ph do and t brion and billen 2000 shammas 1986 the modifications in these parameters during 2019 are also shown in fig 5 b c and d respectively in general table 5 shows that in may june july and october the reduced forms ammonium were in higher concentration than the oxidized ones nitrates only in august and september is this pattern reversed fig 5 a shows an uneven nitrification throughout the irrigation season for that reason the influential parameters were analyzed previously regarding ph fig 5 b shows that ph varied from 9 to 7 the optimal value for the nitrification process is 8 while ph values below 6 5 reduce the nitrification rate significantly shammas 1986 therefore ph values in tid were suitable for the nitrification process this reaction consumes alkalinity since it reduces the hco3 content and increases h2co3 which decreases the ph rittmann and mccarty 2001 this is consistent with the information observed in fig 5 a and b in which the ph decreased at farms where nh4 n transformation into no3 n occurred this ph reduction was around 1 as average from fso as for t the nitrification process can occur from 15 to 35 ºc with 30 ºc being the optimal temperature shammas 1986 fig 5 c shows that during july august and september water temperatures were higher around 26 5 ºc compared to may june or october when temperatures were 22 ºc on average there were no important modifications in t from fso and the farms finally considering do concentrations values below 4 mg l 1 indicates a slowdown of nitrification rate until less than 2 mg l 1 when this rate drops significantly espinosa rodríguez et al 2014 fig 5 d shows that at fso do concentration were above 4 mg l 1 in may june august and september in contrast with july and october when its value was about 4 which can compromise the nitrification process do arriving at the farms also decreased when nitrification occurred due to its use during this reaction therefore during may and june part of the nh4 n turned into no3 n from fso to the farms fig 5 a and table 5 information related to the farm distances are shown in table 1 in june this transformation was probably higher because of the higher temperature and do content than in may in both cases nitrification was higher in f5 which was further than f2 which may indicate the influence of distance and therefore the travel time of the water in the n form arriving at farms this matches the results found by wang et al 2020 who found a clear relationship between nitrification and pipes length during august and september the ammonium transformations to nitrate were more similar between the farms t do and ph were in appropriate ranges in t these months for the nitrifying bacteria however these were the months in which nt was lower and nitrification occurred until the entire nh4 n removal as shown in table 5 finally in july and october the nitrification process was irregular along the farms in both months do concentration at fso was significantly lower than in other months around 4 mg l 1 which compromised the oxidation reaction in october t was also lower which can also affect this reaction 3 4 implications of using rw for olive tree irrigation the n form arriving at the farm affects both the olive grove growth and the environment this work proved that important changes in both n form and total n content took place in tid during the 2019 irrigation season removal of n and nitrification were produced both temporally and spatially considering the irrigation schedule of tid and the results of the water quality analyses the total n applied was estimated at 19 6 kg ha 1 during the irrigation season according to fernández escobar et al 2012 who estimated the n extractions and inputs in olive grove that quantity was enough to cover olive n requirements this means that in this particular case no additional fertilizers would be needed however farmers applied additional fertilizers as their fertilization management is based on traditional methods and they do not consider the nutrients carried in water alcaide zaragoza et al 2019 this results in overfertilization which causes numerous negative effects reduction in yield oil quality and frost tolerance as well as water pollution problems fernández escobar et al 2009 2006 as for n distribution different authors affirmed that the more distributed the n applications the higher the n efficiency fernández escobar et al 2004 thanks to the nutrients going through rw the n application was continuous and distributed over time however the total quantity arriving at the farms was not steady this proved the importance of a periodic water quality control and of a real time fertilization dose adjustment to that quality the supply of n through rw must be considered when carrying out additional fertilization programs since if necessary they should supplement the n already dissolved in the water this could be a complex task for farmers on a day to day basis however thanks to advances in technology nowadays there are tools or apps for mobiles that can help farmers to do that in an easy way such as that developed by alcaide zaragoza et al 2020 considering n form this work also proved that pipe length and abiotic factors could influence the final form arriving at the farms fernández escobar et al 2004 affirmed that the olive tree growth was adequate regardless the n form used as long as the applied dose of fertilizer was correct however if n form did not change it could create some problems for example excessive application in the ammonium form could acidify the rhizosphere and cause ca mg or k absorption problems fernández escobar 2017 tsabarducas et al 2017 also found that an excess in ammonium use inhibited the photosynthetic ratio of olive trees on the other hand nitrate is easily used by the olive trees when the application dose is low but given in excess it can cause a drop in p fe mn and zn concentrations as well as leaching problems in fact no3 n is the main form of n leaching which is one of the major concerns facing sustainable agriculture n leaching is exacerbated by rain events however in this work the highest amount of nitrate reached the farms during the summer months when rain fall is less likely which entailed less nitrate leaching risk during the rainy season in any case the nitrate concentration did not exceed the harmful quantity to the environment spanish government 1996 influence of the farm distance in the arriving n form could be valuable guidance for managers in order to avoid leaching or other nutrient absorption problems in this particular case the changes produced in n temporally and spatially prevented the aforementioned problems related to the constant n form finally the nitrification process also entailed modifications in some other water quality parameters which could influence the olive irrigation particularly ph the water ph could influence the emergence of plugging problems in the irrigation system garcía zamorano et al 2004 established the chemical plugging risk as high when ph was higher than 8 then in those farms in which nitrification occurred the plugging risk was reduced without the need to apply additional products 4 conclusions a spatial and temporal analysis of n content and form in reclaimed water used for olive tree irrigation was carried out this study proved that due to the characteristics of the rw changes in n were produced both over time and across the irrigation water distribution network the temporal changes were strongly linked to the content in chl a which was not related to the distribution

occurred from the pumping station to the farms this reaction was determined by the ph t and do values of the water in the pumping station in most cases part or the totality of the ammonium was converted into nitrate this study confirmed that due to the quantity of n found in the rw olive tree requirements were covered the temporal and spatial changes of n form allowed for the avoidance of problems related to the same n form in olives trees in addition these changes demonstrate the importance of a continuous water quality control to adjust the fertilization plan to the n content in

9713,the environmental impact of subsurface drainage and agricultural activities has been widely studied in the literature agricultural subsurface drainage modifies the hydrological behavior and accelerates the transfer of pollutants of agricultural origin into surface water during the drain flow period which is often limited to winter the main objective of this study is to present a modeling approach allowing an accurate modeling of subsurface drainage discharge and prediction of drain flow start times by integrating a new conceptual soil reservoir managing the water flow in the unsaturated zone to the sidra model a comparison of the model results with field measurements of drainage discharge at the la jaillière site france shows that such a model can efficiently simulate drainage discharge kge values 0 75 and predict with good accuracy the drain flow start time with a median value of 5 days and a standard deviation of 10 days the split simple test conducted for the model calibration and validation shows that the model is temporally robust a sensitivity analysis conducted using the sobol method on the five model parameters reveals that the drainage discharge simulation is mainly sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity parameters on the other hand the date delimiting drain flow start is sensitive to the soil reservoir parameters the model s ability to accurately predict the start of drain flow serves to avoid the application of farm inputs pesticides or fertilizers during this critical period in order to limit their transfer to surface waters keywords subsurface drainage modeling drain flow start tile drained field 1 introduction land improvements contribute to agricultural intensification which in turn leads to greater crop production from the same parcel among such improvements subsurface drainage sd is practiced to remove the temporary excess water from the root zone for purposes of better aeration higher temperatures and enhanced workability of the soil in humid regions in arid and semi arid regions the primary function of sd is to prevent irrigation induced waterlogging and soil salinization ritzema 2016 in europe sd is mainly devoted to preventing waterlogging in specific hydromorphic soils this practice is principally employed in northern europe on over 50 of arable land from the netherlands to finland

dusek and vogel 2014 gärdenäs et al 2006 gatel et al 2019 gerke et al 2013 mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 shokri and bardsley 2016 the hydraulic based approach merely considers the flow in a saturated zone and proposes a simplified equation derived from both the boussinesq equation 1904 and forchheimer s hypothesis guyon 1963 henine et al 2014 van schilfgaarde 1963 to calculate drainage discharge as a function of water table height at mid drain the hooghoudt drainage equation hooghoudt 1940 which relates steady state drainage discharge to the water table height at mid drain is the most widely used approach in sd modeling when the water table rises to the soil surface for relatively long periods drainage discharge is computed using the kirkham equation kirkham 1949 for ponded water the approach proposed by moriasi et al 2013 couples kirkham s simplified equations with the hooghoudt equation hooghoudt 1940 kirkham 1949 to examine long time series of subsurface drained experimental facilities this approach offers the advantage of simulating both small and peak flow discharges the kirkham and hooghoudt equations were integrated into the drainmod model skaggs 1980 the models macro jarvis and larsbo 2012 swap kroes et al 2008 and many others adopt different equations such as hooghoudt kirkham s and ernst equations or use seepage potential theory by considering the drain as a sink term to take into account subsurface drainage qi and qi 2016 youngs 1980 guyon 1963 and lesaffre and zimmer 1987 developed the sidra simulation of drainage model to simulate drainage discharge during the drainage season based on the numerical integration of boussinesq s equation between the drain and mid drain in relying on this same boussinesq equation stillman et al 2006 proposed another semi analytical equation to simulate drainage discharge these various simplified approaches have been incorporated into several distributed hydrological and gis based models for the purpose of integrating the sd function e g swat moriasi et al 2012 hype lindstrom et al 2010 and adapt gowda et al 2012 the models derived from the boussinesq equation are well adapted to simulate the hydrological behavior of sd including peak flow prediction lesaffre and zimmer 1988 however they become less suitable once the goal turns to predicting the environmental impact of agricultural sd it is necessary to take into account the hydrodynamic behavior of the unsaturated zone as well as the plant growth impact on water table recharge and hence on drainage discharge in this context a coupling of the behavior in both saturated and unsaturated zones within a simple hydraulic approach for sd behavior modeling would offer a better understanding of the underlying environmental impacts a coupled agronomic hydrological model namely stics sidra tournebize et al 2004 was developed to manage the saturated and unsaturated zones however this crop model requires numerous parameters only available in certain fields of experimental research this paper integrates a new conceptual soil reservoir module into the hydraulic based sidra model in order to predict both drainage discharge and drain flow starts the conceptual module simulates water transfer in the unsaturated zone and calculates the recharge of the perched water table which then serves as sidra input data to simplify the model as much as possible this conceptualization needs to be easily implemented and should improve both the prediction of drainage discharge and drain flow start every hydrological year the proposed model has been calibrated and validated using the dataset collected from two experimental drained plots located at the la jaillière site western france the model s performance evaluation criterion is based on a comparison between simulated and observed drainage discharge as well as on the drainage season start date a global sensitivity analysis has also been conducted to study the influence of input parameters on model performance 2 experimental set up 2 1 experimental study sites the la jaillière experimental site fig 1 is located in western france s loire atlantique department 47 27 n 0 57 w it has been managed by the arvalis institute french agricultural institute since 1987 the experiments and research work carried out here focus on several study objectives in particular to achieve satisfactory control over both water quality and quantity of the sd system several experiments have been ongoing since its inception thus providing a most valuable dataset covering nearly 30 years the climate in the study area is oceanic with a mean annual rainfall of 709 mm the mean annual temperature is approximately 11 c the mean potential evapotranspiration pet reaches 738 mm a year the period of water budget deficit begins in april and continues until the end of september subsequent to this period the excess net rainfall allows for a progressive saturation of the soil and the formation of a temporary perched water table at which point the drain flow starts the soil at the la jaillière site is a brown hydromorphic stagnic luvisol developed on a low permeability altered schist formation dairon et al 2017 the soil surface layer 30 cm deep consists of a sandy loam 16 22 clay while the underlying layer of variable thickness from 30 to 90 cm is richer in clay 30 clayey silty texture the depth of the altered schist formation is highly variable within the studied plots ranging from 0 6 to 1 2 m and represents a natural obstacle to water infiltration this impervious layer is responsible for temporary waterlogging through the formation of a perched water table for each experimental plot table 1 the water holding capacity see section 3 1 was estimated from the textural soil analysis at a 0 8 m soil profile by use of rawls linear regression equation rawls and brakensiek 1982 to prevent soil waterlogging and improve crop growth during winter an sd network was installed in the 1980 s table 1 each experimental drained plot has been equipped with an individual drainage network 10 m drain spacing installed at a depth of 0 8 1 m connected to a non perforated collector extending to the measurement chamber for each field the drainage discharge and surface runoff are collected and measured separately the surface runoff is collected using traps around each plot fig 1 the flow discharge is then measured hourly at each collector outlet using a v notch weir the water level upstream of the weir measured with an automatic pressure probe is proportional to the flow discharge meteorological data are available at two stations trajanov et al 2018 the former station from 1982 is located 1 4 km from the fields while the new one in operation since 2006 is located at the experimental site 2 2 observation data for purposes of model assessment the dataset collected for experimental plots t03 1 04 ha and t04 1 08 ha is used to validate sidra ru model these datasets comprise hourly subsurface drainage discharge from 1994 to 2010 and surface runoff from 1994 to 2004 since the meteorological data recorded at the study site contain many gaps we have used the rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet data from the safran meteorological reanalysis produced by the météo france agency vidal et al 2010 defined on 8 km 8 km grids at the national scale while these pet data can be considered as homogeneous on the 8 km 8 km safran grid the rainfall data should display more local variation which can exert a rather significant impact on modeling accuracy of the two studied plots one of the mitigation solutions of pesticides losses from subsurface drained fields is to increase the time interval of several days between their application and first drain flow brown and van beinum 2009 trajanov et al 2015 thus the sidra ru model needs to be efficient and capable of accurately predict drainage discharge and drain flow start this accuracy depends on the method or criterion used to set the drain flow start date at the beginning of the drainage season drain flow is often low and quick also several days may pass without any drain flow at all this specificity is difficult to reproduce with acceptable accuracy by the models to overcome the low flows that fail to indicate the actual start of the drainage season we have introduced herein a new method using two static thresholds conditions 1 the calculated cumulative drainage discharge must be greater than the initial threshold and 2 the additional cumulative drainage discharge within the 5 subsequent days must be greater than the second threshold based on the experimental dataset the first and second thresholds are set to 2 and 2 5 mm respectively from the drainage discharge measurement we defined the drain flow start dates for each season the yearly cumulative values of meteorological data drainage discharge and surface runoff plus the drain flow start dates used in this study are listed in table 2 table 2 shows that the yearly drainage discharge correlates with the yearly rainfall the pet shows a small inter annual variation with a mean value of 690 and a standard deviation of 40 mm in the wet period autumn and winters seasons the pet demand is generally satisfied and the excess of rainfall p pet causes drainage discharge qdrain and surface runoff assuming that deep infiltration under the drainage network is negligible during the drain flow period the average evapotranspiration aet computed as rainfall qdrain surface runoff accounts for 86 of pet however in the dry period the pet demand is poorly satisfied and there occurs neither drain flow nor surface runoff the yearly average aet accounts for 67 of pet the rainfall and drainage discharge dataset displays high hydrological variability with respect to both dry e g season 2004 05 and wet seasons e g 2000 01 analysis of table 2 suggests that the start of drainage season is highly variable from one season to another in average the drainage season starts in mid november however it can start early in september or very late in january the drainage season 2004 2005 started later in january 5 and presented a low cumulative drainage discharge of 10 mm drain flow often starts earlier on plot t03 than on t04 despite their similarity during the intense drainage season the low whc value for plot t03 table 1 allows filling the soil profile and generating a water table flow toward drains earlier on the this plot as compared to t04 from the data observed in table 2 surface runoff accounts for 12 and 10 of the total outflow of plots t04 and t03 respectively 3 model description drain flow occurs when the perched water table rises above the drains the sidra model simulates drainage discharge during the soil profile saturation period defined as the intensive drainage season ids by lesaffre and zimmer 1988 the new sidra ru model presented herein allows sidra to simulate sd discharges and hydrological behavior at the plot scale during a full hydrological year and extending for several subsequent years the proposed model has been based on three coupled modules fig 2 managing the flow paths in the soil surface in the unsaturated zone and in the water table temporally perched above the drains these three modules integrated into the current version of sidra ru are as follows 1 module 1 estimation of net infiltration from climatic data by integrating a more realistic evapotranspiration algorithm that takes into account the potential evapotranspiration rate pet and available soil water content in the soil reservoir s t the new value calculated during this step is referred to as corrected evapotranspiration or cet net infiltration is equal to rainfall p minus corrected evapotranspiration cet 2 module 2 management of water transfer in the unsaturated zone in order to calculate the net recharge into the drained water table based on the conceptual reservoir approach this module calculates net recharge as a function of the available soil water content in the soil reservoir s t relative to three distinct soil reservoir levels namely minimum smin intermediate sinter and maximum smax 3 module 3 simulation of the sd discharge q as a function of the mid drain water table height above drain h by applying the sidra model lesaffre and zimmer 1988 3 1 calculation of the corrected evapotranspiration to estimate net rainfall infiltration this module calculates a more realistic evapotranspiration value referred to here as corrected evapotranspiration cet this cet depends on the potential evapotranspiration pet the available soil water content in the soil profile and the type of vegetation hansen 1984 kristensen and jensen 1975 depending on the type of vegetation cet is transformed into the maximum evapotranspiration rate met by means of the crop coefficient β when the soil water content lies in the range of the extractable soil water esw the cet pet ratio is equal to β this value represents the share of the whc that allows plants to extract water from the soil without either water constraints or growth limitations hansen 1984 jacquart and choisnel 1995 soil whc represents the amount of water held by soil against gravity force that can be extracted either by evaporation or by root plant bordoloi et al 2019 under france s agro climatic conditions esw varies from 0 4 to 0 6 of whc as a function of root depth jacquart and choisnel 1995 in this study esw has been set equal to 0 6 of whc this value defines the lower limit of soil water content in the soil profile at which cet equals the maximum evapotranspiration rate met when the soil water content in the soil profile lies below esw less water is available for root extraction eq 1 proposes an exponential decrease of cet with water level in the soil reservoir s t to simplify the model parameterization and to take into account the non uniformity of the soil water content in the soil profile whc has been approximated at the intermediate soil reservoir level sinter of the conceptual soil reservoir model section 3 2 below the module computes cet l as follows 1 case 1 if s t 0 6 s inter cet met β pet case 2 if s t 0 6 s inter cet β pet exp 0 6 s inter s t s t case 3 if s t 0 cet 0 where s t l is the actual water level in the soil reservoir β is a correction coefficient that depends on the type of soil cover in this study β has been set equal to 1 3 2 management of water flow in the soil reservoir it has been assumed herein that throughout the hydrological season the soil water content only varies under the effects of rainfall evapotranspiration and drainage discharge modeling soil water movement in unsaturated zone to assess water table recharge should cover several complex processes milly 1988 nielsen et al 1986 šimůnek and bradford 2008 van genuchten and jury 1987 in the literature numerous models describing water flow in this zone are available and they use either physical based or conceptual approach in this study we present a conceptual calculation of the water table recharge downward water movement through homogenous soil profile is governed mainly by both gravity and matric pressure gradients ψ effects when the soil is dry the ψ gradients effect is dominating and when the soil is very wet gravity effect becomes dominant nimmo 2005 along the soil profile extending from the soil surface to the impervious layer under the drains the soil water content is not uniform and variable with respect to time zimmer and lesaffre 1989 indeed the soil profile can present at the same time dry condition near the soil surface and wet condition at the drain level thus instead of considering this spatial variation the soil reservoir model depicts the filling of the soil profile and calculates water table recharge as a function of three global thresholds see fig 2 i e 1 the minimum soil reservoir level smin represents the lower limit of the soil reservoir below which no water moves in the soil under the effects of either evaporation or root extraction herein set equal to zero this reflects the driest soil profile condition 2 the maximum soil reservoir level smax represents the upper limit at which the total net infiltration recharges the water table gravitationally in this case the soil water content lies close to the saturation condition throughout the soil profile the sd network reaction to a rainfall event is rapid mainly occurring during the high rainfall events that generate drainage discharge peaks this subsurface drainage period is referred to as intense drainage season ids 3 between smin and smax the reservoir model includes an intermediate threshold sinter when the soil reservoir lies between sinter and smax the soil water content can exhibit a saturation condition close to the drain while remaining unsaturated at the upper part of the soil profile in this case one portion of the infiltrated water contributes to the water table recharge and flows toward drains the other portion of the infiltrated water continues to fill the soil reservoir the distribution of net infiltration between water table recharge and soil reservoir filling was conducted by means of partition coefficient α thus the sinter defining the start of the drainage season is used as first soil reservoir parameter the soil water level difference between sinter and smax is referred to as the intense drainage season reservoir level sids as smax variations are dependent on that of sinter smax must be greater than sinter sids is used as second soil reservoir parameter the two parameters sinter and sids of the conceptual soil reservoir are difficult to estimate from a field measurement they are mainly determined through model calibration the model responsible for managing the behavior of the unsaturated zone is referred to as the water holding capacity whc concept or ru acronym for réserve utile in french consequently the reservoir model will be referred to hereafter as the ru model the conceptual reservoir ignores the deep infiltration flow given that such contributions are often negligible during the winter period in hydromorphic soils due to the presence of clayey layers underneath the drains which in this study are assumed to be impervious in the ru module water variations in the soil reservoir δs and water table recharge r t at time t both depend on the water level in the soil reservoir s t at time t 1 the ru module considers the time variable s t and r t as uniform between the drain and mid drain the calculation algorithm can then be expressed as follows 1 if s t lies between smin and sinter net infiltration increases or decreases the water level in the soil reservoir depending on its sign negative or positive hence s t s t 1 p cet the minimum soil reservoir level cannot decrease below zero during this stage the water table recharge equals zero 2 if s t lies between sinter and smax when net infiltration is positive the ru module splits this infiltration into two components via partition parameter α with the first part α recharging the water table and the second part 1 α continuing to fill the soil reservoir 2 s t s t 1 1 α p cet r t α p cet 1 if s t is equal to smax when net infiltration is positive the entire excess infiltration will recharge the water table otherwise when net infiltration is negative the net infiltration rate will be extracted from the soil reservoir 3 3 management of water table flow in this study the original sidra model is used to simulate water table flow toward drain the specificity of sd in france is that the drains overlay a clayey layer assumed herein as impervious sd flow only occurs when the perched water table rises above the drain as identified during the intense drainage season the sidra model is only able to simulate drainage discharge during this season the model does not consider unsaturated flow by assuming that the net infiltration calculated as rainfall minus evapotranspiration rate instantly reaches the water table bouarfa and zimmer 2000 lesaffre and zimmer 1988 zimmer et al 1995 water flow toward the drain is influenced by several parameters related to both the sd network geometry i e drain depth and drain spacing and soil hydrodynamic characteristics the sidra model semi analytically solves the boussinesq equation according to the following basic assumptions bouarfa and zimmer 2000 lesaffre and zimmer 1988 1 the perched water table is a free unconfined surface that overlays the impervious horizontal clayey layer within the saturated zone the subsurface flow is assumed to be horizontal in accordance with dupuit forchheimer guyon 1963 van schilfgaarde 1963 2 the boussinesq equation is based on the concept of drainable porosity de marsily 1986 zhang and zhang 1986 which serves to relate water table fluctuations to water table recharge this parameter is also approximated with a specific yield or specific storage value anderson and woessner 1992 rupp and selker 2005 in homogeneous soils based on these assumptions a combination of the continuity equation and darcy s law leads to the classical 1d nonlinear boussinesq equation 1904 3 μ h t x k sat h h x r t where ksat lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal direction h l the water table height above the drain µ the drainable porosity r t lt 1 the time dependent water table recharge t t the time and x l the horizontal position coordinate the boussinesq equation simulates drainage discharge and water table variations assuming that the water table shape remains constant or slightly variable during the steady state or tail recession stages guyon 1963 van schilfgaarde 1963 modeling of the transient state of a water table depends on the time step adopted from hourly to daily for a daily time step the boussinesq assumption of a constant water table shape is acceptable as demonstrated by tournebize et al 2004 this assumption allows for a pseudo separation of variables in both time and space the spatial integration of the water table shape between drain and mid drain using the factor concepts developed by guyon 1963 and youngs 1966 results in the following equation solely dependent on the time variable 4 μ c dh t dt k sat h² l² r t where c is defined as the second water table shape factor l l the half drain spacing and h l the water table elevation above the drain at mid drain the term j h k sat h² l² lt 1 represents an equivalent hooghoudt equation hooghoudt 1940 van der ploeg et al 1999 describing the steady state drainage discharge in assuming that the drain lies on the impervious horizontal layer further details of different steps establishing the model equations can be found in the publication by bouarfa and zimmer 2000 from darcy s law let s now add the influence of recharge as established by lesaffre and zimmer 1987 which yields the following equation to calculate drainage discharge 5 q t aj h 1 a r t where a is called the third water table shape factor the water table shape factors c and a are equal to 0 904 and 0 896 respectively as calculated by integrating ¼ of the ellipse curve corresponding to the water table shape between drain and mid drain bouarfa and zimmer 2000 eq 5 reveals that during the recharge stage drainage discharge q t is generated by i the water table recession based on the hooghoudt equation the a j h term and ii the direct contribution of net recharge the 1 a r t term in eq 5 the water table shape factor a enables the water table recession to contribute to drainage discharge by a factor of 86 9 to be subsequently completed with the direct recharge at 13 1 1 a of r t in this study surface runoff is calculated using a simplified approach several empirical models are available to calculate surface runoff such as the model by horton and green and ampt musy and higy 2004 however most of these models are based on parameters that lack physical meaning and can only be defined by model calibration the simplest empirical approach consists of assuming that surface runoff occurs when the soil reservoir reaches its maximum storage capacity dooge 1959 i e when the soil profile is totally saturated and the water table lies near the soil surface we thus assume that the generation of surface runoff is independent of the soil infiltration capacity in drained soils observations in drained fields do indeed show that the surface runoff rate is reduced compared to an undrained field and moreover account for roughly 10 of total outflow thus confirming the high infiltration capacity of drained soils augeard et al 2005 kao et al 1998 trajanov et al 2018 in the sidra ru model when the water table elevation h equals drain depth d the excess rainfall is converted into surface runoff 4 model evaluation the aim of this study is to validate the ability new sidra ru model to address the tasks of drainage discharge and drain flow start at the field scale based on the existing experimental observations we begin by assessing the model performance in order to simulate drainage discharge using the classical calibration and validation criterion kge gupta et al 2009 next we evaluate the model by predicting the drain flow start a criterion determining the drain flow start dates from both observed and simulated drainage discharge is presented we finish by conducting an analysis to assess the sensitivity of model parameters with respect to kge and the drain flow start criteria 4 1 model calibration and validation running sidra ru requires introducing input data rainfall and evapotranspiration as well as field characteristics the sd geometry data consist of the 0 8 m drain depth d and the 5 m half drain spacing l the correction coefficient for the cet calculation which depends on the type of soil cover β equals 1 the water partition parameter α is not considered for model calibration because its influence on model calibration using observed drainage discharge is negligible see sensitivity analysis results section 5 1 during the period when drainage season starts delimited by sinter and smax the ratio of drainage discharge to rainfall is typically low field observations have indeed shown that during this period the ratio equals approximately 1 3 favrot and lesaffre 1984 lesaffre 1988 lesaffre and morel 1986 the partition coefficient α is thus set theoretically at 1 3 the calibration model parameters are the two soil reservoir parameters sinter and sids and the two soil hydrodynamic parameters ksat and µ this modeling approach assumes uniform hydraulic properties within the soil profile thus leading to calibrate an average value of the parameters set for each plot a performance assessment of the model must acknowledge the fact that drainage discharge is highly variable during the drainage season to account for this seasonal variability the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 criterion eq 6 is used for model calibration and validation this kge criterion has the advantage of incorporating drainage discharge variability throughout the simulation period by combining the correlation bias and variability between simulated and observed drainage discharges 6 kge 1 r 1 2 ε 1 2 1 2 where δ denotes the ratio between the mean simulated and mean observed drainage discharges i e the bias r the linear correlation between observations and simulations and ε the measure of relative variability kge values range from to 1 the model performance is improved when the value of kge lies close 1 gupta et al 2009 the limited number of calibration parameters in sidra ru serves to limit the equifinality problem and the possibility of obtaining secondary optima coron et al 2017 the optimization algorithm is based on the drainage discharge results using the kge criterion as objective function of combined with airgr r package coron et al 2017 2021 first a grid screening algorithm explores the parameters space by systematic examination and extracts the most likely convergence zone second a steepest descent local search procedure seeks to improve the of by refining the previously obtained parameter set note that each parameter is independently calibrated without considering their possible correlations the sampling procedure is based on the probability distribution function pdf and the limits of the four calibration parameters table 3 1 ksat and µ follow a log normal distribution kosugi 1999 ren and santamarina 2018 rousseva et al 2017 schaap and van genuchten 2006 suleiman and t ritchie 2001 the pdf and the limits of hydraulic conductivity ksat and drainable porosity µ values in table 3 were established from 35 hydrodynamic measurements in different drained hydromorphic soils by means of guyon s pumping test lesaffre 1990 these experiments were carried out in the 1980 s as part of the measurement campaign initiated by the french ministry of agriculture that allowed establishing 70 referenced soil areas lagacherie 1987 2 the soil reservoir parameters sinter and sids follow a normal distribution similar to that used for maximum soil water content biswas 2019 brocca et al 2007 the model evaluation is performed using the split sample test klemeš 1986 by dividing the 16 seasons table 2 of daily drainage discharge measurements into two equivalent periods period p1 from 1994 to 2002 and period p2 from 2002 to 2010 for each period the model was run in turn for both calibration and validation of drainage discharge fig 3 shows the mean variations in yearly cumulative rainfall and drainage during these two periods on plots t03 and t04 note that period p1 is wetter than p2 with a higher variation in the yearly cumulative rainfall and drainage discharge fig 3 displays the various box widths it then becomes interesting to test the behavior of model calibration and validation during these two defined periods 4 2 assessment of drain flow start dates to assess model accuracy in predicting the drain flow start a criterion has been established in this study based on the mean of the absolute difference between observed and simulated drain flow start dates xdiff this criterion is calculated as follows 7 x diff mean abs date obs date sim where datesim and dateobs in julian days are the determined dates of drain flow start from the observed and simulated drainage discharge respectively using this dynamic threshold abs represent the absolute value the best date prediction occurs when xdiff lies near zero this criterion in calculating a mean value for the 8 drainage seasons for each period is sufficient to evaluate model performance in predicting the drain flow start it is not used however for model calibration 4 3 sensitivity analysis of the performance criteria the objective of the sensitivity analysis is to identify the model input parameters exerting the greatest influence on two performance criteria namely drainage discharge using kge criterion and the drain flow start criterion xdiff several sensitivity analysis methods are available to analyze model effectiveness iooss and lemaître 2015 saltelli 2008 in light of the low number of input parameters it is possible to perform a global sensitivity analysis gsa of sidra ru using the sobol method sobol 1993 based on the variance decomposition principle the purpose of this method is to allocate a fraction of the total variance in the evaluation criterion to each model parameter the main advantage of this method is its strong performance with nonlinearities that can be often problematic in hydrological modeling e g gatel et al 2019 muñoz carpena et al 2007 when considering a model with several parameters the sobol method allows quantifying their impact on the model response as well as their interactions regarding the evaluation criterion pianosi et al 2016 saltelli et al 2000 the total variance of the model output in this case the quality criteria of drainage discharge and xdiff is allocated to each parameter using two sensitivity indices the first order sensitivity index si and the total sensitivity index tsi the si index represents the direct impact of each parameter taken alone on total variability while tsi is defined as the sum of the impact of each parameter taken alone and in interaction with others on total variability several methods exist to define the si and tsi index values and no single one prevails over the others consequently it is recommended to use several methods to compute the sensitivity indices in order to assess the robustness of gsa in this study we tested three variance estimators from i saltelli 2002 named saltelli2002 ii jansen 1999 named jansen and iii martinez 2011 named martinez si has been computed based on the same estimators as tsi plus the roalhs estimator tissot and prieur 2015 named roalhs the sidra ru sensitivity analysis is focused on the following parameters soil hydraulic conductivity ksat drainable porosity μ intermediate reservoir level sinter the intense drainage season reservoir level sids and partition coefficient α the sobol sampling procedure is based on the probability distribution function pdf and the limits defined for all calibration parameters presented in table 3 and the partition coefficient α which follows a uniform distribution and ranging from 0 to 1 in practice input parameter was sampled in its respective pdf as defined in table 3 the sampling size was n 1000 and the total number of simulations for np 5 parameters was thus ntot np 2 n 5 2 1000 7000 bootstrap methods were then implemented to evaluate the uncertainty associated with each estimator considering the 95 confidence interval and 100 bootstrap replicates 5 results this section reports the results obtained by the sidra ru model in terms of optimal criterion performance the first subsection will discuss the sensitivity analysis results of the five model parameters ksat µ sinter sids and α with respect to the drainage discharge by mean of kge criterion and xdiff criteria the second subsection will provide the results obtained for the calibration and validation of four model parameters ksat µ sinter and sids using the daily drainage discharge in the kge criterion and analyze the results obtained for yearly cumulative of drainage discharge and surface runoff next the reliability of the model in predicting the drain flow start will be assessed using the xdiff criterion the assumption of approximating the soil whc by sinter section 3 1 will be assessed by comparing the sinter values and the measured whc for both plots t03 and t04 table 1 5 1 sensitivity analysis drainage discharge simulation t04 p1 table 4 section 5 2 has been used as a reference for the sensitivity analysis of the five sidra ru model input parameters ksat µ α sinter sids this analysis generated 20 first order indices si and 15 total order indices tsi per criterion using drainage discharge and xdiff fig 4 shows that the various methods used all present a similar hierarchy of input effects on each criterion with small deviations thereby confirming the reliability of the sensitivity analysis conducted as regards the drainage discharge hydraulic conductivity ksat is the parameter featuring the highest si index from 0 4 to 0 6 it explains nearly half of the total model variance with respect to this criterion drainable porosity µ reflects values of the si index around 0 2 the tsi index exhibits an identical trend its values for ksat are close to 0 8 and for µ close to 0 5 the last three parameters α sinter sids all display values for both the si and tsi indices of close to zero and have negligible influence on drainage discharge saltili2002 saltelli 2002 and martinez martinez 2011 estimators show a greater difference between si and tsi for ksat and µ hence highlighting strong interactions between them in contrast the tsi for α sinter and sids parameters lie close to zero thus indicating that taken alone or interacting with others these parameters exert no influence on drainage discharge in considering the very limited effect of parameters α sinter and sids it can be concluded that the interactions are essentially occurring between ksat and µ thus demonstrating that these two parameters are the only ones sensitive to the drainage discharge as regards the xdiff criterion sinter is the parameter with the highest si and tsi indices with values close to 0 8 for both hence the importance of this parameter in the model defining drain flow start the tsi and si index values for sids are nearly zero thus demonstrating that the xdiff criterion is insensitive to this parameter taken alone or in interaction with the other model parameters parameter α reflecting values of si index around 0 1 and tsi index around 0 18 has little impact on the model performance regarding the drains flow start the hydrodynamic soil parameters ksat and µ exert no influence on the xdiff criterion 5 2 model performance assessment the split sample test yields calibration and validation results in two parameter sets for each plot table 4 simulations using either period p1 or p2 for calibration are followed by the suffix p1 or p2 for plots t03 and t04 respectively the kge values obtained exceed 0 81 for calibration and 0 75 for validation thus indicating that model calibration can be considered good enough for hydrological modeling knoben et al 2019 however the calibrated parameters differ slightly depending on the selected calibration period this variability is mainly influenced by the hydrological variability of period p1 as compared with p2 fig 3 for the various calibration tests the resulting values of drainable porosity µ are identical while those of hydraulic conductivity ksat range from 0 54 to 0 73 m day this difference is more pronounced for the soil reservoir parameters note that the calibrated sinter values overestimate the measured whc calculated as water held by the soil between the drain and the soil surface see table 1 as the whc has been approximated by sinter see section 3 1 this result reveals that part of the soil below the drains can contribute to water storage before the start of the drain flow the graphical comparison between the measured and simulated drainage discharges of plot t04 using calibration period p1 simulation t04 p1 is illustrated in fig 5 the results obtained from plot t03 show the same variations as from plot t04 discussed herein the two graphs for the calibration and validation steps indicate that the simulated daily drainage discharge is in good agreement with observed values during both high and low drainage seasons fig 5 this simulation slightly underestimates the observed peak discharge and slightly overestimates the low and medium discharge values the model does not capture some of the observed peak flows such as those in july 2001 august 2003 and july 2009 and does not correctly simulate the drain flow start of some drainage seasons e g december 2001 these inaccuracies might be explained by the use of safran rainfall defined on an 8 km 8 km grid instead of that measured in the field as input data or else by drainage discharge measurement errors which are difficult to verify aside from these few simulation shortcomings the model faithfully reproduces the drainage discharge observations for simulation t04 p1 fig 6 shows the variations in yearly cumulative rainfall the measured and simulated drainage discharge and surface runoff mm season and the drainage flow start time differential days at the scale of a hydrological season except for a few wet years the simulated cumulative drainage discharge lies close to the observed values to within 10 the mean simulated drainage discharge of 250 mm season is in good agreement with the observed volume of 236 mm season table 2 the yearly simulation of surface runoff calculated by the model as excess rainfall is of the same order of magnitude as the available data observations from 1995 to 2004 the reliability of the sidra ru model in predicting drain flow start was also assessed using the xdiff criterion eq 7 the median values of xdiff are less than 8 days for both plots table 4 for simulation t04 p1 fig 6 shows that the model accurately simulates the drain flow start except for seasons 1994 95 and 1998 99 when the difference in simulated and observed drain flow start times was equal to 34 and 32 days respectively for the entire simulation period the model output a median xdiff value of 5 days with a standard deviation of 10 days these results demonstrate that model calibration based on the drainage discharge observation does not reduce the large discrepancies between drain flow start observation and simulation 6 discussion the main objective of integrating a soil reservoir module ru into the sidra model consists of simulating a continuous drainage discharge over several hydrological years as opposed to the original sidra model which is only applied during the intense drainage season and a priori qualified by users the sidra ru performance analysis has been based on optimizing the four model parameters ksat µ sinter sids to maximize calibration criterion kge based on drainage discharge the comparison between daily observation and simulation of drainage discharge proves to be satisfactory in most seasons examined simulations reveal good flow dynamics with kge values greater than 0 75 which are efficient in hydrological modeling knoben et al 2019 the peak flows have been correctly simulated yet some events have been slightly under or overestimated these small deviations might be related to the input data or the model s simplifying hypothesis e g neglecting deep infiltration and preferential flow pluer et al 2020 in terms of yearly cumulative drainage discharge and surface runoff these results show that the simulations lie very close to the observations as for the observations themselves table 2 the simulated surface runoff is less than 12 of total outflow the model evaluation demonstrates that for most drainage seasons the observed drain flow start times are predicted with good accuracy however large gaps can be noticed when predicting the drain flow start times for certain seasons the main cause may be related to the rainfall regime indeed continuous rainfall does in fact cause a progressive rewetting of the soil profile until formation of the perched water table any heavy rainfall on dry soil can generate preferential flow toward the drains before total saturation of the soil profile zimmer 1992 since this process is neglected in sidra ru the prediction of drain flow start time gets delayed despite such simulation differences the model is still capable of predicting drain flow start with a relatively acceptable standard deviation of 10 days thus the model can offer farmers and agricultural operators accurate critical period to avoid the application of pesticides and fertilizers other than changing or limiting their application to the autumn or winter period brown and van beinum 2009 lewan et al 2009 the sensitivity analysis of sidra ru parameters according to the sobol method indicates that model performance with respect to the drainage discharge using kge criterion solely depends on hydrodynamic parameters ksat and µ the soil reservoir parameter sinter which describes the threshold when the soil reservoir is capable of recharging the drained water table has negligible impact on model sensitivity as regards drainage discharge meanwhile model performance relative to the drain flow start as described by the xdiff criterion mainly depends on the parameter sinter in our modeling approach the soil hydrodynamic parameters ksat and µ governing the water table flow have zero impact on the determination of the drain flow start dates indeed the water table only starts to form when water storage in the soil reservoir lies above the sinter threshold in the ru module section 3 2 this module considers the unsaturated zone as a single reservoir system defined by its storage level parameters sinter and sids with instantaneous input net infiltration and output water table recharge thus the ru module does not take into account dynamic flow in the unsaturated zone e g niswonger et al 2006 nor any influence of the soil hydrodynamic parameters the sensitivity analysis has also shown that model parameter α has a negligible impact on the model performance regarding the drainage discharge thus confirming the assumption to set this parameter to 1 3 within the limit of the sidra ru model proposed in this study section 3 2 however this parameter has a little influence when defining the drain flow start in situ the soil hydrodynamic parameters ksat µ can be estimated using guyon s pumping test chossat 1995 guyon and lesaffre 1986 lesaffre 1990 however the field estimation of the soil reservoir parameters sinter and sids is difficult theoretically their values lie close to the measured whc of the soil profile which is available from farming professionals we would suggest determining these values by means of model calibration based on the drain discharge observations 7 conclusion this study has presented a modeling strategy based on the integration of a new module ru in order to manage the behavior of the sidra model s soil reservoir this novel concept allows calculating the recharge of the perched water table integration of the ru module makes it possible to simulate the flow of soil water through the drainage system this model is run with four parameters serving to control the behavior of both soil water storage and hydrodynamic flow of the perched water table both of which are determined by means of model calibration application of sidra ru at the la jaillière experimental site has revealed its efficiency in simulating drainage discharge during both wet and dry seasons simulation output is in good agreement with the observed daily drainage discharge and yearly cumulative volume in most of the seasons studied in addition the model correctly identifies the drain flow start i e accurate to within a median value of 5 days and a standard deviation of 10 days the sensitivity analysis conducted for five model parameters ksat µ α sinter sids indicates various dependencies on the performance criteria tested the calibration of drainage discharge is mainly sensitive to hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity whereas the determination of drain flow start time is sensitive to the soil reservoir parameter sinter to reduce simulation uncertainties it is recommended to calibrate sinter and sids independently of the ksat µ calibration using the observed drainage discharges the model s ability to predict drain flow start times with good accuracy allows preventing the transfer of agricultural pollutants into the water surface predicting the first drainage flows using 6 days weather forecasts allows farmers and agricultural operators to plan for the critical application timing and hence reduce the level of pesticide transfer moreover this new model simulates the drained yearly volume with a good level of approximation thus offering the potential for realistic estimations of the annual transfer of various pollutants of agricultural origin by means of sd systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9713,the environmental impact of subsurface drainage and agricultural activities has been widely studied in the literature agricultural subsurface drainage modifies the hydrological behavior and accelerates the transfer of pollutants of agricultural origin into surface water during the drain flow period which is often limited to winter the main objective of this study is to present a modeling approach allowing an accurate modeling of subsurface drainage discharge and prediction of drain flow start times by integrating a new conceptual soil reservoir managing the water flow in the unsaturated zone to the sidra model a comparison of the model results with field measurements of drainage discharge at the la jaillière site france shows that such a model can efficiently simulate drainage discharge kge values 0 75 and predict with good accuracy the drain flow start time with a median value of 5 days and a standard deviation of 10 days the split simple test conducted for the model calibration and validation shows that the model is temporally robust a sensitivity analysis conducted using the sobol method on the five model parameters reveals that the drainage discharge simulation is mainly sensitive to the hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity parameters on the other hand the date delimiting drain flow start is sensitive to the soil reservoir parameters the model s ability to accurately predict the start of drain flow serves to avoid the application of farm inputs pesticides or fertilizers during this critical period in order to limit their transfer to surface waters keywords subsurface drainage modeling drain flow start tile drained field 1 introduction land improvements contribute to agricultural intensification which in turn leads to greater crop production from the same parcel among such improvements subsurface drainage sd is practiced to remove the temporary excess water from the root zone for purposes of better aeration higher temperatures and enhanced workability of the soil in humid regions in arid and semi arid regions the primary function of sd is to prevent irrigation induced waterlogging and soil salinization ritzema 2016 in europe sd is mainly devoted to preventing waterlogging in specific hydromorphic soils this practice is principally employed in northern europe on over 50 of arable land from the netherlands to finland vs approximately 10 20 for other european countries in france out of the 27 million hectares of arable land more than 10 are subsurface drained agreste 2010 vincent 2020 subsurface drainage was established in france later than in other european countries i e during the 1980 s it was promoted by european and national level subsidies until 1992 when current water laws began limiting the extent of additional sd practices agricultural sd introduces significant modifications to the hydrological behavior and results in nutrient and fertilizer losses from farmland to surface water blann et al 2009 gramlich et al 2018 during the drainage period the application of mobile pesticides or fertilizers before a heavy rainfall increases their losses toward the sd outlet and the water surface boithias et al 2014 nolan et al 2008 the temporary functioning of sd systems mainly during the wet season allows adapting the timing of when to apply farm inputs to reduce losses e g increasing the interval between an application and the first drain flow of the drainage season brown and van beinum 2009 trajanov et al 2015 wilson et al 2020 an accurate prediction of this first drain flow is key to optimizing the timing of farm input application thereby decreasing the risk of their transfer toward the water surface jones et al 2000 lewan et al 2009 nolan et al 2008 trajanov et al 2015 willkommen et al 2019 the behavior of sd systems can be simulated by means of a physical or hydraulic approach the physical approach is based on the numerical resolution of a physical law such as the 3d richards equation several physically based models propose specific conditions for considering the presence of sd e g in hydrus soil cathy ddm and 2d dperm al jabri and youngs 2015 boivin et al 2006 dusek and vogel 2014 gärdenäs et al 2006 gatel et al 2019 gerke et al 2013 mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 shokri and bardsley 2016 the hydraulic based approach merely considers the flow in a saturated zone and proposes a simplified equation derived from both the boussinesq equation 1904 and forchheimer s hypothesis guyon 1963 henine et al 2014 van schilfgaarde 1963 to calculate drainage discharge as a function of water table height at mid drain the hooghoudt drainage equation hooghoudt 1940 which relates steady state drainage discharge to the water table height at mid drain is the most widely used approach in sd modeling when the water table rises to the soil surface for relatively long periods drainage discharge is computed using the kirkham equation kirkham 1949 for ponded water the approach proposed by moriasi et al 2013 couples kirkham s simplified equations with the hooghoudt equation hooghoudt 1940 kirkham 1949 to examine long time series of subsurface drained experimental facilities this approach offers the advantage of simulating both small and peak flow discharges the kirkham and hooghoudt equations were integrated into the drainmod model skaggs 1980 the models macro jarvis and larsbo 2012 swap kroes et al 2008 and many others adopt different equations such as hooghoudt kirkham s and ernst equations or use seepage potential theory by considering the drain as a sink term to take into account subsurface drainage qi and qi 2016 youngs 1980 guyon 1963 and lesaffre and zimmer 1987 developed the sidra simulation of drainage model to simulate drainage discharge during the drainage season based on the numerical integration of boussinesq s equation between the drain and mid drain in relying on this same boussinesq equation stillman et al 2006 proposed another semi analytical equation to simulate drainage discharge these various simplified approaches have been incorporated into several distributed hydrological and gis based models for the purpose of integrating the sd function e g swat moriasi et al 2012 hype lindstrom et al 2010 and adapt gowda et al 2012 the models derived from the boussinesq equation are well adapted to simulate the hydrological behavior of sd including peak flow prediction lesaffre and zimmer 1988 however they become less suitable once the goal turns to predicting the environmental impact of agricultural sd it is necessary to take into account the hydrodynamic behavior of the unsaturated zone as well as the plant growth impact on water table recharge and hence on drainage discharge in this context a coupling of the behavior in both saturated and unsaturated zones within a simple hydraulic approach for sd behavior modeling would offer a better understanding of the underlying environmental impacts a coupled agronomic hydrological model namely stics sidra tournebize et al 2004 was developed to manage the saturated and unsaturated zones however this crop model requires numerous parameters only available in certain fields of experimental research this paper integrates a new conceptual soil reservoir module into the hydraulic based sidra model in order to predict both drainage discharge and drain flow starts the conceptual module simulates water transfer in the unsaturated zone and calculates the recharge of the perched water table which then serves as sidra input data to simplify the model as much as possible this conceptualization needs to be easily implemented and should improve both the prediction of drainage discharge and drain flow start every hydrological year the proposed model has been calibrated and validated using the dataset collected from two experimental drained plots located at the la jaillière site western france the model s performance evaluation criterion is based on a comparison between simulated and observed drainage discharge as well as on the drainage season start date a global sensitivity analysis has also been conducted to study the influence of input parameters on model performance 2 experimental set up 2 1 experimental study sites the la jaillière experimental site fig 1 is located in western france s loire atlantique department 47 27 n 0 57 w it has been managed by the arvalis institute french agricultural institute since 1987 the experiments and research work carried out here focus on several study objectives in particular to achieve satisfactory control over both water quality and quantity of the sd system several experiments have been ongoing since its inception thus providing a most valuable dataset covering nearly 30 years the climate in the study area is oceanic with a mean annual rainfall of 709 mm the mean annual temperature is approximately 11 c the mean potential evapotranspiration pet reaches 738 mm a year the period of water budget deficit begins in april and continues until the end of september subsequent to this period the excess net rainfall allows for a progressive saturation of the soil and the formation of a temporary perched water table at which point the drain flow starts the soil at the la jaillière site is a brown hydromorphic stagnic luvisol developed on a low permeability altered schist formation dairon et al 2017 the soil surface layer 30 cm deep consists of a sandy loam 16 22 clay while the underlying layer of variable thickness from 30 to 90 cm is richer in clay 30 clayey silty texture the depth of the altered schist formation is highly variable within the studied plots ranging from 0 6 to 1 2 m and represents a natural obstacle to water infiltration this impervious layer is responsible for temporary waterlogging through the formation of a perched water table for each experimental plot table 1 the water holding capacity see section 3 1 was estimated from the textural soil analysis at a 0 8 m soil profile by use of rawls linear regression equation rawls and brakensiek 1982 to prevent soil waterlogging and improve crop growth during winter an sd network was installed in the 1980 s table 1 each experimental drained plot has been equipped with an individual drainage network 10 m drain spacing installed at a depth of 0 8 1 m connected to a non perforated collector extending to the measurement chamber for each field the drainage discharge and surface runoff are collected and measured separately the surface runoff is collected using traps around each plot fig 1 the flow discharge is then measured hourly at each collector outlet using a v notch weir the water level upstream of the weir measured with an automatic pressure probe is proportional to the flow discharge meteorological data are available at two stations trajanov et al 2018 the former station from 1982 is located 1 4 km from the fields while the new one in operation since 2006 is located at the experimental site 2 2 observation data for purposes of model assessment the dataset collected for experimental plots t03 1 04 ha and t04 1 08 ha is used to validate sidra ru model these datasets comprise hourly subsurface drainage discharge from 1994 to 2010 and surface runoff from 1994 to 2004 since the meteorological data recorded at the study site contain many gaps we have used the rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet data from the safran meteorological reanalysis produced by the météo france agency vidal et al 2010 defined on 8 km 8 km grids at the national scale while these pet data can be considered as homogeneous on the 8 km 8 km safran grid the rainfall data should display more local variation which can exert a rather significant impact on modeling accuracy of the two studied plots one of the mitigation solutions of pesticides losses from subsurface drained fields is to increase the time interval of several days between their application and first drain flow brown and van beinum 2009 trajanov et al 2015 thus the sidra ru model needs to be efficient and capable of accurately predict drainage discharge and drain flow start this accuracy depends on the method or criterion used to set the drain flow start date at the beginning of the drainage season drain flow is often low and quick also several days may pass without any drain flow at all this specificity is difficult to reproduce with acceptable accuracy by the models to overcome the low flows that fail to indicate the actual start of the drainage season we have introduced herein a new method using two static thresholds conditions 1 the calculated cumulative drainage discharge must be greater than the initial threshold and 2 the additional cumulative drainage discharge within the 5 subsequent days must be greater than the second threshold based on the experimental dataset the first and second thresholds are set to 2 and 2 5 mm respectively from the drainage discharge measurement we defined the drain flow start dates for each season the yearly cumulative values of meteorological data drainage discharge and surface runoff plus the drain flow start dates used in this study are listed in table 2 table 2 shows that the yearly drainage discharge correlates with the yearly rainfall the pet shows a small inter annual variation with a mean value of 690 and a standard deviation of 40 mm in the wet period autumn and winters seasons the pet demand is generally satisfied and the excess of rainfall p pet causes drainage discharge qdrain and surface runoff assuming that deep infiltration under the drainage network is negligible during the drain flow period the average evapotranspiration aet computed as rainfall qdrain surface runoff accounts for 86 of pet however in the dry period the pet demand is poorly satisfied and there occurs neither drain flow nor surface runoff the yearly average aet accounts for 67 of pet the rainfall and drainage discharge dataset displays high hydrological variability with respect to both dry e g season 2004 05 and wet seasons e g 2000 01 analysis of table 2 suggests that the start of drainage season is highly variable from one season to another in average the drainage season starts in mid november however it can start early in september or very late in january the drainage season 2004 2005 started later in january 5 and presented a low cumulative drainage discharge of 10 mm drain flow often starts earlier on plot t03 than on t04 despite their similarity during the intense drainage season the low whc value for plot t03 table 1 allows filling the soil profile and generating a water table flow toward drains earlier on the this plot as compared to t04 from the data observed in table 2 surface runoff accounts for 12 and 10 of the total outflow of plots t04 and t03 respectively 3 model description drain flow occurs when the perched water table rises above the drains the sidra model simulates drainage discharge during the soil profile saturation period defined as the intensive drainage season ids by lesaffre and zimmer 1988 the new sidra ru model presented herein allows sidra to simulate sd discharges and hydrological behavior at the plot scale during a full hydrological year and extending for several subsequent years the proposed model has been based on three coupled modules fig 2 managing the flow paths in the soil surface in the unsaturated zone and in the water table temporally perched above the drains these three modules integrated into the current version of sidra ru are as follows 1 module 1 estimation of net infiltration from climatic data by integrating a more realistic evapotranspiration algorithm that takes into account the potential evapotranspiration rate pet and available soil water content in the soil reservoir s t the new value calculated during this step is referred to as corrected evapotranspiration or cet net infiltration is equal to rainfall p minus corrected evapotranspiration cet 2 module 2 management of water transfer in the unsaturated zone in order to calculate the net recharge into the drained water table based on the conceptual reservoir approach this module calculates net recharge as a function of the available soil water content in the soil reservoir s t relative to three distinct soil reservoir levels namely minimum smin intermediate sinter and maximum smax 3 module 3 simulation of the sd discharge q as a function of the mid drain water table height above drain h by applying the sidra model lesaffre and zimmer 1988 3 1 calculation of the corrected evapotranspiration to estimate net rainfall infiltration this module calculates a more realistic evapotranspiration value referred to here as corrected evapotranspiration cet this cet depends on the potential evapotranspiration pet the available soil water content in the soil profile and the type of vegetation hansen 1984 kristensen and jensen 1975 depending on the type of vegetation cet is transformed into the maximum evapotranspiration rate met by means of the crop coefficient β when the soil water content lies in the range of the extractable soil water esw the cet pet ratio is equal to β this value represents the share of the whc that allows plants to extract water from the soil without either water constraints or growth limitations hansen 1984 jacquart and choisnel 1995 soil whc represents the amount of water held by soil against gravity force that can be extracted either by evaporation or by root plant bordoloi et al 2019 under france s agro climatic conditions esw varies from 0 4 to 0 6 of whc as a function of root depth jacquart and choisnel 1995 in this study esw has been set equal to 0 6 of whc this value defines the lower limit of soil water content in the soil profile at which cet equals the maximum evapotranspiration rate met when the soil water content in the soil profile lies below esw less water is available for root extraction eq 1 proposes an exponential decrease of cet with water level in the soil reservoir s t to simplify the model parameterization and to take into account the non uniformity of the soil water content in the soil profile whc has been approximated at the intermediate soil reservoir level sinter of the conceptual soil reservoir model section 3 2 below the module computes cet l as follows 1 case 1 if s t 0 6 s inter cet met β pet case 2 if s t 0 6 s inter cet β pet exp 0 6 s inter s t s t case 3 if s t 0 cet 0 where s t l is the actual water level in the soil reservoir β is a correction coefficient that depends on the type of soil cover in this study β has been set equal to 1 3 2 management of water flow in the soil reservoir it has been assumed herein that throughout the hydrological season the soil water content only varies under the effects of rainfall evapotranspiration and drainage discharge modeling soil water movement in unsaturated zone to assess water table recharge should cover several complex processes milly 1988 nielsen et al 1986 šimůnek and bradford 2008 van genuchten and jury 1987 in the literature numerous models describing water flow in this zone are available and they use either physical based or conceptual approach in this study we present a conceptual calculation of the water table recharge downward water movement through homogenous soil profile is governed mainly by both gravity and matric pressure gradients ψ effects when the soil is dry the ψ gradients effect is dominating and when the soil is very wet gravity effect becomes dominant nimmo 2005 along the soil profile extending from the soil surface to the impervious layer under the drains the soil water content is not uniform and variable with respect to time zimmer and lesaffre 1989 indeed the soil profile can present at the same time dry condition near the soil surface and wet condition at the drain level thus instead of considering this spatial variation the soil reservoir model depicts the filling of the soil profile and calculates water table recharge as a function of three global thresholds see fig 2 i e 1 the minimum soil reservoir level smin represents the lower limit of the soil reservoir below which no water moves in the soil under the effects of either evaporation or root extraction herein set equal to zero this reflects the driest soil profile condition 2 the maximum soil reservoir level smax represents the upper limit at which the total net infiltration recharges the water table gravitationally in this case the soil water content lies close to the saturation condition throughout the soil profile the sd network reaction to a rainfall event is rapid mainly occurring during the high rainfall events that generate drainage discharge peaks this subsurface drainage period is referred to as intense drainage season ids 3 between smin and smax the reservoir model includes an intermediate threshold sinter when the soil reservoir lies between sinter and smax the soil water content can exhibit a saturation condition close to the drain while remaining unsaturated at the upper part of the soil profile in this case one portion of the infiltrated water contributes to the water table recharge and flows toward drains the other portion of the infiltrated water continues to fill the soil reservoir the distribution of net infiltration between water table recharge and soil reservoir filling was conducted by means of partition coefficient α thus the sinter defining the start of the drainage season is used as first soil reservoir parameter the soil water level difference between sinter and smax is referred to as the intense drainage season reservoir level sids as smax variations are dependent on that of sinter smax must be greater than sinter sids is used as second soil reservoir parameter the two parameters sinter and sids of the conceptual soil reservoir are difficult to estimate from a field measurement they are mainly determined through model calibration the model responsible for managing the behavior of the unsaturated zone is referred to as the water holding capacity whc concept or ru acronym for réserve utile in french consequently the reservoir model will be referred to hereafter as the ru model the conceptual reservoir ignores the deep infiltration flow given that such contributions are often negligible during the winter period in hydromorphic soils due to the presence of clayey layers underneath the drains which in this study are assumed to be impervious in the ru module water variations in the soil reservoir δs and water table recharge r t at time t both depend on the water level in the soil reservoir s t at time t 1 the ru module considers the time variable s t and r t as uniform between the drain and mid drain the calculation algorithm can then be expressed as follows 1 if s t lies between smin and sinter net infiltration increases or decreases the water level in the soil reservoir depending on its sign negative or positive hence s t s t 1 p cet the minimum soil reservoir level cannot decrease below zero during this stage the water table recharge equals zero 2 if s t lies between sinter and smax when net infiltration is positive the ru module splits this infiltration into two components via partition parameter α with the first part α recharging the water table and the second part 1 α continuing to fill the soil reservoir 2 s t s t 1 1 α p cet r t α p cet 1 if s t is equal to smax when net infiltration is positive the entire excess infiltration will recharge the water table otherwise when net infiltration is negative the net infiltration rate will be extracted from the soil reservoir 3 3 management of water table flow in this study the original sidra model is used to simulate water table flow toward drain the specificity of sd in france is that the drains overlay a clayey layer assumed herein as impervious sd flow only occurs when the perched water table rises above the drain as identified during the intense drainage season the sidra model is only able to simulate drainage discharge during this season the model does not consider unsaturated flow by assuming that the net infiltration calculated as rainfall minus evapotranspiration rate instantly reaches the water table bouarfa and zimmer 2000 lesaffre and zimmer 1988 zimmer et al 1995 water flow toward the drain is influenced by several parameters related to both the sd network geometry i e drain depth and drain spacing and soil hydrodynamic characteristics the sidra model semi analytically solves the boussinesq equation according to the following basic assumptions bouarfa and zimmer 2000 lesaffre and zimmer 1988 1 the perched water table is a free unconfined surface that overlays the impervious horizontal clayey layer within the saturated zone the subsurface flow is assumed to be horizontal in accordance with dupuit forchheimer guyon 1963 van schilfgaarde 1963 2 the boussinesq equation is based on the concept of drainable porosity de marsily 1986 zhang and zhang 1986 which serves to relate water table fluctuations to water table recharge this parameter is also approximated with a specific yield or specific storage value anderson and woessner 1992 rupp and selker 2005 in homogeneous soils based on these assumptions a combination of the continuity equation and darcy s law leads to the classical 1d nonlinear boussinesq equation 1904 3 μ h t x k sat h h x r t where ksat lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal direction h l the water table height above the drain µ the drainable porosity r t lt 1 the time dependent water table recharge t t the time and x l the horizontal position coordinate the boussinesq equation simulates drainage discharge and water table variations assuming that the water table shape remains constant or slightly variable during the steady state or tail recession stages guyon 1963 van schilfgaarde 1963 modeling of the transient state of a water table depends on the time step adopted from hourly to daily for a daily time step the boussinesq assumption of a constant water table shape is acceptable as demonstrated by tournebize et al 2004 this assumption allows for a pseudo separation of variables in both time and space the spatial integration of the water table shape between drain and mid drain using the factor concepts developed by guyon 1963 and youngs 1966 results in the following equation solely dependent on the time variable 4 μ c dh t dt k sat h² l² r t where c is defined as the second water table shape factor l l the half drain spacing and h l the water table elevation above the drain at mid drain the term j h k sat h² l² lt 1 represents an equivalent hooghoudt equation hooghoudt 1940 van der ploeg et al 1999 describing the steady state drainage discharge in assuming that the drain lies on the impervious horizontal layer further details of different steps establishing the model equations can be found in the publication by bouarfa and zimmer 2000 from darcy s law let s now add the influence of recharge as established by lesaffre and zimmer 1987 which yields the following equation to calculate drainage discharge 5 q t aj h 1 a r t where a is called the third water table shape factor the water table shape factors c and a are equal to 0 904 and 0 896 respectively as calculated by integrating ¼ of the ellipse curve corresponding to the water table shape between drain and mid drain bouarfa and zimmer 2000 eq 5 reveals that during the recharge stage drainage discharge q t is generated by i the water table recession based on the hooghoudt equation the a j h term and ii the direct contribution of net recharge the 1 a r t term in eq 5 the water table shape factor a enables the water table recession to contribute to drainage discharge by a factor of 86 9 to be subsequently completed with the direct recharge at 13 1 1 a of r t in this study surface runoff is calculated using a simplified approach several empirical models are available to calculate surface runoff such as the model by horton and green and ampt musy and higy 2004 however most of these models are based on parameters that lack physical meaning and can only be defined by model calibration the simplest empirical approach consists of assuming that surface runoff occurs when the soil reservoir reaches its maximum storage capacity dooge 1959 i e when the soil profile is totally saturated and the water table lies near the soil surface we thus assume that the generation of surface runoff is independent of the soil infiltration capacity in drained soils observations in drained fields do indeed show that the surface runoff rate is reduced compared to an undrained field and moreover account for roughly 10 of total outflow thus confirming the high infiltration capacity of drained soils augeard et al 2005 kao et al 1998 trajanov et al 2018 in the sidra ru model when the water table elevation h equals drain depth d the excess rainfall is converted into surface runoff 4 model evaluation the aim of this study is to validate the ability new sidra ru model to address the tasks of drainage discharge and drain flow start at the field scale based on the existing experimental observations we begin by assessing the model performance in order to simulate drainage discharge using the classical calibration and validation criterion kge gupta et al 2009 next we evaluate the model by predicting the drain flow start a criterion determining the drain flow start dates from both observed and simulated drainage discharge is presented we finish by conducting an analysis to assess the sensitivity of model parameters with respect to kge and the drain flow start criteria 4 1 model calibration and validation running sidra ru requires introducing input data rainfall and evapotranspiration as well as field characteristics the sd geometry data consist of the 0 8 m drain depth d and the 5 m half drain spacing l the correction coefficient for the cet calculation which depends on the type of soil cover β equals 1 the water partition parameter α is not considered for model calibration because its influence on model calibration using observed drainage discharge is negligible see sensitivity analysis results section 5 1 during the period when drainage season starts delimited by sinter and smax the ratio of drainage discharge to rainfall is typically low field observations have indeed shown that during this period the ratio equals approximately 1 3 favrot and lesaffre 1984 lesaffre 1988 lesaffre and morel 1986 the partition coefficient α is thus set theoretically at 1 3 the calibration model parameters are the two soil reservoir parameters sinter and sids and the two soil hydrodynamic parameters ksat and µ this modeling approach assumes uniform hydraulic properties within the soil profile thus leading to calibrate an average value of the parameters set for each plot a performance assessment of the model must acknowledge the fact that drainage discharge is highly variable during the drainage season to account for this seasonal variability the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 criterion eq 6 is used for model calibration and validation this kge criterion has the advantage of incorporating drainage discharge variability throughout the simulation period by combining the correlation bias and variability between simulated and observed drainage discharges 6 kge 1 r 1 2 ε 1 2 1 2 where δ denotes the ratio between the mean simulated and mean observed drainage discharges i e the bias r the linear correlation between observations and simulations and ε the measure of relative variability kge values range from to 1 the model performance is improved when the value of kge lies close 1 gupta et al 2009 the limited number of calibration parameters in sidra ru serves to limit the equifinality problem and the possibility of obtaining secondary optima coron et al 2017 the optimization algorithm is based on the drainage discharge results using the kge criterion as objective function of combined with airgr r package coron et al 2017 2021 first a grid screening algorithm explores the parameters space by systematic examination and extracts the most likely convergence zone second a steepest descent local search procedure seeks to improve the of by refining the previously obtained parameter set note that each parameter is independently calibrated without considering their possible correlations the sampling procedure is based on the probability distribution function pdf and the limits of the four calibration parameters table 3 1 ksat and µ follow a log normal distribution kosugi 1999 ren and santamarina 2018 rousseva et al 2017 schaap and van genuchten 2006 suleiman and t ritchie 2001 the pdf and the limits of hydraulic conductivity ksat and drainable porosity µ values in table 3 were established from 35 hydrodynamic measurements in different drained hydromorphic soils by means of guyon s pumping test lesaffre 1990 these experiments were carried out in the 1980 s as part of the measurement campaign initiated by the french ministry of agriculture that allowed establishing 70 referenced soil areas lagacherie 1987 2 the soil reservoir parameters sinter and sids follow a normal distribution similar to that used for maximum soil water content biswas 2019 brocca et al 2007 the model evaluation is performed using the split sample test klemeš 1986 by dividing the 16 seasons table 2 of daily drainage discharge measurements into two equivalent periods period p1 from 1994 to 2002 and period p2 from 2002 to 2010 for each period the model was run in turn for both calibration and validation of drainage discharge fig 3 shows the mean variations in yearly cumulative rainfall and drainage during these two periods on plots t03 and t04 note that period p1 is wetter than p2 with a higher variation in the yearly cumulative rainfall and drainage discharge fig 3 displays the various box widths it then becomes interesting to test the behavior of model calibration and validation during these two defined periods 4 2 assessment of drain flow start dates to assess model accuracy in predicting the drain flow start a criterion has been established in this study based on the mean of the absolute difference between observed and simulated drain flow start dates xdiff this criterion is calculated as follows 7 x diff mean abs date obs date sim where datesim and dateobs in julian days are the determined dates of drain flow start from the observed and simulated drainage discharge respectively using this dynamic threshold abs represent the absolute value the best date prediction occurs when xdiff lies near zero this criterion in calculating a mean value for the 8 drainage seasons for each period is sufficient to evaluate model performance in predicting the drain flow start it is not used however for model calibration 4 3 sensitivity analysis of the performance criteria the objective of the sensitivity analysis is to identify the model input parameters exerting the greatest influence on two performance criteria namely drainage discharge using kge criterion and the drain flow start criterion xdiff several sensitivity analysis methods are available to analyze model effectiveness iooss and lemaître 2015 saltelli 2008 in light of the low number of input parameters it is possible to perform a global sensitivity analysis gsa of sidra ru using the sobol method sobol 1993 based on the variance decomposition principle the purpose of this method is to allocate a fraction of the total variance in the evaluation criterion to each model parameter the main advantage of this method is its strong performance with nonlinearities that can be often problematic in hydrological modeling e g gatel et al 2019 muñoz carpena et al 2007 when considering a model with several parameters the sobol method allows quantifying their impact on the model response as well as their interactions regarding the evaluation criterion pianosi et al 2016 saltelli et al 2000 the total variance of the model output in this case the quality criteria of drainage discharge and xdiff is allocated to each parameter using two sensitivity indices the first order sensitivity index si and the total sensitivity index tsi the si index represents the direct impact of each parameter taken alone on total variability while tsi is defined as the sum of the impact of each parameter taken alone and in interaction with others on total variability several methods exist to define the si and tsi index values and no single one prevails over the others consequently it is recommended to use several methods to compute the sensitivity indices in order to assess the robustness of gsa in this study we tested three variance estimators from i saltelli 2002 named saltelli2002 ii jansen 1999 named jansen and iii martinez 2011 named martinez si has been computed based on the same estimators as tsi plus the roalhs estimator tissot and prieur 2015 named roalhs the sidra ru sensitivity analysis is focused on the following parameters soil hydraulic conductivity ksat drainable porosity μ intermediate reservoir level sinter the intense drainage season reservoir level sids and partition coefficient α the sobol sampling procedure is based on the probability distribution function pdf and the limits defined for all calibration parameters presented in table 3 and the partition coefficient α which follows a uniform distribution and ranging from 0 to 1 in practice input parameter was sampled in its respective pdf as defined in table 3 the sampling size was n 1000 and the total number of simulations for np 5 parameters was thus ntot np 2 n 5 2 1000 7000 bootstrap methods were then implemented to evaluate the uncertainty associated with each estimator considering the 95 confidence interval and 100 bootstrap replicates 5 results this section reports the results obtained by the sidra ru model in terms of optimal criterion performance the first subsection will discuss the sensitivity analysis results of the five model parameters ksat µ sinter sids and α with respect to the drainage discharge by mean of kge criterion and xdiff criteria the second subsection will provide the results obtained for the calibration and validation of four model parameters ksat µ sinter and sids using the daily drainage discharge in the kge criterion and analyze the results obtained for yearly cumulative of drainage discharge and surface runoff next the reliability of the model in predicting the drain flow start will be assessed using the xdiff criterion the assumption of approximating the soil whc by sinter section 3 1 will be assessed by comparing the sinter values and the measured whc for both plots t03 and t04 table 1 5 1 sensitivity analysis drainage discharge simulation t04 p1 table 4 section 5 2 has been used as a reference for the sensitivity analysis of the five sidra ru model input parameters ksat µ α sinter sids this analysis generated 20 first order indices si and 15 total order indices tsi per criterion using drainage discharge and xdiff fig 4 shows that the various methods used all present a similar hierarchy of input effects on each criterion with small deviations thereby confirming the reliability of the sensitivity analysis conducted as regards the drainage discharge hydraulic conductivity ksat is the parameter featuring the highest si index from 0 4 to 0 6 it explains nearly half of the total model variance with respect to this criterion drainable porosity µ reflects values of the si index around 0 2 the tsi index exhibits an identical trend its values for ksat are close to 0 8 and for µ close to 0 5 the last three parameters α sinter sids all display values for both the si and tsi indices of close to zero and have negligible influence on drainage discharge saltili2002 saltelli 2002 and martinez martinez 2011 estimators show a greater difference between si and tsi for ksat and µ hence highlighting strong interactions between them in contrast the tsi for α sinter and sids parameters lie close to zero thus indicating that taken alone or interacting with others these parameters exert no influence on drainage discharge in considering the very limited effect of parameters α sinter and sids it can be concluded that the interactions are essentially occurring between ksat and µ thus demonstrating that these two parameters are the only ones sensitive to the drainage discharge as regards the xdiff criterion sinter is the parameter with the highest si and tsi indices with values close to 0 8 for both hence the importance of this parameter in the model defining drain flow start the tsi and si index values for sids are nearly zero thus demonstrating that the xdiff criterion is insensitive to this parameter taken alone or in interaction with the other model parameters parameter α reflecting values of si index around 0 1 and tsi index around 0 18 has little impact on the model performance regarding the drains flow start the hydrodynamic soil parameters ksat and µ exert no influence on the xdiff criterion 5 2 model performance assessment the split sample test yields calibration and validation results in two parameter sets for each plot table 4 simulations using either period p1 or p2 for calibration are followed by the suffix p1 or p2 for plots t03 and t04 respectively the kge values obtained exceed 0 81 for calibration and 0 75 for validation thus indicating that model calibration can be considered good enough for hydrological modeling knoben et al 2019 however the calibrated parameters differ slightly depending on the selected calibration period this variability is mainly influenced by the hydrological variability of period p1 as compared with p2 fig 3 for the various calibration tests the resulting values of drainable porosity µ are identical while those of hydraulic conductivity ksat range from 0 54 to 0 73 m day this difference is more pronounced for the soil reservoir parameters note that the calibrated sinter values overestimate the measured whc calculated as water held by the soil between the drain and the soil surface see table 1 as the whc has been approximated by sinter see section 3 1 this result reveals that part of the soil below the drains can contribute to water storage before the start of the drain flow the graphical comparison between the measured and simulated drainage discharges of plot t04 using calibration period p1 simulation t04 p1 is illustrated in fig 5 the results obtained from plot t03 show the same variations as from plot t04 discussed herein the two graphs for the calibration and validation steps indicate that the simulated daily drainage discharge is in good agreement with observed values during both high and low drainage seasons fig 5 this simulation slightly underestimates the observed peak discharge and slightly overestimates the low and medium discharge values the model does not capture some of the observed peak flows such as those in july 2001 august 2003 and july 2009 and does not correctly simulate the drain flow start of some drainage seasons e g december 2001 these inaccuracies might be explained by the use of safran rainfall defined on an 8 km 8 km grid instead of that measured in the field as input data or else by drainage discharge measurement errors which are difficult to verify aside from these few simulation shortcomings the model faithfully reproduces the drainage discharge observations for simulation t04 p1 fig 6 shows the variations in yearly cumulative rainfall the measured and simulated drainage discharge and surface runoff mm season and the drainage flow start time differential days at the scale of a hydrological season except for a few wet years the simulated cumulative drainage discharge lies close to the observed values to within 10 the mean simulated drainage discharge of 250 mm season is in good agreement with the observed volume of 236 mm season table 2 the yearly simulation of surface runoff calculated by the model as excess rainfall is of the same order of magnitude as the available data observations from 1995 to 2004 the reliability of the sidra ru model in predicting drain flow start was also assessed using the xdiff criterion eq 7 the median values of xdiff are less than 8 days for both plots table 4 for simulation t04 p1 fig 6 shows that the model accurately simulates the drain flow start except for seasons 1994 95 and 1998 99 when the difference in simulated and observed drain flow start times was equal to 34 and 32 days respectively for the entire simulation period the model output a median xdiff value of 5 days with a standard deviation of 10 days these results demonstrate that model calibration based on the drainage discharge observation does not reduce the large discrepancies between drain flow start observation and simulation 6 discussion the main objective of integrating a soil reservoir module ru into the sidra model consists of simulating a continuous drainage discharge over several hydrological years as opposed to the original sidra model which is only applied during the intense drainage season and a priori qualified by users the sidra ru performance analysis has been based on optimizing the four model parameters ksat µ sinter sids to maximize calibration criterion kge based on drainage discharge the comparison between daily observation and simulation of drainage discharge proves to be satisfactory in most seasons examined simulations reveal good flow dynamics with kge values greater than 0 75 which are efficient in hydrological modeling knoben et al 2019 the peak flows have been correctly simulated yet some events have been slightly under or overestimated these small deviations might be related to the input data or the model s simplifying hypothesis e g neglecting deep infiltration and preferential flow pluer et al 2020 in terms of yearly cumulative drainage discharge and surface runoff these results show that the simulations lie very close to the observations as for the observations themselves table 2 the simulated surface runoff is less than 12 of total outflow the model evaluation demonstrates that for most drainage seasons the observed drain flow start times are predicted with good accuracy however large gaps can be noticed when predicting the drain flow start times for certain seasons the main cause may be related to the rainfall regime indeed continuous rainfall does in fact cause a progressive rewetting of the soil profile until formation of the perched water table any heavy rainfall on dry soil can generate preferential flow toward the drains before total saturation of the soil profile zimmer 1992 since this process is neglected in sidra ru the prediction of drain flow start time gets delayed despite such simulation differences the model is still capable of predicting drain flow start with a relatively acceptable standard deviation of 10 days thus the model can offer farmers and agricultural operators accurate critical period to avoid the application of pesticides and fertilizers other than changing or limiting their application to the autumn or winter period brown and van beinum 2009 lewan et al 2009 the sensitivity analysis of sidra ru parameters according to the sobol method indicates that model performance with respect to the drainage discharge using kge criterion solely depends on hydrodynamic parameters ksat and µ the soil reservoir parameter sinter which describes the threshold when the soil reservoir is capable of recharging the drained water table has negligible impact on model sensitivity as regards drainage discharge meanwhile model performance relative to the drain flow start as described by the xdiff criterion mainly depends on the parameter sinter in our modeling approach the soil hydrodynamic parameters ksat and µ governing the water table flow have zero impact on the determination of the drain flow start dates indeed the water table only starts to form when water storage in the soil reservoir lies above the sinter threshold in the ru module section 3 2 this module considers the unsaturated zone as a single reservoir system defined by its storage level parameters sinter and sids with instantaneous input net infiltration and output water table recharge thus the ru module does not take into account dynamic flow in the unsaturated zone e g niswonger et al 2006 nor any influence of the soil hydrodynamic parameters the sensitivity analysis has also shown that model parameter α has a negligible impact on the model performance regarding the drainage discharge thus confirming the assumption to set this parameter to 1 3 within the limit of the sidra ru model proposed in this study section 3 2 however this parameter has a little influence when defining the drain flow start in situ the soil hydrodynamic parameters ksat µ can be estimated using guyon s pumping test chossat 1995 guyon and lesaffre 1986 lesaffre 1990 however the field estimation of the soil reservoir parameters sinter and sids is difficult theoretically their values lie close to the measured whc of the soil profile which is available from farming professionals we would suggest determining these values by means of model calibration based on the drain discharge observations 7 conclusion this study has presented a modeling strategy based on the integration of a new module ru in order to manage the behavior of the sidra model s soil reservoir this novel concept allows calculating the recharge of the perched water table integration of the ru module makes it possible to simulate the flow of soil water through the drainage system this model is run with four parameters serving to control the behavior of both soil water storage and hydrodynamic flow of the perched water table both of which are determined by means of model calibration application of sidra ru at the la jaillière experimental site has revealed its efficiency in simulating drainage discharge during both wet and dry seasons simulation output is in good agreement with the observed daily drainage discharge and yearly cumulative volume in most of the seasons studied in addition the model correctly identifies the drain flow start i e accurate to within a median value of 5 days and a standard deviation of 10 days the sensitivity analysis conducted for five model parameters ksat µ α sinter sids indicates various dependencies on the performance criteria tested the calibration of drainage discharge is mainly sensitive to hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity whereas the determination of drain flow start time is sensitive to the soil reservoir parameter sinter to reduce simulation uncertainties it is recommended to calibrate sinter and sids independently of the ksat µ calibration using the observed drainage discharges the model s ability to predict drain flow start times with good accuracy allows preventing the transfer of agricultural pollutants into the water surface predicting the first drainage flows using 6 days weather forecasts allows farmers and agricultural operators to plan for the critical application timing and hence reduce the level of pesticide transfer moreover this new model simulates the drained yearly volume with a good level of approximation thus offering the potential for realistic estimations of the annual transfer of various pollutants of agricultural origin by means of sd systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9714,management of water food energy nexus wefn is of great importance to achieve the sustainable development goals the development of wefn management strategies is challenged by extensive uncertainties in different system components also agricultural activities would contribute a large portion of the total ghg emissions in many countries which are affecting the promised carbon neutrality in future in this study an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming method was developed towards planning the water food energy nexus system under consideration of both uncertainties and greenhouse gases ghg emission an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming based water energy food nexus iffccp wefn model has been established under consideration of various restrictions and ghg emissions solutions of the planting areas for different crops in different periods have been generated these results imply that the corn cultivation would be prioritized to satisfy cereal demand due to its relatively lower ghg emission intensity but the residual resources after satisfying cereal demand would tend to be allocated to vegetable planting comparison has been conducted among the iffccp wefn model and wefn models based the inexact fuzzy chance constraint programming approach with and without ghg emissions the results indicate that the results from iffccp wefn model would achieve a highest unit benefit and lowest total ghg emissions the total ghg emissions can be 11 less at most than ghg emissions from the resulting crop structures of the other two comparable models consequently the developed iffccp wefn model can help decision makers identify the desirable planting structure for crops with a priority of low ghg emission rate the major contributions in this study include i the inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming method to deal with interval and fuzzy parameters reflect decision makers preferences and handle conflicts among contradictory objectives ii the iffccp wefn model to achieve a maximized unit benefit with respect ghg emissions keywords inexact fractional programming fuzzy chance constraint uncertainty water energy food nexus system decision making ghg emission 1 introduction consumptions of water energy and food are accelerating due to rapid socio economic development booming population and increasing living standard such an issue cannot only be deemed as a general problem of administration but also come into a large number of intricacies among water energy and food liu et al 2015 moreover water food and energy have been involved in the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs for 2030 to tackle global challenges united nations 2015 however water energy and food systems are highly correlated on the one hand irrigation is required for agricultural planting and at the same time the effluents from farming will lead to pollution issues for the water systems on the other hand energy is required to sustain food transport water treatment farming irrigation and water supply while water resources can ensure stabilized energy generation normal crops growth processing and food production liu et al 2015 shang et al 2018 consequently it is challenging to ensure water food and energy demands accompanied with the urbanization process due to the complicated interactions among water energy and food systems das et al 2015 yu et al 2018 the deterioration of one factor in one system may spread to other components and cause serious consequences the policy measure and security of water energy or food may break the fragile balance among the three resources through critical demand and supply mechanism keskinen et al 2016 owen et al 2018 thus integrated management strategies are desired for the water energy food nexus wefn in order to address the above issue wef has complex interactions in which the water energy and food systems are not only interdependent but also competitive among each other cai et al 2018 water and energy are the key factors for agricultural production whilst agriculture would produce basic food and raw materials to other sectors e g life manufacturing service and support mankind s survival and economic development fernández et al 2020 guan et al 2020 zuo et al 2021 nevertheless intensive contradiction among food demand and agricultural supply has been observed in many regions especially in water scare areas a recent report from fao stated that 70 of the world s freshwater resources are used for agricultural irrigation and even up to 95 in low income countries fao 2017 moreover the water depletion would significantly affect crop yield which has been experienced in many countries daher et al 2019 bhattarai et al 2021 in addition a number of studies have demonstrated the high dependence of agriculture production and energy supply e g arizpe et al 2011 ghisellini et al 2016 buko et al 2021 even through agriculture accounts for only a relatively small proportion of total final energy demand consequently energy supply would also play a key role in agriculture production especially for farm machinery and irrigation many research works were conducted to explore management strategies of water energy nexus wen water food nexus wfn and water energy food nexus wefn perrone et al 2011 yu et al 2019 for example tsolas et al 2018 and liu et al 2019 employed a graphical and systematic program with the purpose of identifying and eliminating surplus from consumption and production of wen system salmoral and yan 2018 used the theory of virtual water and embedded energy to explore water and energy allocations in the economic system nevertheless there are still some issues to be addressed to develop effective management strategies for the wefn system firstly extensive uncertainties may exist in the wefn system which are embedded in different system components and also present different formats such as fuzzy interval and random variables yu et al 2020a ji et al 2020a 2020b this leads to challenges to reflect those uncertainties in developing the management policies for wefn system recently a number of studies have been proposed deal with various uncertainties in the wefn system through inexact optimization techniques perrone et al 2011 georgiou et al 2018 tsolas et al 2018 liu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 interval mathematical programming imp stochastic programming sp and fuzzy programming fp are the three major approaches to reflect uncertainties in the wefn systems and each technique would have its unique feature and shortcomings in dealing with uncertainties for instance the stochastic programming sp approach can effectively tackle random variables quantified with probability distributions whilst a large number of samples are required to formulate those probability distributions and thus this method is not applicable when only limited data are available gholizadeh et al 2020 in comparison the fp methods are able to deal with ambiguity in knowledge or information and vagueness in decision makers aspirations and the imp methods can tackle uncertainties only having the lower and upper bounds which are useful when available data are insufficient li et al 2017 these approaches have been widely used for management issues related to water energy and food for instance lv et al 2018 proposed an interval fuzzy chance constraint programming method towards planning the energy water nexus system in hebei province china ma et al 2020 developed a multi preference based interval fuzzy credibility constrained programming mifcp approach for planning the regional scale water resources management system rwms of henan province zuo et al 2021 developed a scenario based type 2 fuzzy interval programming stfip approach for planning agricultural water energy and food wef as well as crop area management for the henan province nevertheless due to the complexities of the wefn system and also data availability those uncertain parameters in wefn may present in different formats e g fuzzy and interval and even subjective linguistic uncertainties preferences of decision makers consequently advanced inexact optimization methods are still desired to reflect complex uncertainties in a wefn system secondly a wefn system is associated with different sectors stakeholders such as energy water and agriculture and each sector may have their own prioritized concerns or objectives this may lead to contradictions among different decision makers some studies have been proposed to deal with those contradictory issues in management of the wefn system for instance yu et al 2020a developed a copula based interval two level programming citp method for optimizing energy water nexus system management for henan province in which the two level programming method was adopted to balance the goals and preferences among different decision making levels yu et al 2020c also developed multi level interval fuzzy credibility constrained programming mifcp method for planning the regional scale water energy food nexus wefn system in which a multi level programming was used to handle conflicts and hierarchical relationships among multiple decision departments zhang et al 2020 advanced a multi level multi objective stochastic approach to deal with main conflicting objectives of each decision making level in water allocation in an arid agricultural region the studies on dealing with contradictory goals in wefn are still limited and more studies may be desired to explore the trade offs among those conflicting concerns from different decision makers moreover carbon neutrality is becoming one of the most critical issues all over the world to mitigate the climate change effect agricultural activities and related farming operations constitute a large portion of the total ghg emissions in many countries in which the main agricultural ghg emissions ch4 and n2o account for 10 12 of anthropogenic emissions globally robertson et al 2000 smith et al 2008 yang et al 2014 in china the agricultural carbon emissions have been accounted for 16 17 of the total carbon emissions making up 50 and 92 of the ch4 and n2o emissions consequently wefn management also needs to consider both direct and indirect greenhouse gas ghg emissions in relevant activities therefore it is desired to formulate effective strategies for water energy and food management to coordinate rapid development of various relevant departments in a sustainable pathway under various uncertain conditions martinez et al 2018 wang et al 2018 therefore this paper aims to propose an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming iffccp method through coordinating interval programming ip fuzzy chance constraint programming fccp and fractional programming fp into one framework the developed inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming method integrates the unique contribution of each individual technique in which the ip would be adopted to deal with uncertain parameters presented in interval numbers fccp is employed to tackle fuzzy variables and also reflect preferences from decision makers and the fp would be employed to reflect conflicting objectives of the studied problem moreover an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming based water energy food nexus ifccp wefn model is developed for planning the water energy food nexus system for the city of jinan in which both the system benefit and the ghg emissions are to be considered subject to restrictions related to food requirements water availability energy supply and other environmental protection constraints there are different modelling formulations for wefn planning such as land use optimization e g zuo et al 2021 resource technology network optimization e g bieber et al 2018 water and energy resources allocation e g li et al 2019 and so on in this study the iffccp wefn model would be developed for planning the crop cultivation areas under consideration of energy and water requirements as well as ghg emissions in addition both interval and fuzzy variables are employed to reflect extensive uncertainties existing in a wefn system in detail interval numbers are adopted for some economic parameters e g unit price for crops unit cost of fertilizer resources availability total cultivation areas availabilities for water resources energy consumption fertilizers and pesticides the interval parameters are used since their lower and upper bounds can be easily specified with only limited data and also help decision makers make trade offs between lower and upper bound conditions also some parameters such as local population food loss rate irrigation reliability are presented as triangular fuzzy numbers in order to explore their impacts on the resulting solutions for crop cultivation patterns particularly one major unique feature for this study is that the direct and indirect ghg emissions from wefn system would be considered in the iffccp wefn model those ghg emissions be used as the denominator in the objective function in order to generate maximized unit benefit with respect to ghg emissions for the wefn system the obtained solutions can help the local governor generate reliable planting schemes for different crops to achieve desirable system benefits and at the same time alleviate ghg emissions 2 overview of the study area as the capital city the city of jinan is located in the north western part of shandong province with the latitude ranging between 36001 and 37032 n and the longitude varying between 116011 and 117044 e after absorbing the city of laiwu jinan is now covering a terrain of 10244 km2 and having a population of 8 91 million the total gross domestic product gdp in 2019 is about rmb 944 34 billion with an increase rate of 7 0 ranked as the second largest city in shandong province jinan municipal bureau of statistics 2020 the mount tai is in the south of jinan and yellow river plain is located in the north part leading to higher land in the south than that in the north there are two major river systems namely the yellow river and xiaoqing river flowing across the city with other small rivers such as north south dasha river and yufuhe river etc jinan has the warm temperate continental climate with hot and rainy in summer and dry and rainless in other seasons the annual average temperature is 13 5 15 5 the frost free period all year round is about 230 days and the amount of precipitation is 600 900 mm as one of the major agricultural provinces shandong province is an important production area for a number of agricultural products such as wheat corn peanuts which accounts for 8 4 11 and 16 respectively for food vegetables and peanuts production in china in 2020 for the city of jinan the total output of grain was 2 855 million tons and the output of vegetables was 6 72 million tons in 2019 there are several crops sown in jinan but wheat corn and vegetables are the three major crops in 2019 the total sown areas for wheat corn and vegetables are 2 19 106 2 32 106 and 1 00 106 ha respectively making a respective contribution of 35 37 and 16 to the total sown area jinan municipal bureau of statistics 2020 even though there has been a prosperous growth for food and vegetable production in the city of jinan several issues need to be addressed to enhance the sustainability of the agriculture system in response to increasing food requirement environmental protection and also climate change a the amount of water resources for irrigation is abundant while its utilization efficiency is low and leads to serious waste of water for instance the total water demand in the city is about 1 542 109 m3 in 2017 in which water demands for agricultural industrial municipal and environmental sectors are respectively 8 67 108 1 99 108 2 85 108 and 1 93 108 m3 jinan municipal bureau of statistics 2018 for the water demand in agriculture about 6 54 108 of water were supplied for irrigation which made a contribution of 42 for the total water demand jinan municipal bureau of statistics 2018 b due to rapid urbanization and industrialization there has been a fierce competition for land use among municipal industrial and agricultural sectors the planting area of grain was 0 48 107 ha decreased by 1 0 in 2019 whilst the sown area of vegetables was 0 1 107 ha decreased by 2 2 jinan municipal bureau of statistics 2020 c there are growing electricity consumption in the city especially after 2019 while the city of laiwu was merged into jinan especially for industrial and household power consumptions for instance the industrial and household consumption for electricity respectively increased from 121 5 108 and 66 8 108 kwh to 221 5 108 and 77 6 108 kwh in 2019 nevertheless the electricity production only increased from 152 9 108 to 295 1 108 kwh which implied a remarkable power deficit and also serious competition for electricity consumption between agriculture and other sectors d in order to mitigate climate change china has promised to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 which indicates remarkable carbon reduction pressures for all socio economic sectors including agricultural production the greenhouse gas emission from agricultural production accounts for 16 17 of the total emission in china huang et al 2019 the agricultural greenhouse gas emissions are from various sources including both the direct and indirect emissions caused by utilization of fertilizers pesticides electricity and fossil fuels as one of the major provinces for agricultural production shandong province including the city of jinan are facing a noticeable pressure for reducing carbon emissions in agricultural production process due to the above issues the sustainability of the agricultural system is being challenged in terms of food production water availability energy electricity utilization and greenhouse gas emissions consequently it is desired to develop effective management strategies for the water energy food nexus at the city of jinan in order to achieve the coordination among planting agricultural planting environmental protection and carbon reduction to promote the sustainable development of agriculture 3 model development 3 1 modeling formulation for a real world water energy food nexus system there are multiple components and multiple uncertainties in association with different decision makers preferences there are many uncertain technical and economic parameters in the production and processing of agriculture besides the management of water energy food nexus system does not only consider the profit of the entire system but also balances the contradiction among agricultural water and energy resources managers according to different decision making priorities consequently a wefn model need to be established for planning the water energy food nexus system for the city of jinan china in which the agriculture activities i e crop cultivation crop processing food generation food transportation and available resources control i e fertilizer utilization pesticide utilization energy consumption for farming water consumption for irrigation are considered to achieve a desirable trade off between system benefit and greenhouse gas emissions moreover in order to reflect uncertain future in the planning horizon inexact parameters are to be included in the wefn model which are denoted as either interval or fuzzy numbers therefore the objective of the wefn model is to maximize unit benefits between agriculture profits and carbon emission the agriculture profits include revenue of crops and the cost used for the consumption of various resources e g water fertilizer electricity and seed in addition the labor cost has not been taken into account 1a max f f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 f 7 1

effertilizer v fat v efpesticide v pat v based on the current situation and future development strategy the wefn model would consider multifaceted and comprehensive constraints e g limited utilization amount of land and electricity which could be clearly seen as follows the constraints can help plan the agricultural development alleviate the contradictions among the development of socio economic environmental protection and other aspects at the city of jinan which will ultimately realize the sustainable development 1 land availability for cultivation the excessive exploitation of land for agriculture may lead to negative effects e g ecological environment deterioration and soil erosion which means cultivated area should be restricted also there has been significant competition for land use between agricultural cultivation and other sectors which lead to limited land availability for crop cultivation constraint 2a limited the minimum and maximum planting area of crops so as to avoid large fluctuations of the market price of agricultural products meanwhile the total planting area of crops should not exceed the available arable land in planning periods as shown in constraint 2b 2a

sufficiency rate for the study area 3 water availability constraint 4 indicates that the total consumption of water should not exceed the available amount for agriculture in study area furthermore this constraint can optimize the water use structure of crops under a certain amount of water resources coordinate the contradictions among water using departments and obtain higher economic benefits

where pme t is the total electricity availability for agricultural production b fossil consumption constraints here only the diesel is considered the plowing machines are required in the food production process which will consume diesel for their operation in general there are also certain limitations for fossil availability in different planning periods 5b v 1 vsat v uoct v pmot where uoc t v is the unit diesel consumption kg ha for crop v in period t and pmo t is the total diesel availability for agricultural production 5 as the major sources of agricultural pollution and greenhouse

t is respectively the total fertilizer and pesticide availability for agricultural production the proposed wefn model is established based on some recent studies e g yu et al 2020a ji et al 2020b zuo et al 2021 however there are some inherent assumptions in the establishment of the wefn model firstly the availabilities for some resources especially for water and energy are those can be allocated to agricultural production whilst those resources used by other sectors would be excluded this assumption would be validated in the availability predictions for these resources in which the relevant availabilities are projected through regression methods based on historical resources allocated to agricultural production secondly there are ghg emissions in food production process but also carbon sinks in crop cultivation through soil organic carbon storage and cover carbon sequestration studies have argued that the major crops production showed as carbon sinks in general e g she et al 2017 however in the developed wefn model the carbon sinks in crop planting are not considered this assumption would be accepted since without considering carbon sink the developed wefn model would generate crop cultivation structures with low ghg emission intensities finally product prices including crop products e g wheat corn vegetables and raw materials e g fertilizers energy would have complex relationship with their supply demand curves in this study those prices are simply projected through add an inflation rate based on historical product prices moreover certain fluctuation ranges are added to those projected prices in order the reflect the price volatility this is one of the main reasons to introduce uncertain parameters in the developed wefn model table 1 provides the definitions of the symbols used in the wefn model as well as their uncertainty formats the developed wefn model expressed as equations 1 6 is a nonlinear programming model since it has a fractional objective function here the fractional programming fp is introduced to deal with the benefit and ghg emission objectives in the wefn system since it is an effective tool to deal with optimization of ratio where the objective is quotient of system benefit and ghg emission the fp method can compare objectives of different aspects directly through their original magnitudes and provide an unprejudiced measure of system efficiency zhu et al 2014 it has been proved to be a natural way of approaching both economic and environmental criteria related to the systems sustainability zhu and huang 2011 in the real wefn system parameters may be affected by a series of factors e g limited data availability inaccuracy of statistical data subjective experience which would result in system errors and multiple uncertainties si et al 2019 for example during the entire planning horizon prices of agricultural products and costs of agricultural production conditions may ﬂuctuate under the inﬂuence of demand supply relationship and policies hoolohan et al 2019 in general the economic coefficients such as prices for crops costs for utilization of energy fertilizers and pesticides are uncertain in natures since they are closely related to the volatility of interest rates inflation rates and other factors i e energy price labor fee and operation condition yu et al 2020b in this study these parameters are denoted as interval variables due to limited data availability moreover the future resources availabilities for the wefn system such as water resources electricity availability fertilizer and pesticides availabilities are projected through regression methods based on historical data however these parameters would also be affected by a number of factors such as hydrometeorological conditions and would present uncertain features therefore some variation ranges are added to those forecasting results and thus lead to interval parameters in addition the prioritized objective for wefn system is to satisfy the food demand from local population and the food loss rate in production transportation and other processes are also quite crucial affecting the food availabilities to local people thus these two parameters are presented as fuzzy numbers also the fuzzy number would be used to express the uncertainty in irrigation reliability the purpose of using fuzzy numbers was to explore the impacts of changes in population food loss rates and irrigation reliabilities on the resulting crop cultivation patterns 3 2 solution method in order to reflect uncertain conditions in the future planning horizon uncertain parameter expressed either by interval or fuzzy numbers are introduced into the developed water energy food nexus wefn model expressed as equations 1 6 consequently an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming iffccp method will be developed to solve the proposed wefn model which will finally lead to an iffccp wefn model in this study the proposed iffccp approach integrates the inexact fractional programming and fuzzy chance constraint programming approaches to deal with contradictory objectives and also multiple uncertainties in the water energy food nexus planning practices consider a generic inexact fuzzy fractional programming with fractional objective function and uncertain parameters expressed as interval and fuzzy numbers as follows 7a max f j 1 n c j x j α j 1 n d j x j β subject to 7b j 1 naij xj bi i 1 2 l 7c j 1 nãijxj b i i l 1 m 7d xj 0 based on the interactive transform algorithm proposed by zhu et al 2014 an inexact fractional programming i e eqs 7a 7b and 7d can be converted into two conventional fractional programming submodels corresponding to the lower i e pessimistic and upper i e optimistic bound of the objectives however for the constraints with fuzzy parameters i e eq 7c a number of approaches have been proposed such as the α cut method e g ammar 2008 lexicographic criteria e g p é rez cañedo 2020 possibility and necessity measures inuiguchi and ramik 2000 xu et al 2011 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2016 xu et al 2014 in this study the measures of possibility and necessity will be adopted to deal with the constraints with fuzzy parameters the necessity and possibility constraints are introduced by dubois and prade 1987 which are considered to be very relevant to the real life decision problems maity 2011 these two measures have been used for many practical management problems with fuzzy uncertainties such as portfolio selection problem inuiguchi and ramik 2000 production inventory control problem maity and maiti 2007 and so on consequently based on the integration of the interactive transform algorithm and the measures of possibility and necessity the iffccp model can be transformed into two conventional fractional programming submodels corresponding to the low and upper bound of the objective the first submodel corresponding to the lower bound i e f of the objective which is formulated as follows i e submodel i 8a max f j 1 kcj xj j k 1 ncj xj α j 1 kdj xj j k 1 ndj xj β subject to 8b j 1 k aij sign aij xj j k 1 n aij sign aij xj bi i 1 2 l 8c nes j 1 kãijxj j k

the former k k n coefficients get their lower bounds for submodel i and upper bounds for submodel ii which are determined by the criteria proposed by zhu et al 2014 the later n k coefficients get their upper bounds and lower bounds respectively corresponding to submodel i and ii x jopt j 1 2 k and x jopt j k 1 n are the optimal solutions obtained from submodel i r i and t i stands for the numbers of a ij 0 associated with decision variables x j j 1 2 k and x j j k 1 n for constraint i nes in eq 8c is the measure of necessity for fuzzy numbers and pos in eq 9d indicates the measure of possibility for two fuzzy numbers consider two fuzzy numbers a and b with their membership functions being μ a x and μ b y for a confidence level α 0 1 we can have inuiguchi and ramik 2000 xu et al 2011 10a p o s a b sup min μ a x μ b y x y α a α b α 10b n e s a b inf max 1 μ a x 1 μ b y x y α a 1 α b α where a α inf x x μ a 1 α and a α sup x x μ a 1 α are the lower and upper bounds for the α cut of fuzzy number a and b α inf y y μ b 1 α and b α sup y y μ b 1 α are the lower and upper bounds for the α cut for fuzzy number b based on models 8 and 9 the final solutions for model 7 under any fuzzy confidence level α can be obtained as follows 11a f f opt f opt 11b x opt x jopt x jopt 3 3 data collection in this study three planning period will be considered with each one having one year i e 2022 2024 the parameters for the water energy food nexus system such as water availability unit outputs for different crops and their sown area limits unit consumptions for fertilizers pesticides electricity and fossils are collected from national provincial and local yearbooks shandong statistical bureau 2017 jinan municipal bureau of statistics 2017 2018 2019 national development and reform commission 2018 as well as relevant literatures hu et al 2016 2019 zhu et al 2017 ji et al 2020a 2020b ma et al 2020 ministry of agriculture and rural affairs mara 2020 the irrigation quotas for different crops are obtained from the local irrigation policy no db37 t 3772 2019 released by the water resources department of shandong province table 2 presents the variation intervals for relevant agricultural and economic parameters here the interval values are adopted to reflect uncertainties in those parameters table 3 presents the availabilities for water resources electricity fertilizers and pesticides the ghg emissions associated with food production are mainly generated from electricity for irrigation diesel for machinery fertilizer and pesticide utilization the emission coefficients for these sources are presented in table 4 here the emission coefficients for fertilizer utilization for different crops would be different duet to different combinations of nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizers for different crops the emission coefficients for pesticide utilization are also different because of different usages of herbicide pesticide and fungicide for different crops in addition to the uncertain parameters presented as intervals there are also some parameters estimated as fuzzy numbers such as the irrigation reliability the loss rates for food and vegetables and also local population in the city of jinan there are several methods to express a fuzzy number the triangular fuzzy number is adopted to present the fuzzy uncertainty since the membership function for a fuzzy number is easily established this kind of fuzzy numbers has been wide used in a number of studies e g fan et al 2009 2012 ma et al 2020 the fuzzy parameters used in this study are presented in table 5 4 result analysis based on the constraints e g environmental protection and limited resource utilization and the objective of maximum unit benefit the planting areas of different crops as well as total co2 emission during the planning periods could be obtained by solving the inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming based water energy food nexus model particularly three α cut levels i e α 0 2 0 5 0 8 are chosen to deal with the fuzzy parameters in the developed model in order to reflect the preferences by the decision maker under each α cut level two submodels corresponding to the optimistic and pessimistic conditions are formulated based on the solution method presented in section 3 2 leading to six submodels in total each submodel is a conventional fractional programming model with deterministic parameter values in current study the cultivation areas for corn wheat and vegetables would be generated from the iffccp wefn model in three planning periods therefore the developed iffccp wefn as well as its corresponding submodels would have nine decision variables the generated submodels were solved through lingo 11 0 software packagewith a computational time less than 1 s and infeasibility tolerance less than 10 6 interval solutions are finally obtained under each α cut level to reflect the potential farming pattern in different planning periods table 6 clearly shows crops planting area and the corresponding variation trend during the planning periods under different preferences i e α cut levels from the decision maker which would further help the decision makers to formulate and implement scientific planning schemes it can be seen that the planting areas for different crops would vary in different planning periods due to the socioeconomic and environmental restrictions in detail the planting areas for corn and vegetables show a slightly increasing trend while in comparison the sown area for wheat tends to keep constant for instance the planting area for corn would be 1 784 105 ha in period 1 and 1 932 105 ha in period 3 under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 2 showing an increasing rate of 8 3 in comparison cultivation area for wheat would be 1 89 10 5 ha for all the planning periods which is the upper bound of the minimum planting limit the results imply that the corn seems to be prioritized between corn and wheat in the planting structure to satisfy the cereal demand from local population more specifically as the cereal demand increases in time periods 2 and 3 these demands would also be satisfied by corn and thus lead to an increasing trend for corn cultivation over the planning horizon in addition the cultivation area for vegetables would slightly increase from 0 956 1 204 105 ha in period 1 to 0 996 1 204 105 ha in period 3 under this fuzzy confidence level with an increasing rate of 4 2 for the lower bound the increasing trend for vegetable cultivation under the demanding pessimistic conditions i e lower bound may also be attributed to the increasing vegetable demand over the planning horizon moreover compared with the cultivation structures for corns and wheat there are certain fluctuations ranges for vegetable planting between demanding pessimistic and advantageous conditions e g 0 956 1 204 10 5 ha in period 1 the advantageous optimistic conditions generally correspond to more resource availabilities e g water resources electricity fertilizers etc but less food demand e g less population less food loss rate etc the fluctuation ranges for vegetable cultivation indicate that when more resources are available these resources tend to be utilized to increase sown areas for vegetables furthermore as the fuzzy confidence level changes the detailed sown areas for corn and vegetables would be changed whilst the variation pattern would not change significantly fig 2 presents the fluctuation of sown areas for the three crops in the planning horizon which shows the variation trends under both advantageous and demanding conditions under different fuzzy confidence levels in this study three fuzzy confidence levels are chosen to reflect the variations of the predefined triangular fuzzy parameters i e α 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 under each fuzzy confidence level the α cut method would be employed to convert the fuzzy numbers into corresponding interval numbers under this level these three levels are selected since they can generally reflect the variations of fuzzy parameters under low medium and high possibilities the α cut value of 0 2 indicates a low possibility for the corresponding parameter ranges i e the intervals of fuzzy numbers under α cut 0 2 but such ranges can cover most possible values for the fuzzy parameters in comparison the α cut value of 0 8 indicates a high possibility for the corresponding parameter ranges but such ranges may neglect some possible parameter values with low possibilities consequently through choosing these three fuzzy confidence levels the proposed iffccp wefn model would generate desired cultivation structures under different possibilities moreover based on the solutions under multiple fuzzy confidence levels the impacts of fuzzy parameters on the resulting solutions can be explored as stated in table 6 it can be concluded that the change of fuzzy confidence levels may not pose significant effects on the resulting solutions under advantageous conditions since there would be less food demand but sufficient resource availabilities under these conditions in comparison the fuzzy confidence level would have some visible impacts on the detail sown areas for corn and vegetables under the demanding pessimistic conditions the necessity measure would be adopted as presented in eq 11b fig 3 compared the local population and crop cultivation under different fuzzy confidence levels as the increase of fuzzy confidence level less population would be estimated i e p t 0 8 p t 0 2 leading to less food demand nevertheless more food loss rate may happen as the increase of fuzzy confidence level i e 1 η 1 0 8 l 1 η 1 0 2 l fig 3a and b present constant sown areas for corn and vegetables for all three fuzzy confidence levels at time period 1 this implies that the decreasing food demand with the increase of fuzzy confidence level would be balanced by the decreases of food loss rates thus the fuzzy confidence level would not have explicit impacts on crop cultivation in this planning period however in time periods 2 and 3 more food demands especially for cereal are expected per person as presented in table 2 therefore the decrease of local population as a result of increasing fuzzy confidence level would lead to more decrease of total food demand than that happened in period 1 which would not be balanced by the corresponding increases of food loss rates consequently the food demand in both periods 2 and 3 would generally decrease as the increase of fuzzy confidence levels this would lead to less sown area for corn as the fuzzy confidence level increases as presented in fig 3c and e besides the reduction of corn cultivation would generally lead some residues for arable land the remaining land would tend to be utilized for planting vegetables and thus lead to increasing sown areas for vegetables as presented in fig 3d and e such a conclusion is consistent with the changes of cultivation patterns under advantageous conditions where sufficient resources are available as stated in table 6 and fig 2 different sown areas would be expected for wheat corn and vegetables in different planning period under different fuzzy confidence levels these planting structures would also lead to different ghg emissions from utilization of electricity fossil fertilizers and pesticides fig 4 presents the percentages of the cultivation areas for the three crops as well as the associated ghg emission contributions in the planning horizon under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 2 the results indicate that the proportion for wheat cultivation shows a decreasing trend due to the increasing proportion for corn this can be attributed to the relatively high ghg emission rate from wheat for instance under the pessimistic conditions the wheat cultivation has a planting proportion of 40 8 but it would make a contribution of 42 1 to the total ghg emission in time period 1 in comparison the cultivation of corn would contribute 29 1 of ghg emission through a 38 5 planting proportion however it can be observed from fig 4 that the cultivation of vegetables seems to have higher co2 emission intensity than the other two crops which would contribute 20 7 to the total co2 emissions through a planting proportion of 28 9 in time period 1 for pessimistic conditions nevertheless the sown areas for the vegetables would still show an increasing trend especially under the demanding pessimistic condition as presented in table 6 and fig 2 this may be due to two possible reasons i the vegetables would generally have much higher unit production weight than corns and wheat which may lead to more profits ii both corn and wheat belong to cereals and thus they are interchangeable but the vegetables can hardly be replaced by cereals consequently a large proportion of the sown areas should be allocated to vegetables to meet the vegetable demands in the local area more importantly as presented in table 6 and fig 3 after satisfying the cereal demands from local population the residual resources e g arable land water resources electricity etc would be suggested to be used for vegetable cultivations figs 5 and 6 present the cultivation pattern for the three crops and the corresponding contributions of ghg emissions under the fuzzy confidence levels of 0 5 and 0 8 the results also reveal similar patterns for crop cultivation and ghg emissions with those under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 2 however the ghg emissions from corn cultivation would likely decrease as the increase of the fuzzy confidence level especially in time periods 2 and 3 this would be due to the decreasing sown areas for corn as presented in fig 3 in comparison the ghg emissions from vegetables would slightly increase at the same time for instance under the pessimistic condition the cultivation for corn and vegetables would respectively have proportions of 39 2 20 7 in time period 2 under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 5 and 39 0 20 9 under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 8 correspondingly the ghg emissions from corn and vegetables would respectively make contributions of 29 6 and 29 1 under the fuzzy confidence level of 0 5 and 29 4 and 29 2 under the fuzzy confidence level of 0 8 these results also demonstrate the priority of corn cultivation to meet the cereal demand in the city of jinan fig 7 presents both the unit benefits and total benefits obtained from the developed iffccp wefn model under different fuzzy confidence levels under the demanding conditions which corresponding to more food demands less resource availabilities and thus lower objective bounds an increasing trend would be observed as the increase of fuzzy confidence level for instance the unit benefit would range between 8 410 8 438 and 8 459 rmb kg co2 eq respectively under the fuzzy confidence level being 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 correspondingly the total benefits would be rmb 4 095 1010 rmb 4 103 1010 and rmb 4 109 1010 respectively this may be due to more sown areas for vegetables as presented in table 6 for the advantageous conditions corresponding to the upper bound of the objective an increasing trend would be still observed since after satisfying cereal demands the remaining resources tend to be allocated to vegetables nevertheless the total benefit as presented in fig 7b tends to slightly decrease from rmb 5 379 1010 under α 0 2 to rmb 5 373 1010 under α 0 8 this would be mainly because that under the advantageous conditions where the possibility measure is adopted the increase of fuzzy confidence level would also lead to increase for the lower bound of irrigation reliability i e õ α in constraint 4 such an increase would lead to decrease for the total sown areas for the three crops as presented in table 6 i e sown area for corn decreases while the sown areas for the other two crops keep constant consequently this would lead to a slight decrease in the total benefit under advantageous conditions 5 discussion the objective of the developed iffccp wefn model is to achieve a maximized unit benefit for the agriculture department with respect to the ghg emissions this is the reason to introduce a fractional objective function into the iffccp wefn model if the objective function is to maximize the total benefit of the water energy food nexus system this will lead to an inexact fuzzy chance constraint programming based water energy food nexus ifccp wefn model more specifically if the ghg emission target is not considered the objective function in equation 1 will be denoted as max f f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 which is denoted as ifccp case1 in the following analyses moreover the ghg emission can also be considered in the ifccp wefn model through introducing a carbon trading objective in which the function of f 7 can be revised as f 7 t 1 t ctp t tce t and the objective function in equation 1 will be denoted as max f f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 f 7 here ctp t denote the carbon trading price in time period t which was set as 48 60 51 1 65 4 and 54 5 71 3 rmb tonne for t 1 2 and 3 respectively such an ifccp wefn model is denoted as ifccp case2 in the following comparison analyses compared with the developed iffccp wefn model both ifccp case1 and ifccp case2 models can be converted into two conventional linear programming submodels under each fuzzy confidence level which were solve by lingo 11 0 software package in this study also the submodels generated from the two ifccp models would be solved with less computational time than those fractional submodels generated from the iffccp wefn model however due to the small model size for the studied wefn system all the submodels including linear programming and fractional programming submodels were solved by the lingo 11 0 software package within 1 s therefore there would be no computational burden in practical computation for the developed iffccp wefn model in addition since the fractional submodels would be generated from the iffccp wefn model only local optimal solutions would be obtained from lingo corresponding to both pessimistic and optimistic conditional in comparison the submodels for the ifccp wefn model both ifccp case1 and ifccp case2 models would generate global optimal solutions since these submodels are linear programming models fig 8 compares the low and upper bounds of the total benefits obtained through the iffccp and ifccp models the results indicate that the ifccp case1 model would generate the highest total benefits for both demanding pessimistic and advantageous optimistic conditions since the ghg emissions from wefn system is not considered for instance the total benefits would range between rmb 4 111 5 574 1010 under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 2 compared with the total benefit of rmb 4 095 5 379 1010 from iffccp wefn model which leads to an slightly increase rate of 0 4 for the lower bound and 3 6 for the upper bound in comparison when the ghg emission is also consider in the ifccp wefn model i e ifccp case2 the obtained total benefits would be lower than the benefit from iffccp wefn model under demanding conditions but higher for the advantageous conditions where sufficient resources are available for example the total benefit from the ifccp case2 model would be rmb 4 078 5 546 1010 under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 2 leading to a decreasing rate of 0 4 for the benefit from iffccp wefn model under demanding conditions but an increasing rate of 3 1 for the upper bound moreover the lower bounds of the total benefit from all three models would present an increasing trend as the increase in fuzzy confidence level implying the visible effect of the decision makers preferences on the desired crop planting structures nevertheless except the slightly decreasing trend for the upper bound objective from iffccp model the upper bound benefits for the two ifccp models would keep constant regardless of the changes in fuzzy confidence level this suggest that the decision preferences would not have explicit impact on the desired wefn management strategies under advantageous conditions fig 9 presents the comparison of the unit benefits with respect to ghg emissions from the ifccp wefn model and two ifccp wefn models since the ifccp case1 model did not consider the ghg emissions during the crop cultivation process it is straightforward that the unit benefit with respect to ghg emissions would generally lower than that obtained from the developed iffccp wefn model for instance the unit benefit generated from the ifccp case1 model would range within 8 401 10 398 rmb kg co2 eq under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 2 whilst the unit benefit from iffccp wefn model would vary within 8 410 11 204 rmb kg co2 eq a decreasing rate about 0 1 would be observed for the lower bound while the decreasing rate for the upper bound can increase to 7 2 the results indicate that the planting structure for crops without consideration of ghg emission may not be as efficient as the solution from iffccp wefn model in response to ghg mitigation especially when sufficient resources are available for crop planting it is noticeable that the introduction of carbon trading in the ifccp model i e ifccp case2 would not enhance the efficiency of ghg mitigation as presented in fig 9 the unit benefits from the ifccp case2 model are the same as the unit benefits obtained from ifccp case1 model for both demanding and advantageous conditions under all three fuzzy confidence levels these results may be due to two possible reasons i both the ifccp case1 and ifccp case2 models were developed to maximize the total system benefit and thus the unit benefit with respect to ghg emission was not considered ii the ghg trading price obtained from some open news report would be too low e g 0 07 rmb kg co2 eq for the highest price and such a price may not visibly affect the desired crop planting structure from the ifccp models this can be further demonstrated through comparing the total benefits from the two ifccp models the total cost for carbon trading i e the benefit from ifccp case1 model minus the benefit from ifccp case2 model would only have a proportion about 0 8 under demanding conditions and 0 5 under advantageous conditions in the total benefit fig 10 presents the total ghg emissions in different planning periods under different fuzzy confidence levels it indicates that the ghg emissions from the planting patterns obtained by the ifccp wefn models i e ifccp case1 and ifccp case2 are higher than those from the cultivation structure obtained by iffccp wefn model in all the planning periods under all the fuzzy confidence levels this is because that the iffccp model would maximize the unit benefit with respect to ghg emissions while the ifccp models only considered the total system benefits in addition the total ghg emissions under each fuzzy confidence level tend to decrease over the planning period for all the three wefn models this may be mainly because that the resources availabilities especially for fertilizers and pesticides would decrease due to more strict environmental restrictions these results demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the planting structure obtained from the ifccp wefn models for ghg emission control in this study the contradictory objectives between system benefits and ghg emissions for a wefn system were reflected through introducing the fractional programming method into the developed iffccp approach in order to achieve a maximum unit benefit with respect to ghg emissions however such contradiction issues in the wefn system would also be tackled through bi level or multi level programming methods as developed in jin et al 2018 yu et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 and other relevant studies nevertheless we argue that the developed iffccp approach would have some merit when compared with bi level or multi level methods in dealing with trade offs among contradictor objectives firstly the bi level or multi level methods would need to pre define the hierarchical structure for the upper level and lower level models for the same conflicting objectives e g system benefit and ghg emissions different hierarchical structures e g the upper level for system benefit or the upper level for ghg emissions would lead to significant discrepancies in the desired solutions in comparison the developed iffccp approach would reflect contradiction between system benefit and ghg emissions through maximizing the unit benefit with respect to ghg emission without pre specifying the priority among these two objectives moreover the bi level or multi level models would be solved through some complex interactive algorithms e g jin et al 2018 in which one model either the upper level or the lower level model would be solved firstly and the other one would then be solved for decision variables around their solutions from the first model within a pre defined tolerance jin et al 2018 this may lead to two possible issues i the tolerance was commonly determined subjectively by the decision makers or model developers in which different tolerance values would lead to different solutions ii since the second model would be solved around the solutions of the decision variables obtained from the first model this would also lead to local optimal solutions furthermore we admit that the bi level or multi level models may generate crop planting structures with relatively higher unit benefits than the ifccp models ifccp case1 and ifccp case2 however those models may hardly produce the crop planting structure with a higher unit benefit than the desired cultivation pattern generated by the developed ifccp wefn model based on the shortcomings for the bi level or multi level models discussed above 6 conclusions in this study an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming iffccp method has been developed to provide management strategies for the complex water energy food nexus wefn system an iffccp based water energy food nexus iffccp wefn model has been formulated for planning the wefn system for the city of jinan shandong province under consideration of both system benefits and ghg emissions solutions of the planting areas for different crops under different periods have been generated in order to achieve a maximized unit benefit with respect to the ghg emissions based on the iffccp wefn model results indicated that the increase of cereal demand over the planning horizon would be mainly satisfied by the corn cultivation while the cultivation area of wheat would maintain at it upper bound of minimum requirement to avoid noticeable fluctuation for wheat price this is due to the relatively lower ghg emission intensity from corn in which the proportion of ghg emissions from corn would approximately drop 10 points compared with its proportion in the crop cultivation areas in addition the sown area for vegetables under strict restrictions would also increase to meet the vegetable demand over the planning area however the sown area of vegetables would reach its upper bound under the advantageous conditions whilst the corn and wheat cultivation would not change even though more resources would be available under advantageous conditions this implies that after satisfying the cereal demand the residual resources e g water fertilizer energy etc would tend to be allocated to vegetable planting moreover preferences of decision makers on fuzzy parameters as denoted as fuzzy confidence level would generally pose explicit impacts on the obtained crop planting structure under demanding conditions where strict constraints are adopted in detail the increase of fuzzy confidence level would generally lead to decreased planting area for corn but increased planting area of vegetables in the time periods 2 and 3 this is because that under the increase of fuzzy confidence level would lead to decreased population estimation and thus decreased food demand therefore less corn planting is required whilst the residual resources would be allocated to vegetables and thus lead to increased vegetable planting conversely the planting structure would keep constant regardless of changes of fuzzy confidence level since the decreased food demand with the increase of fuzzy confidence level would be balanced by the decreased food loss rates the objective of the iffccp wefn model is to achieve a maximized unit benefit with respect to ghg emission and thus the obtained planting scheme is different from that generated by the inexact fuzzy chance constraint programming based water energy food nexus ifccp wefn models the results suggest that the unit benefit from iffccp wefn model would higher than that from ifccp wefn models both considering and not considering ghg emissions moreover the total ghg emissions from the cultivation scheme obtained by iffccp wefn model would be less than the cultivation scheme generated by the ifccp wefn models this is particularly explicit under advantageous conditions where sufficient resources are available the ghg emissions based on the iffccp wefn model can be reduced by about 11 at most than those from the ifccp wefn models particularly inclusion of ghg emission objective in the traditional ifccp wefn model i e ifccp case2 would not produce distinguishable results with the ifccp wefn model without ghe emission target i e ifccp case1 since the cost for carbon trading would only account for a small proportion in the total benefit about 0 8 under demanding conditions and 0 5 under advantageous conditions consequently these results indicate that the iffccp wefn model would generate more desirable support for sustainable wefn management in response to climate change in this study an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming iffccp approached have been developed for management of water energy food nexus system under consideration of ghg emissions this study would have contributions in both methodology and model development for wefn planning and management firstly the proposed iffccp method is able to reflect uncertainties presented as both fuzzy and interval numbers particularly the measures of necessity and possibility which are considered to be very relevant to the real life decision problems maity 2011 are introduced to reflect decision preferences on fuzzy parameters secondly the fractional programming is introduced into the iffccp approach to deal with contradictory targets in the wefn system the iffccp based models can be solved more easily than those models based on bi level or multi level programming methods in which subjective pre specifications for hierarchical model structure and solution tolerance are required finally the proposed iffccp wefn model has considered ghg emissions in food production in order to achieve a maximized unit benefit with respect ghg emission the obtained solutions have been demonstrated to be more effective in ghg mitigation than the results from some traditional models even considering carbon trading moreover such a model can be transferred to other areas to provide scientific support for carbon emission control in the water energy food nexus system even though the proposed iffccp wefn model has been demonstrated to be effective for sustainable management of wefn system further studies are still required to address some potential issues in the present iffccp wefn model firstly only the ghg emissions were considered in the current iffccp wefn model whilst the carbon sink from crop cultivation was not considered in fact some studies i e she et al 2017 has demonstrated that the major crops production showed as carbon sinks rather than carbon sources in general secondly the uncertain parameters adopted in the proposed model are only expressed as fuzzy or interval variables while some studies claimed that some parameter may present as multiple uncertain formats based on different data availability e g yu et al 2020b yue et al 2021 therefore further studies are required to improve the developed model to include carbon sink and also multiple uncertain parameters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9714,management of water food energy nexus wefn is of great importance to achieve the sustainable development goals the development of wefn management strategies is challenged by extensive uncertainties in different system components also agricultural activities would contribute a large portion of the total ghg emissions in many countries which are affecting the promised carbon neutrality in future in this study an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming method was developed towards planning the water food energy nexus system under consideration of both uncertainties and greenhouse gases ghg emission an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming based water energy food nexus iffccp wefn model has been established under consideration of various restrictions and ghg emissions solutions of the planting areas for different crops in different periods have been generated these results imply that the corn cultivation would be prioritized to satisfy cereal demand due to its relatively lower ghg emission intensity but the residual resources after satisfying cereal demand would tend to be allocated to vegetable planting comparison has been conducted among the iffccp wefn model and wefn models based the inexact fuzzy chance constraint programming approach with and without ghg emissions the results indicate that the results from iffccp wefn model would achieve a highest unit benefit and lowest total ghg emissions the total ghg emissions can be 11 less at most than ghg emissions from the resulting crop structures of the other two comparable models consequently the developed iffccp wefn model can help decision makers identify the desirable planting structure for crops with a priority of low ghg emission rate the major contributions in this study include i the inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming method to deal with interval and fuzzy parameters reflect decision makers preferences and handle conflicts among contradictory objectives ii the iffccp wefn model to achieve a maximized unit benefit with respect ghg emissions keywords inexact fractional programming fuzzy chance constraint uncertainty water energy food nexus system decision making ghg emission 1 introduction consumptions of water energy and food are accelerating due to rapid socio economic development booming population and increasing living standard such an issue cannot only be deemed as a general problem of administration but also come into a large number of intricacies among water energy and food liu et al 2015 moreover water food and energy have been involved in the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs for 2030 to tackle global challenges united nations 2015 however water energy and food systems are highly correlated on the one hand irrigation is required for agricultural planting and at the same time the effluents from farming will lead to pollution issues for the water systems on the other hand energy is required to sustain food transport water treatment farming irrigation and water supply while water resources can ensure stabilized energy generation normal crops growth processing and food production liu et al 2015 shang et al 2018 consequently it is challenging to ensure water food and energy demands accompanied with the urbanization process due to the complicated interactions among water energy and food systems das et al 2015 yu et al 2018 the deterioration of one factor in one system may spread to other components and cause serious consequences the policy measure and security of water energy or food may break the fragile balance among the three resources through critical demand and supply mechanism keskinen et al 2016 owen et al 2018 thus integrated management strategies are desired for the water energy food nexus wefn in order to address the above issue wef has complex interactions in which the water energy and food systems are not only interdependent but also competitive among each other cai et al 2018 water and energy are the key factors for agricultural production whilst agriculture would produce basic food and raw materials to other sectors e g life manufacturing service and support mankind s survival and economic development fernández et al 2020 guan et al 2020 zuo et al 2021 nevertheless intensive contradiction among food demand and agricultural supply has been observed in many regions especially in water scare areas a recent report from fao stated that 70 of the world s freshwater resources are used for agricultural irrigation and even up to 95 in low income countries fao 2017 moreover the water depletion would significantly affect crop yield which has been experienced in many countries daher et al 2019 bhattarai et al 2021 in addition a number of studies have demonstrated the high dependence of agriculture production and energy supply e g arizpe et al 2011 ghisellini et al 2016 buko et al 2021 even through agriculture accounts for only a relatively small proportion of total final energy demand consequently energy supply would also play a key role in agriculture production especially for farm machinery and irrigation many research works were conducted to explore management strategies of water energy nexus wen water food nexus wfn and water energy food nexus wefn perrone et al 2011 yu et al 2019 for example tsolas et al 2018 and liu et al 2019 employed a graphical and systematic program with the purpose of identifying and eliminating surplus from consumption and production of wen system salmoral and yan 2018 used the theory of virtual water and embedded energy to explore water and energy allocations in the economic system nevertheless there are still some issues to be addressed to develop effective management strategies for the wefn system firstly extensive uncertainties may exist in the wefn system which are embedded in different system components and also present different formats such as fuzzy interval and random variables yu et al 2020a ji et al 2020a 2020b this leads to challenges to reflect those uncertainties in developing the management policies for wefn system recently a number of studies have been proposed deal with various uncertainties in the wefn system through inexact optimization techniques perrone et al 2011 georgiou et al 2018 tsolas et al 2018 liu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 interval mathematical programming imp stochastic programming sp and fuzzy programming fp are the three major approaches to reflect uncertainties in the wefn systems and each technique would have its unique feature and shortcomings in dealing with uncertainties for instance the stochastic programming sp approach can effectively tackle random variables quantified with probability distributions whilst a large number of samples are required to formulate those probability distributions and thus this method is not applicable when only limited data are available gholizadeh et al 2020 in comparison the fp methods are able to deal with ambiguity in knowledge or information and vagueness in decision makers aspirations and the imp methods can tackle uncertainties only having the lower and upper bounds which are useful when available data are insufficient li et al 2017 these approaches have been widely used for management issues related to water energy and food for instance lv et al 2018 proposed an interval fuzzy chance constraint programming method towards planning the energy water nexus system in hebei province china ma et al 2020 developed a multi preference based interval fuzzy credibility constrained programming mifcp approach for planning the regional scale water resources management system rwms of henan province zuo et al 2021 developed a scenario based type 2 fuzzy interval programming stfip approach for planning agricultural water energy and food wef as well as crop area management for the henan province nevertheless due to the complexities of the wefn system and also data availability those uncertain parameters in wefn may present in different formats e g fuzzy and interval and even subjective linguistic uncertainties preferences of decision makers consequently advanced inexact optimization methods are still desired to reflect complex uncertainties in a wefn system secondly a wefn system is associated with different sectors stakeholders such as energy water and agriculture and each sector may have their own prioritized concerns or objectives this may lead to contradictions among different decision makers some studies have been proposed to deal with those contradictory issues in management of the wefn system for instance yu et al 2020a developed a copula based interval two level programming citp method for optimizing energy water nexus system management for henan province in which the two level programming method was adopted to balance the goals and preferences among different decision making levels yu et al 2020c also developed multi level interval fuzzy credibility constrained programming mifcp method for planning the regional scale water energy food nexus wefn system in which a multi level programming was used to handle conflicts and hierarchical relationships among multiple decision departments zhang et al 2020 advanced a multi level multi objective stochastic approach to deal with main conflicting objectives of each decision making level in water allocation in an arid agricultural region the studies on dealing with contradictory goals in wefn are still limited and more studies may be desired to explore the trade offs among those conflicting concerns from different decision makers moreover carbon neutrality is becoming one of the most critical issues all over the world to mitigate the climate change effect agricultural activities and related farming operations constitute a large portion of the total ghg emissions in many countries in which the main agricultural ghg emissions ch4 and n2o account for 10 12 of anthropogenic emissions globally robertson et al 2000 smith et al 2008 yang et al 2014 in china the agricultural carbon emissions have been accounted for 16 17 of the total carbon emissions making up 50 and 92 of the ch4 and n2o emissions consequently wefn management also needs to consider both direct and indirect greenhouse gas ghg emissions in relevant activities therefore it is desired to formulate effective strategies for water energy and food management to coordinate rapid development of various relevant departments in a sustainable pathway under various uncertain conditions martinez et al 2018 wang et al 2018 therefore this paper aims to propose an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming iffccp method through coordinating interval programming ip fuzzy chance constraint programming fccp and fractional programming fp into one framework the developed inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming method integrates the unique contribution of each individual technique in which the ip would be adopted to deal with uncertain parameters presented in interval numbers fccp is employed to tackle fuzzy variables and also reflect preferences from decision makers and the fp would be employed to reflect conflicting objectives of the studied problem moreover an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming based water energy food nexus ifccp wefn model is developed for planning the water energy food nexus system for the city of jinan in which both the system benefit and the ghg emissions are to be considered subject to restrictions related to food requirements water availability energy supply and other environmental protection constraints there are different modelling formulations for wefn planning such as land use optimization e g zuo et al 2021 resource technology network optimization e g bieber et al 2018 water and energy resources allocation e g li et al 2019 and so on in this study the iffccp wefn model would be developed for planning the crop cultivation areas under consideration of energy and water requirements as well as ghg emissions in addition both interval and fuzzy variables are employed to reflect extensive uncertainties existing in a wefn system in detail interval numbers are adopted for some economic parameters e g unit price for crops unit cost of fertilizer resources availability total cultivation areas availabilities for water resources energy consumption fertilizers and pesticides the interval parameters are used since their lower and upper bounds can be easily specified with only limited data and also help decision makers make trade offs between lower and upper bound conditions also some parameters such as local population food loss rate irrigation reliability are presented as triangular fuzzy numbers in order to explore their impacts on the resulting solutions for crop cultivation patterns particularly one major unique feature for this study is that the direct and indirect ghg emissions from wefn system would be considered in the iffccp wefn model those ghg emissions be used as the denominator in the objective function in order to generate maximized unit benefit with respect to ghg emissions for the wefn system the obtained solutions can help the local governor generate reliable planting schemes for different crops to achieve desirable system benefits and at the same time alleviate ghg emissions 2 overview of the study area as the capital city the city of jinan is located in the north western part of shandong province with the latitude ranging between 36001 and 37032 n and the longitude varying between 116011 and 117044 e after absorbing the city of laiwu jinan is now covering a terrain of 10244 km2 and having a population of 8 91 million the total gross domestic product gdp in 2019 is about rmb 944 34 billion with an increase rate of 7 0 ranked as the second largest city in shandong province jinan municipal bureau of statistics 2020 the mount tai is in the south of jinan and yellow river plain is located in the north part leading to higher land in the south than that in the north there are two major river systems namely the yellow river and xiaoqing river flowing across the city with other small rivers such as north south dasha river and yufuhe river etc jinan has the warm temperate continental climate with hot and rainy in summer and dry and rainless in other seasons the annual average temperature is 13 5 15 5 the frost free period all year round is about 230 days and the amount of precipitation is 600 900 mm as one of the major agricultural provinces shandong province is an important production area for a number of agricultural products such as wheat corn peanuts which accounts for 8 4 11 and 16 respectively for food vegetables and peanuts production in china in 2020 for the city of jinan the total output of grain was 2 855 million tons and the output of vegetables was 6 72 million tons in 2019 there are several crops sown in jinan but wheat corn and vegetables are the three major crops in 2019 the total sown areas for wheat corn and vegetables are 2 19 106 2 32 106 and 1 00 106 ha respectively making a respective contribution of 35 37 and 16 to the total sown area jinan municipal bureau of statistics 2020 even though there has been a prosperous growth for food and vegetable production in the city of jinan several issues need to be addressed to enhance the sustainability of the agriculture system in response to increasing food requirement environmental protection and also climate change a the amount of water resources for irrigation is abundant while its utilization efficiency is low and leads to serious waste of water for instance the total water demand in the city is about 1 542 109 m3 in 2017 in which water demands for agricultural industrial municipal and environmental sectors are respectively 8 67 108 1 99 108 2 85 108 and 1 93 108 m3 jinan municipal bureau of statistics 2018 for the water demand in agriculture about 6 54 108 of water were supplied for irrigation which made a contribution of 42 for the total water demand jinan municipal bureau of statistics 2018 b due to rapid urbanization and industrialization there has been a fierce competition for land use among municipal industrial and agricultural sectors the planting area of grain was 0 48 107 ha decreased by 1 0 in 2019 whilst the sown area of vegetables was 0 1 107 ha decreased by 2 2 jinan municipal bureau of statistics 2020 c there are growing electricity consumption in the city especially after 2019 while the city of laiwu was merged into jinan especially for industrial and household power consumptions for instance the industrial and household consumption for electricity respectively increased from 121 5 108 and 66 8 108 kwh to 221 5 108 and 77 6 108 kwh in 2019 nevertheless the electricity production only increased from 152 9 108 to 295 1 108 kwh which implied a remarkable power deficit and also serious competition for electricity consumption between agriculture and other sectors d in order to mitigate climate change china has promised to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 which indicates remarkable carbon reduction pressures for all socio economic sectors including agricultural production the greenhouse gas emission from agricultural production accounts for 16 17 of the total emission in china huang et al 2019 the agricultural greenhouse gas emissions are from various sources including both the direct and indirect emissions caused by utilization of fertilizers pesticides electricity and fossil fuels as one of the major provinces for agricultural production shandong province including the city of jinan are facing a noticeable pressure for reducing carbon emissions in agricultural production process due to the above issues the sustainability of the agricultural system is being challenged in terms of food production water availability energy electricity utilization and greenhouse gas emissions consequently it is desired to develop effective management strategies for the water energy food nexus at the city of jinan in order to achieve the coordination among planting agricultural planting environmental protection and carbon reduction to promote the sustainable development of agriculture 3 model development 3 1 modeling formulation for a real world water energy food nexus system there are multiple components and multiple uncertainties in association with different decision makers preferences there are many uncertain technical and economic parameters in the production and processing of agriculture besides the management of water energy food nexus system does not only consider the profit of the entire system but also balances the contradiction among agricultural water and energy resources managers according to different decision making priorities consequently a wefn model need to be established for planning the water energy food nexus system for the city of jinan china in which the agriculture activities i e crop cultivation crop processing food generation food transportation and available resources control i e fertilizer utilization pesticide utilization energy consumption for farming water consumption for irrigation are considered to achieve a desirable trade off between system benefit and greenhouse gas emissions moreover in order to reflect uncertain future in the planning horizon inexact parameters are to be included in the wefn model which are denoted as either interval or fuzzy numbers therefore the objective of the wefn model is to maximize unit benefits between agriculture profits and carbon emission the agriculture profits include revenue of crops and the cost used for the consumption of various resources e g water fertilizer electricity and seed in addition the labor cost has not been taken into account 1a max f f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 f 7 1

effertilizer v fat v efpesticide v pat v based on the current situation and future development strategy the wefn model would consider multifaceted and comprehensive constraints e g limited utilization amount of land and electricity which could be clearly seen as follows the constraints can help plan the agricultural development alleviate the contradictions among the development of socio economic environmental protection and other aspects at the city of jinan which will ultimately realize the sustainable development 1 land availability for cultivation the excessive exploitation of land for agriculture may lead to negative effects e g ecological environment deterioration and soil erosion which means cultivated area should be restricted also there has been significant competition for land use between agricultural cultivation and other sectors which lead to limited land availability for crop cultivation constraint 2a limited the minimum and maximum planting area of crops so as to avoid large fluctuations of the market price of agricultural products meanwhile the total planting area of crops should not exceed the available arable land in planning periods as shown in constraint 2b 2a

t is respectively the total fertilizer and pesticide availability for agricultural production the proposed wefn model is established based on some recent studies e g yu et al 2020a ji et al 2020b zuo et al 2021 however there are some inherent assumptions in the establishment of the wefn model firstly the availabilities for some resources especially for water and energy are those can be allocated to agricultural production whilst those resources used by other sectors would be excluded this assumption would be validated in the availability predictions for these resources in which the relevant availabilities are projected through regression methods based on historical resources allocated to agricultural production secondly there are ghg emissions in food production process but also carbon sinks in crop cultivation through soil organic carbon storage and cover carbon sequestration studies have argued that the major crops production showed as carbon sinks in general e g she et al 2017 however in the developed wefn model the carbon sinks in crop planting are not considered this assumption would be accepted since without considering carbon sink the developed wefn model would generate crop cultivation structures with low ghg emission intensities finally product prices including crop products e g wheat corn vegetables and raw materials e g fertilizers energy would have complex relationship with their supply demand curves in this study those prices are simply projected through add an inflation rate based on historical product prices moreover certain fluctuation ranges are added to those projected prices in order the reflect the price volatility this is one of the main reasons to introduce uncertain parameters in the developed wefn model table 1 provides the definitions of the symbols used in the wefn model as well as their uncertainty formats the developed wefn model expressed as equations 1 6 is a nonlinear programming model since it has a fractional objective function here the fractional programming fp is introduced to deal with the benefit and ghg emission objectives in the wefn system since it is an effective tool to deal with optimization of ratio where the objective is quotient of system benefit and ghg emission the fp method can compare objectives of different aspects directly through their original magnitudes and provide an unprejudiced measure of system efficiency zhu et al 2014 it has been proved to be a natural way of approaching both economic and environmental criteria related to the systems sustainability zhu and huang 2011 in the real wefn system parameters may be affected by a series of factors e g limited data availability inaccuracy of statistical data subjective experience which would result in system errors and multiple uncertainties si et al 2019 for example during the entire planning horizon prices of agricultural products and costs of agricultural production conditions may ﬂuctuate under the inﬂuence of demand supply relationship and policies hoolohan et al 2019 in general the economic coefficients such as prices for crops costs for utilization of energy fertilizers and pesticides are uncertain in natures since they are closely related to the volatility of interest rates inflation rates and other factors i e energy price labor fee and operation condition yu et al 2020b in this study these parameters are denoted as interval variables due to limited data availability moreover the future resources availabilities for the wefn system such as water resources electricity availability fertilizer and pesticides availabilities are projected through regression methods based on historical data however these parameters would also be affected by a number of factors such as hydrometeorological conditions and would present uncertain features therefore some variation ranges are added to those forecasting results and thus lead to interval parameters in addition the prioritized objective for wefn system is to satisfy the food demand from local population and the food loss rate in production transportation and other processes are also quite crucial affecting the food availabilities to local people thus these two parameters are presented as fuzzy numbers also the fuzzy number would be used to express the uncertainty in irrigation reliability the purpose of using fuzzy numbers was to explore the impacts of changes in population food loss rates and irrigation reliabilities on the resulting crop cultivation patterns 3 2 solution method in order to reflect uncertain conditions in the future planning horizon uncertain parameter expressed either by interval or fuzzy numbers are introduced into the developed water energy food nexus wefn model expressed as equations 1 6 consequently an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming iffccp method will be developed to solve the proposed wefn model which will finally lead to an iffccp wefn model in this study the proposed iffccp approach integrates the inexact fractional programming and fuzzy chance constraint programming approaches to deal with contradictory objectives and also multiple uncertainties in the water energy food nexus planning practices consider a generic inexact fuzzy fractional programming with fractional objective function and uncertain parameters expressed as interval and fuzzy numbers as follows 7a max f j 1 n c j x j α j 1 n d j x j β subject to 7b j 1 naij xj bi i 1 2 l 7c j 1 nãijxj b i i l 1 m 7d xj 0 based on the interactive transform algorithm proposed by zhu et al 2014 an inexact fractional programming i e eqs 7a 7b and 7d can be converted into two conventional fractional programming submodels corresponding to the lower i e pessimistic and upper i e optimistic bound of the objectives however for the constraints with fuzzy parameters i e eq 7c a number of approaches have been proposed such as the α cut method e g ammar 2008 lexicographic criteria e g p é rez cañedo 2020 possibility and necessity measures inuiguchi and ramik 2000 xu et al 2011 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2016 xu et al 2014 in this study the measures of possibility and necessity will be adopted to deal with the constraints with fuzzy parameters the necessity and possibility constraints are introduced by dubois and prade 1987 which are considered to be very relevant to the real life decision problems maity 2011 these two measures have been used for many practical management problems with fuzzy uncertainties such as portfolio selection problem inuiguchi and ramik 2000 production inventory control problem maity and maiti 2007 and so on consequently based on the integration of the interactive transform algorithm and the measures of possibility and necessity the iffccp model can be transformed into two conventional fractional programming submodels corresponding to the low and upper bound of the objective the first submodel corresponding to the lower bound i e f of the objective which is formulated as follows i e submodel i 8a max f j 1 kcj xj j k 1 ncj xj α j 1 kdj xj j k 1 ndj xj β subject to 8b j 1 k aij sign aij xj j k 1 n aij sign aij xj bi i 1 2 l 8c nes j 1 kãijxj j k

different crops are obtained from the local irrigation policy no db37 t 3772 2019 released by the water resources department of shandong province table 2 presents the variation intervals for relevant agricultural and economic parameters here the interval values are adopted to reflect uncertainties in those parameters table 3 presents the availabilities for water resources electricity fertilizers and pesticides the ghg emissions associated with food production are mainly generated from electricity for irrigation diesel for machinery fertilizer and pesticide utilization the emission coefficients for these sources are presented in table 4 here the emission coefficients for fertilizer utilization for different crops would be different duet to different combinations of nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizers for different crops the emission coefficients for pesticide utilization are also different because of different usages of herbicide pesticide and fungicide for different crops in addition to the uncertain parameters presented as intervals there are also some parameters estimated as fuzzy numbers such as the irrigation reliability the loss rates for food and vegetables and also local population in the city of jinan there are several methods to express a fuzzy number the triangular fuzzy number is adopted to present the fuzzy uncertainty since the membership function for a fuzzy number is easily established this kind of fuzzy numbers has been wide used in a number of studies e g fan et al 2009 2012 ma et al 2020 the fuzzy parameters used in this study are presented in table 5 4 result analysis based on the constraints e g environmental protection and limited resource utilization and the objective of maximum unit benefit the planting areas of different crops as well as total co2 emission during the planning periods could be obtained by solving the inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming based water energy food nexus model particularly three α cut levels i e α 0 2 0 5 0 8 are chosen to deal with the fuzzy parameters in the developed model in order to reflect the preferences by the decision maker under each α cut level two submodels corresponding to the optimistic and pessimistic conditions are formulated based on the solution method presented in section 3 2 leading to six submodels in total each submodel is a conventional fractional programming model with deterministic parameter values in current study the cultivation areas for corn wheat and vegetables would be generated from the iffccp wefn model in three planning periods therefore the developed iffccp wefn as well as its corresponding submodels would have nine decision variables the generated submodels were solved through lingo 11 0 software packagewith a computational time less than 1 s and infeasibility tolerance less than 10 6 interval solutions are finally obtained under each α cut level to reflect the potential farming pattern in different planning periods table 6 clearly shows crops planting area and the corresponding variation trend during the planning periods under different preferences i e α cut levels from the decision maker which would further help the decision makers to formulate and implement scientific planning schemes it can be seen that the planting areas for different crops would vary in different planning periods due to the socioeconomic and environmental restrictions in detail the planting areas for corn and vegetables show a slightly increasing trend while in comparison the sown area for wheat tends to keep constant for instance the planting area for corn would be 1 784 105 ha in period 1 and 1 932 105 ha in period 3 under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 2 showing an increasing rate of 8 3 in comparison cultivation area for wheat would be 1 89 10 5 ha for all the planning periods which is the upper bound of the minimum planting limit the results imply that the corn seems to be prioritized between corn and wheat in the planting structure to satisfy the cereal demand from local population more specifically as the cereal demand increases in time periods 2 and 3 these demands would also be satisfied by corn and thus lead to an increasing trend for corn cultivation over the planning horizon in addition the cultivation area for vegetables would slightly increase from 0 956 1 204 105 ha in period 1 to 0 996 1 204 105 ha in period 3 under this fuzzy confidence level with an increasing rate of 4 2 for the lower bound the increasing trend for vegetable cultivation under the demanding pessimistic conditions i e lower bound may also be attributed to the increasing vegetable demand over the planning horizon moreover compared with the cultivation structures for corns and wheat there are certain fluctuations ranges for vegetable planting between demanding pessimistic and advantageous conditions e g 0 956 1 204 10 5 ha in period 1 the advantageous optimistic conditions generally correspond to more resource availabilities e g water resources electricity fertilizers etc but less food demand e g less population less food loss rate etc the fluctuation ranges for vegetable cultivation indicate that when more resources are available these resources tend to be utilized to increase sown areas for vegetables furthermore as the fuzzy confidence level changes the detailed sown areas for corn and vegetables would be changed whilst the variation pattern would not change significantly fig 2 presents the fluctuation of sown areas for the three crops in the planning horizon which shows the variation trends under both advantageous and demanding conditions under different fuzzy confidence levels in this study three fuzzy confidence levels are chosen to reflect the variations of the predefined triangular fuzzy parameters i e α 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 under each fuzzy confidence level the α cut method would be employed to convert the fuzzy numbers into corresponding interval numbers under this level these three levels are selected since they can generally reflect the variations of fuzzy parameters under low medium and high possibilities the α cut value of 0 2 indicates a low possibility for the corresponding parameter ranges i e the intervals of fuzzy numbers under α cut 0 2 but such ranges can cover most possible values for the fuzzy parameters in comparison the α cut value of 0 8 indicates a high possibility for the corresponding parameter ranges but such ranges may neglect some possible parameter values with low possibilities consequently through choosing these three fuzzy confidence levels the proposed iffccp wefn model would generate desired cultivation structures under different possibilities moreover based on the solutions under multiple fuzzy confidence levels the impacts of fuzzy parameters on the resulting solutions can be explored as stated in table 6 it can be concluded that the change of fuzzy confidence levels may not pose significant effects on the resulting solutions under advantageous conditions since there would be less food demand but sufficient resource availabilities under these conditions in comparison the fuzzy confidence level would have some visible impacts on the detail sown areas for corn and vegetables under the demanding pessimistic conditions the necessity measure would be adopted as presented in eq 11b fig 3 compared the local population and crop cultivation under different fuzzy confidence levels as the increase of fuzzy confidence level less population would be estimated i e p t 0 8 p t 0 2 leading to less food demand nevertheless more food loss rate may happen as the increase of fuzzy confidence level i e 1 η 1 0 8 l 1 η 1 0 2 l fig 3a and b present constant sown areas for corn and vegetables for all three fuzzy confidence levels at time period 1 this implies that the decreasing food demand with the increase of fuzzy confidence level would be balanced by the decreases of food loss rates thus the fuzzy confidence level would not have explicit impacts on crop cultivation in this planning period however in time periods 2 and 3 more food demands especially for cereal are expected per person as presented in table 2 therefore the decrease of local population as a result of increasing fuzzy confidence level would lead to more decrease of total food demand than that happened in period 1 which would not be balanced by the corresponding increases of food loss rates consequently the food demand in both periods 2 and 3 would generally decrease as the increase of fuzzy confidence levels this would lead to less sown area for corn as the fuzzy confidence level increases as presented in fig 3c and e besides the reduction of corn cultivation would generally lead some residues for arable land the remaining land would tend to be utilized for planting vegetables and thus lead to increasing sown areas for vegetables as presented in fig 3d and e such a conclusion is consistent with the changes of cultivation patterns under advantageous conditions where sufficient resources are available as stated in table 6 and fig 2 different sown areas would be expected for wheat corn and vegetables in different planning period under different fuzzy confidence levels these planting structures would also lead to different ghg emissions from utilization of electricity fossil fertilizers and pesticides fig 4 presents the percentages of the cultivation areas for the three crops as well as the associated ghg emission contributions in the planning horizon under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 2 the results indicate that the proportion for wheat cultivation shows a decreasing trend due to the increasing proportion for corn this can be attributed to the relatively high ghg emission rate from wheat for instance under the pessimistic conditions the wheat cultivation has a planting proportion of 40 8 but it would make a contribution of 42 1 to the total ghg emission in time period 1 in comparison the cultivation of corn would contribute 29 1 of ghg emission through a 38 5 planting proportion however it can be observed from fig 4 that the cultivation of vegetables seems to have higher co2 emission intensity than the other two crops which would contribute 20 7 to the total co2 emissions through a planting proportion of 28 9 in time period 1 for pessimistic conditions nevertheless the sown areas for the vegetables would still show an increasing trend especially under the demanding pessimistic condition as presented in table 6 and fig 2 this may be due to two possible reasons i the vegetables would generally have much higher unit production weight than corns and wheat which may lead to more profits ii both corn and wheat belong to cereals and thus they are interchangeable but the vegetables can hardly be replaced by cereals consequently a large proportion of the sown areas should be allocated to vegetables to meet the vegetable demands in the local area more importantly as presented in table 6 and fig 3 after satisfying the cereal demands from local population the residual resources e g arable land water resources electricity etc would be suggested to be used for vegetable cultivations figs 5 and 6 present the cultivation pattern for the three crops and the corresponding contributions of ghg emissions under the fuzzy confidence levels of 0 5 and 0 8 the results also reveal similar patterns for crop cultivation and ghg emissions with those under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 2 however the ghg emissions from corn cultivation would likely decrease as the increase of the fuzzy confidence level especially in time periods 2 and 3 this would be due to the decreasing sown areas for corn as presented in fig 3 in comparison the ghg emissions from vegetables would slightly increase at the same time for instance under the pessimistic condition the cultivation for corn and vegetables would respectively have proportions of 39 2 20 7 in time period 2 under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 5 and 39 0 20 9 under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 8 correspondingly the ghg emissions from corn and vegetables would respectively make contributions of 29 6 and 29 1 under the fuzzy confidence level of 0 5 and 29 4 and 29 2 under the fuzzy confidence level of 0 8 these results also demonstrate the priority of corn cultivation to meet the cereal demand in the city of jinan fig 7 presents both the unit benefits and total benefits obtained from the developed iffccp wefn model under different fuzzy confidence levels under the demanding conditions which corresponding to more food demands less resource availabilities and thus lower objective bounds an increasing trend would be observed as the increase of fuzzy confidence level for instance the unit benefit would range between 8 410 8 438 and 8 459 rmb kg co2 eq respectively under the fuzzy confidence level being 0 2 0 5 and 0 8 correspondingly the total benefits would be rmb 4 095 1010 rmb 4 103 1010 and rmb 4 109 1010 respectively this may be due to more sown areas for vegetables as presented in table 6 for the advantageous conditions corresponding to the upper bound of the objective an increasing trend would be still observed since after satisfying cereal demands the remaining resources tend to be allocated to vegetables nevertheless the total benefit as presented in fig 7b tends to slightly decrease from rmb 5 379 1010 under α 0 2 to rmb 5 373 1010 under α 0 8 this would be mainly because that under the advantageous conditions where the possibility measure is adopted the increase of fuzzy confidence level would also lead to increase for the lower bound of irrigation reliability i e õ α in constraint 4 such an increase would lead to decrease for the total sown areas for the three crops as presented in table 6 i e sown area for corn decreases while the sown areas for the other two crops keep constant consequently this would lead to a slight decrease in the total benefit under advantageous conditions 5 discussion the objective of the developed iffccp wefn model is to achieve a maximized unit benefit for the agriculture department with respect to the ghg emissions this is the reason to introduce a fractional objective function into the iffccp wefn model if the objective function is to maximize the total benefit of the water energy food nexus system this will lead to an inexact fuzzy chance constraint programming based water energy food nexus ifccp wefn model more specifically if the ghg emission target is not considered the objective function in equation 1 will be denoted as max f f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 which is denoted as ifccp case1 in the following analyses moreover the ghg emission can also be considered in the ifccp wefn model through introducing a carbon trading objective in which the function of f 7 can be revised as f 7 t 1 t ctp t tce t and the objective function in equation 1 will be denoted as max f f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 f 7 here ctp t denote the carbon trading price in time period t which was set as 48 60 51 1 65 4 and 54 5 71 3 rmb tonne for t 1 2 and 3 respectively such an ifccp wefn model is denoted as ifccp case2 in the following comparison analyses compared with the developed iffccp wefn model both ifccp case1 and ifccp case2 models can be converted into two conventional linear programming submodels under each fuzzy confidence level which were solve by lingo 11 0 software package in this study also the submodels generated from the two ifccp models would be solved with less computational time than those fractional submodels generated from the iffccp wefn model however due to the small model size for the studied wefn system all the submodels including linear programming and fractional programming submodels were solved by the lingo 11 0 software package within 1 s therefore there would be no computational burden in practical computation for the developed iffccp wefn model in addition since the fractional submodels would be generated from the iffccp wefn model only local optimal solutions would be obtained from lingo corresponding to both pessimistic and optimistic conditional in comparison the submodels for the ifccp wefn model both ifccp case1 and ifccp case2 models would generate global optimal solutions since these submodels are linear programming models fig 8 compares the low and upper bounds of the total benefits obtained through the iffccp and ifccp models the results indicate that the ifccp case1 model would generate the highest total benefits for both demanding pessimistic and advantageous optimistic conditions since the ghg emissions from wefn system is not considered for instance the total benefits would range between rmb 4 111 5 574 1010 under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 2 compared with the total benefit of rmb 4 095 5 379 1010 from iffccp wefn model which leads to an slightly increase rate of 0 4 for the lower bound and 3 6 for the upper bound in comparison when the ghg emission is also consider in the ifccp wefn model i e ifccp case2 the obtained total benefits would be lower than the benefit from iffccp wefn model under demanding conditions but higher for the advantageous conditions where sufficient resources are available for example the total benefit from the ifccp case2 model would be rmb 4 078 5 546 1010 under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 2 leading to a decreasing rate of 0 4 for the benefit from iffccp wefn model under demanding conditions but an increasing rate of 3 1 for the upper bound moreover the lower bounds of the total benefit from all three models would present an increasing trend as the increase in fuzzy confidence level implying the visible effect of the decision makers preferences on the desired crop planting structures nevertheless except the slightly decreasing trend for the upper bound objective from iffccp model the upper bound benefits for the two ifccp models would keep constant regardless of the changes in fuzzy confidence level this suggest that the decision preferences would not have explicit impact on the desired wefn management strategies under advantageous conditions fig 9 presents the comparison of the unit benefits with respect to ghg emissions from the ifccp wefn model and two ifccp wefn models since the ifccp case1 model did not consider the ghg emissions during the crop cultivation process it is straightforward that the unit benefit with respect to ghg emissions would generally lower than that obtained from the developed iffccp wefn model for instance the unit benefit generated from the ifccp case1 model would range within 8 401 10 398 rmb kg co2 eq under a fuzzy confidence level of 0 2 whilst the unit benefit from iffccp wefn model would vary within 8 410 11 204 rmb kg co2 eq a decreasing rate about 0 1 would be observed for the lower bound while the decreasing rate for the upper bound can increase to 7 2 the results indicate that the planting structure for crops without consideration of ghg emission may not be as efficient as the solution from iffccp wefn model in response to ghg mitigation especially when sufficient resources are available for crop planting it is noticeable that the introduction of carbon trading in the ifccp model i e ifccp case2 would not enhance the efficiency of ghg mitigation as presented in fig 9 the unit benefits from the ifccp case2 model are the same as the unit benefits obtained from ifccp case1 model for both demanding and advantageous conditions under all three fuzzy confidence levels these results may be due to two possible reasons i both the ifccp case1 and ifccp case2 models were developed to maximize the total system benefit and thus the unit benefit with respect to ghg emission was not considered ii the ghg trading price obtained from some open news report would be too low e g 0 07 rmb kg co2 eq for the highest price and such a price may not visibly affect the desired crop planting structure from the ifccp models this can be further demonstrated through comparing the total benefits from the two ifccp models the total cost for carbon trading i e the benefit from ifccp case1 model minus the benefit from ifccp case2 model would only have a proportion about 0 8 under demanding conditions and 0 5 under advantageous conditions in the total benefit fig 10 presents the total ghg emissions in different planning periods under different fuzzy confidence levels it indicates that the ghg emissions from the planting patterns obtained by the ifccp wefn models i e ifccp case1 and ifccp case2 are higher than those from the cultivation structure obtained by iffccp wefn model in all the planning periods under all the fuzzy confidence levels this is because that the iffccp model would maximize the unit benefit with respect to ghg emissions while the ifccp models only considered the total system benefits in addition the total ghg emissions under each fuzzy confidence level tend to decrease over the planning period for all the three wefn models this may be mainly because that the resources availabilities especially for fertilizers and pesticides would decrease due to more strict environmental restrictions these results demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the planting structure obtained from the ifccp wefn models for ghg emission control in this study the contradictory objectives between system benefits and ghg emissions for a wefn system were reflected through introducing the fractional programming method into the developed iffccp approach in order to achieve a maximum unit benefit with respect to ghg emissions however such contradiction issues in the wefn system would also be tackled through bi level or multi level programming methods as developed in jin et al 2018 yu et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 and other relevant studies nevertheless we argue that the developed iffccp approach would have some merit when compared with bi level or multi level methods in dealing with trade offs among contradictor objectives firstly the bi level or multi level methods would need to pre define the hierarchical structure for the upper level and lower level models for the same conflicting objectives e g system benefit and ghg emissions different hierarchical structures e g the upper level for system benefit or the upper level for ghg emissions would lead to significant discrepancies in the desired solutions in comparison the developed iffccp approach would reflect contradiction between system benefit and ghg emissions through maximizing the unit benefit with respect to ghg emission without pre specifying the priority among these two objectives moreover the bi level or multi level models would be solved through some complex interactive algorithms e g jin et al 2018 in which one model either the upper level or the lower level model would be solved firstly and the other one would then be solved for decision variables around their solutions from the first model within a pre defined tolerance jin et al 2018 this may lead to two possible issues i the tolerance was commonly determined subjectively by the decision makers or model developers in which different tolerance values would lead to different solutions ii since the second model would be solved around the solutions of the decision variables obtained from the first model this would also lead to local optimal solutions furthermore we admit that the bi level or multi level models may generate crop planting structures with relatively higher unit benefits than the ifccp models ifccp case1 and ifccp case2 however those models may hardly produce the crop planting structure with a higher unit benefit than the desired cultivation pattern generated by the developed ifccp wefn model based on the shortcomings for the bi level or multi level models discussed above 6 conclusions in this study an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming iffccp method has been developed to provide management strategies for the complex water energy food nexus wefn system an iffccp based water energy food nexus iffccp wefn model has been formulated for planning the wefn system for the city of jinan shandong province under consideration of both system benefits and ghg emissions solutions of the planting areas for different crops under different periods have been generated in order to achieve a maximized unit benefit with respect to the ghg emissions based on the iffccp wefn model results indicated that the increase of cereal demand over the planning horizon would be mainly satisfied by the corn cultivation while the cultivation area of wheat would maintain at it upper bound of minimum requirement to avoid noticeable fluctuation for wheat price this is due to the relatively lower ghg emission intensity from corn in which the proportion of ghg emissions from corn would approximately drop 10 points compared with its proportion in the crop cultivation areas in addition the sown area for vegetables under strict restrictions would also increase to meet the vegetable demand over the planning area however the sown area of vegetables would reach its upper bound under the advantageous conditions whilst the corn and wheat cultivation would not change even though more resources would be available under advantageous conditions this implies that after satisfying the cereal demand the residual resources e g water fertilizer energy etc would tend to be allocated to vegetable planting moreover preferences of decision makers on fuzzy parameters as denoted as fuzzy confidence level would generally pose explicit impacts on the obtained crop planting structure under demanding conditions where strict constraints are adopted in detail the increase of fuzzy confidence level would generally lead to decreased planting area for corn but increased planting area of vegetables in the time periods 2 and 3 this is because that under the increase of fuzzy confidence level would lead to decreased population estimation and thus decreased food demand therefore less corn planting is required whilst the residual resources would be allocated to vegetables and thus lead to increased vegetable planting conversely the planting structure would keep constant regardless of changes of fuzzy confidence level since the decreased food demand with the increase of fuzzy confidence level would be balanced by the decreased food loss rates the objective of the iffccp wefn model is to achieve a maximized unit benefit with respect to ghg emission and thus the obtained planting scheme is different from that generated by the inexact fuzzy chance constraint programming based water energy food nexus ifccp wefn models the results suggest that the unit benefit from iffccp wefn model would higher than that from ifccp wefn models both considering and not considering ghg emissions moreover the total ghg emissions from the cultivation scheme obtained by iffccp wefn model would be less than the cultivation scheme generated by the ifccp wefn models this is particularly explicit under advantageous conditions where sufficient resources are available the ghg emissions based on the iffccp wefn model can be reduced by about 11 at most than those from the ifccp wefn models particularly inclusion of ghg emission objective in the traditional ifccp wefn model i e ifccp case2 would not produce distinguishable results with the ifccp wefn model without ghe emission target i e ifccp case1 since the cost for carbon trading would only account for a small proportion in the total benefit about 0 8 under demanding conditions and 0 5 under advantageous conditions consequently these results indicate that the iffccp wefn model would generate more desirable support for sustainable wefn management in response to climate change in this study an inexact fractional fuzzy chance constraint programming iffccp approached have been developed for management of water energy food nexus system under consideration of ghg emissions this study would have contributions in both methodology and model development for wefn planning and management firstly the proposed iffccp method is able to reflect uncertainties presented as both fuzzy and interval numbers particularly the measures of necessity and possibility which are considered to be very relevant to the real life decision problems maity 2011 are introduced to reflect decision preferences on fuzzy parameters secondly the fractional programming is introduced into the iffccp approach to deal with contradictory targets in the wefn system the iffccp based models can be solved more easily than those models based on bi level or multi level programming methods in which subjective pre specifications for hierarchical model structure and solution tolerance are required finally the proposed iffccp wefn model has considered ghg emissions in food production in order to achieve a maximized unit benefit with respect ghg emission the obtained solutions have been demonstrated to be more effective in ghg mitigation than the results from some traditional models even considering carbon trading moreover such a model can be transferred to other areas to provide scientific support for carbon emission control in the water energy food nexus system even though the proposed iffccp wefn model has been demonstrated to be effective for sustainable management of wefn system further studies are still required to address some potential issues in the present iffccp wefn model firstly only the ghg emissions were considered in the current iffccp wefn model whilst the carbon sink from crop cultivation was not considered in fact some studies i e she et al 2017 has demonstrated that the major crops production showed as carbon sinks rather than carbon sources in general secondly the uncertain parameters adopted in the proposed model are only expressed as fuzzy or interval variables while some studies claimed that some parameter may present as multiple uncertain formats based on different data availability e g yu et al 2020b yue et al 2021 therefore further studies are required to improve the developed model to include carbon sink and also multiple uncertain parameters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
