24395,numerical models of ecological systems are increasingly used to address complex environmental and resource management questions one challenge for scientists managers and stakeholders is to appraise how well suited these models are to answer questions of scientific or societal relevance that is to perform communicate or access transparent evaluations of ecological models while there have been substantial developments to support standardised descriptions of ecological models less has been done to standardise and to report model evaluation practices we present here a general protocol designed to guide the reporting of model evaluation the protocol is organised in three major parts the objective s of the modelling application the ecological patterns of relevance and the evaluation methodology proper and is termed the ope objectives patterns evaluation protocol we present the 25 questions of the ope protocol which address the many aspects of the evaluation process and then apply them to six case studies based on a diversity of ecological models in addition to standardising and increasing the transparency of the model evaluation process we find that going through the ope protocol helps modellers to think more deeply about the evaluation of their models from this last point we suggest that it would be highly beneficial for modellers to consider the ope early in the modelling process in addition to using it as a reporting tool and as a reviewing tool keywords standardisation best practice ecological patterns skill assessment transparency data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction scientists managers and stakeholders increasingly rely on numerical models of ecological systems one challenge is to appraise the efficiency of these models to tackle complex environmental questions providing clear evaluations of model performance is one way to address this challenge models can be constructed analysed and used by different actors from scientists to policymakers and these actors have different understandings and expectations from models assessing how good a model is at addressing specific problems is difficult when ecological modellers use a variety of model types have different modelling cultures and practices and use different vocabularies this can hinder communication transparency reproducibility and the general development of good practices within the modelling community it is therefore essential to provide tools to support a collective understanding of what can be expected from a model and how a model is to be evaluated cartwright et al 2016 eker et al 2018 heymans et al 2020 transparency and reproducibility are at the core of the scientific method however the complexity of the tools used to observe and model ecological systems challenges reproducibility and transparency powers and hampton 2019 the ongoing so called reproducibility or replicability crisis reflects this difficulty the crisis has primarily been identified in the fields of psychology pashler and wagenmakers 2012 clinical studies begley and ioannidis john 2015 and economics camerer et al 2016 and is much less discussed in ecological research but see ives 2018 nichols et al 2019 2021 it may not be possible to strictly replicate ecological observations but transparency in workflow and data analyses can facilitate reproducibility it should be possible to reproduce ecological model simulations given that the relevant information is provided for that purpose in addition to replicating a model and the associated simulations it is equally important to be able to understand assess and replicate how model performance was evaluated this step is critical given that almost every new method published claims to outperform existing ones but are seldom re evaluated boulesteix et al 2020 providing relevant and comprehensive information is a first step towards replicability which needs to be complemented by appropriate communication and quality standards how is the information communicated is it accessible is it unambiguous is it sufficient a standardised protocol for reporting model evaluation procedures would address these questions and contribute to increased transparency and reproducibility of ecological models there have been considerable collective efforts in recent decades to develop standardized modelling practices from model building to evaluation of model performances a major advancement has been the development of standardised protocols such as the odd overview design concepts and details grimm et al 2006 the odd protocol was originally developed to respond to the lack of a standard protocol for describing individual based models ibms the protocol was reviewed and updated twice since its original publication grimm et al 2010 2020b and it is now commonly used by ecological modellers beyond the original ibm community to describe their models in reports and publications the odd protocol has been inspirational to groups of modellers with diverse focus such as on model optimisation oddo mahévas 2019 data mapping odd 2d laatabi et al 2018 and inclusion of human decisions odd d müller et al 2013 in each case these groups have borrowed from the original odd protocol idea and extended it for their specific purpose thereby contributing to the harmonisation and communication of modelling practices a major step in the development and application of ecological models is the evaluation phase there exists a large body of literature on how to perform model evaluation for various classes of models e g stow et al 2009 allen and somerfield 2009 bennett et al 2013 conn et al 2018 hipsey et al 2020 but much less work has been done to standardise the reporting of model evaluations the trace transparent and comprehensive ecological modelling documentation grimm et al 2014 is a notable exception which provides a framework for documenting the modelling process including several aspects of model evaluation standardised protocols for reporting model evaluation can constitute useful tools for modellers and end users to easily understand and compare evaluation procedures and appreciate the performance of models in relation to specific objectives making such tools available is therefore anticipated to benefit the scientific community and model end users the issue of model validation and evaluation in environmental science has been the subject of extensive research and debate oreskes 1998 argued that quantitative models cannot be validated but only evaluated in oreskes view evaluation is described as an assessment in which both positive and negative results are possible and where the grounds on which a model is declared good enough are clearly articulated this assessment implies an examination of model outputs against pre specified performance criteria in the literature the term model validation has remained pervasive eker et al 2019 although often overlapping with the concept of evaluation as originally presented by oreskes in their 10 step procedure for developing and evaluating environmental models jakeman et al 2006 introduced a stepwise approach in which every stage is open to critical review and revision in consort with end users the evaluation step is left to the end and is concerned with the model being fit for purpose although the criteria for achieving this goal are not fully developed by these authors more recently parker 2020 explores the meaning of a model being adequate for purpose for different classes of models whether pedagogical explanatory or predictive in the works of jakeman and parker model evaluation is primarily achieved by measuring the performance of a model against pre specified objectives thereby following the original argument of oreskes this excludes the idea of a general validity of a model and favours the principle of an evaluation of a model for a specific objective or a set of objectives this mirrors george box s notorious statement that all models are wrong the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful box and draper 1987 where useful implies use and therefore purpose this is also in line with augusiak s review of the literature on model evaluation and validation which concludes that despite little agreement on terms and underlying notions in the literature it has repeatedly been pointed out that the evaluation of a model should depend on its purpose augusiak et al 2014 evaluating that an ecological model is fit for purpose implies that the same model can and should be evaluated each time it is used for a new purpose this is a rather trivial implication of the fit for purpose evaluation however examples of re evaluation of the performance of complex ecological models are scarce complex ecological models require extensive development efforts and these materialise in the first publication of the model together with a global evaluation or validation of the model see e g radach and moll 2006 link et al 2010 travers trolet et al 2014 pedersen et al 2021 a fit for purpose approach would require that this first model evaluation be revised and reported for each new application of the model one challenge in doing so is that the task of reporting model evaluation which is already substantial when the model is first published may seem daunting if it is to be repeated for every new model application this can possibly be eased by reporting primarily on aspects of the model evaluation that are specific to each new application an additional help can be provided by following a template in which a set of questions can guide the modeller through the reporting process by taking inspiration from the success and utility of the odd protocol and the following extensions we here present a complementary protocol for the reporting of ecological model evaluation procedures the ope objectives patterns evaluation protocol we discuss the rationale for the different elements of this protocol and provide a list of questions that can guide modellers to report in ope format we summarise the protocol table 1 and provide an easy to use word template to support documenting model evaluations supplementary material s1 finally we test the protocol on six case studies taken from a collection of marine ecosystem models with which the authors are familiar these case studies are presented in detail in the supplementary material s2 these modelling applications pre existed the ope protocol the ope has therefore not been used to guide the model evaluations presented here but only to report how these evaluations were performed 2 elements of the ope protocol the elements of the ope protocol are divided into three sections objectives patterns and evaluation each section is then divided in subsections which contain one to six questions 2 1 objectives 2 1 1 context and motivations in our experience many ecological models are not developed with the sole purpose of answering a single well circumscribed question rather complex ecological models take time to develop are often built to address multiple and sometimes diffuse purposes and are gradually applied to a range of questions fulton et al 2011 planque and mullon 2020 for example dynamic global vegetation models dgvm which were originally conceived to assess ecosystem level responses to atmospheric co2 concentration prentice et al 2000 have later been applied to deliver projections based on future climate scenarios sitch et al 2008 and are being continuously developed to address new questions such as the impacts of different management practices on terrestrial ecosystems prentice et al 2007 in a similar fashion the ecosystem model atlantis developed for the northwest atlantic shelf link et al 2010 was first used to explore the combined effects of climate and fishing nye et al 2013 then to address the impact of ocean acidification fay et al 2017 and more recently to quantify combined effects of acidification fishing and marine protection olsen et al 2018 models of natural systems are inevitably embedded with multiple sources of uncertainty and modellers make decisions during model construction e g on which processes to include or simplify which will affect the final outcome babel et al 2019 there is a risk that assumptions which are reasonable for one particular model application are inadequate for another parker 2020 saltelli et al 2020 it is therefore essential that model suitability and performance are assessed and described for each application and a crucial first step is describing the purpose of the specific application in other words to evaluate that a model is fit for purpose one must first specify the purpose in this contribution we refer to model as the generic description of the modelling tool e g ecopath with ecosim polovina 1984a 1984b christensen and walters 2004 we use the terms goal purpose and objective in an interchangeable manner to express the motivation driving the study and we refer to a model application when the model is applied towards a pre defined objective or set of objectives central in the ope framework is our conception that it is sensical to evaluate the same model against different patterns or data when applied for different purposes describing the main objectives of the study and how modelling will contribute to reach these objectives is perhaps the most crucial step in evaluating model performance and suitability and it should be a key reference point throughout the evaluation process without a clear understanding of the purpose it becomes difficult to communicate credibility and generate trust in the modelling work furthermore it may be sensible to evaluate the same model against quite different patterns or data when applied for different purposes defining the aims and objectives of the model application early in the research process can save time for instance with the realisation that objectives may depend on key processes for which the model of choice lacks functionality the aims and objectives of a model application should be stated in simple clear language we suggest using active sentences e g construct produce test document and avoid vague wordings e g explore study investigate beware that ambiguity in the description of the purpose of a model often leads to multiple subjective interpretations of whether an outcome was successful or not parker 2020 this hinders a reliable evaluation process the following questions guide the reporting of objectives 1 what are the objectives of the model application 2 why is the model suitable to address the objectives 3 what would count as successful in achieving these objectives 2 1 2 specific model setup ideally the ecological model has already been fully described following a standardized protocol such as the odd it is possible that the original description is adequate for a new application of the model but specific applications may also require adjustments of the model structure parameters or assumptions assumptions are particularly important to report when the model is used to perform predictions at other points in time and space which requires that the model has some degree of transferability wenger and olden 2012 yates et al 2018 this is the case when the objective of the model is to produce forecasts or to predict ecosystem properties in one region based on a model developed in another it is wise to explicitly state what lies behind the often implicit assumption of ceteris paribus everything else being equal for example are trophic interactions assumed to follow the same rules in different regions are spatial distributions or environmental conditions assumed to be unchanged in the future when models are used for conditional forecasting one should also report assumptions about expected changes that can affect the system studied for example how are possible future changes in water temperature fishing effort accidental oil spill or increase in noise due to shipping represented in the model a model can be revised to better reproduce the ecological components or processes that are relevant to a new application it is also possible that revised model structure estimates of input parameters or new data on the forcing conditions of the model become available all these updates should be reported in this section which describes any changes or additions which have been made since the original model description 4 are there any deviations from the original model description a in the model assumptions b in the model structure e g addition of submodels variables components modifications of spatial or temporal scales c in the model details e g changes in parameter values functional relationships d in the model forcing e g initial conditions boundary conditions forcing time series and maps 2 2 patterns 2 2 1 selected patterns a pattern may be defined as a characteristic and clearly identifiable structure in nature or in data extracted from nature e g population cycles animal space use species diversity etc that can be attributed to a generative process levin 1992 grimm et al 1996 thus defined a pattern is key to ecological understanding and prediction ecological patterns emerge from multiple ecological processes which operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales and levels of organization individual population community and ecosystem understanding the causal mechanisms responsible for pattern formation is a primary goal of ecology levin 1992 modelling complex adaptive systems see levin 1992 such as marine ecosystems is challenging but pattern orientated modelling pom may facilitate the task grimm et al 1996 2005 grimm and railsback 2012 pom starts with identifying a set of patterns observed at multiple scales and levels that characterize a system with respect to the particular problem being modelled grimm and railsback 2012 in other words the selection of patterns to be used in model evaluation depends on the objective s or hypothesis of the study relevant ecological patterns may be related to numbers biomass production or consumption of relevant ecological entities to dynamic behaviour at equilibrium or to character of state transitions in perturbation studies or in systems undergoing change e g beisner et al 2003 other examples are spatial patterns such as spatial synchrony or travelling waves e g sherratt and smith 2008 more complex emerging patterns e g spatial structure described by a variogram degree of spatial overlap between species may also be candidate targets for model evaluation the selection of specific patterns is motivated by the objectives of the modelling application and is generally driven by the hypotheses that can explain the emergence of these patterns as pointed by cury et al 2008 it might be relatively easy to reproduce a single ecological pattern with all kinds of alternative models but simultaneously reproducing an entire set of patterns is much more demanding and requires that the model is structurally realistic rather than tying a model to a specific pattern via heavy calibration it can be more useful consider several weak patterns at the same time because then the risk that we force the model to look right but for the wrong reasons is reduced this is particularly true in the case of complex ecosystem models which include many processes and parameters that can be adjusted to tune the model to few selected outputs while some patterns may be used to inform the model construction e g some empirical relationships between ecological variables other are emergent properties of the model model evaluation based on these emergent patterns may be of greater interest since models that succeed in getting emergent patterns right may also have greater potential for transferability to other time place or systems radchuk et al 2019 it is therefore critical to report on the selection of patterns and on the justification for this selection 5 which ecological patterns are used for the model evaluation a temporal patterns such as cycles regime shift or trends measures of temporal variability and autocorrelation b spatial patterns such as spatial synchrony travelling waves patchiness and autocorrelation c structural and functional patterns such as taxonomic diversity biomass ratios integrated production diet fractions and trait distributions d other relevant patterns 6 why are these patterns important essential to address the objectives in the following part of the ope one must describe the data used for evaluation purposes which can include both data from the model output and data which are independent of the model information on data used for model building should be provided in the model description typically an odd protocol and data used for optimization should be reported in the optimization description e g in an oddo protocol mahévas 2019 2 2 2 independent data independent data that is data that exists independently of the model being built are often derived from field observations and procedures for collecting and processing these observations should briefly be summarized in this part of the ope relevant information includes i whether the data originate from a dedicated field survey an open database or another model ii the spatial temporal taxonomic etc extent and resolution of the data iii data representativeness and iv accuracy precision bias or uncertainty data representativeness is the degree to which data can be used to represent the ecological patterns that are relevant for the objective of the study for example daily weekly or monthly time series will have different representativeness if the ecological pattern of interest is related to phenology similarly the representativeness of data collected at a single sampling station is also expected to vary with the spatial scale of the ecological question of concern being more representative for small scale modelling studies centred around the sampling station than for larger scale investigations deriving ecological patterns section 2 2 1 from observations can involve extensive data processing and this should be reported here when the same type of data can be used for model optimisation and evaluation as in cross validation this should be reported in this section in some cases although the data is collected independently of the model being built the model and data may not be completely independent from each other for example knowledge from historical data used to build the model or input data in an ecopath model is also expressed as an output of the model and this should be reported the following questions guide the collection of information about the independent data used to evaluate the model given selected pattern s 7 where do the independent data originate from e g field survey open database another model 8 what are the extent and resolution of the independent data spatially temporally taxonomically 9 how representative of the ecological process are the independent data 10 are there estimates of independent data accuracy precision bias or uncertainty 11 how are the independent data processed to represent the selected patterns are assumptions made to derive these patterns from the data 2 2 3 model outputs often only parts of the model outputs are used in a specific application and the aim of this section is to describe which outputs have been used and evaluated in some cases the data may be post processed e g aggregation of results by guild geographical region or integration in time the purpose of post processing can be to generate indicators of the relevant patterns ex species spatial distribution biomass ratios index of seasonality see section 2 2 1 or to generate model outputs that are comparable with independent data section 2 2 2 the post processing step can require new assumptions e g assume that conversion rates such as c chla are constant in time space taxa the aim of this section is to describe the selection of model outputs the post processing operations and to report on quality quantity representativeness uncertainties or potential bias in the model outputs 12 which model outputs are used for the evaluation 13 have the outputs been post processed and how 14 are there estimates of model outputs accuracy precision bias or uncertainty 15 are additional assumptions made when deriving patterns from model outputs 2 3 evaluation 2 3 1 evaluation methodology we refer here to the evaluation method applied in the context of a specific application of a model to address stated objectives section 2 1 1 model verification sensu gräbner 2018 the act of testing whether the model does what it is supposed to do i e that it is technically functional should precede any application of the model and is not considered here a first model evaluation step is often to conduct sanity checks these are rapid explorations of the model outputs which ensure that even though the model is technically functional it is not behaving poorly sanity checks are often non quantitative and based on domain knowledge rather than on quantitative comparisons of observations vs model outputs though these are not often reported in model evaluation procedures they inform about key conditions that the model must satisfy to be considered useful examples of sanity checks can include an inspection that population sizes or biomasses are within plausible ranges that seasonal patterns are plausible or that emerging spatial patterns are visually credible these can be done via fermi estimations often referred to as back of the envelope calculations of plausible ranges sanity checks are often performed in an unformal way and the intention of this section is to clarify and document this step in cases when no sanity checks are performed this should be justified 16 are sanity checks conducted if so what is the method used if not explain why a which data and patterns are used for this b does this apply to patterns that are not otherwise evaluated for this model application the core of the evaluation process is the comparison of patterns emerging from model outputs against those obtained from independent observations this first raises the issue of the comparability between independent observations and model outputs i e whether model outputs and independent data are directly comparable and whether modelled patterns are directly comparable to observed patterns for example are modelled biomass integrated over a large continuous geographical domain comparable with biomass field observations from a limited number of sampling sites the second issue is the methodology used to compare ecological patterns derived from observations to those derived from the model there can be many methodological approaches ranging from qualitative visual comparisons to fully quantitative estimates of the model performance at reproducing observed patterns allen and somerfield 2009 bennett et al 2013 the latter can include univariate or multivariate approaches and can be based on error based measures information theory measures parametric tests non parametric tests distance based measures and combined measures hora and campos 2015 this stage of the evaluation is sometimes referred to as skill assessment the choice of methods and metrics used in model skills evaluation will depend on the relevant patterns for example when dealing with cycles the degree of congruence between modelled and observed cycles amplitude and frequency should be reported when modelling state transitions agreement in the rate of change of a trend should be reported with ecosystem models addressing ecological stability or temporal variability the stability measure should be reported at multiple levels of organisation e g species functional group community etc the quantitative criteria to evaluate the match between observed and simulated patterns must be reported for example if the mean of the simulations is within a certain range e g 1 standard deviation of the observed pattern the model satisfactorily addresses the pattern e g kramer schadt et al 2007 the selection or lack of selection of particular skill assessment methods can also be partially dictated by existing skills available software or discipline culture and habits some evaluation methods may have been tried without success in those cases one should report on the attempted evaluation steps with some discussion on how and why these were deemed unsuccessful each methodology usually comes with associated assumptions that need fulfilling for the method to be valid and these should also be reported here the core issue at the end of the evaluation process is whether the model outputs can be considered satisfying for the purpose of answering the modelling objective i e that the grounds on which a model is declared good enough are clearly articulated oreskes 1998 17 what is the methodology used to compare ecological patterns derived from independent data with patterns derived from the model a what is the rationale for choosing this method b how are observational and or model output uncertainties handled c does the methodology rely on specific assumptions d were other methods experimented if they didn t succeed explain why 18 is there a threshold level in the match between observed and modelled patterns that can separate acceptable from unacceptable models 19 how comparable are the patterns derived from the model and those derived from the independent data by answering the above questions researchers should also discuss if there are patterns that cannot be well evaluated with the chosen method 2 3 2 sensitivities we distinguish between two types of sensitivities to be reported first model sensitivity which is the result of a sensitivity analysis sa usually performed on model structure and parameters second evaluation method sensitivity which refers to the sensitivity of the model evaluation to the choice of evaluation methodology and available observational data sensitivity analysis scrutinizes how variations in model inputs influence variations in model outputs a fundamental step in model evaluation and corroboration epa 2009 a sensitivity analysis informs about which input parameters the model is most sensitive to and therefore which parameters should be obtained with greater precision and accuracy and about the relative importance of processes in the model a diverse array of sa approaches has been developed to help cope with the various needs dictated by differing model assumptions computational complexity and availability of relevant information saltelli et al 2004 epa 2009 reviews and guidelines for best sa practice in the context of ecological and environmental modelling are an important aid to sa planning implementation and reporting saltelli et al 2004 a 2021 epa 2009 thiele et al 2014 pianosi et al 2016 attributes of sa methods worth considering in reporting include independence of model linearity and additivity assumptions ability to address interaction effects amongst input factors capacity to handle differences in scale and shape of input probability distribution functions ability to deal with differences in input spatial and temporal dimensions and capacity to evaluate the effect of an input while all other inputs are allowed to vary as well frey 2002 saltelli et al 2004 in this section one should consider the sensitivity of the model outputs that are relevant to the objective of the study i e the modelled patterns section 2 2 3 priority should be given to reporting sensitivity analyses that were conducted specifically for the model application sensitivity analyses performed in earlier stages of model development can be reported if also relevant for the objective s of the study 20 has a model sensitivity analysis been performed if so how if not explain why a on the model structure b on the model parametrization c on other aspects of the model 21 which elements are the modelled patterns most sensitive to a input parameters b priors and assumptions c structural elements d processes 22 how sensitive are the modelled patterns to the choice of initial conditions boundary conditions spatial and temporal resolution while there is no perfect model to address a specific ecological question there is no perfect method either to evaluate the performance of a model makridakis et al 2020 typically the choice of the sensitivity analyses depends on the availability of observational data with which the model can be compared on the computational requirements to perform certain types of model evaluation on the availability of evaluation methodologies to the modellers and on modellers skill sets this section reports on the rationale and criteria for choosing a particular approach to evaluate the model performance it stresses when the choices are dictated by the objectives of the study as opposed to computational constraints lack of relevant information or other considerations for example models with complex architecture and high computational costs two common features for ecosystem models steenbeek et al 2021 impose restrictions on the exploration of the parameter space this in turns limits the scope for global sa and simultaneous exploration of known sources of uncertainty which are two desirable features of sa this section also reports on how sensitive the evaluation method is to the data used for evaluation section 2 4 could the model evaluation give significantly different results if supported by other new more precise data or if other skill assessment methods had been used it is also the place where one can report failed attempts to evaluate the model or discuss possible future development in evaluation methodology alternative or complementary approaches to standard sensitivity analyses e g robustness analysis thiele and grimm 2015 grimm and berger 2016 can also be reported here in summary this section highlights the relevant attributes of the model evaluation caveats possible limitations and possible developments clarifying the performance of the model evaluation in relation to the objectives 23 how sensitive is the model evaluation to availability and uncertainty of the independent data 24 how much is the model evaluation constrained by computational or theoretical limits 25 how does the perceived performance of the model depend on the chosen evaluation methodology 3 ope template as a practical tool we provide in table 1 a summary of the ope protocol which highlights the main sections of the protocol the 25 questions as well as guidelines on how to answer them we also provide in supplementary material s1 a word template that can be used to provide information relevant to a modelling study 4 applications we provide in the supplementary material s2 examples of applications of the ope protocol in the context of six modelling applications 1 an individual based model ibm used to quantify uncertainties in the estimates of mean biomass of the copepod calanus finmarchicus as a function of sampling design hjøllo et al 2021 2 a statistical food web model used to quantify the association between capelin mallotus villosus and its main two prey krill and calanus species stige et al 2018 3 simulations from the non deterministic network dynamics ndnd model to assess the persistence of trophic controls in the barents sea sivel et al 2021 4 an ecopath model to estimate trophic positions for ecological groups in the barents sea pedersen 2022 5 the nordic and barents seas atlantis model noba simulations to assess cumulative impact of fisheries and climate in the norwegian and barents seas hansen et al 2019 and 6 the reconstructions and predictions of selected physical and biogeochemical properties using the norcpm1 model in the barents sea bethke et al 2021 these case studies cover a range of modelling practices modelling tools and study objectives knowledge about context within which a model is developed and of the history of the model development is essential to understand the evaluation approach we realise that the ope case studies presented in this manuscript can be difficult to read without prior knowledge of each model context and history in stand alone modelling studies model descriptions would normally be provided in full but this is not the case here to correct for this we included introductory paragraphs that describe the models that were used in each case study and provide a brief history of the models i e where they originate from and how they evolved to finally be used in the current case studies 5 discussion the ope protocol as we present it here is complementing other reporting protocols in particular the odd protocol and the extensions e g oddo odd d by focusing on the model evaluation we argue that such a protocol can significantly contribute to improving model evaluation and can in general increase transparency and reproducibility of published models following oreskes 1998 augusiak et al 2014 edmonds et al 2019 grimm et al 2020a parker 2020 and others we contend that model evaluation is purpose dependant and that a clear description of the purpose of a modelling application must be an integral part of the evaluation process whether the model goal is pedagogical explanatory or predictive model evaluation is essential and should accompany all model studies we have therefore developed the ope protocol for model evaluation which is generic enough to apply to a wide range of ecological modelling studies from coupled physical chemical biological systems norwecom e2e norcpm1 atlantis to simpler models focussed on food webs interactions ndnd ecopath gompertz in our experience most modellers consider their model as somewhat special i e not like other models and therefore presume that it would be difficult to evaluate models using a standardised protocol like the ope indeed we found that it was often work demanding for modellers to answer the 25 questions of the ope protocol through the six case studies we identified several challenges in documenting the ope documenting model evaluation is not a standard step in most modelling studies lack of experience and training in doing so made it a time consuming and demanding task that required several iterations and substantial amount of thinking and discussion at times the ope exercise was perceived as too time consuming little rewarding in the short term and easy to postpone it was often difficult to find the balance between providing informative answers and remaining concise in several cases it was not always obvious what was the right amount of contextual information required to inform readers about the model the amount of evidence to be presented in support of ope statements was also debated when sensitivity analysis had been performed in earlier studies it could be unclear how much this should be reported at first sight some questions appeared unclear or redundant though these issues were usually resolved after some iterations some questions were also of little relevance for some of the model applications explored here nevertheless it was possible to successfully apply the ope protocol to each specific case study despite the diverse collection of model types we therefore anticipate that the protocol will be applicable to many ecological modelling studies the protocol can be used from the start of a modelling study to guide model evaluation throughout the study though the primary motivation for this protocol was to construct a tool to help modellers reporting how they evaluated their models given specific objectives we found that answering the protocol questions for the individual case studies led to additional discussions and reflections on model evaluation in some instances it was identified that additional evaluation steps could be taken or that some steps in the evaluation process could have been better specified in the case of the gompertz case study documenting the ope revealed that posterior predictive checks could have been considered to improve the evaluation in the ndnd case study it was only after the ope was documented that the issue of determining a threshold between acceptable and unacceptable models became clear in the noba case study it became apparent that many aspects of model evaluation for a complex end to end model like atlantis were still under developed and that the ope could guide future work towards improved model evaluation methodology in all case studies the ope helped to clarify existing evaluation procedures and identify possible improvements had the ope been available at the start of these studies the model evaluation would likely have been conducted more thoroughly a lesson learned from the exercise is that documenting the ope is more easily done if modellers take relevant notes about model evaluation while developing their model rather than leaving the ope questionnaire to the end this highlights the potential utility of the ope to stimulate higher standard of model evaluation in addition to its original goal of merely reporting how evaluation was conducted it is important to note that the ope protocol goes far beyond model skill assessment assessing the prediction skill of ecological models has been the focus of recent literature see e g stow et al 2009 olsen et al 2016 steenbeek et al 2021 and references therein skill assessment is an integral part of model evaluation and is clearly identified in the first part of the evaluation section of the ope protocol questions 17 19 the ope protocol expands beyond skill assessment by addressing issues related to objective patterns data and sensitivity analyses and puts balanced focus on these different elements documenting model evaluation is not yet standard practice the 25 questions outlined in the ope protocol are a guide to present an extensive but not exhaustive description of a model evaluation a full description of the evaluation is often too long to be included in the core part of a published manuscript we advocate that the ope documentation be presented as a technical supplement by documenting the details of the model evaluation procedure the ope provides essential information for the peer review of a modelling study and directly contributes to higher transparency even when not all ope questions are answered it makes sense to present an ope we encourage modellers to try the ope protocol by using the word template s1 and get help and inspiration from the answers provided in the six case studies s2 we also encourage reviewers to use the ope questions as a guide when evaluating modelling studies the current ope template is qualitative thus providing high flexibility in reporting but makes the evaluation report hard to appraise or to enter in automated systems that prefer numbers over free text possible future developments of the ope may focus on adding standardised evaluation metrics or standardised evaluation vocabularies that could be automatically populated while performing evaluation exercises this in turn would facilitate analyses and comparisons within and between models further development of the ope might also include other aspects of model evaluation that were not explicitly addressed here such as robustness analysis grimm and berger 2016 the questionnaire structure could possibly be hierarchised to highlight questions that have the highest priority e g questions 1 2 3 and 19 or it could eventually be formally linked to other existing tools like trace grimm et al 2014 ayllón et al 2021 as noted by grimm et al 2014 building a culture of model reporting is about doing all these things as well as you can because you know that peers and model clients are expecting you to there is no point any more in complaining about additional effort for these things we recognise that we are not there yet promoting the ope and similar documentation during the peer review process would help in getting this culture in place the current version of the ope protocol is a work in progress model evaluation is complex and the development of tools for reporting how evaluation is conducted is not a simple problem the case studies presented here all originate from high latitude marine ecosystem modelling research which reflects the expertise of the authors further applications of the ope will show how much the experience gained from developing and applying the ope protocol on these few examples can benefit other modelling approaches on other ecological system types during the discussions that formed the basis for the current protocol a central point was that modellers have various cultures experiences and practices when it comes to model evaluation these points of view are not always easy to reconcile with each other further discussions based on the use of the protocol on a wider range of models are expected to lead to revisions of the ope protocol in the future 6 conclusion the ope protocol is proposed as a tool to report the evaluation of ecological models the reporting template is organised along 25 questions which make it easier and faster for modellers to report model evaluation the ope structure further promotes comprehensive reporting of the evaluation process ranging from objectives to data skill assessment and sensitivity analyses our experience is that structured reporting of model evaluation helps modellers to think more deeply about the evaluation of their models from this last point we suggest that it would be highly beneficial for modellers to consider the ope early in the modelling

24395,numerical models of ecological systems are increasingly used to address complex environmental and resource management questions one challenge for scientists managers and stakeholders is to appraise how well suited these models are to answer questions of scientific or societal relevance that is to perform communicate or access transparent evaluations of ecological models while there have been substantial developments to support standardised descriptions of ecological models less has been done to standardise and to report model evaluation practices we present here a general protocol designed to guide the reporting of model evaluation the protocol is organised in three major parts the objective s of the modelling application the ecological patterns of relevance and the evaluation methodology proper and is termed the ope objectives patterns evaluation protocol we present the 25 questions of the ope protocol which address the many aspects of the evaluation process and then apply them to six case studies based on a diversity of ecological models in addition to standardising and increasing the transparency of the model evaluation process we find that going through the ope protocol helps modellers to think more deeply about the evaluation of their models from this last point we suggest that it would be highly beneficial for modellers to consider the ope early in the modelling process in addition to using it as a reporting tool and as a reviewing tool keywords standardisation best practice ecological patterns skill assessment transparency data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction scientists managers and stakeholders increasingly rely on numerical models of ecological systems one challenge is to appraise the efficiency of these models to tackle complex environmental questions providing clear evaluations of model performance is one way to address this challenge models can be constructed analysed and used by different actors from scientists to policymakers and these actors have different understandings and expectations from models assessing how good a model is at addressing specific problems is difficult when ecological modellers use a variety of model types have different modelling cultures and practices and use different vocabularies this can hinder communication transparency reproducibility and the general development of good practices within the modelling community it is therefore essential to provide tools to support a collective understanding of what can be expected from a model and how a model is to be evaluated cartwright et al 2016 eker et al 2018 heymans et al 2020 transparency and reproducibility are at the core of the scientific method however the complexity of the tools used to observe and model ecological systems challenges reproducibility and transparency powers and hampton 2019 the ongoing so called reproducibility or replicability crisis reflects this difficulty the crisis has primarily been identified in the fields of psychology pashler and wagenmakers 2012 clinical studies begley and ioannidis john 2015 and economics camerer et al 2016 and is much less discussed in ecological research but see ives 2018 nichols et al 2019 2021 it may not be possible to strictly replicate ecological observations but transparency in workflow and data analyses can facilitate reproducibility it should be possible to reproduce ecological model simulations given that the relevant information is provided for that purpose in addition to replicating a model and the associated simulations it is equally important to be able to understand assess and replicate how model performance was evaluated this step is critical given that almost every new method published claims to outperform existing ones but are seldom re evaluated boulesteix et al 2020 providing relevant and comprehensive information is a first step towards replicability which needs to be complemented by appropriate communication and quality standards how is the information communicated is it accessible is it unambiguous is it sufficient a standardised protocol for reporting model evaluation procedures would address these questions and contribute to increased transparency and reproducibility of ecological models there have been considerable collective efforts in recent decades to develop standardized modelling practices from model building to evaluation of model performances a major advancement has been the development of standardised protocols such as the odd overview design concepts and details grimm et al 2006 the odd protocol was originally developed to respond to the lack of a standard protocol for describing individual based models ibms the protocol was reviewed and updated twice since its original publication grimm et al 2010 2020b and it is now commonly used by ecological modellers beyond the original ibm community to describe their models in reports and publications the odd protocol has been inspirational to groups of modellers with diverse focus such as on model optimisation oddo mahévas 2019 data mapping odd 2d laatabi et al 2018 and inclusion of human decisions odd d müller et al 2013 in each case these groups have borrowed from the original odd protocol idea and extended it for their specific purpose thereby contributing to the harmonisation and communication of modelling practices a major step in the development and application of ecological models is the evaluation phase there exists a large body of literature on how to perform model evaluation for various classes of models e g stow et al 2009 allen and somerfield 2009 bennett et al 2013 conn et al 2018 hipsey et al 2020 but much less work has been done to standardise the reporting of model evaluations the trace transparent and comprehensive ecological modelling documentation grimm et al 2014 is a notable exception which provides a framework for documenting the modelling process including several aspects of model evaluation standardised protocols for reporting model evaluation can constitute useful tools for modellers and end users to easily understand and compare evaluation procedures and appreciate the performance of models in relation to specific objectives making such tools available is therefore anticipated to benefit the scientific community and model end users the issue of model validation and evaluation in environmental science has been the subject of extensive research and debate oreskes 1998 argued that quantitative models cannot be validated but only evaluated in oreskes view evaluation is described as an assessment in which both positive and negative results are possible and where the grounds on which a model is declared good enough are clearly articulated this assessment implies an examination of model outputs against pre specified performance criteria in the literature the term model validation has remained pervasive eker et al 2019 although often overlapping with the concept of evaluation as originally presented by oreskes in their 10 step procedure for developing and evaluating environmental models jakeman et al 2006 introduced a stepwise approach in which every stage is open to critical review and revision in consort with end users the evaluation step is left to the end and is concerned with the model being fit for purpose although the criteria for achieving this goal are not fully developed by these authors more recently parker 2020 explores the meaning of a model being adequate for purpose for different classes of models whether pedagogical explanatory or predictive in the works of jakeman and parker model evaluation is primarily achieved by measuring the performance of a model against pre specified objectives thereby following the original argument of oreskes this excludes the idea of a general validity of a model and favours the principle of an evaluation of a model for a specific objective or a set of objectives this mirrors george box s notorious statement that all models are wrong the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful box and draper 1987 where useful implies use and therefore purpose this is also in line with augusiak s review of the literature on model evaluation and validation which concludes that despite little agreement on terms and underlying notions in the literature it has repeatedly been pointed out that the evaluation of a model should depend on its purpose augusiak et al 2014 evaluating that an ecological model is fit for purpose implies that the same model can and should be evaluated each time it is used for a new purpose this is a rather trivial implication of the fit for purpose evaluation however examples of re evaluation of the performance of complex ecological models are scarce complex ecological models require extensive development efforts and these materialise in the first publication of the model together with a global evaluation or validation of the model see e g radach and moll 2006 link et al 2010 travers trolet et al 2014 pedersen et al 2021 a fit for purpose approach would require that this first model evaluation be revised and reported for each new application of the model one challenge in doing so is that the task of reporting model evaluation which is already substantial when the model is first published may seem daunting if it is to be repeated for every new model application this can possibly be eased by reporting primarily on aspects of the model evaluation that are specific to each new application an additional help can be provided by following a template in which a set of questions can guide the modeller through the reporting process by taking inspiration from the success and utility of the odd protocol and the following extensions we here present a complementary protocol for the reporting of ecological model evaluation procedures the ope objectives patterns evaluation protocol we discuss the rationale for the different elements of this protocol and provide a list of questions that can guide modellers to report in ope format we summarise the protocol table 1 and provide an easy to use word template to support documenting model evaluations supplementary material s1 finally we test the protocol on six case studies taken from a collection of marine ecosystem models with which the authors are familiar these case studies are presented in detail in the supplementary material s2 these modelling applications pre existed the ope protocol the ope has therefore not been used to guide the model evaluations presented here but only to report how these evaluations were performed 2 elements of the ope protocol the elements of the ope protocol are divided into three sections objectives patterns and evaluation each section is then divided in subsections which contain one to six questions 2 1 objectives 2 1 1 context and motivations in our experience many ecological models are not developed with the sole purpose of answering a single well circumscribed question rather complex ecological models take time to develop are often built to address multiple and sometimes diffuse purposes and are gradually applied to a range of questions fulton et al 2011 planque and mullon 2020 for example dynamic global vegetation models dgvm which were originally conceived to assess ecosystem level responses to atmospheric co2 concentration prentice et al 2000 have later been applied to deliver projections based on future climate scenarios sitch et al 2008 and are being continuously developed to address new questions such as the impacts of different management practices on terrestrial ecosystems prentice et al 2007 in a similar fashion the ecosystem model atlantis developed for the northwest atlantic shelf link et al 2010 was first used to explore the combined effects of climate and fishing nye et al 2013 then to address the impact of ocean acidification fay et al 2017 and more recently to quantify combined effects of acidification fishing and marine protection olsen et al 2018 models of natural systems are inevitably embedded with multiple sources of uncertainty and modellers make decisions during model construction e g on which processes to include or simplify which will affect the final outcome babel et al 2019 there is a risk that assumptions which are reasonable for one particular model application are inadequate for another parker 2020 saltelli et al 2020 it is therefore essential that model suitability and performance are assessed and described for each application and a crucial first step is describing the purpose of the specific application in other words to evaluate that a model is fit for purpose one must first specify the purpose in this contribution we refer to model as the generic description of the modelling tool e g ecopath with ecosim polovina 1984a 1984b christensen and walters 2004 we use the terms goal purpose and objective in an interchangeable manner to express the motivation driving the study and we refer to a model application when the model is applied towards a pre defined objective or set of objectives central in the ope framework is our conception that it is sensical to evaluate the same model against different patterns or data when applied for different purposes describing the main objectives of the study and how modelling will contribute to reach these objectives is perhaps the most crucial step in evaluating model performance and suitability and it should be a key reference point throughout the evaluation process without a clear understanding of the purpose it becomes difficult to communicate credibility and generate trust in the modelling work furthermore it may be sensible to evaluate the same model against quite different patterns or data when applied for different purposes defining the aims and objectives of the model application early in the research process can save time for instance with the realisation that objectives may depend on key processes for which the model of choice lacks functionality the aims and objectives of a model application should be stated in simple clear language we suggest using active sentences e g construct produce test document and avoid vague wordings e g explore study investigate beware that ambiguity in the description of the purpose of a model often leads to multiple subjective interpretations of whether an outcome was successful or not parker 2020 this hinders a reliable evaluation process the following questions guide the reporting of objectives 1 what are the objectives of the model application 2 why is the model suitable to address the objectives 3 what would count as successful in achieving these objectives 2 1 2 specific model setup ideally the ecological model has already been fully described following a standardized protocol such as the odd it is possible that the original description is adequate for a new application of the model but specific applications may also require adjustments of the model structure parameters or assumptions assumptions are particularly important to report when the model is used to perform predictions at other points in time and space which requires that the model has some degree of transferability wenger and olden 2012 yates et al 2018 this is the case when the objective of the model is to produce forecasts or to predict ecosystem properties in one region based on a model developed in another it is wise to explicitly state what lies behind the often implicit assumption of ceteris paribus everything else being equal for example are trophic interactions assumed to follow the same rules in different regions are spatial distributions or environmental conditions assumed to be unchanged in the future when models are used for conditional forecasting one should also report assumptions about expected changes that can affect the system studied for example how are possible future changes in water temperature fishing effort accidental oil spill or increase in noise due to shipping represented in the model a model can be revised to better reproduce the ecological components or processes that are relevant to a new application it is also possible that revised model structure estimates of input parameters or new data on the forcing conditions of the model become available all these updates should be reported in this section which describes any changes or additions which have been made since the original model description 4 are there any deviations from the original model description a in the model assumptions b in the model structure e g addition of submodels variables components modifications of spatial or temporal scales c in the model details e g changes in parameter values functional relationships d in the model forcing e g initial conditions boundary conditions forcing time series and maps 2 2 patterns 2 2 1 selected patterns a pattern may be defined as a characteristic and clearly identifiable structure in nature or in data extracted from nature e g population cycles animal space use species diversity etc that can be attributed to a generative process levin 1992 grimm et al 1996 thus defined a pattern is key to ecological understanding and prediction ecological patterns emerge from multiple ecological processes which operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales and levels of organization individual population community and ecosystem understanding the causal mechanisms responsible for pattern formation is a primary goal of ecology levin 1992 modelling complex adaptive systems see levin 1992 such as marine ecosystems is challenging but pattern orientated modelling pom may facilitate the task grimm et al 1996 2005 grimm and railsback 2012 pom starts with identifying a set of patterns observed at multiple scales and levels that characterize a system with respect to the particular problem being modelled grimm and railsback 2012 in other words the selection of patterns to be used in model evaluation depends on the objective s or hypothesis of the study relevant ecological patterns may be related to numbers biomass production or consumption of relevant ecological entities to dynamic behaviour at equilibrium or to character of state transitions in perturbation studies or in systems undergoing change e g beisner et al 2003 other examples are spatial patterns such as spatial synchrony or travelling waves e g sherratt and smith 2008 more complex emerging patterns e g spatial structure described by a variogram degree of spatial overlap between species may also be candidate targets for model evaluation the selection of specific patterns is motivated by the objectives of the modelling application and is generally driven by the hypotheses that can explain the emergence of these patterns as pointed by cury et al 2008 it might be relatively easy to reproduce a single ecological pattern with all kinds of alternative models but simultaneously reproducing an entire set of patterns is much more demanding and requires that the model is structurally realistic rather than tying a model to a specific pattern via heavy calibration it can be more useful consider several weak patterns at the same time because then the risk that we force the model to look right but for the wrong reasons is reduced this is particularly true in the case of complex ecosystem models which include many processes and parameters that can be adjusted to tune the model to few selected outputs while some patterns may be used to inform the model construction e g some empirical relationships between ecological variables other are emergent properties of the model model evaluation based on these emergent patterns may be of greater interest since models that succeed in getting emergent patterns right may also have greater potential for transferability to other time place or systems radchuk et al 2019 it is therefore critical to report on the selection of patterns and on the justification for this selection 5 which ecological patterns are used for the model evaluation a temporal patterns such as cycles regime shift or trends measures of temporal variability and autocorrelation b spatial patterns such as spatial synchrony travelling waves patchiness and autocorrelation c structural and functional patterns such as taxonomic diversity biomass ratios integrated production diet fractions and trait distributions d other relevant patterns 6 why are these patterns important essential to address the objectives in the following part of the ope one must describe the data used for evaluation purposes which can include both data from the model output and data which are independent of the model information on data used for model building should be provided in the model description typically an odd protocol and data used for optimization should be reported in the optimization description e g in an oddo protocol mahévas 2019 2 2 2 independent data independent data that is data that exists independently of the model being built are often derived from field observations and procedures for collecting and processing these observations should briefly be summarized in this part of the ope relevant information includes i whether the data originate from a dedicated field survey an open database or another model ii the spatial temporal taxonomic etc extent and resolution of the data iii data representativeness and iv accuracy precision bias or uncertainty data representativeness is the degree to which data can be used to represent the ecological patterns that are relevant for the objective of the study for example daily weekly or monthly time series will have different representativeness if the ecological pattern of interest is related to phenology similarly the representativeness of data collected at a single sampling station is also expected to vary with the spatial scale of the ecological question of concern being more representative for small scale modelling studies centred around the sampling station than for larger scale investigations deriving ecological patterns section 2 2 1 from observations can involve extensive data processing and this should be reported here when the same type of data can be used for model optimisation and evaluation as in cross validation this should be reported in this section in some cases although the data is collected independently of the model being built the model and data may not be completely independent from each other for example knowledge from historical data used to build the model or input data in an ecopath model is also expressed as an output of the model and this should be reported the following questions guide the collection of information about the independent data used to evaluate the model given selected pattern s 7 where do the independent data originate from e g field survey open database another model 8 what are the extent and resolution of the independent data spatially temporally taxonomically 9 how representative of the ecological process are the independent data 10 are there estimates of independent data accuracy precision bias or uncertainty 11 how are the independent data processed to represent the selected patterns are assumptions made to derive these patterns from the data 2 2 3 model outputs often only parts of the model outputs are used in a specific application and the aim of this section is to describe which outputs have been used and evaluated in some cases the data may be post processed e g aggregation of results by guild geographical region or integration in time the purpose of post processing can be to generate indicators of the relevant patterns ex species spatial distribution biomass ratios index of seasonality see section 2 2 1 or to generate model outputs that are comparable with independent data section 2 2 2 the post processing step can require new assumptions e g assume that conversion rates such as c chla are constant in time space taxa the aim of this section is to describe the selection of model outputs the post processing operations and to report on quality quantity representativeness uncertainties or potential bias in the model outputs 12 which model outputs are used for the evaluation 13 have the outputs been post processed and how 14 are there estimates of model outputs accuracy precision bias or uncertainty 15 are additional assumptions made when deriving patterns from model outputs 2 3 evaluation 2 3 1 evaluation methodology we refer here to the evaluation method applied in the context of a specific application of a model to address stated objectives section 2 1 1 model verification sensu gräbner 2018 the act of testing whether the model does what it is supposed to do i e that it is technically functional should precede any application of the model and is not considered here a first model evaluation step is often to conduct sanity checks these are rapid explorations of the model outputs which ensure that even though the model is technically functional it is not behaving poorly sanity checks are often non quantitative and based on domain knowledge rather than on quantitative comparisons of observations vs model outputs though these are not often reported in model evaluation procedures they inform about key conditions that the model must satisfy to be considered useful examples of sanity checks can include an inspection that population sizes or biomasses are within plausible ranges that seasonal patterns are plausible or that emerging spatial patterns are visually credible these can be done via fermi estimations often referred to as back of the envelope calculations of plausible ranges sanity checks are often performed in an unformal way and the intention of this section is to clarify and document this step in cases when no sanity checks are performed this should be justified 16 are sanity checks conducted if so what is the method used if not explain why a which data and patterns are used for this b does this apply to patterns that are not otherwise evaluated for this model application the core of the evaluation process is the comparison of patterns emerging from model outputs against those obtained from independent observations this first raises the issue of the comparability between independent observations and model outputs i e whether model outputs and independent data are directly comparable and whether modelled patterns are directly comparable to observed patterns for example are modelled biomass integrated over a large continuous geographical domain comparable with biomass field observations from a limited number of sampling sites the second issue is the methodology used to compare ecological patterns derived from observations to those derived from the model there can be many methodological approaches ranging from qualitative visual comparisons to fully quantitative estimates of the model performance at reproducing observed patterns allen and somerfield 2009 bennett et al 2013 the latter can include univariate or multivariate approaches and can be based on error based measures information theory measures parametric tests non parametric tests distance based measures and combined measures hora and campos 2015 this stage of the evaluation is sometimes referred to as skill assessment the choice of methods and metrics used in model skills evaluation will depend on the relevant patterns for example when dealing with cycles the degree of congruence between modelled and observed cycles amplitude and frequency should be reported when modelling state transitions agreement in the rate of change of a trend should be reported with ecosystem models addressing ecological stability or temporal variability the stability measure should be reported at multiple levels of organisation e g species functional group community etc the quantitative criteria to evaluate the match between observed and simulated patterns must be reported for example if the mean of the simulations is within a certain range e g 1 standard deviation of the observed pattern the model satisfactorily addresses the pattern e g kramer schadt et al 2007 the selection or lack of selection of particular skill assessment methods can also be partially dictated by existing skills available software or discipline culture and habits some evaluation methods may have been tried without success in those cases one should report on the attempted evaluation steps with some discussion on how and why these were deemed unsuccessful each methodology usually comes with associated assumptions that need fulfilling for the method to be valid and these should also be reported here the core issue at the end of the evaluation process is whether the model outputs can be considered satisfying for the purpose of answering the modelling objective i e that the grounds on which a model is declared good enough are clearly articulated oreskes 1998 17 what is the methodology used to compare ecological patterns derived from independent data with patterns derived from the model a what is the rationale for choosing this method b how are observational and or model output uncertainties handled c does the methodology rely on specific assumptions d were other methods experimented if they didn t succeed explain why 18 is there a threshold level in the match between observed and modelled patterns that can separate acceptable from unacceptable models 19 how comparable are the patterns derived from the model and those derived from the independent data by answering the above questions researchers should also discuss if there are patterns that cannot be well evaluated with the chosen method 2 3 2 sensitivities we distinguish between two types of sensitivities to be reported first model sensitivity which is the result of a sensitivity analysis sa usually performed on model structure and parameters second evaluation method sensitivity which refers to the sensitivity of the model evaluation to the choice of evaluation methodology and available observational data sensitivity analysis scrutinizes how variations in model inputs influence variations in model outputs a fundamental step in model evaluation and corroboration epa 2009 a sensitivity analysis informs about which input parameters the model is most sensitive to and therefore which parameters should be obtained with greater precision and accuracy and about the relative importance of processes in the model a diverse array of sa approaches has been developed to help cope with the various needs dictated by differing model assumptions computational complexity and availability of relevant information saltelli et al 2004 epa 2009 reviews and guidelines for best sa practice in the context of ecological and environmental modelling are an important aid to sa planning implementation and reporting saltelli et al 2004 a 2021 epa 2009 thiele et al 2014 pianosi et al 2016 attributes of sa methods worth considering in reporting include independence of model linearity and additivity assumptions ability to address interaction effects amongst input factors capacity to handle differences in scale and shape of input probability distribution functions ability to deal with differences in input spatial and temporal dimensions and capacity to evaluate the effect of an input while all other inputs are allowed to vary as well frey 2002 saltelli et al 2004 in this section one should consider the sensitivity of the model outputs that are relevant to the objective of the study i e the modelled patterns section 2 2 3 priority should be given to reporting sensitivity analyses that were conducted specifically for the model application sensitivity analyses performed in earlier stages of model development can be reported if also relevant for the objective s of the study 20 has a model sensitivity analysis been performed if so how if not explain why a on the model structure b on the model parametrization c on other aspects of the model 21 which elements are the modelled patterns most sensitive to a input parameters b priors and assumptions c structural elements d processes 22 how sensitive are the modelled patterns to the choice of initial conditions boundary conditions spatial and temporal resolution while there is no perfect model to address a specific ecological question there is no perfect method either to evaluate the performance of a model makridakis et al 2020 typically the choice of the sensitivity analyses depends on the availability of observational data with which the model can be compared on the computational requirements to perform certain types of model evaluation on the availability of evaluation methodologies to the modellers and on modellers skill sets this section reports on the rationale and criteria for choosing a particular approach to evaluate the model performance it stresses when the choices are dictated by the objectives of the study as opposed to computational constraints lack of relevant information or other considerations for example models with complex architecture and high computational costs two common features for ecosystem models steenbeek et al 2021 impose restrictions on the exploration of the parameter space this in turns limits the scope for global sa and simultaneous exploration of known sources of uncertainty which are two desirable features of sa this section also reports on how sensitive the evaluation method is to the data used for evaluation section 2 4 could the model evaluation give significantly different results if supported by other new more precise data or if other skill assessment methods had been used it is also the place where one can report failed attempts to evaluate the model or discuss possible future development in evaluation methodology alternative or complementary approaches to standard sensitivity analyses e g robustness analysis thiele and grimm 2015 grimm and berger 2016 can also be reported here in summary this section highlights the relevant attributes of the model evaluation caveats possible limitations and possible developments clarifying the performance of the model evaluation in relation to the objectives 23 how sensitive is the model evaluation to availability and uncertainty of the independent data 24 how much is the model evaluation constrained by computational or theoretical limits 25 how does the perceived performance of the model depend on the chosen evaluation methodology 3 ope template as a practical tool we provide in table 1 a summary of the ope protocol which highlights the main sections of the protocol the 25 questions as well as guidelines on how to answer them we also provide in supplementary material s1 a word template that can be used to provide information relevant to a modelling study 4 applications we provide in the supplementary material s2 examples of applications of the ope protocol in the context of six modelling applications 1 an individual based model ibm used to quantify uncertainties in the estimates of mean biomass of the copepod calanus finmarchicus as a function of sampling design hjøllo et al 2021 2 a statistical food web model used to quantify the association between capelin mallotus villosus and its main two prey krill and calanus species stige et al 2018 3 simulations from the non deterministic network dynamics ndnd model to assess the persistence of trophic controls in the barents sea sivel et al 2021 4 an ecopath model to estimate trophic positions for ecological groups in the barents sea pedersen 2022 5 the nordic and barents seas atlantis model noba simulations to assess cumulative impact of fisheries and climate in the norwegian and barents seas hansen et al 2019 and 6 the reconstructions and predictions of selected physical and biogeochemical properties using the norcpm1 model in the barents sea bethke et al 2021 these case studies cover a range of modelling practices modelling tools and study objectives knowledge about context within which a model is developed and of the history of the model development is essential to understand the evaluation approach we realise that the ope case studies presented in this manuscript can be difficult to read without prior knowledge of each model context and history in stand alone modelling studies model descriptions would normally be provided in full but this is not the case here to correct for this we included introductory paragraphs that describe the models that were used in each case study and provide a brief history of the models i e where they originate from and how they evolved to finally be used in the current case studies 5 discussion the ope protocol as we present it here is complementing other reporting protocols in particular the odd protocol and the extensions e g oddo odd d by focusing on the model evaluation we argue that such a protocol can significantly contribute to improving model evaluation and can in general increase transparency and reproducibility of published models following oreskes 1998 augusiak et al 2014 edmonds et al 2019 grimm et al 2020a parker 2020 and others we contend that model evaluation is purpose dependant and that a clear description of the purpose of a modelling application must be an integral part of the evaluation process whether the model goal is pedagogical explanatory or predictive model evaluation is essential and should accompany all model studies we have therefore developed the ope protocol for model evaluation which is generic enough to apply to a wide range of ecological modelling studies from coupled physical chemical biological systems norwecom e2e norcpm1 atlantis to simpler models focussed on food webs interactions ndnd ecopath gompertz in our experience most modellers consider their model as somewhat special i e not like other models and therefore presume that it would be difficult to evaluate models using a standardised protocol like the ope indeed we found that it was often work demanding for modellers to answer the 25 questions of the ope protocol through the six case studies we identified several challenges in documenting the ope documenting model evaluation is not a standard step in most modelling studies lack of experience and training in doing so made it a time consuming and demanding task that required several iterations and substantial amount of thinking and discussion at times the ope exercise was perceived as too time consuming little rewarding in the short term and easy to postpone it was often difficult to find the balance between providing informative answers and remaining concise in several cases it was not always obvious what was the right amount of contextual information required to inform readers about the model the amount of evidence to be presented in support of ope statements was also debated when sensitivity analysis had been performed in earlier studies it could be unclear how much this should be reported at first sight some questions appeared unclear or redundant though these issues were usually resolved after some iterations some questions were also of little relevance for some of the model applications explored here nevertheless it was possible to successfully apply the ope protocol to each specific case study despite the diverse collection of model types we therefore anticipate that the protocol will be applicable to many ecological modelling studies the protocol can be used from the start of a modelling study to guide model evaluation throughout the study though the primary motivation for this protocol was to construct a tool to help modellers reporting how they evaluated their models given specific objectives we found that answering the protocol questions for the individual case studies led to additional discussions and reflections on model evaluation in some instances it was identified that additional evaluation steps could be taken or that some steps in the evaluation process could have been better specified in the case of the gompertz case study documenting the ope revealed that posterior predictive checks could have been considered to improve the evaluation in the ndnd case study it was only after the ope was documented that the issue of determining a threshold between acceptable and unacceptable models became clear in the noba case study it became apparent that many aspects of model evaluation for a complex end to end model like atlantis were still under developed and that the ope could guide future work towards improved model evaluation methodology in all case studies the ope helped to clarify existing evaluation procedures and identify possible improvements had the ope been available at the start of these studies the model evaluation would likely have been conducted more thoroughly a lesson learned from the exercise is that documenting the ope is more easily done if modellers take relevant notes about model evaluation while developing their model rather than leaving the ope questionnaire to the end this highlights the potential utility of the ope to stimulate higher standard of model evaluation in addition to its original goal of merely reporting how evaluation was conducted it is important to note that the ope protocol goes far beyond model skill assessment assessing the prediction skill of ecological models has been the focus of recent literature see e g stow et al 2009 olsen et al 2016 steenbeek et al 2021 and references therein skill assessment is an integral part of model evaluation and is clearly identified in the first part of the evaluation section of the ope protocol questions 17 19 the ope protocol expands beyond skill assessment by addressing issues related to objective patterns data and sensitivity analyses and puts balanced focus on these different elements documenting model evaluation is not yet standard practice the 25 questions outlined in the ope protocol are a guide to present an extensive but not exhaustive description of a model evaluation a full description of the evaluation is often too long to be included in the core part of a published manuscript we advocate that the ope documentation be presented as a technical supplement by documenting the details of the model evaluation procedure the ope provides essential information for the peer review of a modelling study and directly contributes to higher transparency even when not all ope questions are answered it makes sense to present an ope we encourage modellers to try the ope protocol by using the word template s1 and get help and inspiration from the answers provided in the six case studies s2 we also encourage reviewers to use the ope questions as a guide when evaluating modelling studies the current ope template is qualitative thus providing high flexibility in reporting but makes the evaluation report hard to appraise or to enter in automated systems that prefer numbers over free text possible future developments of the ope may focus on adding standardised evaluation metrics or standardised evaluation vocabularies that could be automatically populated while performing evaluation exercises this in turn would facilitate analyses and comparisons within and between models further development of the ope might also include other aspects of model evaluation that were not explicitly addressed here such as robustness analysis grimm and berger 2016 the questionnaire structure could possibly be hierarchised to highlight questions that have the highest priority e g questions 1 2 3 and 19 or it could eventually be formally linked to other existing tools like trace grimm et al 2014 ayllón et al 2021 as noted by grimm et al 2014 building a culture of model reporting is about doing all these things as well as you can because you know that peers and model clients are expecting you to there is no point any more in complaining about additional effort for these things we recognise that we are not there yet promoting the ope and similar documentation during the peer review process would help in getting this culture in place the current version of the ope protocol is a work in progress model evaluation is complex and the development of tools for reporting how evaluation is conducted is not a simple problem the case studies presented here all originate from high latitude marine ecosystem modelling research which reflects the expertise of the authors further applications of the ope will show how much the experience gained from developing and applying the ope protocol on these few examples can benefit other modelling approaches on other ecological system types during the discussions that formed the basis for the current protocol a central point was that modellers have various cultures experiences and practices when it comes to model evaluation these points of view are not always easy to reconcile with each other further discussions based on the use of the protocol on a wider range of models are expected to lead to revisions of the ope protocol in the future 6 conclusion the ope protocol is proposed as a tool to report the evaluation of ecological models the reporting template is organised along 25 questions which make it easier and faster for modellers to report model evaluation the ope structure further promotes comprehensive reporting of the evaluation process ranging from objectives to data skill assessment and sensitivity analyses our experience is that structured reporting of model evaluation helps modellers to think more deeply about the evaluation of their models from this last point we suggest that it would be highly beneficial for modellers to consider the ope early in the modelling process in addition to using it as a reporting tool as we have done here and as a reviewing tool funding this work was funded by the research council of norway through the project nansen legacy rcn no

24396,this study introduces a multi objective programming model for identifying a cropping pattern to evaluate the feasibility of increasing net profit reducing water use and diminishing the environmental impacts simultaneously under life cycle assessment lca the research uses data collected in 2016 2017 through a survey in the east of the lorestan province of iran results indicate that the multi objective cropping pattern reduces environmental indicators including water consumption by 1 global warming potential by 14 and nonrenewable energy use by 14 with no change in farms net profit compared to the current pattern in the region the findings reveal that a designed cropping pattern under the constraints and objectives of lca not only minimizes the environmental impacts but also considers the stability of the benefits in the long term however the currently applied cropping pattern by farmers only focuses on achieving short term profit oriented goals a new approach to land allocation is necessary to produce crops with a reduction in water consumption non renewable energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in the region in this regard it is essential to consider the policies that reduce available water and non renewable resources into government decisions on the other hand policy incentives or disincentives developing support packages of crop pricing insurance and facilities support to prevent the cultivation of crops with high water demand and fertilizer are also essential this proposed planning model should be used as the foundation for long term cropping pattern planning policies in other irrigated and rainfed farming systems around the world keywords multi objective programming non renewable energy mineral extraction optimization net profit life cycle analysis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction agriculture is critical for economic development but it may cause irreversible environmental problems including global warming excessive use of non renewable resources and contamination of water resources with nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizers and pesticides amiri et al 2019 asgharipour et al 2019 although the agricultural system seeks to increase profits agricultural ecosystems must guarantee long term sustainable and stable crop production conservation of primary resources and environmental pollution mitigation vandermeer et al 2011 amiri et al 2020 therefore reducing environmental impacts should be one of the objectives pursued by any agricultural system in addition to the economic and other goals de koeijer et al 2002 nitschelm et al 2016 planning for land allocation to produce crops under such a system is based on a compromise between multiple goals in a cropping pattern cropping patterns refer to an agricultural system with long term economic benefits based on macroeconomic policies food security farmer local knowledge and the most efficient use of regional resources while adhering to ecophysiological crop production and environmental protection principles dury et al 2013 west 2019 mardani najafabadi et al 2019 the planning models analyze the effective management and adjustment of such a cropping pattern at each farm region and national level to find solutions for reducing environmental impacts and increasing profitability galán martín et al 2015 a systemic analysis of the above definition reveals the necessity of using effective programming techniques and models to assess the determinants of agricultural sector policies and their economic effects in this regard cropping patterns simulation using the most significant number of effective methods is necessary to achieve different objectives and planning based on the possibilities and limitations gohar and ward 2010 related scientific literatures classify the optimal decision making models for such situations into multi criteria multi objective competitive objective and multi attribute categories these methods do not result in a consensus on a simple purpose sarker and ray 2009 multi objective programming and decision making processes can use fuzzy logic to homogenize goals elliot et al 2019 sengupta et al 2001 many studies have used this method in multi objective models to boost productivity by ensuring maximum gross profit while limiting irrigation water use nikouei et al 2012 raheli namin et al 2016 and highlighting an environmental approach to inputs including water chemical fertilizers and chemical toxins manos et al 2010 meanwhile thermodynamic techniques such as energy analysis asgharipour et al 2012 exergy accounting chen and chen 2009 emergy synthesis and life cycle assessment i canals et al 2006 are beneficial because they quantify the contribution of environmental products and services to production systems in equivalent units with other inputs odum 1996 in this context several researchers recommend life cycle assessment lca as the best way to analyze agricultural sustainability acosta alba et al 2019 galán martn et al 2017 hospido et al 2012 there are several ways to evaluate the environmental effect of cropping systems in order to study and compare the total environmental load caused by agricultural production systems it is necessary to consider all environmental effects at once hasani et al 2021 lca is a technique used to comprehensively assess the environmental impact of producing a product over its life cycle as a result it can identify and solve problems of production system processes such as resource consumption brentrup et al 2004 in other words this technique is capable of assessing and analyzing environmental implications and locating appropriate routes with minimal environmental impact lca actually analyzes the environmental impacts of agricultural production and finds suitable routes with the most negligible environmental impact patterson et al 2017 esmaeilzadeh et al 2020 this is a comprehensive method of assessing the environmental impacts of a process activity or production by detecting and calculating energy and energy use waste production and distribution of waste on the environment cellura et al 2012 habibi et al 2019 the use of this method allows an accurate evaluation of agricultural systems because of the separate evaluation of processes in production systems in addition to environmental effects esmaeilzadeh et al 2020 the design of agricultural systems with fewer inputs and environmental impacts including greenhouse co2 emissions using methods like lca is necessary for agricultural development mohammadi et al 2014 macwilliam et al 2014 thus it is important to identify a cropping pattern that diminishes environmental impacts including global warming potential nonrenewable energy use and mineral extraction on the other hand it is also necessary to consider increasing the farms net profit and reducing the agricultural water use especially in the irrigated farming system of arid and semi arid regions planners and policymakers must understand how a suitable cropping pattern can meet these goals while model makers must address this question and include various environmental and economic indicators a multi objective programming mop model can evaluate the feasibility of achieving these goals by changing the cropping pattern although numerous studies have widely use of such models e g sarker and ray 2009 manos et al 2010 mardani najafabadi et al 2019 but they have rarely used lca indicators for environmental goal analysis marzban et al 2020 iran is located in the arid and semi arid belt of the earth with one third of the annual rainfall compared to the world average while the long term rainfall trend has decreased over the past five decades with this reduction iran faces 42 7 billion cubic meters of surface water flows in 2018 52 less than in the long term as a result the inflow of runoff to the reservoirs of the country s dams has decreased significantly iran water resources management company 2018 on the other hand on the other hand the value added of agricultural sector of gdp in iran was reported as minimum 5 5 and maximum 12 4 with an average of about 10 since 25 years ago in this regard this sector produces over 90 of food for the country and employs about 20 of the population with the age of over 10 years old fao 2022 statistical centre of iran 2018 these quantitative data clarify the significance of agriculture and its important and essential role in the iran s economy however the cultivated area has increased in this country and it faces over withdrawals from groundwater resources fasakhodi et al 2010 as a result it is necessary to protect existing water resources by introducing a cropping pattern that optimizes water use and reduces environmental impacts in this country in summary the role of agriculture in the country s economic development and environmental hazards underscores the importance of allocating agricultural land for economic and environmental purposes previous studies reveal that two methods lca and mop are appropriate for data processing planning and analyzing this issue iran is an appropriate region to consider these characteristics given the difficulties it faces the novelty of this research is in developing a mop and using lca to address the model s stated environmental goals in irrigated and rainfed farming systems the study area is the irrigated and rainfed farming land in the east of iran s lorestan province fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lorestan province is one of the major agricultural centers of iran ranked 16th among other provinces as the crop producer it has first place in bean production and 12th among cereal producers the study area is a region including azna aligoudarz and dorud cities in the east of lorestan province with 47 881 ha of land under cultivation and 960 830 tons of crop production ministry of agriculture jihad 2018 climate change is one of the main challenges of the agricultural sector in this region like other semi arid regions in the world asgharipour et al 2016 it has a semi humid climate with mild summers and cold winters this climate causes cold and snowy winters while the average annual temperature of azna aligoudarz and dorud is 12 8 11 6 and 14 3 c respectively the average yearly rainfall is 304 264 and 375 mm in azna aligoudarz and dorud respectively these three cities are the top three crop producers in lorestan province with 41271 34481 and 28525 ha of cultivation respectively the main crops produced in this region are wheat barley bean chickpea lentil sugar beet potato and rapeseed wheat and barley account for 78 and 93 of the region s existing irrigated and rainfed cropping patterns chickpea lentil barley and rapeseed crops also make up 22 of the cultivation pattern of irrigated crops and lentils and chickpeas make up about 7 of the rainfed crops of the study area fig 2 this research collected the data required through a review of journals agricultural statistical yearbooks of 2018 2019 and interviews with experts in each city and a field survey through completing a questionnaire from a sample of region farmers using cochran s formula to determine the sample size equation 1 1 n z 2 p q d 2 1 1 n z 2 p q d 2 1 where n is the sample size n is the statistical population of farmers in the region z is the percentage error of the acceptable reliability coefficient which was considered at 95 p is the proportion of people with a specific attribute p is the proportion of the population without a definite attribute and d is the degree of confidence or standard error 2 2 mop and lca the present study investigates the proper cropping pattern in the study area intending to reduce environmental effects on resources improve resource management and increase farmers profits mop involves the decision variables objective functions and constraints and the goal is to maximize objective function fig 3 since these problems rarely have a unique solution the decision maker picks from a collection of efficient solutions in most cases dunnett et al 2018 mardani najafabadi et al 2019 in this study lca was used to examine the environmental impacts of crop production in the region including global warming potential gwp non renewable energy ner and mineral extraction me iso 14040 defines lca as a technique for measuring the environmental impacts of a product process or special activity throughout its life cycle or from conception to completion cellura et al 2012 the advantage of this method is that it incorporates the results of the lca based evaluation of environmental indicators into a decision making planning model however the need to perform each step of the process in distinct and intermittent steps reduces the speed of operation and the accuracy with which results are obtained the four stages of lca are goal setting and study scope life cycle recording impact evaluation and interpretation 2 2 1 goal setting and study scope the stage of goal setting and study scope establishes the study s objectives expected ultimate product system boundaries functional unit and eventually the study s assumptions they are determined by the production system s inputs and outputs as well as the system s boundaries sahle and potting 2013 goossens et al 2017 the purpose of this study was to explore the economic and environmental consequences of crops grown in an irrigated area of east lorestan to identify the crucial points of their products and to propose effective strategies for mitigating the associated environmental damages one ton of product serves as the functional unit and the farm s output gate serves as the system boundary 2 2 2 life cycle recording the second stage which takes the most time of all the stages establishes the production chain for each product the first section covers raw material extraction processing and transportation while the second section contains secondary data for environmental effect assessments derived from ecoinvent 3 0 databases cooper et al 2011 the approach proposed by brentrup et al 2000 was used to estimate nitrogen emissions no3 nh4 and n2o associated with the use of nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural life cycle assessments additionally it calculates the emissions of phosphorus fertilizer introduced by erosion and surface runoff using the nemecek et al technique nemecek et al 2010 van den berg et al 1999 estimated pesticide emissions into the air using the proposed approach the simapro software database calculates the amount of pollutants such as greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere as a result of diesel fuel combustion durlinger et al 2017 the proposed method by van paassen et al 2019 is to estimate the heavy elements emission into soil and water 2 2 3 impact assessment the impact classes and their evaluation methods for each product must be specified in the lca impact assessment stage to examine and estimate these effects data from the life cycle recording stage were loaded into the simapro version 8 3 software and compared to the ecoinvent3 0 database s standard values the effects of global warming potential g w p j d non renewable energy n e r j d and mineral extraction m e j d were calculated by the impact 2002 method jolliet et al 2003 where table 1 presents the description of symbols in parentheses the global warming index is defined as the amount of pollutants emitted into the air and is expressed as the equivalent of co2 ipcc 2006 the depletion of non renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels or minerals is constantly reducing and making them unavailable to future generations thus the consumption of fossil fuels and minerals such as phosphate potash and lime subsets are important for lca in crop production guinée 2001 2 2 4 interpretation of results this stage evaluates the results of life cycle recording and impacts assessment steps to identify the hot and critical stages or points in the production and consumption of products that have the most adverse environmental effects and specify the products and options with less adverse environmental effects this study used cropwat8 software to calculate the net irrigation water requirements w netreq jm d kuo et al 2006 input data for this software in addition to some information about the geographical location and altitude of the studied station were the average maximum and average minimum temperatures average relative humidity wind speed at a 2 meter height above the ground and daily sunny hours using a quantitative method called et0 which calculates the evapotranspiration of a reference plant monthly and annually the decision variable in this mathematical model is land under cultivation l c j d and other variables include amount of gross irrigation water requirement w g r o s s r e q j d net profit n p j d global warming potential gwp j d non renewable energy consumption nre j d and mineral extraction m e j d as table 1 shows their symbols in addition due to the flexibility of the model and the contrast of this model with the decision makers involved in it it is possible to consider the different economic and environmental goals included in the model to optimize the environmental and economic impacts of implementing the multi objective planning model several objectives must be separately achieved to meet critical points including maximum net profit objnp minimum water consumption objw grossreq minimum global warming potential objgwp non renewable energy consumption objnre and mineral extraction objme subjected to model constraints as follows a the objective functions the model includes five single objective functions which determine the optimal or ideal values of each goal separately at the first step they work under a planning model subjected to constraints as section b with described symbols in tables 1 these values help to form the membership functions of each objective in the multi objective plan at the second step in this regard obj1 refers to the maximum net profit of agricultural activities and obj2 presents the minimum water consumption or irrigation water as an environmental objective in the study areas formulated as equations 2 and 3 respectively 2 max o b j 1

including production resources constraints irrigation water and land maximum and minimum land under cultivation constraints and economic constraints table 1 the total amount of land assigned to crops in rainfed and irrigated conditions should not exceed the total arable land for crops in each city region every month according to equations 7 and 8 to ensure that irrigation water consumption does not exceed available water resources in each month and city equation 9 addresses the consumption resources balance 7 j 1 j l c s c h j m d l c i r r i g a t e d j d l c r h s i r r i g a t e d d 2 d m

of products in each city as a minimum demand based on relevant information and statistical data in order to prevent the pattern from deviating towards products for which there may not be sufficient

the framework of meeting the ideals as mentioned above under the limitations and decision making criteria to achieve specific goals this is a mental process that is not completely described or documented in this regard the model assigns weights to decision making criteria based on the relative importance of the competitor s objectives and the decision maker s preferences chakraborty et al 2002 assume that there are d 1 d regions cities and j 1 m where j specifies the required standard number target additionally obj j d is the value that the criterion j gives to the region d then equation 13 outlines the technique for finding the membership function of index j in area d with the index s minimal value serving as the ideal limit here minimization of water global warming

in this case profit maximization the membership function ʎj d is defined as eq 14 14 λ j d 1 if obj j d obj j max obj j d obj j min obj j max obj j min if obj j min obj j d 0 if obj j d obj j min obj j max these functions are incremental functions of the pattern and have values between zero and one in the present study these membership functions were used to rank the objectives of the current study and were determined using the geometric weight method for the membership functions of the objectives as equation 15 objective weight values should be maximum and minimum defined as equation 16 chiappero 1996 15 λ i i 1 m w j λ j i 16 w j in 1 λ j j 1 m in 1 λ j where wj is an inverse function of the mean level of the objective relative to j additionally the logarithmic function implies that any optimal model s priority is a nonlinear function of objectives it should be noted that the considered weights were estimated using the opinions of agricultural experts and the analytic hierarchy process ahp technique mardani najafabadi et al 2019 this study developed the mathematical programming model algorithms for the study area in the gams package environment gams 2010 the study s objectives are to fuzziness the value of their ideal composite distance function to reach a general idea as a result of the nonlinear nature of the goal functions this decision making model is structured as a multi objective fuzzy nonlinear programming model this model allows a compromise between multiple goals simultaneously and is subject to resource constraints the model uses the nonlinear programming nlp method using the conopt 3 solver available in gams to find the results 2 2 5 model validation and verification monte carlo simulation was used to validate the proposed model hillston 2003 in this regard 10000 random data points for the parameter of available waterwere generated using two distributions uniform at regular intervals and normal with 95 convergence the feasibility of generated random numbers was then investigated using the optimal amounts of water consumed as a result of solving the optimal cultivation pattern model if the model required more water to implement the optimal cropping pattern than any of the simulated random numbers this case was recorded as an inconsistent record the greater number of these inconsistencies reveals the greater model s inability based on the results of this simulation the percentage of inconsistency with random data was estimated to be 18 and 9 under uniformity and normal distribution respectively this shows the model s reliability all model outputs were also validated by environmental and agricultural experts following that they reviewed the model results and made necessary corrections via model constraints ensuring that the final results were acceptable in terms of application and reality 3 results and discussion 3 1 the current pattern in the study area fig 4 shows that the amount of global heating potential and non renewable energy consumption of the irrigated farming ecosystem is higher than the rainfed table 2 indicates that the highest global warming potential and consumption of non renewable energy is allocated to potatoes sugar beets beans and wheat in the irrigated farming system and wheat and barley in the rainfed farming system in the region sugar beets potatoes beans and wheat have more water requirements than other areas crops it also shows that the highest net profits are for sugar beet wheat beans barley and potatoes respectively in the irrigated farming system and for wheat and lentils in the rainfed farming system in the current cropping pattern in the study region 3 2 multi objective cropping pattern in the region the mop results of irrigated crops in table 3 show increasing land under cultivation of wheat lentils and beans in the region by 1 49 and 18 respectively as this table shows the land under lentil cultivation increased by 116 115 and 49 in mop compared to cu in azna aligudarz and dorud cities respectively these increases indicate the low water requirement global warming potential and non renewable energy of this crop compared to other crops in the irrigated ecosystem in addition the increase in land under bean cultivation of mop compared to cu in dorud aligudarz and azna cities is 31 19 and 16 respectively this is because of the high profit low warming potential and low non renewable energy of this crop in the region another notable factor in table 3 is a 50 reduction in the area under irrigated potato and rapeseed cultivation in mop compared to cu this considerable reduction indicates the high water demand global warming potential non renewable energy and low profit of this crop in this region as related model objectives table 2 in addition a 23 and 15 reduction in the area under sugar beet and chickpea cultivation is in the results of the whole region in the mop of aligudarz azna and doroud cities the area under sugar beet cultivation decreased by 42 34 and 10 respectively compared to cu table 3 it is clear that the land under cultivation of this crop reduces in models with objectives such as minimizing global warming potential and non renewable energy therefore the performance and profit of this crop cannot compensate for non renewable energy consumption mineral extraction and global warming potential as a result the severity of these environmental effects in the systems with such crops is higher than other systems under study this result confirms the findings of goossens et al 2017 the percentage of changes in the proposed regional planning compared to the current pattern of irrigated products by city shows that the area under chickpea cultivation in aligudarz city increased by 13 but in dorud and azna cities decreased by 50 and 70 respectively the area under cultivation of this crop has also decreased in all objectives in dorud and azna cities except for the minimization of global warming potential table 3 this indicates that chickpea and sugar beet in terms of economic and environmental effects and potatoes and rapeseed in terms of environmental impacts have some limitations for cultivation in this region table 2 the results also show that the area under barley cultivation in dorud city decreased by 20 in aligudarz city increased by 1 and in azna city remains unchanged compared to cu the changes of mop s area under wheat cultivation are not significant in these tree cities table 3 the proposed regional planning for rainfed crops cultivation shows that the area under barley cultivation increased by 15 and for wheat by one percent compared to cu the area under lentils and chickpeas decreased by 42 and 13 respectively compared to the cu of rainfed crops fig 5 marzban et al 2020 in their research concluded that environmental effects have led to a reduction in the area under cultivation of selected crops in the cultivation pattern in addition compared to cu the area under rainfed lentil cultivation in mop of azna and aligudarz cities decreased by 50 and increased by 50 in dorud city table 3 the area under rainfed chickpea cultivation in dourud city increased by 1 and in aligudarz and azna cities decreased by 30 compared to cu these decreases indicate the limitations of chickpea for cultivation in the rainfed conditions of aligudarz and azna in terms of environmental effects objectives mnb maximizing net profit maw minimizing use of water mgw minimizing global warming mner minimizing non renewable energy use mme minimizing mineral extraction mop multi objective programing reduced area under rainfed lentil and chickpea cultivation in azna and aligudarz cities reflects these crops limits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption as well as their reduced profitability under rainfed agriculture table 3 in mop of azna city the area under rainfed barley cultivation grew by 14 but it declined by almost 20 compared to cu in doroud and aligudarz the changes in the area under rainfed wheat cultivation of mop pattern in three cities are not significant compared to cu table 3 the findings reveal a significant difference between the rainfed and irrigated cropping pattern of mop and cu the findings of multi objective cropping patterns are summarized in fig 5 per crop and studied objective as shown in this fig the total area under irrigated crop cultivation in lorestan s eastern region reduces in all targets as compared to the current cropping pattern the goal of having the least amount of land under irrigated crops is related to the objective of consuming the least amount of water possible this is due to limited water resources in the region especially in aligudarz city the total area under rainfed crops decreases in the eastern part of lorestan in all objectives except the net profit compared to the current cultivation pattern tables 4 and 5 report the net profit irrigation water amount global warming potential non renewable energy and mineral extraction for rainfed and irrigated crops in the eastern region of lorestan according to the studied models the amount of net profit in all models except the maximizing net profit remains at the same level of cu in the net profit maximization model the net profit index increases compared to cu in this model the amount of non renewable energy and global warming potential increases by 11 the amount of water consumed decreases by 4 67 10 6 m3 and the profit rate increases by 9 07 10 6 dollars compared to cu and in the whole region table 3 results state that determining the optimal cropping pattern which compromises the maximum net profit the reduction of non renewable energy the global warming potential and the emission of pollutants co2 in farms is one of the most effective strategies to reduce climate change as fallahpour et al 2012 confirm ecological management strategies in addition to agricultural management strategies particularly reducing the consumption of fossil and chemical inputs to reduce environmental impacts play a significant role in reducing environmental impacts determining and applying the appropriate cropping pattern in the region are such strategies therefore by considering economic and environmental goals simultaneously it is possible to minimize the damage to the environment in addition to helping farmers incomes by designing a suitable cropping pattern in the region as table 4 it also seems that it is possible to reduce irrigation water consumption global warming potential and non renewable energy in all models the highest reduction in irrigation water consumption is related to maw by reducing 8 5 10 6 cubic meters the global warming potential decreases in all introduced models and this reduction is 18 in mgw and mnre compared to cu the highest reduction in global warming potential is in aligudarz city global warming potential in this city decreases from 8 09 10 7 kg co2 eq in cu to 6 64 10 7 kg co2 eq in mgw this change has occurred as a result of increased cultivation of lentils barley and chickpea looking at the share of different products in mnre and mgw focusing on fig 5 and table 4 suggests a close relationship between non renewable energy consumption and co2 production in agricultural systems as a result of shifting cultivation to crops with lower water requirements such as lentil the amount of nonrenewable energy and global warming potential was reduced by 18 the relationship between non renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions in agricultural production is closely related to production techniques input amounts crop area and environmental factors these results confirm the findings by masuda 2016 and cetin and vardar 2008 a solution that reduces non renewable energy consumption in agroecosystems will be connected with system stability and increased energy efficiency samuel fitwi et al 2012 therefore it is unavoidable that cropping patterns in the region be altered in order to reduce dependency on non renewable resources additionally more space must be devoted to lentil and bean than to other crops such as potato and rapeseed in order to achieve higher energy efficiency and profits and to reduce the cropping pattern s reliance on non renewable energy table 4 compared to cu the mineral extraction rate in mme decreases from 4 6 10 5 to 4 5 10 5 mj surplus the highest decrease in mme is related to irrigated crops in dorud city the irrigation water consumption global warming potential consumption of non renewable energy and mineral extraction in the whole region also decrease by 2 1 10 6 m3 6 6 10 4 kg co2 eq 1 6 10 4 mj primary energy and 5 5 10 3 mj surplus respectively by achieving the goal of mme compared to cu thus implementing a suitable cultivation pattern as mop will reduce global warming greenhouse gas emissions by 14 and non renewable energy consumption by 16 as fig 6 shows according to fig 7 these reductions are much greater in the irrigated than rainfed farming systems showing a decrease of about 15 vs 1 for both indicators for the irrigated versus rainfed farming system this fig also reveals that the mop for the irrigated farming system is not able to reduce the mineral extraction indicator so that its consumption in this model has increased by 6 while the rainfed farming system has reduced this indicator by 1 fig 8 shows that if the decision is to reduce the mineral extraction in the whole region the mme should be chosen which leads to a 1 reduction for both indicators of mineral extraction and water consumption but the changes in other indicators are zero for it however agricultural experts in this study gave less weight to the goal of reducing mineral extraction than to other goals due to this fact the mop focuses more on reducing other environmental indicators including water consumption global warming and non renewable energy respectively as 1 14 and 14 with no changes in total land under cultivation and net profit indicators in the whole region as fig 8 presents agricultural activities and the use of non renewable energy in this sector have caused a quarter of the world s emissions kirchmann and thorvaldsson 2000 and if the consumption of inputs in ecosystems is higher the environmental effects including the global warming potential will be more significant nemecek et al 2010 as a result it is vital to lower the non renewable energy use and global warming potential in each region s cropping pattern a sustainable cropping plan should optimize the use of chemical inputs and fossil fuels first and gradually limit their use while maintaining this precious resource for the future mohamadi et al 2014 yousefi et al 2016 second it should exercise control over inputs so saving money and lowering manufacturing costs and third it should safeguard the environment aid in survival and avert climate change de moraes et al 2017 as previously stated the mop results show that applying such a cropping pattern in the research area uses less non renewable energy has a lower global warming potential and consumes less water while maintaining farmers net profit this finding confirms the results of other studies that show the cropping pattern of each area should include intra system relations relations with neighboring natural ecosystems and economic conditions of each region in any case the agricultural planers should design the cropping pattern in such a way that considers appropriate strategies to create and achieve sustainable development nikouei and ward 2013 suresh and mujumdar 2004 additionally it can be claimed that each region requires its own cropping pattern and it is not possible to generalize a cropping pattern from one zone to the others accepting these results in a cropping plan is not far from the mind due to the uncontrolled abstraction of water from the aquifers and the increased global warming potential however such a plan reduces the area under cultivation of agricultural products that have high environmental effects and water needs to reduce those effects and counteract the uncontrolled withdrawal of water in the future instead resource use productivity including water and non renewable resources should increase with changes in cropping pattern as an important strategy other research revealed that when cropping patterns are designed farmers objectives play a significant effect in determining the type and level of crop cultivation de jonge 2004 nikouei and ward 2013 as previously noted when farmers make cropping decisions based solely on economic considerations resources are used inefficiently in the region resulting in increased energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions amponsah et al 2014 4 conclusion this study shows that the optimal cropping pattern based on the multi objective planning model differs from the current cropping pattern in the study area in other words in formulating their current cropping pattern the farmers of the study area do not pay much attention to the environmental effects and sustainable agricultural conditions including global warming potential and non renewable energy consumption the crisis will lead to intensified energy consumption and environmental pollution which in addition to environmental changes and creating problems for current and future generations will also limit food production in irrigated and rainfed lands however implementing the the results of such proposed cultivation pattern and delivering more significant economic rewards to farmers than the their current pattern will meet some of the aims of sustainable agriculture if the cropping pattern is designed based on economic goals it will focus only on achieving maximum yield and short term profit oriented goals a designed cropping pattern under the constraints and objectives of life cycle assessment minimizes the environmental impacts such as water consumption global warming potential non renewable energy and the use of inputs with less environmental impact it also considers the stability of the benefits in the long term it is recommended that government policies and approaches are adopted with these goals to reduce available water and non renewable resources as well as policy incentives or disincentives developing support packages of crop pricing insurance and facilities which support to prevent the cultivation of crops with high water and fertilizer demand are essential in other words the government facilities and support tools should be aggregated to implement the proposed cropping pattern in the study areas this proposed model is able to develop and implement for other similar farming systems in the world

24396,this study introduces a multi objective programming model for identifying a cropping pattern to evaluate the feasibility of increasing net profit reducing water use and diminishing the environmental impacts simultaneously under life cycle assessment lca the research uses data collected in 2016 2017 through a survey in the east of the lorestan province of iran results indicate that the multi objective cropping pattern reduces environmental indicators including water consumption by 1 global warming potential by 14 and nonrenewable energy use by 14 with no change in farms net profit compared to the current pattern in the region the findings reveal that a designed cropping pattern under the constraints and objectives of lca not only minimizes the environmental impacts but also considers the stability of the benefits in the long term however the currently applied cropping pattern by farmers only focuses on achieving short term profit oriented goals a new approach to land allocation is necessary to produce crops with a reduction in water consumption non renewable energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in the region in this regard it is essential to consider the policies that reduce available water and non renewable resources into government decisions on the other hand policy incentives or disincentives developing support packages of crop pricing insurance and facilities support to prevent the cultivation of crops with high water demand and fertilizer are also essential this proposed planning model should be used as the foundation for long term cropping pattern planning policies in other irrigated and rainfed farming systems around the world keywords multi objective programming non renewable energy mineral extraction optimization net profit life cycle analysis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction agriculture is critical for economic development but it may cause irreversible environmental problems including global warming excessive use of non renewable resources and contamination of water resources with nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizers and pesticides amiri et al 2019 asgharipour et al 2019 although the agricultural system seeks to increase profits agricultural ecosystems must guarantee long term sustainable and stable crop production conservation of primary resources and environmental pollution mitigation vandermeer et al 2011 amiri et al 2020 therefore reducing environmental impacts should be one of the objectives pursued by any agricultural system in addition to the economic and other goals de koeijer et al 2002 nitschelm et al 2016 planning for land allocation to produce crops under such a system is based on a compromise between multiple goals in a cropping pattern cropping patterns refer to an agricultural system with long term economic benefits based on macroeconomic policies food security farmer local knowledge and the most efficient use of regional resources while adhering to ecophysiological crop production and environmental protection principles dury et al 2013 west 2019 mardani najafabadi et al 2019 the planning models analyze the effective management and adjustment of such a cropping pattern at each farm region and national level to find solutions for reducing environmental impacts and increasing profitability galán martín et al 2015 a systemic analysis of the above definition reveals the necessity of using effective programming techniques and models to assess the determinants of agricultural sector policies and their economic effects in this regard cropping patterns simulation using the most significant number of effective methods is necessary to achieve different objectives and planning based on the possibilities and limitations gohar and ward 2010 related scientific literatures classify the optimal decision making models for such situations into multi criteria multi objective competitive objective and multi attribute categories these methods do not result in a consensus on a simple purpose sarker and ray 2009 multi objective programming and decision making processes can use fuzzy logic to homogenize goals elliot et al 2019 sengupta et al 2001 many studies have used this method in multi objective models to boost productivity by ensuring maximum gross profit while limiting irrigation water use nikouei et al 2012 raheli namin et al 2016 and highlighting an environmental approach to inputs including water chemical fertilizers and chemical toxins manos et al 2010 meanwhile thermodynamic techniques such as energy analysis asgharipour et al 2012 exergy accounting chen and chen 2009 emergy synthesis and life cycle assessment i canals et al 2006 are beneficial because they quantify the contribution of environmental products and services to production systems in equivalent units with other inputs odum 1996 in this context several researchers recommend life cycle assessment lca as the best way to analyze agricultural sustainability acosta alba et al 2019 galán martn et al 2017 hospido et al 2012 there are several ways to evaluate the environmental effect of cropping systems in order to study and compare the total environmental load caused by agricultural production systems it is necessary to consider all environmental effects at once hasani et al 2021 lca is a technique used to comprehensively assess the environmental impact of producing a product over its life cycle as a result it can identify and solve problems of production system processes such as resource consumption brentrup et al 2004 in other words this technique is capable of assessing and analyzing environmental implications and locating appropriate routes with minimal environmental impact lca actually analyzes the environmental impacts of agricultural production and finds suitable routes with the most negligible environmental impact patterson et al 2017 esmaeilzadeh et al 2020 this is a comprehensive method of assessing the environmental impacts of a process activity or production by detecting and calculating energy and energy use waste production and distribution of waste on the environment cellura et al 2012 habibi et al 2019 the use of this method allows an accurate evaluation of agricultural systems because of the separate evaluation of processes in production systems in addition to environmental effects esmaeilzadeh et al 2020 the design of agricultural systems with fewer inputs and environmental impacts including greenhouse co2 emissions using methods like lca is necessary for agricultural development mohammadi et al 2014 macwilliam et al 2014 thus it is important to identify a cropping pattern that diminishes environmental impacts including global warming potential nonrenewable energy use and mineral extraction on the other hand it is also necessary to consider increasing the farms net profit and reducing the agricultural water use especially in the irrigated farming system of arid and semi arid regions planners and policymakers must understand how a suitable cropping pattern can meet these goals while model makers must address this question and include various environmental and economic indicators a multi objective programming mop model can evaluate the feasibility of achieving these goals by changing the cropping pattern although numerous studies have widely use of such models e g sarker and ray 2009 manos et al 2010 mardani najafabadi et al 2019 but they have rarely used lca indicators for environmental goal analysis marzban et al 2020 iran is located in the arid and semi arid belt of the earth with one third of the annual rainfall compared to the world average while the long term rainfall trend has decreased over the past five decades with this reduction iran faces 42 7 billion cubic meters of surface water flows in 2018 52 less than in the long term as a result the inflow of runoff to the reservoirs of the country s dams has decreased significantly iran water resources management company 2018 on the other hand on the other hand the value added of agricultural sector of gdp in iran was reported as minimum 5 5 and maximum 12 4 with an average of about 10 since 25 years ago in this regard this sector produces over 90 of food for the country and employs about 20 of the population with the age of over 10 years old fao 2022 statistical centre of iran 2018 these quantitative data clarify the significance of agriculture and its important and essential role in the iran s economy however the cultivated area has increased in this country and it faces over withdrawals from groundwater resources fasakhodi et al 2010 as a result it is necessary to protect existing water resources by introducing a cropping pattern that optimizes water use and reduces environmental impacts in this country in summary the role of agriculture in the country s economic development and environmental hazards underscores the importance of allocating agricultural land for economic and environmental purposes previous studies reveal that two methods lca and mop are appropriate for data processing planning and analyzing this issue iran is an appropriate region to consider these characteristics given the difficulties it faces the novelty of this research is in developing a mop and using lca to address the model s stated environmental goals in irrigated and rainfed farming systems the study area is the irrigated and rainfed farming land in the east of iran s lorestan province fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area lorestan province is one of the major agricultural centers of iran ranked 16th among other provinces as the crop producer it has first place in bean production and 12th among cereal producers the study area is a region including azna aligoudarz and dorud cities in the east of lorestan province with 47 881 ha of land under cultivation and 960 830 tons of crop production ministry of agriculture jihad 2018 climate change is one of the main challenges of the agricultural sector in this region like other semi arid regions in the world asgharipour et al 2016 it has a semi humid climate with mild summers and cold winters this climate causes cold and snowy winters while the average annual temperature of azna aligoudarz and dorud is 12 8 11 6 and 14 3 c respectively the average yearly rainfall is 304 264 and 375 mm in azna aligoudarz and dorud respectively these three cities are the top three crop producers in lorestan province with 41271 34481 and 28525 ha of cultivation respectively the main crops produced in this region are wheat barley bean chickpea lentil sugar beet potato and rapeseed wheat and barley account for 78 and 93 of the region s existing irrigated and rainfed cropping patterns chickpea lentil barley and rapeseed crops also make up 22 of the cultivation pattern of irrigated crops and lentils and chickpeas make up about 7 of the rainfed crops of the study area fig 2 this research collected the data required through a review of journals agricultural statistical yearbooks of 2018 2019 and interviews with experts in each city and a field survey through completing a questionnaire from a sample of region farmers using cochran s formula to determine the sample size equation 1 1 n z 2 p q d 2 1 1 n z 2 p q d 2 1 where n is the sample size n is the statistical population of farmers in the region z is the percentage error of the acceptable reliability coefficient which was considered at 95 p is the proportion of people with a specific attribute p is the proportion of the population without a definite attribute and d is the degree of confidence or standard error 2 2 mop and lca the present study investigates the proper cropping pattern in the study area intending to reduce environmental effects on resources improve resource management and increase farmers profits mop involves the decision variables objective functions and constraints and the goal is to maximize objective function fig 3 since these problems rarely have a unique solution the decision maker picks from a collection of efficient solutions in most cases dunnett et al 2018 mardani najafabadi et al 2019 in this study lca was used to examine the environmental impacts of crop production in the region including global warming potential gwp non renewable energy ner and mineral extraction me iso 14040 defines lca as a technique for measuring the environmental impacts of a product process or special activity throughout its life cycle or from conception to completion cellura et al 2012 the advantage of this method is that it incorporates the results of the lca based evaluation of environmental indicators into a decision making planning model however the need to perform each step of the process in distinct and intermittent steps reduces the speed of operation and the accuracy with which results are obtained the four stages of lca are goal setting and study scope life cycle recording impact evaluation and interpretation 2 2 1 goal setting and study scope the stage of goal setting and study scope establishes the study s objectives expected ultimate product system boundaries functional unit and eventually the study s assumptions they are determined by the production system s inputs and outputs as well as the system s boundaries sahle and potting 2013 goossens et al 2017 the purpose of this study was to explore the economic and environmental consequences of crops grown in an irrigated area of east lorestan to identify the crucial points of their products and to propose effective strategies for mitigating the associated environmental damages one ton of product serves as the functional unit and the farm s output gate serves as the system boundary 2 2 2 life cycle recording the second stage which takes the most time of all the stages establishes the production chain for each product the first section covers raw material extraction processing and transportation while the second section contains secondary data for environmental effect assessments derived from ecoinvent 3 0 databases cooper et al 2011 the approach proposed by brentrup et al 2000 was used to estimate nitrogen emissions no3 nh4 and n2o associated with the use of nitrogen fertilizers in agricultural life cycle assessments additionally it calculates the emissions of phosphorus fertilizer introduced by erosion and surface runoff using the nemecek et al technique nemecek et al 2010 van den berg et al 1999 estimated pesticide emissions into the air using the proposed approach the simapro software database calculates the amount of pollutants such as greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere as a result of diesel fuel combustion durlinger et al 2017 the proposed method by van paassen et al 2019 is to estimate the heavy elements emission into soil and water 2 2 3 impact assessment the impact classes and their evaluation methods for each product must be specified in the lca impact assessment stage to examine and estimate these effects data from the life cycle recording stage were loaded into the simapro version 8 3 software and compared to the ecoinvent3 0 database s standard values the effects of global warming potential g w p j d non renewable energy n e r j d and mineral extraction m e j d were calculated by the impact 2002 method jolliet et al 2003 where table 1 presents the description of symbols in parentheses the global warming index is defined as the amount of pollutants emitted into the air and is expressed as the equivalent of co2 ipcc 2006 the depletion of non renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels or minerals is constantly reducing and making them unavailable to future generations thus the consumption of fossil fuels and minerals such as phosphate potash and lime subsets are important for lca in crop production guinée 2001 2 2 4 interpretation of results this stage evaluates the results of life cycle recording and impacts assessment steps to identify the hot and critical stages or points in the production and consumption of products that have the most adverse environmental effects and specify the products and options with less adverse environmental effects this study used cropwat8 software to calculate the net irrigation water requirements w netreq jm d kuo et al 2006 input data for this software in addition to some information about the geographical location and altitude of the studied station were the average maximum and average minimum temperatures average relative humidity wind speed at a 2 meter height above the ground and daily sunny hours using a quantitative method called et0 which calculates the evapotranspiration of a reference plant monthly and annually the decision variable in this mathematical model is land under cultivation l c j d and other variables include amount of gross irrigation water requirement w g r o s s r e q j d net profit n p j d global warming potential gwp j d non renewable energy consumption nre j d and mineral extraction m e j d as table 1 shows their symbols in addition due to the flexibility of the model and the contrast of this model with the decision makers involved in it it is possible to consider the different economic and environmental goals included in the model to optimize the environmental and economic impacts of implementing the multi objective planning model several objectives must be separately achieved to meet critical points including maximum net profit objnp minimum water consumption objw grossreq minimum global warming potential objgwp non renewable energy consumption objnre and mineral extraction objme subjected to model constraints as follows a the objective functions the model includes five single objective functions which determine the optimal or ideal values of each goal separately at the first step they work under a planning model subjected to constraints as section b with described symbols in tables 1 these values help to form the membership functions of each objective in the multi objective plan at the second step in this regard obj1 refers to the maximum net profit of agricultural activities and obj2 presents the minimum water consumption or irrigation water as an environmental objective in the study areas formulated as equations 2 and 3 respectively 2 max o b j 1

including production resources constraints irrigation water and land maximum and minimum land under cultivation constraints and economic constraints table 1 the total amount of land assigned to crops in rainfed and irrigated conditions should not exceed the total arable land for crops in each city region every month according to equations 7 and 8 to ensure that irrigation water consumption does not exceed available water resources in each month and city equation 9 addresses the consumption resources balance 7 j 1 j l c s c h j m d l c i r r i g a t e d j d l c r h s i r r i g a t e d d 2 d m

of products in each city as a minimum demand based on relevant information and statistical data in order to prevent the pattern from deviating towards products for which there may not be sufficient demand the model also estimates the region s maximum demand based on documentary studies and interviews with regional experts equations 10 and 11 apply these two sets of information as the number of

the framework of meeting the ideals as mentioned above under the limitations and decision making criteria to achieve specific goals this is a mental process that is not completely described or documented in this regard the model assigns weights to decision making criteria based on the relative importance of the competitor s objectives and the decision maker s preferences chakraborty et al 2002 assume that there are d 1 d regions cities and j 1 m where j specifies the required standard number target additionally obj j d is the value that the criterion j gives to the region d then equation 13 outlines the technique for finding the membership function of index j in area d with the index s minimal value serving as the ideal limit here minimization of water global warming

obj j d obj j min obj j min when the function j d quantifies the dth operator s degree of enjoyment in relation to the criterion j similarly if the ideal limit is defined as the largest value of goals in this case profit maximization the membership function ʎj d is defined as eq 14 14 λ j d 1 if obj j d obj j max obj j d obj j min obj j max obj j min if obj j min obj j d 0 if obj j d obj j min obj j max these functions are incremental functions of the pattern and have values between zero and one in the present study these membership functions were used to rank the objectives of the current study and were determined using the geometric weight method for the membership functions of the objectives as equation 15 objective weight values should be maximum and minimum defined as equation 16 chiappero 1996 15 λ i i 1 m w j λ j i 16 w j in 1 λ j j 1 m in 1 λ j where wj is an inverse function of the mean level of the objective relative to j additionally the logarithmic function implies that any optimal model s priority is a nonlinear function of objectives it should be noted that the considered weights were estimated using the opinions of agricultural experts and the analytic hierarchy process ahp technique mardani najafabadi et al 2019 this study developed the mathematical programming model algorithms for the study area in the gams package environment gams 2010 the study s objectives are to fuzziness the value of their ideal composite distance function to reach a general idea as a result of the nonlinear nature of the goal functions this decision making model is structured as a multi objective fuzzy nonlinear programming model this model allows a compromise between multiple goals simultaneously and is subject to resource constraints the model uses the nonlinear programming nlp method using the conopt 3 solver available in gams to find the results 2 2 5 model validation and verification monte carlo simulation was used to validate the proposed model hillston 2003 in this regard 10000 random data points for the parameter of available waterwere generated using two distributions uniform at regular intervals and normal with 95 convergence the feasibility of generated random numbers was then investigated using the optimal amounts of water consumed as a result of solving the optimal cultivation pattern model if the model required more water to implement the optimal cropping pattern than any of the simulated random numbers this case was recorded as an inconsistent record the greater number of these inconsistencies reveals the greater model s inability based on the results of this simulation the percentage of inconsistency with random data was estimated to be 18 and 9 under uniformity and normal distribution respectively this shows the model s reliability all model outputs were also validated by environmental and agricultural experts following that they reviewed the model results and made necessary corrections via model constraints ensuring that the final results were acceptable in terms of application and reality 3 results and discussion 3 1 the current pattern in the study area fig 4 shows that the amount of global heating potential and non renewable energy consumption of the irrigated farming ecosystem is higher than the rainfed table 2 indicates that the highest global warming potential and consumption of non renewable energy is allocated to potatoes sugar beets beans and wheat in the irrigated farming system and wheat and barley in the rainfed farming system in the region sugar beets potatoes beans and wheat have more water requirements than other areas crops it also shows that the highest net profits are for sugar beet wheat beans barley and potatoes respectively in the irrigated farming system and for wheat and lentils in the rainfed farming system in the current cropping pattern in the study region 3 2 multi objective cropping pattern in the region the mop results of irrigated crops in table 3 show increasing land under cultivation of wheat lentils and beans in the region by 1 49 and 18 respectively as this table shows the land under lentil cultivation increased by 116 115 and 49 in mop compared to cu in azna aligudarz and dorud cities respectively these increases indicate the low water requirement global warming potential and non renewable energy of this crop compared to other crops in the irrigated ecosystem in addition the increase in land under bean cultivation of mop compared to cu in dorud aligudarz and azna cities is 31 19 and 16 respectively this is because of the high profit low warming potential and low non renewable energy of this crop in the region another notable factor in table 3 is a 50 reduction in the area under irrigated potato and rapeseed cultivation in mop compared to cu this considerable reduction indicates the high water demand global warming potential non renewable energy and low profit of this crop in this region as related model objectives table 2 in addition a 23 and 15 reduction in the area under sugar beet and chickpea cultivation is in the results of the whole region in the mop of aligudarz azna and doroud cities the area under sugar beet cultivation decreased by 42 34 and 10 respectively compared to cu table 3 it is clear that the land under cultivation of this crop reduces in models with objectives such as minimizing global warming potential and non renewable energy therefore the performance and profit of this crop cannot compensate for non renewable energy consumption mineral extraction and global warming potential as a result the severity of these environmental effects in the systems with such crops is higher than other systems under study this result confirms the findings of goossens et al 2017 the percentage of changes in the proposed regional planning compared to the current pattern of irrigated products by city shows that the area under chickpea cultivation in aligudarz city increased by 13 but in dorud and azna cities decreased by 50 and 70 respectively the area under cultivation of this crop has also decreased in all objectives in dorud and azna cities except for the minimization of global warming potential table 3 this indicates that chickpea and sugar beet in terms of economic and environmental effects and potatoes and rapeseed in terms of environmental impacts have some limitations for cultivation in this region table 2 the results also show that the area under barley cultivation in dorud city decreased by 20 in aligudarz city increased by 1 and in azna city remains unchanged compared to cu the changes of mop s area under wheat cultivation are not significant in these tree cities table 3 the proposed regional planning for rainfed crops cultivation shows that the area under barley cultivation increased by 15 and for wheat by one percent compared to cu the area under lentils and chickpeas decreased by 42 and 13 respectively compared to the cu of rainfed crops fig 5 marzban et al 2020 in their research concluded that environmental effects have led to a reduction in the area under cultivation of selected crops in the cultivation pattern in addition compared to cu the area under rainfed lentil cultivation in mop of azna and aligudarz cities decreased by 50 and increased by 50 in dorud city table 3 the area under rainfed chickpea cultivation in dourud city increased by 1 and in aligudarz and azna cities decreased by 30 compared to cu these decreases indicate the limitations of chickpea for cultivation in the rainfed conditions of aligudarz and azna in terms of environmental effects objectives mnb maximizing net profit maw minimizing use of water mgw minimizing global warming mner minimizing non renewable energy use mme minimizing mineral extraction mop multi objective programing reduced area under rainfed lentil and chickpea cultivation in azna and aligudarz cities reflects these crops limits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption as well as their reduced profitability under rainfed agriculture table 3 in mop of azna city the area under rainfed barley cultivation grew by 14 but it declined by almost 20 compared to cu in doroud and aligudarz the changes in the area under rainfed wheat cultivation of mop pattern in three cities are not significant compared to cu table 3 the findings reveal a significant difference between the rainfed and irrigated cropping pattern of mop and cu the findings of multi objective cropping patterns are summarized in fig 5 per crop and studied objective as shown in this fig the total area under irrigated crop cultivation in lorestan s eastern region reduces in all targets as compared to the current cropping pattern the goal of having the least amount of land under irrigated crops is related to the objective of consuming the least amount of water possible this is due to limited water resources in the region especially in aligudarz city the total area under rainfed crops decreases in the eastern part of lorestan in all objectives except the net profit compared to the current cultivation pattern tables 4 and 5 report the net profit irrigation water amount global warming potential non renewable energy and mineral extraction for rainfed and irrigated crops in the eastern region of lorestan according to the studied models the amount of net profit in all models except the maximizing net profit remains at the same level of cu in the net profit maximization model the net profit index increases compared to cu in this model the amount of non renewable energy and global warming potential increases by 11 the amount of water consumed decreases by 4 67 10 6 m3 and the profit rate increases by 9 07 10 6 dollars compared to cu and in the whole region table 3 results state that determining the optimal cropping pattern which compromises the maximum net profit the reduction of non renewable energy the global warming potential and the emission of pollutants co2 in farms is one of the most effective strategies to reduce climate change as fallahpour et al 2012 confirm ecological management strategies in addition to agricultural management strategies particularly reducing the consumption of fossil and chemical inputs to reduce environmental impacts play a significant role in reducing environmental impacts determining and applying the appropriate cropping pattern in the region are such strategies therefore by considering economic and environmental goals simultaneously it is possible to minimize the damage to the environment in addition to helping farmers incomes by designing a suitable cropping pattern in the region as table 4 it also seems that it is possible to reduce irrigation water consumption global warming potential and non renewable energy in all models the highest reduction in irrigation water consumption is related to maw by reducing 8 5 10 6 cubic meters the global warming potential decreases in all introduced models and this reduction is 18 in mgw and mnre compared to cu the highest reduction in global warming potential is in aligudarz city global warming potential in this city decreases from 8 09 10 7 kg co2 eq in cu to 6 64 10 7 kg co2 eq in mgw this change has occurred as a result of increased cultivation of lentils barley and chickpea looking at the share of different products in mnre and mgw focusing on fig 5 and table 4 suggests a close relationship between non renewable energy consumption and co2 production in agricultural systems as a result of shifting cultivation to crops with lower water requirements such as lentil the amount of nonrenewable energy and global warming potential was reduced by 18 the relationship between non renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions in agricultural production is closely related to production techniques input amounts crop area and environmental factors these results confirm the findings by masuda 2016 and cetin and vardar 2008 a solution that reduces non renewable energy consumption in agroecosystems will be connected with system stability and increased energy efficiency samuel fitwi et al 2012 therefore it is unavoidable that cropping patterns in the region be altered in order to reduce dependency on non renewable resources additionally more space must be devoted to lentil and bean than to other crops such as potato and rapeseed in order to achieve higher energy efficiency and profits and to reduce the cropping pattern s reliance on non renewable energy table 4 compared to cu the mineral extraction rate in mme decreases from 4 6 10 5 to 4 5 10 5 mj surplus the highest decrease in mme is related to irrigated crops in dorud city the irrigation water consumption global warming potential consumption of non renewable energy and mineral extraction in the whole region also decrease by 2 1 10 6 m3 6 6 10 4 kg co2 eq 1 6 10 4 mj primary energy and 5 5 10 3 mj surplus respectively by achieving the goal of mme compared to cu thus implementing a suitable cultivation pattern as mop will reduce global warming greenhouse gas emissions by 14 and non renewable energy consumption by 16 as fig 6 shows according to fig 7 these reductions are much greater in the irrigated than rainfed farming systems showing a decrease of about 15 vs 1 for both indicators for the irrigated versus rainfed farming system this fig also reveals that the mop for the irrigated farming system is not able to reduce the mineral extraction indicator so that its consumption in this model has increased by 6 while the rainfed farming system has reduced this indicator by 1 fig 8 shows that if the decision is to reduce the mineral extraction in the whole region the mme should be chosen which leads to a 1 reduction for both indicators of mineral extraction and water consumption but the changes in other indicators are zero for it however agricultural experts in this study gave less weight to the goal of reducing mineral extraction than to other goals due to this fact the mop focuses more on reducing other environmental indicators including water consumption global warming and non renewable energy respectively as 1 14 and 14 with no changes in total land under cultivation and net profit indicators in the whole region as fig 8 presents agricultural activities and the use of non renewable energy in this sector have caused a quarter of the world s emissions kirchmann and thorvaldsson 2000 and if the consumption of inputs in ecosystems is higher the environmental effects including the global warming potential will be more significant nemecek et al 2010 as a result it is vital to lower the non renewable energy use and global warming potential in each region s cropping pattern a sustainable cropping plan should optimize the use of chemical inputs and fossil fuels first and gradually limit their use while maintaining this precious resource for the future mohamadi et al 2014 yousefi et al 2016 second it should exercise control over inputs so saving money and lowering manufacturing costs and third it should safeguard the environment aid in survival and avert climate change de moraes et al 2017 as previously stated the mop results show that applying such a cropping pattern in the research area uses less non renewable energy has a lower global warming potential and consumes less water while maintaining farmers net profit this finding confirms the results of other studies that show the cropping pattern of each area should include intra system relations relations with neighboring natural ecosystems and economic conditions of each region in any case the agricultural planers should design the cropping pattern in such a way that considers appropriate strategies to create and achieve sustainable development nikouei and ward 2013 suresh and mujumdar 2004 additionally it can be claimed that each region requires its own cropping pattern and it is not possible to generalize a cropping pattern from one zone to the others accepting these results in a cropping plan is not far from the mind due to the uncontrolled abstraction of water from the aquifers and the increased global warming potential however such a plan reduces the area under cultivation of agricultural products that have high environmental effects and water needs to reduce those effects and counteract the uncontrolled withdrawal of water in the future instead resource use productivity including water and non renewable resources should increase with changes in cropping pattern as an important strategy other research revealed that when cropping patterns are designed farmers objectives play a significant effect in determining the type and level of crop cultivation de jonge 2004 nikouei and ward 2013 as previously noted when farmers make cropping decisions based solely on economic considerations resources are used inefficiently in the region resulting in increased energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions amponsah et al 2014 4 conclusion this study shows that the optimal cropping pattern based on the multi objective planning model differs from the current cropping pattern in the study area in other words in formulating their current cropping pattern the farmers of the study area do not pay much attention to the environmental effects and sustainable agricultural conditions including global warming potential and non renewable energy consumption the crisis will lead to intensified energy consumption and environmental pollution which in addition to environmental changes and creating problems for current and future generations will also limit food production in irrigated and rainfed lands however implementing the the results of such proposed cultivation pattern and delivering more significant economic rewards to farmers than the their current pattern will meet some of the aims of sustainable agriculture if the cropping pattern is designed based on economic goals it will focus only on achieving maximum yield and short term profit oriented goals a designed cropping pattern under the constraints and objectives of life cycle assessment minimizes the environmental impacts such as water consumption global warming potential non renewable energy and the use of inputs with less environmental impact it also considers the stability of the benefits in the long term it is recommended that government policies and approaches are adopted with these goals to reduce available water and non renewable resources as well as policy incentives or disincentives developing support packages of crop pricing insurance and facilities which support to prevent the cultivation of crops with high water and fertilizer demand are essential in other words the government facilities and support tools should be aggregated to implement the proposed cropping pattern in the study areas this proposed model is able to develop and implement for other similar farming systems in the world

24397,as one of the important sources of nitrogen pollution in cities food consumption has major ramifications for the global nitrogen cycle making researches about food nitrogen and its urban optimization management of great significance taking beijing as an example we analyzed the differences in urban and rural characteristics of residents food nitrogen consumption on the time scale from 1979 to 2019 then used the logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi to construct a brand new factor decomposition model and identify the driving factors the results showed that overall food nitrogen consumption in beijing exhibited an increasing trend from 37 gg in 1979 to 70 77 gg in 2019 rural and urban residents showed the same direction of changing dietary habits switching to a high nitrogen animal consumption pattern gdp per capita was the most critical pulling factor followed by the population on the other hand the factors that always showed inhibition are food price level and engel s coefficient the results provide a scientific reference for the coordinated development of urban and rural areas and urban nitrogen management and a scientific basis for residents to reasonably plan their food nitrogen input graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords food nitrogen consumption urban rural dichotomy influencing factors lmdi beijing data availability the data can be found in supplementary information 1 introduction as an essential component of urban ecosystems food and its nutrient rich nitrogen are of great importance in the implementation of the un 2030 agenda for sustainable development especially in efforts to achieve goal 11 sustainable cities and communities and goal 12 responsible consumption and production un 2015 nitrogen plays an essential role in maintaining ecosystem productivity galloway et al 2014 and the production of excess reactive nitrogen due to anthropogenic interference has caused an imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle gao et al 2019 the nitrogen cycle disruption has become the third major global environmental problem after biodiversity loss and global warming giles 2005 galloway et al 2008 estimated that the worldwide population has increased by 78 since 1970 while the production of reactive nitrogen has risen by 120 food is rich in nitrogen and human food consumption is an important driver of activated nitrogen production pierer et al 2015 with social progress people s food demand is rising and the structure of food consumption has changed since the 1980s the dietary structure and nutritional patterns of chinese residents have shifted from mainly staple diet to staple food substitution and from mostly plant based food to both animal based and plant based food consumption li 2007 cui et al 2010 norman 1999 as well as going through survival quantitative and qualitative stages casani et al 2005 gao et al 2007 growing consumption and changing dietary structures can lead to a simultaneous increase in nitrogen inputs and environmental nitrogen loads an issue that has received considerable attention from researchers and managers beijing a representative globalized metropolis with a rapidly growing economic volume and population size consumed 8171 gg of food in 2019 2 1 times more than the value in 1979 3869 gg bmbs nbs 1980 bmbs nbs 2020 as an important node of nitrogen input and pollution in beijing food consumption is a crucial target for nitrogen regulation and management urbanization and agglomeration have accelerated nitrogen production and flows for food consumption chen et al 2020 barles et al 2007 depicted the nitrogen flow pattern in paris and found that nitrogen input to the city increased fourfold between 1801 and 1914 hence suggesting that population explosion was one of the key factors forkes et al 2007 showed that only 4 7 of nitrogen was recycled during the food consumption process in toronto while the vast majority of the remaining nitrogen accumulated in the environment subsequently yan et al 2012 pointed out the role of urbanization in promoting food n consumption in xiamen noting that food nitrogen consumption increased by 88 91 in 2010 compared to 1988 some studies have also focused on urban rural differences in food consumption structure for example wei et al 2008 showed that from 1982 to 2002 with urbanization food n consumption by urban residents increased by 145 3 while it in rural areas decreased by 8 1 gao et al 2018 2019 pointed out that the consumption of animal food n in china has increased by 17 in the last 30 years and that the urbanization has led to a continuous increase in the proportion of animal based foods high in nitrogen consumption resulting in a higher n loss into the environment tilman and clark 2014 a range of socio economic factors drives the changes in food n consumption two methods have been widely used in the analysis of influencing factors correlation analysis and factor decomposition analysis zhang et al 2019 in previous studies using correlation analysis researchers mainly chose indicators such as disposable income per capita food price index the share of higher education and engel s coefficient to fit with food n consumption yu et al 2012 li et al 2016 in the study about shenzhen the researchers chose the population density and gdp per capita in urban areas as the leading indicators of population urbanization and economic urbanization respectively they considered the relationship between disposable income per capita engel s coefficient food price index average household size and the food n footprint of residents xian and ouyang 2016 xian et al 2020 the study of xiamen indicated a negative correlation between average household size and food n consumption research about chongqing also fitted the correlation between gdp per capita and food n showing a significant positive correlation between the two li et al 2016 gao et al 2018 2019 considered dietary change effect local population growth effect local rural to urban migration effect migration from other regions effect and net food export effect on food n consumption although this method can reflect the correlation between different factors and food consumption it cannot fully quantify the relative contribution of each factor in contrast factor decomposition analysis can comprehensively consider the contribution of different factors to food n consumption and reflect the degree and direction of each factor among multiple decomposition models the logarithmic mean weight divisia index method lmdi is the most widely used one liu et al 2013 in studies on nitrogen lmdi has been mainly applied to nitrogen containing pollutant emissions anthropogenic nitrogen consumption etc researchers have explored the causes of environmental loads from the emission side considering influencing factors such as structure scale efficiency and intensity while also incorporating factors such as social and technological progress into their studies wang et al 2017 jia et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 analyzed the factors affecting anthropogenic n consumption identified the direction facilitation or inhibition of each factor and quantified the contribution degree of the influencing factors however few studies have applied the lmdi model to food n consumption in response to the urban rural duality characteristics that were less considered in previous studies this study calculated the food nitrogen amount of urban and rural residents in beijing from 1979 to 2019 we compared phase changes and dual structural characteristics and established the lmdi model to identify the key factors of food n consumption in beijing this study is intended to provide a reference for urban nitrogen management to reasonably plan its food nitrogen inputs and provide a scientific basis to optimize residents dietary structure 2 methodology 2 1 study area and system boundary beijing is chosen to be the study area of this article as it is a typical urbanized metropolitan in china it covers an area of 16 4 thousand km2 and embraces a population of 21 8 million 2020 since the reform and opening up beijing s gross domestic products and its population have rapidly grown in this case food consumption also increases sharply as mentioned above this study s system boundary refers to beijing s geographical land border the division of urban and rural residents is based on the data from the yearbooks provided by the governments 2 2 calculation of food nitrogen amount this study calculated nitrogen consumption in eight food groups including cereals vegetables meat poultry eggs milk aquatic products and melons and fruits the food nitrogen content can be calculated as follows 2 1 w p i 1 n ω pi 2 2 ω pi ω i p i where wp represents the total food nitrogen consumption ωpi is the nitrogen consumption of food i ωi indicates the total consumption of food i and pi means nitrogen content of food i in table 1 the nitrogen contents of different food groups are shown in table 1 gu 2011 2 3 the decomposition model according to previous studies food n consumption is related to disposable income per capita engel s coefficient food price index the share of the population in higher education average household size and degree of urbanization luo et al 2005 xian et al 2020 in addition considering that dietary habits differ between urban and rural areas food n consumption is related to the dietary structure of residents in this study we selected six factors to establish the lmdi model including food consumption structure food price level engel s coefficient consumption level per capita gdp and population to investigate the direction and extent of their contributions to food n consumption 2 3 f c

consumption f c i t is food consumption f c v i t represents food consumption expenditure c v i t represents total consumption expenditure g d p i t stands for total gdp of the study area p i t stands for the population according to eqs 2 3 and 2 4 can be further obtained the terms can be corresponded to each other 2 4 m i t d s i t f v i t e c i t c l i t r i t p i t where m i t represents food n consumption d s i t stands for the proportion of nitrogen in food consumption characterizing the dietary structure f v i t represents the ratio of food consumption to food consumption expenditure reflecting the level of food prices e c i t represents the ratio of food expenditure to total consumption expenditure i e engel coefficient c l i t stands for the ratio of total consumption expenditure to total gdp reflecting resident s consumption level r i t represents gdp to population ratio i e gdp per capita in the study area reflecting socio economic factors the change in food n consumption from the start of the base year 0 to the target year t can be expressed as follows 2 5 δ m m t m 0 δ m d s δ m f v δ m e c δ m c l δ m r δ m p where δ m denotes the amount of change in food n consumption from year 0 to t δ m d s δ m f v δ m e c δ m c l δ m r δ m p denotes the effects of food consumption structure food price level engel s coefficient consumption level per capita gdp and population on the change of food n consumption in the target area respectively based on eq 2 5 the factors can be decomposed as follows 2 6 δ m d s l m t m 0 ln d s t d s 0 2 7 δ m f v l m t m 0

s δ m δ m f v δ m δ m e c δ m δ m c l δ m δ m r δ m δ m p δ m 100 100 based on the factor decomposition model constructed above we studied the driving factors of the growth of food n consumption in beijing from 1979 to 2019 we analyzed the direction and magnitude of the contribution of dietary structure food price level engel s coefficient consumption level per capita gdp and population effect on the change of food n consumption so as to identify the key factors 2 4 data collection the data required for this study were mainly obtained from beijing statistical yearbook and china statistical yearbook from 1980 to 2020 2000 2014 yearbook only included residents food consumption expenditure and urban food consumption data were missing so price and price index were used to obtain consumption data through conversion the 12 month prices of various food items in 2014 were obtained from china price statistical yearbook 2015 and the prices of different food items in each year were obtained by taking the arithmetic mean and converting them with the price indices of various food items from 2001 to 2014 in beijing statistical yearbook in addition milk consumption data was still missing for some years the milk consumption in rural areas in 1985 1992 was obtained from beijing sixty years since milk consumption of rural residents in the early years was very small and varied little this study considered milk consumption of rural residents in 1979 1984 to be the same as that in 1985 by default wang and deng 2012 while the consumption of urban residents in 2000 2014 was considered 4 6 times that of rural residents in the same year yuan 2001 3 results 3 1 changes in total and structural of food n consumption in beijing from 1979 to 2019 food n consumption in beijing increased nearly 1 fold 91 3 increase fig 1 and went through three distinct phases the city s food n consumption in the first 15 years generally remained around 38 gg with an average annual growth rate of only 0 06 this is because the total food consumption did not show a significant growth trend at the beginning of the reform and opening up period influenced by the previous unified sales and purchase policies and the average annual growth rate of food consumption was only 0 5 furthermore the average annual growth rate of beijing s population was 1 5 which was lower than the average level during the whole period 1979 2019 fig 2 in the second phase from 1994 to 2006 there was a significant increase compared to the previous stage with an average annual growth rate 2 4 nearly 40 times higher than the last reaching a peak of 49 1 gg in 2005 in this period the population grew at an average annual rate of 3 0 which had a more significant pull on the growth of total food n consumption fig 2 in the third stage from 2006 to 2019 total food n consumption increased further at an average annual rate of 3 2 especially from 2018 to 2019 with an average yearly growth rate of 10 4 and total food n consumption averaged 61 5 gg 25 higher than the peak of the previous stage 49 1 gg and reached a maximum of 70 8 gg in 2019 in contrast to the last stage the average annual growth rate of food consumption in the third stage was 3 9 which was relatively close to that of food n consumption however later in this stage the slowdown in population growth due to beijing s increasingly stringent population policy especially the population growth deficit since 2017 has somewhat slowed the growth trend in food n consumption fig 2 regarding the dietary structure the nitrogen consumption of all eight food types showed an increasing trend during 1979 2019 cereals have been the most significant food type in terms of nitrogen consumption since the beginning with cereals dominating overwhelmingly 76 1 in 1979 and increasing to 1 1 times the 1979 level in 2019 but its share decreased to 43 7 mainly because meat nitrogen consumption increased 3 8 times in 40 years meat nitrogen consumption was 2 4 times higher than vegetables in 2019 and its share increased from 8 0 in 1979 to 20 3 in 2019 overtaking vegetables as the second largest food group after cereals in 1979 vegetables were the second largest while it was the only type other than cereals whose share of nitrogen consumption decreased however the decline in the percentage of vegetables was slight from 10 1 in 1979 to 8 3 in 2019 due to a 1 6 fold increase in nitrogen consumption nitrogen consumption of eggs 6 2 gg ranked third in 2019 8 2 times higher than the value in 1979 and its share increased from 2 0 in 1979 to 8 8 in 2019 poultry and melons and fruits had the most significant increases both more than 10 times with poultry nitrogen consumption in 2019 being 19 7 times higher than the value in 1979 and melons and fruits being 15 7 times higher the initial share of nitrogen consumption of both poultry and melons and fruits was less than 1 but after a large increase more than 100 the final share was in the range of 2 5 5 6 becoming an important part of the food consumption structure this indicated that with improved living standards residents paid more attention to dietary health and the consumption of poultry with higher protein content and healthier fruits and vegetables is increasing fig 3 the initial share of nitrogen consumption in milk was relatively small 0 6 and grew in fluctuation to 2 8 in 2019 and nitrogen consumption increased from 0 23 gg in 1979 to 1 98 gg in 2019 3 2 comparison between urban and rural food nitrogen consumption in beijing fig 4 a shows the differences in food n consumption between urban and rural areas where they were relatively equal at the beginning but the contribution of urban food n consumption was significant 87 at the later stage food n consumption in urban areas increased 2 1 times while rural food n consumption in 2019 decreased to 55 of that in 1979 and urban food n consumption in 2019 was 6 4 times higher than that in rural areas despite the fluctuating upward trend of total food n consumption in beijing from 1979 to 2019 rural food n consumption was in decline and its contribution to total urban food n consumption decreased from 47 in 1979 to 13 in 2019 which may be related to the change of urban rural population ratio and the difference of residents dietary structure the trend of food n consumption and population change curves in urban and rural areas before 2000 was relatively consistent only after 2000 the influence of population on urban food n consumption had decreased and the population continued to maintain growth but food n consumption showed a fluctuating increase this may be due to the profound changes in the dietary habits of the residents as the economy continues to develop 2018 2019 saw a significant rebound in urban food n consumption despite the negative population growth unlike the impact of the urban population on urban food n consumption the rural population has shown simultaneous changes in rural food n consumption since 1979 however in 2018 2019 while the rural population still showed a slow decline there was a slight rebound in rural food n consumption food n consumption and food consumption in both urban and rural areas were generally consistent over most of the time except 2013 2015 in urban areas where the trends were reversed due to a decline in consumption of meat poultry eggs and aquatic products with higher nitrogen content coefficients in 2013 and a large increase in milk and vegetables with lower nitrogen content coefficients resulting in the decrease of food n consumption despite the increase in urban food consumption however urban food consumption decreased in 2015 and the consumption of meat which has a higher nitrogen content coefficient had a significant increase so urban food n consumption showed an increase the correlation between food n consumption and population and food consumption indicated the driving influence of these two factors on urban food n consumption it also revealed that a single factor has a limited impact on food n consumption and multiple factors jointly dominate its changes the structure of food n consumption in urban areas had similar characteristics to that in the whole city and the change in food n consumption structure in rural areas shows a different trend as can be seen in fig 5 the nitrogen consumption of all eight food types in urban areas showed an increase during 1979 2019 while the nitrogen consumption of cereals and vegetables decreased among the eight food types of nitrogen consumption for rural residents for both urban and rural areas cereals have been the largest food type in terms of nitrogen consumption since the beginning with both urban and rural cereals dominating overwhelmingly in 1979 68 3 and 84 9 and urban food n consumption increased 1 fold in 2019 but its share decreased to 43 2 rural areas decreased by nearly 70 from 14 8 gg in 1979 to 4 5 gg in 2019 and its share decreased to 47 1 the significant decrease in the share of food n consumption was accompanied by an increase in the share of meat which increased 4 3 times in urban areas to 20 37 in 2019 and 16 4 times in rural areas to 20 02 in 2019 both second only to cereals the share of rural vegetables nitrogen consumption was still above meat in 1979 but in 2019 the share of vegetables 7 9 was only 40 of meat poultry was the food group with the largest share increase with the share of urban and rural poultry in 2019 being 6 1 and 44 3 times higher than the value in 1979 respectively clearly for most rural households poultry was not among the daily consumption options in the early years because of self sufficiency this situation shifted in 2019 as rural land has decreased and the lifestyle of the residents has changed for urban food n consumption melons and fruits were the food group with the second highest increase in share after poultry accounting for 5 1 times more in 2019 than in 1979 for rural areas milk was second only to poultry with a 33 3 times higher share in 2019 than in 1979 3 3 analysis of the drivers of food n consumption based on the analysis of total and structural food n consumption in beijing according to the three phases mentioned above the slow growth phase 1979 1994 the first accelerated growth phase 1994 2006 and the second accelerated growth phase 2006 2019 we analyzed the contributions of six drivers to the changes of food n consumption during 1979 2019 including dietary structure food price level engel s coefficient consumption level per capita gdp and population the results showed that gdp per capita and population factors consistently drove the growth of food n consumption during the study period while the food price level and engel s coefficient showed inhibitory effects fig 6 as shown in table 2 gdp per capita 75 30 gg 68 95 gg 66 85 gg and population 8 39 gg 14 89 gg 17 35 gg exhibited pulling effects in all three stages food price level 77 20 gg 30 86 gg 13 51 gg and engel s coefficient 8 96 gg 21 66 gg 20 41 gg showed inhibition dietary structure 2 26 gg 1 45 gg 4 24 gg showed weak inhibition in the first and the third stage while the second stage showed a weak pull effect consumption level 4 84 gg 22 12 gg 23 01 gg showed a weak pulling effect in the first stage and a suppression in the second and the third stage the overall increase in the contributions of pulling factors were accompanied by an overall decrease in the contribution of inhibiting factors such as food price level and engel s coefficient leading to a gradual increase in the amount of changes in food n consumption in the three stages food n consumption increased by 0 09 gg 10 65 gg and 23 03 gg respectively the annual average food nitrogen consumption in the first stage was 0 01 gg yr and in the second stage increased to 0 82 gg yr and then increased twofold to 1 64 gg yr in the third stage the sum of the contribution rates of the three stages of pull factors was 50 02 53 33 and 57 92 respectively table 3 and the contribution rates were increasing the dominant factor in all three stages was gdp per capita whose contribution rate was between 79 and 85 of the pull factors the contribution of gdp per capita to the change of food n consumption was in the range of 42 46 and the values increased slightly in a stable manner 42 55 43 11 and 45 99 in order indicating that the annual increasing economic volume of beijing has a non negligible role in food n consumption gdp per can also reflect changes in the level of disposable income of residents which in turn showed changes in their dietary tendencies studies have shown that high income residents tended to exhibit high nitrogen and high price food consumption habits zhao et al 2017 seto and ramankutty 2016 thus with the increasing per capita gdp in beijing residents total food n consumption accelerated phase by phase it was noteworthy that although gdp per capita has the most significant and increasing contribution to the consumption of food n the actual contribution gradually decreased table 2 from 75 30 gg in the first stage to 66 85 gg in the third stage the contribution of the population also played an important role in the change of food n consumption and the rate of increase was more significant than that of gdp per capita with an increase of nearly 1 5 times in the third stage compared with the first stage the increase in population led to an increase in food consumption as well as food n consumption and the results once again demonstrated the direct influence of population growth on the change of total food n consumption in beijing from a quantitative perspective the sum of the contribution rates of the three stages of the inhibitory factors was 49 97 46 67 and 41 18 respectively with decreasing inhibitory contributions among them the dominant factor in the first stage was the food price level whose contribution accounted for 87 of all the inhibitory factors the inhibitory contributions in the second and the third stage were jointly determined by food price level engel s coefficient and consumption level among the six drivers food price level and engel s coefficient showed suppressive effects throughout the study period among them the contribution of food price level kept decreasing from 43 63 in the first stage to 9 29 in the third stage and the real contribution also showed a decrease 77 20 gg 30 86 gg 13 51 gg the absolute value of engel s coefficient contribution kept increasing from 5 06 in the first stage to 14 04 in the third stage but its contribution amount showed first an increase and then a decrease 8 96 gg 21 66 gg 20 41 gg the engel s coefficient in the second stage 1995 2006 decreased more significantly in value and had a stronger inhibitory effect the suppressive effect of food price level and engel s coefficient on the change of food n consumption may because that as the economic level increased the price level increased and the amount of food that could be purchased per unit price decreased while the engel s coefficient decreased indicating that food consumption expenditure as a percentage of total household consumption expenditure decreased thus suppressing the increase in food n consumption the weakening of the inhibitory effect of food price level indicated that residents were less sensitive to price changes and food consumption patterns were gradually decoupled from the constraints of food prices and food consumption expenditures consumption level ratio of total consumption expenditure to gdp showed a trend of pulling and then suppressing 2 73 gg 13 83 gg 15 83 gg within the first stage the growth rate of residential consumption expenditure was greater than the growth rate of gdp per capita this may be related to the continuous reduction of rural population and the gradual reduction of traditional self consumption level in rural areas stemming from the development of market economy and urbanization which in turn caused a substantial increase in residential consumption expenditure in the first stage in the next two stages the growth rate of gdp per capita exceeded the growth rate of consumption expenditure resulting in a numerical downward trend in consumption level the first stage presented as a pull probably because that in the early stage of reform and opening up the fast growth of the economy was mainly driven by domestic consumption demand some studies showed that the contribution of consumer spending to economic growth averaged 66 64 in 1978 1990 much higher than the contribution of gross capital formation and net exports 23 9 and 9 87 in the same period in turn among the consumption expenditures the growth of food consumption expenditures of urban and rural residents was the fastest li 2018 thus showing a pull on the change in food n consumption in the second and the third stage however the demand for economic growth gradually shifted from domestic demand to both domestic and external demand especially after 2000 when the pull of external demand on economic growth increased significantly leading to a continuous decline in total consumption expenditure per unit of gdp meanwhile the engel s coefficient kept decreasing and the ratio of food consumption expenditure to total consumption expenditure decreased thus exerting a dampening effect on the increase of food n consumption dietary structure showed a depressing effect on the change of food n consumption at the first and the third stage while it showed a pulling effect at the second stage however the absolute value of its contribution was the lowest among the six factors at the three stages and the promotion or inhibition effect was not obvious 4 discussion in this study the analysis of the total and structure of food n consumption in beijing over the past 40 years showed that the proportion of cereals and vegetables n consumption decreased in different degrees meanwhile food consumption types for major families became diverse with a significant increase in the consumption of animal foods such as meat and poultry which is consistent with the findings of gao et al 2018 which studied the trend of food n consumption in china from 1990 to 2012 the changes in the characteristics of food n consumption in the three stages basically confirmed the development of food consumption stages of urban and rural chinese residents namely subsistence consumption 1978 1993 quality consumption 1994 2002 and developmental consumption 2003 2018 yin et al 2020 comparative urban rural analysis showed significant differences between the two with the completion of the poverty eradication target and the promotion of the rural revitalization strategy the rural economy will face new historical development opportunities and it can be expected that the food consumption habits of rural residents will continue to converge to those of urban residents and the food consumption structure will increasingly tend to be with high nitrogen on the other hand studies have already shown that beijing has been reverse urbanization tang and xiao 2017 and is in the transition stage from urbanization to suburbanization mao and wang 2014 with the renaissance of the rural population the environmental pressure caused by rural residents food nitrogen consumption would not be neglected in the near future we first applied the lmdi model to food n consumption accounting the rapid growth of disposable income per capita was the result of urbanization and gdp per capita was the indicator used to measure the degree of urbanization of the economy i e the gdp per capita indicator can also be used to characterize the change in disposable income per capita the results showed that gdp per capita played the most important pulling role in the change of food n consumption implying that the increase in per capita income was one of the main drivers of food n consumption also food price was a very important influencing factor and the food price index reflected the changes in market prices of each food group which was influenced by factors such as market supply and demand and inflation in previous correlation studies the food price index has been correlated with food nitrogen consumption positively yu et al 2012 li et al 2016 in this study the ratio of food consumption to food consumption expenditure was used to characterize food price level and its effect was shown to be suppressed in fact food price index is equivalent to the inverse of food price level and the positive correlation between food price index and food n consumption is equivalent to the negative correlation between food price level and food n consumption which indicated that the result of this study was consistent with the results of previous correlation studies in addition the highest contribution of food price level exhibited within the first stage and the decreasing inhibitory effect within the second and the third stage reflected the influence of price factors on food n consumption more profoundly as mentioned above since the reform and opening up urbanization has been continuing on the one hand the self consumption of rural residents has been decreasing and prices have been rising on the other hand the dietary habits of residents have gradually changed from mainly plant based food to a combination of plant based and animal based food while animal based food tends to be more expensive and richer in nitrogen thus causing food n consumption to rise while the growth rate of food consumption expenditure was greater than the growth rate of food consumption this shows that the effect of price factors on food n consumption is not only caused by market changes but also contributed by changes in dietary structure and habits of urban and rural residents in previous correlation studies engel s coefficient and food n consumption showed a negative relationship yu et al 2012 li et al 2016 this is consistent with the inhibitory effect exhibited by the engel s coefficient here in this study engel s coefficient was the second most inhibitory factor for the change in food n consumption but the actual contribution of engel s coefficient to the change in food nitrogen consumption gradually stabilized as residents food consumption habits entered a developmental stage and the types and structure of food consumption were relatively fixed the results of gao et al 2018 2019 showed that dietary habit change was one of the most important drivers regardless of national or urban scales however in beijing the importance of dietary habit change has significantly decreased since the new century as per capita food n consumption has remained relatively stable replaced by population growth the prominent contribution of dietary habits in the results of gao et al was mainly because economic urbanization indicators were not considered but the impact of the development of urbanization on the change of food n consumption was considered from the perspective of the number and composition of the population in the study by gao et al the change in dietary habits was directly measured by the shift in plant based and animal based nitrogen consumption which corresponded to a part of the combined effect of food consumption structure and food price level in this study considering both the sum effect of their contributions to the change in food n consumption was not negligible in addition shenzhen a typical immigrant city has an urban population growth that exceeded the gdp per capita as the main driver xian et al 2020 beijing on the other hand showed the opposite characteristic i e gdp per capita exceeded the population factor in contributing relatively more to the increase in food n consumption probably because inter urban migration became the largest driver of food n consumption increase during urbanization exceeding local population growth and local rural to urban migration gao et al 2019 food consumption may contribute to nitrogen pollution at several points such as food residues and human excreta the increase in food n consumption does impact beijing s ecological environment and surrounding areas for example a study of pollution in beijing from 1999 to 2014 showed that tn is one of the major nonpoint sources of pollution and that this kind of pollution increased during the study period mainly in residential areas zhi et al 2018 however how food consumption specifically affects the regional pollution status requires further targeted research 5 conclusions this study accounted for the total food nitrogen consumption in beijing from 1979 to 2019 it provided a comparative analysis of the total food nitrogen consumption and structure in rural and urban areas this study is the first to apply the lmdi model to identify food nitrogen consumption drivers providing a comprehensive and intuitive reference basis for overall urban nitrogen management it was found that the urban rural duality of total food nitrogen consumption in beijing was apparent food nitrogen consumption of urban residents increased 2 1 times from 1979 to 2019 and all 8 types of food nitrogen consumption showed an increase in contrast the food nitrogen consumption of rural residents decreased to 55 of that in 1979 in 2019 however the changes in potential threats to the environment from urban and rural areas tended to be the same from the perspective of food nitrogen consumption the proportion of nitrogen consumption of food items with high nitrogen content such as meat and poultry increased significantly in both urban and rural areas in 2019 the proportion of nitrogen consumption of meat was second only to that of cereals for both urban and rural residents and the ratio of nitrogen consumption of poultry increased most significantly between 1979 and 2019 being 6 1 times and 44 3 times their 1979 consumption levels respectively high food nitrogen consumption implies high food nitrogen input and more incredible potential nitrogen waste eventually lost into the environment causing environmental stress and affecting the global nitrogen cycle therefore it is urgent to integrate urban and rural development and pay attention to rural nitrogen management in this study the food consumption mode of the population was household consumption due to the lack of data the consumption model of eating out was not considered and the concentration on household consumption also facilitated the comparative analysis of urban development levels at long time scales per capita food nitrogen consumption in china decreased from 4 7 kg n cap 1 yr 1 to 3 8 kg n cap 1 yr 1 from 1990 to 2012 gao et al 2018 and the lower limit of per capita food nitrogen consumption in beijing was as low as 2 7 kg n cap 1 yr 1 which was lower than the national average and the reason for the low results in this study may be that the proportion of eating out was not considered in contrast the proportion of eating out has been increasing since the beginning of the new century thus causing the difference in the results in addition in constructing the lmdi model some factors with high correlations such as the number of people in higher education and the average household size were discarded at the same time they may also contribute to the changes in food nitrogen consumption in a non negligible way the main drivers may be different since urban and rural areas have different economic development patterns and demographic trends this study combined urban and rural drivers to account for them due to the lack of gdp data future studies may consider distinguishing urban gdp from rural gdp to visually reflect the urban rural differences in the dimension of impact factors providing a decision basis for the government to control nitrogen consumption and pollution and promoting the overall healthy and stable

24397,as one of the important sources of nitrogen pollution in cities food consumption has major ramifications for the global nitrogen cycle making researches about food nitrogen and its urban optimization management of great significance taking beijing as an example we analyzed the differences in urban and rural characteristics of residents food nitrogen consumption on the time scale from 1979 to 2019 then used the logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi to construct a brand new factor decomposition model and identify the driving factors the results showed that overall food nitrogen consumption in beijing exhibited an increasing trend from 37 gg in 1979 to 70 77 gg in 2019 rural and urban residents showed the same direction of changing dietary habits switching to a high nitrogen animal consumption pattern gdp per capita was the most critical pulling factor followed by the population on the other hand the factors that always showed inhibition are food price level and engel s coefficient the results provide a scientific reference for the coordinated development of urban and rural areas and urban nitrogen management and a scientific basis for residents to reasonably plan their food nitrogen input graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords food nitrogen consumption urban rural dichotomy influencing factors lmdi beijing data availability the data can be found in supplementary information 1 introduction as an essential component of urban ecosystems food and its nutrient rich nitrogen are of great importance in the implementation of the un 2030 agenda for sustainable development especially in efforts to achieve goal 11 sustainable cities and communities and goal 12 responsible consumption and production un 2015 nitrogen plays an essential role in maintaining ecosystem productivity galloway et al 2014 and the production of excess reactive nitrogen due to anthropogenic interference has caused an imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle gao et al 2019 the nitrogen cycle disruption has become the third major global environmental problem after biodiversity loss and global warming giles 2005 galloway et al 2008 estimated that the worldwide population has increased by 78 since 1970 while the production of reactive nitrogen has risen by 120 food is rich in nitrogen and human food consumption is an important driver of activated nitrogen production pierer et al 2015 with social progress people s food demand is rising and the structure of food consumption has changed since the 1980s the dietary structure and nutritional patterns of chinese residents have shifted from mainly staple diet to staple food substitution and from mostly plant based food to both animal based and plant based food consumption li 2007 cui et al 2010 norman 1999 as well as going through survival quantitative and qualitative stages casani et al 2005 gao et al 2007 growing consumption and changing dietary structures can lead to a simultaneous increase in nitrogen inputs and environmental nitrogen loads an issue that has received considerable attention from researchers and managers beijing a representative globalized metropolis with a rapidly growing economic volume and population size consumed 8171 gg of food in 2019 2 1 times more than the value in 1979 3869 gg bmbs nbs 1980 bmbs nbs 2020 as an important node of nitrogen input and pollution in beijing food consumption is a crucial target for nitrogen regulation and management urbanization and agglomeration have accelerated nitrogen production and flows for food consumption chen et al 2020 barles et al 2007 depicted the nitrogen flow pattern in paris and found that nitrogen input to the city increased fourfold between 1801 and 1914 hence suggesting that population explosion was one of the key factors forkes et al 2007 showed that only 4 7 of nitrogen was recycled during the food consumption process in toronto while the vast majority of the remaining nitrogen accumulated in the environment subsequently yan et al 2012 pointed out the role of urbanization in promoting food n consumption in xiamen noting that food nitrogen consumption increased by 88 91 in 2010 compared to 1988 some studies have also focused on urban rural differences in food consumption structure for example wei et al 2008 showed that from 1982 to 2002 with urbanization food n consumption by urban residents increased by 145 3 while it in rural areas decreased by 8 1 gao et al 2018 2019 pointed out that the consumption of animal food n in china has increased by 17 in the last 30 years and that the urbanization has led to a continuous increase in the proportion of animal based foods high in nitrogen consumption resulting in a higher n loss into the environment tilman and clark 2014 a range of socio economic factors drives the changes in food n consumption two methods have been widely used in the analysis of influencing factors correlation analysis and factor decomposition analysis zhang et al 2019 in previous studies using correlation analysis researchers mainly chose indicators such as disposable income per capita food price index the share of higher education and engel s coefficient to fit with food n consumption yu et al 2012 li et al 2016 in the study about shenzhen the researchers chose the population density and gdp per capita in urban areas as the leading indicators of population urbanization and economic urbanization respectively they considered the relationship between disposable income per capita engel s coefficient food price index average household size and the food n footprint of residents xian and ouyang 2016 xian et al 2020 the study of xiamen indicated a negative correlation between average household size and food n consumption research about chongqing also fitted the correlation between gdp per capita and food n showing a significant positive correlation between the two li et al 2016 gao et al 2018 2019 considered dietary change effect local population growth effect local rural to urban migration effect migration from other regions effect and net food export effect on food n consumption although this method can reflect the correlation between different factors and food consumption it cannot fully quantify the relative contribution of each factor in contrast factor decomposition analysis can comprehensively consider the contribution of different factors to food n consumption and reflect the degree and direction of each factor among multiple decomposition models the logarithmic mean weight divisia index method lmdi is the most widely used one liu et al 2013 in studies on nitrogen lmdi has been mainly applied to nitrogen containing pollutant emissions anthropogenic nitrogen consumption etc researchers have explored the causes of environmental loads from the emission side considering influencing factors such as structure scale efficiency and intensity while also incorporating factors such as social and technological progress into their studies wang et al 2017 jia et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 analyzed the factors affecting anthropogenic n consumption identified the direction facilitation or inhibition of each factor and quantified the contribution degree of the influencing factors however few studies have applied the lmdi model to food n consumption in response to the urban rural duality characteristics that were less considered in previous studies this study calculated the food nitrogen amount of urban and rural residents in beijing from 1979 to 2019 we compared phase changes and dual structural characteristics and established the lmdi model to identify the key factors of food n consumption in beijing this study is intended to provide a reference for urban nitrogen management to reasonably plan its food nitrogen inputs and provide a scientific basis to optimize residents dietary structure 2 methodology 2 1 study area and system boundary beijing is chosen to be the study area of this article as it is a typical urbanized metropolitan in china it covers an area of 16 4 thousand km2 and embraces a population of 21 8 million 2020 since the reform and opening up beijing s gross domestic products and its population have rapidly grown in this case food consumption also increases sharply as mentioned above this study s system boundary refers to beijing s geographical land border the division of urban and rural residents is based on the data from the yearbooks provided by the governments 2 2 calculation of food nitrogen amount this study calculated nitrogen consumption in eight food groups including cereals vegetables meat poultry eggs milk aquatic products and melons and fruits the food nitrogen content can be calculated as follows 2 1 w p i 1 n ω pi 2 2 ω pi ω i p i where wp represents the total food nitrogen consumption ωpi is the nitrogen consumption of food i ωi indicates the total consumption of food i and pi means nitrogen content of food i in table 1 the nitrogen contents of different food groups are shown in table 1 gu 2011 2 3 the decomposition model according to previous studies food n consumption is related to disposable income per capita engel s coefficient food price index the share of the population in higher education average household size and degree of urbanization luo et al 2005 xian et al 2020 in addition considering that dietary habits differ between urban and rural areas food n consumption is related to the dietary structure of residents in this study we selected six factors to establish the lmdi model including food consumption structure food price level engel s coefficient consumption level per capita gdp and population to investigate the direction and extent of their contributions to food n consumption 2 3 f c n i t f c n i t f c i t f c i t f c v i t f c v i t c v i t c v i t g d p i t g d p i t p i t p i t where t represents years i stands for the region urban or rural f c n i t is food nitrogen consumption f c i t is food consumption f c v i t represents food consumption expenditure c v i t represents total consumption expenditure g d p i t stands for total gdp of the study area p i t stands for the population according to eqs 2 3 and 2 4 can be further obtained the terms can be corresponded to each other 2 4 m i t d s i t f v i t e c i t c l i t r i t p i t where m i t represents food n consumption d s i t stands for the proportion of nitrogen in food consumption characterizing the dietary structure f v i t represents the ratio of food consumption to food consumption expenditure reflecting the level of food prices e c i t represents the ratio of food expenditure to total consumption expenditure i e engel coefficient c l i t stands for the ratio of total consumption expenditure to total gdp reflecting resident s consumption level r i t represents gdp to population ratio i e gdp per capita in the study area reflecting socio economic factors the change in food n consumption from the start of the base year 0 to the target year t can be expressed as follows 2 5 δ m m t m 0 δ m d s δ m f v δ m e c δ m c l δ m r δ m p where δ m denotes the amount of change in food n consumption from year 0 to t δ m d s δ m f v δ m e c δ m c l δ m r δ m p denotes the effects of food consumption structure food price level engel s coefficient consumption level per capita gdp and population on the change of food n consumption in the target area respectively based on eq 2 5 the factors can be decomposed as follows 2 6 δ m d s l m t m 0 ln d s t d s 0 2 7 δ m f v l m t m 0 ln f v t f v 0 2 8 δ m e c l m t m 0 ln e c t e c 0 2 9 δ m c l l m t m 0 ln c l t c l 0 2 10 δ m r l m t m 0 ln r t r 0 2 11 δ m p l m t m 0 ln p t p 0 2 12 l m t m 0 m t m 0 ln m t ln m 0 2 13 δ m d s δ m δ m f v δ m δ m e c δ m δ m c l δ m δ m r δ m δ m p δ m 100 100 based on the factor decomposition model constructed above we studied the driving factors of the growth of food n consumption in beijing from 1979 to 2019 we analyzed the direction and magnitude of the contribution of dietary structure food price level engel s coefficient consumption level per capita gdp and population effect on the change of food n consumption so as to identify the key factors 2 4 data collection the data required for this study were mainly obtained from beijing statistical yearbook and china statistical yearbook from 1980 to 2020 2000 2014 yearbook only included residents food consumption expenditure and urban food consumption data were missing so price and price index were used to obtain consumption data through conversion the 12 month prices of various food items in 2014 were obtained from china price statistical yearbook 2015 and the prices of different food items in each year were obtained by taking the arithmetic mean and converting them with the price indices of various food items from 2001 to 2014 in beijing statistical yearbook in addition milk consumption data was still missing for some years the milk consumption in rural areas in 1985 1992 was obtained from beijing sixty years since milk consumption of rural residents in the early years was very small and varied little this study considered milk consumption of rural residents in 1979 1984 to be the same as that in 1985 by default wang and deng 2012 while the consumption of urban residents in 2000 2014 was considered 4 6 times that of rural residents in the same year yuan 2001 3 results 3 1 changes in total and structural of food n consumption in beijing from 1979 to 2019 food n consumption in beijing increased nearly 1 fold 91 3 increase fig 1 and went through three distinct phases the city s food n consumption in the first 15 years generally remained around 38 gg with an average annual growth rate of only 0 06 this is because the total food consumption did not show a significant growth trend at the beginning of the reform and opening up period influenced by the previous unified sales and purchase policies and the average annual growth rate of food consumption was only 0 5 furthermore the average annual growth rate of beijing s population was 1 5 which was lower than the average level during the whole period 1979 2019 fig 2 in the second phase from 1994 to 2006 there was a significant increase compared to the previous stage with an average annual growth rate 2 4 nearly 40 times higher than the last reaching a peak of 49 1 gg in 2005 in this period the population grew at an average annual rate of 3 0 which had a more significant pull on the growth of total food n consumption fig 2 in the third stage from 2006 to 2019 total food n consumption increased further at an average annual rate of 3 2 especially from 2018 to 2019 with an average yearly growth rate of 10 4 and total food n consumption averaged 61 5 gg 25 higher than the peak of the previous stage 49 1 gg and reached a maximum of 70 8 gg in 2019 in contrast to the last stage the average annual growth rate of food consumption in the third stage was 3 9 which was relatively close to that of food n consumption however later in this stage the slowdown in population growth due to beijing s increasingly stringent population policy especially the population growth deficit since 2017 has somewhat slowed the growth trend in food n consumption fig 2 regarding the dietary structure the nitrogen consumption of all eight food types showed an increasing trend during 1979 2019 cereals have been the most significant food type in terms of nitrogen consumption since the beginning with cereals dominating overwhelmingly 76 1 in 1979 and increasing to 1 1 times the 1979 level in 2019 but its share decreased to 43 7 mainly because meat nitrogen consumption increased 3 8 times in 40 years meat nitrogen consumption was 2 4 times higher than vegetables in 2019 and its share increased from 8 0 in 1979 to 20 3 in 2019 overtaking vegetables as the second largest food group after cereals in 1979 vegetables were the second largest while it was the only type other than cereals whose share of nitrogen consumption decreased however the decline in the percentage of vegetables was slight from 10 1 in 1979 to 8 3 in 2019 due to a 1 6 fold increase in nitrogen consumption nitrogen consumption of eggs 6 2 gg ranked third in 2019 8 2 times higher than the value in 1979 and its share increased from 2 0 in 1979 to 8 8 in 2019 poultry and melons and fruits had the most significant increases both more than 10 times with poultry nitrogen consumption in 2019 being 19 7 times higher than the value in 1979 and melons and fruits being 15 7 times higher the initial share of nitrogen consumption of both poultry and melons and fruits was less than 1 but after a large increase more than 100 the final share was in the range of 2 5 5 6 becoming an important part of the food consumption structure this indicated that with improved living standards residents paid more attention to dietary health and the consumption of poultry with higher protein content and healthier fruits and vegetables is increasing fig 3 the initial share of nitrogen consumption in milk was relatively small 0 6 and grew in fluctuation to 2 8 in 2019 and nitrogen consumption increased from 0 23 gg in 1979 to 1 98 gg in 2019 3 2 comparison between urban and rural food nitrogen consumption in beijing fig 4 a shows the differences in food n consumption between urban and rural areas where they were relatively equal at the beginning but the contribution of urban food n consumption was significant 87 at the later stage food n consumption in urban areas increased 2 1 times while rural food n consumption in 2019 decreased to 55 of that in 1979 and urban food n consumption in 2019 was 6 4 times higher than that in rural areas despite the fluctuating upward trend of total food n consumption in beijing from 1979 to 2019 rural food n consumption was in decline and its contribution to total urban food n consumption decreased from 47 in 1979 to 13 in 2019 which may be related to the change of urban rural population ratio and the difference of residents dietary structure the trend of food n consumption and population change curves in urban and rural areas before 2000 was relatively consistent only after 2000 the influence of population on urban food n consumption had decreased and the population continued to maintain growth but food n consumption showed a fluctuating increase this may be due to the profound changes in the dietary habits of the residents as the economy continues to develop 2018 2019 saw a significant rebound in urban food n consumption despite the negative population growth unlike the impact of the urban population on urban food n consumption the rural population has shown simultaneous changes in rural food n consumption since 1979 however in 2018 2019 while the rural population still showed a slow decline there was a slight rebound in rural food n consumption food n consumption and food consumption in both urban and rural areas were generally consistent over most of the time except 2013 2015 in urban areas where the trends were reversed due to a decline in consumption of meat poultry eggs and aquatic products with higher nitrogen content coefficients in 2013 and a large increase in milk and vegetables with lower nitrogen content coefficients resulting in the decrease of food n consumption despite the increase in urban food consumption however urban food consumption decreased in 2015 and the consumption of meat which has a higher nitrogen content coefficient had a significant increase so urban food n consumption showed an increase the correlation between food n consumption and population and food consumption indicated the driving influence of these two factors on urban food n consumption it also revealed that a single factor has a limited impact on food n consumption and multiple factors jointly dominate its changes the structure of food n consumption in urban areas had similar characteristics to that in the whole city and the change in food n consumption structure in rural areas shows a different trend as can be seen in fig 5 the nitrogen consumption of all eight food types in urban areas showed an increase during 1979 2019 while the nitrogen consumption of cereals and vegetables decreased among the eight food types of nitrogen consumption for rural residents for both urban and rural areas cereals have been the largest food type in terms of nitrogen consumption since the beginning with both urban and rural cereals dominating overwhelmingly in 1979 68 3 and 84 9 and urban food n consumption increased 1 fold in 2019 but its share decreased to 43 2 rural areas decreased by nearly 70 from 14 8 gg in 1979 to 4 5 gg in 2019 and its share decreased to 47 1 the significant decrease in the share of food n consumption was accompanied by an increase in the share of meat which increased 4 3 times in urban areas to 20 37 in 2019 and 16 4 times in rural areas to 20 02 in 2019 both second only to cereals the share of rural vegetables nitrogen consumption was still above meat in 1979 but in 2019 the share of vegetables 7 9 was only 40 of meat poultry was the food group with the largest share increase with the share of urban and rural poultry in 2019 being 6 1 and 44 3 times higher than the value in 1979 respectively clearly for most rural households poultry was not among the daily consumption options in the early years because of self sufficiency this situation shifted in 2019 as rural land has decreased and the lifestyle of the residents has changed for urban food n consumption melons and fruits were the food group with the second highest increase in share after poultry accounting for 5 1 times more in 2019 than in 1979 for rural areas milk was second only to poultry with a 33 3 times higher share in 2019 than in 1979 3 3 analysis of the drivers of food n consumption based on the analysis of total and structural food n consumption in beijing according to the three phases mentioned above the slow growth phase 1979 1994 the first accelerated growth phase 1994 2006 and the second accelerated growth phase 2006 2019 we analyzed the contributions of six drivers to the changes of food n consumption during 1979 2019 including dietary structure food price level engel s coefficient consumption level per capita gdp and population the results showed that gdp per capita and population factors consistently drove the growth of food n consumption during the study period while the food price level and engel s coefficient showed inhibitory effects fig 6 as shown in table 2 gdp per capita 75 30 gg 68 95 gg 66 85 gg and population 8 39 gg 14 89 gg 17 35 gg exhibited pulling effects in all three stages food price level 77 20 gg 30 86 gg 13 51 gg and engel s coefficient 8 96 gg 21 66 gg 20 41 gg showed inhibition dietary structure 2 26 gg 1 45 gg 4 24 gg showed weak inhibition in the first and the third stage while the second stage showed a weak pull effect consumption level 4 84 gg 22 12 gg 23 01 gg showed a weak pulling effect in the first stage and a suppression in the second and the third stage the overall increase in the contributions of pulling factors were accompanied by an overall decrease in the contribution of inhibiting factors such as food price level and engel s coefficient leading to a gradual increase in the amount of changes in food n consumption in the three stages food n consumption increased by 0 09 gg 10 65 gg and 23 03 gg respectively the annual average food nitrogen consumption in the first stage was 0 01 gg yr and in the second stage increased to 0 82 gg yr and then increased twofold to 1 64 gg yr in the third stage the sum of the contribution rates of the three stages of pull factors was 50 02 53 33 and 57 92 respectively table 3 and the contribution rates were increasing the dominant factor in all three stages was gdp per capita whose contribution rate was between 79 and 85 of the pull factors the contribution of gdp per capita to the change of food n consumption was in the range of 42 46 and the values increased slightly in a stable manner 42 55 43 11 and 45 99 in order indicating that the annual increasing economic volume of beijing has a non negligible role in food n consumption gdp per can also reflect changes in the level of disposable income of residents which in turn showed changes in their dietary tendencies studies have shown that high income residents tended to exhibit high nitrogen and high price food consumption habits zhao et al 2017 seto and ramankutty 2016 thus with the increasing per capita gdp in beijing residents total food n consumption accelerated phase by phase it was noteworthy that although gdp per capita has the most significant and increasing contribution to the consumption of food n the actual contribution gradually decreased table 2 from 75 30 gg in the first stage to 66 85 gg in the third stage the contribution of the population also played an important role in the change of food n consumption and the rate of increase was more significant than that of gdp per capita with an increase of nearly 1 5 times in the third stage compared with the first stage the increase in population led to an increase in food consumption as well as food n consumption and the results once again demonstrated the direct influence of population growth on the change of total food n consumption in beijing from a quantitative perspective the sum of the contribution rates of the three stages of the inhibitory factors was 49 97 46 67 and 41 18 respectively with decreasing inhibitory contributions among them the dominant factor in the first stage was the food price level whose contribution accounted for 87 of all the inhibitory factors the inhibitory contributions in the second and the third stage were jointly determined by food price level engel s coefficient and consumption level among the six drivers food price level and engel s coefficient showed suppressive effects throughout the study period among them the contribution of food price level kept decreasing from 43 63 in the first stage to 9 29 in the third stage and the real contribution also showed a decrease 77 20 gg 30 86 gg 13 51 gg the absolute value of engel s coefficient contribution kept increasing from 5 06 in the first stage to 14 04 in the third stage but its contribution amount showed first an increase and then a decrease 8 96 gg 21 66 gg 20 41 gg the engel s coefficient in the second stage 1995 2006 decreased more significantly in value and had a stronger inhibitory effect the suppressive effect of food price level and engel s coefficient on the change of food n consumption may because that as the economic level increased the price level increased and the amount of food that could be purchased per unit price decreased while the engel s coefficient decreased indicating that food consumption expenditure as a percentage of total household consumption expenditure decreased thus suppressing the increase in food n consumption the weakening of the inhibitory effect of food price level indicated that residents were less sensitive to price changes and food consumption patterns were gradually decoupled from the constraints of food prices and food consumption expenditures consumption level ratio of total consumption expenditure to gdp showed a trend of pulling and then suppressing 2 73 gg 13 83 gg 15 83 gg within the first stage the growth rate of residential consumption expenditure was greater than the growth rate of gdp per capita this may be related to the continuous reduction of rural population and the gradual reduction of traditional self consumption level in rural areas stemming from the development of market economy and urbanization which in turn caused a substantial increase in residential consumption expenditure in the first stage in the next two stages the growth rate of gdp per capita exceeded the growth rate of consumption expenditure resulting in a numerical downward trend in consumption level the first stage presented as a pull probably because that in the early stage of reform and opening up the fast growth of the economy was mainly driven by domestic consumption demand some studies showed that the contribution of consumer spending to economic growth averaged 66 64 in 1978 1990 much higher than the contribution of gross capital formation and net exports 23 9 and 9 87 in the same period in turn among the consumption expenditures the growth of food consumption expenditures of urban and rural residents was the fastest li 2018 thus showing a pull on the change in food n consumption in the second and the third stage however the demand for economic growth gradually shifted from domestic demand to both domestic and external demand especially after 2000 when the pull of external demand on economic growth increased significantly leading to a continuous decline in total consumption expenditure per unit of gdp meanwhile the engel s coefficient kept decreasing and the ratio of food consumption expenditure to total consumption expenditure decreased thus exerting a dampening effect on the increase of food n consumption dietary structure showed a depressing effect on the change of food n consumption at the first and the third stage while it showed a pulling effect at the second stage however the absolute value of its contribution was the lowest among the six factors at the three stages and the promotion or inhibition effect was not obvious 4 discussion in this study the analysis of the total and structure of food n consumption in beijing over the past 40 years showed that the proportion of cereals and vegetables n consumption decreased in different degrees meanwhile food consumption types for major families became diverse with a significant increase in the consumption of animal foods such as meat and poultry which is consistent with the findings of gao et al 2018 which studied the trend of food n consumption in china from 1990 to 2012 the changes in the characteristics of food n consumption in the three stages basically confirmed the development of food consumption stages of urban and rural chinese residents namely subsistence consumption 1978 1993 quality consumption 1994 2002 and developmental consumption 2003 2018 yin et al 2020 comparative urban rural analysis showed significant differences between the two with the completion of the poverty eradication target and the promotion of the rural revitalization strategy the rural economy will face new historical development opportunities and it can be expected that the food consumption habits of rural residents will continue to converge to those of urban residents and the food consumption structure will increasingly tend to be with high nitrogen on the other hand studies have already shown that beijing has been reverse urbanization tang and xiao 2017 and is in the transition stage from urbanization to suburbanization mao and wang 2014 with the renaissance of the rural population the environmental pressure caused by rural residents food nitrogen consumption would not be neglected in the near future we first applied the lmdi model to food n consumption accounting the rapid growth of disposable income per capita was the result of urbanization and gdp per capita was the indicator used to measure the degree of urbanization of the economy i e the gdp per capita indicator can also be used to characterize the change in disposable income per capita the results showed that gdp per capita played the most important pulling role in the change of food n consumption implying that the increase in per capita income was one of the main drivers of food n consumption also food price was a very important influencing factor and the food price index reflected the changes in market prices of each food group which was influenced by factors such as market supply and demand and inflation in previous correlation studies the food price index has been correlated with food nitrogen consumption positively yu et al 2012 li et al 2016 in this study the ratio of food consumption to food consumption expenditure was used to characterize food price level and its effect was shown to be suppressed in fact food price index is equivalent to the inverse of food price level and the positive correlation between food price index and food n consumption is equivalent to the negative correlation between food price level and food n consumption which indicated that the result of this study was consistent with the results of previous correlation studies in addition the highest contribution of food price level exhibited within the first stage and the decreasing inhibitory effect within the second and the third stage reflected the influence of price factors on food n consumption more profoundly as mentioned above since the reform and opening up urbanization has been continuing on the one hand the self consumption of rural residents has been decreasing and prices have been rising on the other hand the dietary habits of residents have gradually changed from mainly plant based food to a combination of plant based and animal based food while animal based food tends to be more expensive and richer in nitrogen thus causing food n consumption to rise while the growth rate of food consumption expenditure was greater than the growth rate of food consumption this shows that the effect of price factors on food n consumption is not only caused by market changes but also contributed by changes in dietary structure and habits of urban and rural residents in previous correlation studies engel s coefficient and food n consumption showed a negative relationship yu et al 2012 li et al 2016 this is consistent with the inhibitory effect exhibited by the engel s coefficient here in this study engel s coefficient was the second most inhibitory factor for the change in food n consumption but the actual contribution of engel s coefficient to the change in food nitrogen consumption gradually stabilized as residents food consumption habits entered a developmental stage and the types and structure of food consumption were relatively fixed the results of gao et al 2018 2019 showed that dietary habit change was one of the most important drivers regardless of national or urban scales however in beijing the importance of dietary habit change has significantly decreased since the new century as per capita food n consumption has remained relatively stable replaced by population growth the prominent contribution of dietary habits in the results of gao et al was mainly because economic urbanization indicators were not considered but the impact of the development of urbanization on the change of food n consumption was considered from the perspective of the number and composition of the population in the study by gao et al the change in dietary habits was directly measured by the shift in plant based and animal based nitrogen consumption which corresponded to a part of the combined effect of food consumption structure and food price level in this study considering both the sum effect of their contributions to the change in food n consumption was not negligible in addition shenzhen a typical immigrant city has an urban population growth that exceeded the gdp per capita as the main driver xian et al 2020 beijing on the other hand showed the opposite characteristic i e gdp per capita exceeded the population factor in contributing relatively more to the increase in food n consumption probably because inter urban migration became the largest driver of food n consumption increase during urbanization exceeding local population growth and local rural to urban migration gao et al 2019 food consumption may contribute to nitrogen pollution at several points such as food residues and human excreta the increase in food n consumption does impact beijing s ecological environment and surrounding areas for example a study of pollution in beijing from 1999 to 2014 showed that tn is one of the major nonpoint sources of pollution and that this kind of pollution increased during the study period mainly in residential areas zhi et al 2018 however how food consumption specifically affects the regional pollution status requires further targeted research 5 conclusions this study accounted for the total food nitrogen consumption in beijing from 1979 to 2019 it provided a comparative analysis of the total food nitrogen consumption and structure in rural and urban areas this study is the first to apply the lmdi model to identify food nitrogen consumption drivers providing a comprehensive and intuitive reference basis for overall urban nitrogen management it was found that the urban rural duality of total food nitrogen consumption in beijing was apparent food nitrogen consumption of urban residents increased 2 1 times from 1979 to 2019 and all 8 types of food nitrogen consumption showed an increase in contrast the food nitrogen consumption of rural residents decreased to 55 of that in 1979 in 2019 however the changes in potential threats to the environment from urban and rural areas tended to be the same from the perspective of food nitrogen consumption the proportion of nitrogen consumption of food items with high nitrogen content such as meat and poultry increased significantly in both urban and rural areas in 2019 the proportion of nitrogen consumption of meat was second only to that of cereals for both urban and rural residents and the ratio of nitrogen consumption of poultry increased most significantly between 1979 and 2019 being 6 1 times and 44 3 times their 1979 consumption levels respectively high food nitrogen consumption implies high food nitrogen input and more incredible potential nitrogen waste eventually lost into the environment causing environmental stress and affecting the global nitrogen cycle therefore it is urgent to integrate urban and rural development and pay attention to rural nitrogen management in this study the food consumption mode of the population was household consumption due to the lack of data the consumption model of eating out was not considered and the concentration on household consumption also facilitated the comparative analysis of urban development levels at long time scales per capita food nitrogen consumption in china decreased from 4 7 kg n cap 1 yr 1 to 3 8 kg n cap 1 yr 1 from 1990 to 2012 gao et al 2018 and the lower limit of per capita food nitrogen consumption in beijing was as low as 2 7 kg n cap 1 yr 1 which was lower than the national average and the reason for the low results in this study may be that the proportion of eating out was not considered in contrast the proportion of eating out has been increasing since the beginning of the new century thus causing the difference in the results in addition in constructing the lmdi model some factors with high correlations such as the number of people in higher education and the average household size were discarded at the same time they may also contribute to the changes in food nitrogen consumption in a non negligible way the main drivers may be different since urban and rural areas have different economic development patterns and demographic trends this study combined urban and rural drivers to account for them due to the lack of gdp data future studies may consider distinguishing urban gdp from rural gdp to visually reflect the urban rural differences in the dimension of impact factors providing a decision basis for the government to control nitrogen consumption and pollution and promoting the overall healthy and stable

24398,animal biodiversity and its key roles in ecosystem state and functioning is facing critical challenges in the wake of anthropogenic activities it is urgently necessary to improve understanding of the interconnections between animals and the vegetation within ecosystems process based modelling has shown to be a mighty tool in making assessments on ecological processes we assess the effect of different vegetation models on simulated animal biodiversity by replacing the vegetation module within madingley a multi trophic model of functional diversity with lpj guess a dynamic global vegetation model we compare the output metrics of the model system to madingley s default version for four ecosystem types around the globe and analyse whether the realism of the simulation results increased as a result of the coupling between madingley and lpj guess simulated animal populations react to the coupling by shifting towards smaller individuals with a higher abundance general shifts in body mass and animal distributions can be traced back to ecological processes allowing in depth analysis of heterotrophic responses to changes in leaf biomass we also derive power law relationships for herbivory to npp and herbivore biomass to npp and conclude that the coupled model system simulates animal populations that follow reasonable power laws which are similar to power laws derived from empirical data our results indicate that developing process based model systems is a viable way to assess multi trophic interconnections between animal populations and the ecosystems vegetation keywords modelling animal populations in terrestrial ecosystem advances refinement in methods for ecological modelling data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction animals can play a key role in controlling the state and function of all terrestrial ecosystems schmitz et al 2014 2018 by consuming autotrophic biomass herbivory enhances light transfer into plant canopies and affects net carbon assimilation cascading trophic effects triggered by top predators or the largest herbivores propagate through food webs regulating levels of herbivory and affecting soil carbon and nitrogen cycling through excreta and dead bodies schmitz et al 2014 however anthropogenic activities such as habitat modification harvesting and increasingly anthropogenic climate change are driving large declines in biodiversity cardinale et al 2012 pacifici et al 2015 arneth et al 2020 therefore a better understanding of how changes and losses of plant and animal functional diversity will affect ecosystem functioning is needed from the perspective of both an ecosystems role for both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation however the diverse mixture of species and the interconnectivity in food webs makes quantifying the link between ecosystem biogeochemical cycling and an ecosystems functional diversity a challenge schmitz et al 2018 animals comprise lower total biomass overall compared to plants bar on et al 2018 which could easily result in the assumption that animals play a relatively minor role in terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling but this view is being challenged by an increasing body of literature for instance for eastern africa holdo et al 2009 extrapolated impacts of strongly reduced wildebeest numbers due to the rinderpest into the future and hypothesised that major future wildebeest die offs might lead to a significant increase in grass biomass leading to changes in fire regimes and a potential shift of ecosystems into a net carbon source hooper et al 2012 suggested that the absence or presence of herbivores and carnivores within an ecosystem can lead to similar magnitude impacts as caused by other environmental change drivers such as global warming enhanced co2 or nitrogen pollution wilmers and schmitz 2016 estimated based on measurements that wolves preying upon moose in northern american boreal forests enhance net primary productivity npp and net ecosystem carbon uptake by up to 30 by decreasing moose co2 respiration and increasing growth of deciduous trees due to releasing herbivory pressure sobral et al 2017 carried out an analysis based on observations in the amazonian region which showed animal diversity influencing the carbon cycle directly via metabolism and indirectly via seed dispersal and altering the vegetations species composition nevertheless so far studies and extrapolations of their results that seek to link animal impacts to ecosystem biogeochemical cycles are typically limited by their temporal or spatial scale holdo et al 2009 staver and bond 2014 sobral et al 2017 or focus on a few distinct animal species schmitz et al 2018 nichols et al 2016 so limiting the general applicability of their conclusion process based models can help to overcome observation limitations and improve our knowledge about the complex interactions within ecosystems by expanding the scope to the whole ecosystem a few model studies have started to explore the role of animals berzaghi et al 2019 included elephant disturbances into an ecosystem demography model and showed that the resulting reduction in tree stem density altered competition for light and water and actually enhanced aboveground biomass pachzelt et al 2015 coupled a physiological grazer population model with a dynamic vegetation model and identified npp and the length of the dry season as the main determinants of grazer population size in african savannah ecosystems they found that the presence or absence of grazers substantially impacts the standing grass and tree vegetation biomass as well as the area vulnerable to burning dangal et al 2017 coupled a herbivore population dynamics model with a dynamic land ecosystem model and were able to preproduce observed herbivore populations for livestock species the presence of these herbivores reduced the npp in all nine modelled regions while revealing a vulnerability of herbivores to climate extremes while these studies contribute important information to the understanding of animals roles in ecosystem functioning they also focus on distinct animal species or species classes and neglect complexities such as the top down control predators impose on herbivores and omnivores and thus food webs in ecosystems the madingley model harfoot et al 2014 adopts a different approach linking fluxes of biomasses between above ground autotrophs and heterotrophs by modelling the fundamental processes affecting the ecology of these organisms trophic structures in the modelled ecosystems emerge from the representation of individual and community level biological processes and interactions between organisms and their environment madingley has been shown to reproduce patterns and functional processes in animal populations and has been used to model terrestrial and marine ecosystems harfoot et al 2014 enquist et al 2020 and to analyse complex food chains hoeks et al 2020 at present the vegetation which drives herbivory is modelled by an empirical carbon cycling model smith et al 2013 in which primary production is determined by the miami model lieth 1975 however the miami model does not capture important dynamics such as interannual variability and trends in vegetation composition and productivity introduced by weather climate change carbon nitrogen interactions and changes in atmospheric co2 which modern dynamic vegetation models do this limits madingleys applicability to explore future global environmental change impacts on ecosystem functional diversity here we couple madingley to the advanced dynamic global vegetation model dgvm lpj guess to test how more complex vegetation dynamics affects characteristics of simulated animal populations the work presented here is the first step towards creating a fully coupled multi trophic model of functional diversity which combines the advantages of complex process based vegetation and animal modelling allowing comprehensive assessment of animal vegetation feedbacks in ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 the madingley model madingley represents herbivores omnivores and carnivores of all size classes from very large to very small the heterotrophs are organised into functional groups according to a set of categorical functional traits related to feeding modes metabolic pathways reproduction and movement the model is defined at the level of individual organisms to avoid impractical computational requirements within each functional group individuals are grouped together into cohorts in which all individuals possess the same set of categorical traits plus identical continuous traits defining their juvenile adult and current body mass and age these continuous traits vary across cohorts which share a functional group cohorts of individuals undergo a set of ecological processes metabolism predation feeding reproduction and mortality harfoot et al 2014 dividing the model domain into distinct grid cells makes it possible for cohorts to disperse between those grid cells the lowest levels of the heterotrophic pyramid the herbivores are feeding upon evergreen and deciduous leaf biomass stocks simulated by the carbon cycle model of smith et al 2013 while the deciduous stock is showing seasonal availability herbivores assimilate relatively more biomass when compared to the same amount of evergreen leaf biomass being consumed evergreen and deciduous stock therefore represent a trade off between food availability and food quality at higher trophic levels carnivores prey upon other animal cohorts with a prey size preference omnivores feed from the leaf biomass stocks and heterotroph cohorts alike but are less effective doing so due to a lower assimilation rate for both herbivory and carnivory these feeding processes are limited to the stocks and cohorts of the respective grid cell herbivory is not uniform e g different types of herbivores access different amounts and types of leaf biomass in an ecosystem processes that are currently not yet captured in madingley as a conservative assumption implemented in madingley as ϕ h e r b f 0 1 table 6 in harfoot et al 2014 the total biomass consumed is thus limited to 10 of the gridcells leaf biomass stock the growth of individuals is handled as the difference between their nutrition uptake and metabolic cost once an individual reaches its maturity it starts accumulating its nutrition uptake towards reproduction for this study we adopted and modified the latest version of the model described by hoeks et al 2020 so far the leaf biomass stocks which apply a bottom up control on the simulated trophic pyramid are modelled by the carbon cycle model of smith et al 2013 which includes the miami model by lieth 1975 the miami model predicts the total annual net primary production npp based on the yearly mean temperature and total precipitation sum in the following way 1 n p p t p m i n 0 916645 1 e x p 0 23747 0 006 t 0 916645 1 e x p 0 00118 p in madingley the annual simulated npp is converted to wet matter which animals consume via an estimate of 9 813 gwetmatter gc kattge et al 2011 the annual values are then split into monthly fractions using a seasonality factor leaf mortality and carbon partitioning to leaves is also parameterised through temperature related factors the resulting monthly wet matter leaf increment is divided between evergreen and deciduous vegetation according to the fraction of the year prone to frost in the specific grid cell 2 2 forcing madingley with lpj guess vegetation data lpj guess is a biogeochemical dynamic global vegetation model that combines the advantages of a global macroscopic nutrient cycle and carbon assimilation model with the advantages of an individual based growth model smith et al 2014 wårlind et al 2014 plant individuals are represented by age cohorts which share key ecological properties and traits categorising them into plant functional types pfts distinguished by their bioclimatic preferences photosynthesis pathways and growth strategies plant cohorts compete for nitrogen light water and space annual processes like biomass allocation leaf root and sapwood turnover disturbances or mortality are simulated at the beginning of a year short term processes like soil hydrology stomata regulation photosynthesis plant respiration decomposition and phenology are simulated on a daily basis the overall accuracy of the modelled processes and interactions has been evaluated extensively hickler et al 2006 wramneby et al 2008 lindeskog et al 2021 smith et al 2014 and has shown lpj guesss skills in capturing large scale vegetation patterns and vegetation dynamics lpj guesss physiological vegetation process representation goes far beyond madingleys current approach to estimate the biomass of deciduous and evergreen leave lpj guess requires multiple years of climate data to ensure sufficient variability for computing the models stochastics interannual disturbances and for the model spin up for our purposes here we chose to cycle the crujra v2 1 climatology harris 2020 based on the years 1950 to 1979 this approach allows us to compare vegetation simulated with lpj guess and miami since miami was parameterised based on empirical data available during the 1960s we cycled atmospheric co2 concentrations ranging from 311 to 335 ppm during the lpj guess simulations since the crujra dataset has a 6 h resolution we used daily postprocessing methods supplementary information s1 lpj guess simulates 12 woody and 2 grassy plant functional types which were converted based on their phenology into the evergreen and deciduous leaf biomass stocks that are available for herbivory in madingley table 1 since lpj guess is running on a daily timestep we account leaf biomass from all pft cohorts during every timestep and produce a monthly average of the total evergreen and deciduous leaf biomass per grid cell we then pass this information to madingley using a file transfer method and replace madingleys parameterised autotroph stocks during every timestep fig 1 shows a simplified technical blueprint to illustrate how we realised the coupling of the two models the latest version of madingley hoeks et al 2020 cycles a single year of environmental input data throughout the simulation climate does not only affect the vegetation but also the animals metabolism due to its ecto and endothermic thermoregulation method to ensure that the animals in madingley are exposed to the same climate used for the vegetation prediction in lpj guess we expanded the length of madingleys environmental forcing from the single year cycle to a 30 year time series we used the same crujra v2 1 climate data but due to madingleys monthly timestep we needed to process the data monthly supplementary information s1 both model setups represent a solid and stable version of the model the computational time necessary to carry out a single simulation did not change noticeably when coupling madingley with lpj guess the additional time needed to precompile the lpj guess is small in comparison to the average madingley runtime thus we did not increase the computational cost for a single run significantly however the madingley simulations with the c version are quite time and memory consuming so we decided to carry out smaller scale simulations at different locations instead of a continental or global run other recent studies with madingley followed a similar approach newbold et al 2020 or used a coarser grid for their simulations hoeks et al 2020 2 3 madingley simulation setup we compared madingley output simulated with its standard miami based vegetation with simulations in which at the beginning of each timestep the leaf biomass was replaced by the modelled leaf biomass from lpj guess summed up for deciduous and evergreen pfts four experiments are presented here to test how lpj guess vs miami vegetation affects model stability community structures and individual traits to investigate how ecosystem productivity and climatic conditions affect the coupling responses we performed simulations for four locations representing three different types of forest ecosystems and one savanna ecosystem table 2 each location was resolved by a grid of three by three cells spanning a 1 5 latitude by 1 5 longitude model domain with a resolution of 0 5 in each direction both madingley and lpj guess run on a 0 5 resolution so we did not need to up or downscale any of the exchanged data in all four studies we compared both setups madingley miami model m m and madingley lpj guess m lpjg and check what effects our coupling implies on the model system all simulations include the same animal functional group definitions these groups are distinguished by their feeding mode their reproductive strategy and their thermoregulation strategy table 3 each grid cell was initialised with 100 cohorts of each functional group with initial body masses that are drawn randomly from the cohorts juvenile and adult body mass during a simulation cohorts die out or are newly created in response to predation mortality and reproduction the total number of cohorts that are allowed to coexist in one grid cell is limited to 1000 for all experiments we carried out runs at each of the four locations from table 2 all the data extracted from the model were collected at the end of each timestep and thus represent the state of the ecosystem after all ecological processes have been executed this is true for all animal functional groups and autotroph stocks alike in the first experiment we ran an ensemble of ten long term simulations to investigate the development of leaf biomass and heterotrophic functional group dynamics each simulation covered 1000 years of simulation time the objective here was to test whether madingleys model dynamics reaches equilibrium conditions with lpj guesss as well as with miamis vegetation input when a simulation reaches a state where aggregated biomass densities of both autotroph stocks and heterotroph cohorts are not trending up or downwards anymore we assume the model system has reached its dynamic equilibrium stage for the second experiment we compared the canopy compositions of the simulated vegetation from both lpj guess and the miami model the objective here was to visualise the differences between the two vegetation models since these differences are the key drivers for all coupling related changes understanding them is essential for the interpretation of all other experiments in our third experiment we focussed on how the coupling alters the basic shape of the trophic pyramid and how it affects the animal population on a community level as a whole to do so we investigated the biomass pools of the trophic pyramid and the fluxes between those pools we used an ensemble of ten simulations to capture stochastic variation within the pools shifts in leaf biomass density are likely to affect the size distribution of animals as a result of the bottom up regulation of autotrophs in the trophic pyramid so we also compared the emergent size distribution of cohorts driven by the two vegetation models after investigating the effects of our coupling on the community level our fourth experiment focussed on the effects on an individual level by taking a closer look at power law relationships between individual body mass and growth rate per timestep days needed to reach maturity lifespan and lifetime reproduction successes the simulations for the third and fourth experiments differ in terms of simulation length due to the longer time needed for the uga setup to reach its dynamic equilibrium as found in experiment 1 the uga simulations covered 600 years of simulation time while all other setups covered 250 years of simulation time we extracted detailed information on cohort characteristics during the last year of every simulation a table with all setup descriptions and the most relevant output for each experimental setup can be found in the supporting information s4 to set the effects of our coupling into context we compared both m lpjgs and m ms simulated npp for the four experiment locations since the npp parameterised by the miami model forms the foundation of the m m simulations we wanted to test if the npp simulated by lpj guess is more realistic for the comparison we used npp data derived from the modis 17ashgfv061 dataset running and zhao 2021 as the average npp of the area corresponding to the model domains the modis data layers are derived from the rue radiation use efficiency concept hatfield and dold 2019 and therefore are produced by a model themselves we also compared the results of our simulations with power law relationships cebrian 2004 derived from a huge body of literature on net primary production and herbivore biomass and consumption by primary consumers most authors estimate empirical data for herbivore biomass from a mean herbivore individual weight multiplied by the herbivore abundance which is similar to the total herbivore body mass calculation in madingley empirical data for consumption by primary consumers is commonly recreated based on animal evacuation exclosures enclosures parameterisation of herbivore metabolism reconstruction methods based on bite marks and leaf growth rates studies using these techniques derive their herbivory rate reconstruction by comparing ecosystem states with and without reduced herbivory stress it is worth noting that cebrian 2004 combined herbivore consumption and detritus consumption in one pool as primary consumption while madingley only includes herbivores we derived power laws for the same functional relationships from the last ten years of each simulation since long term measurement data is available for the ger and fin sites we included comparisons between madingley and lpj guess model runs and data from cebrian 2004 rebmann et al 2010 and launiainen et al 2022 in the supplementary information s5 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 long term analysis the left side of fig 2 shows the simulated biomasses resulting from the m m simulations while the right side shows those from m lpjg in m m the simulations reach a state of dynamic equilibrium after about 100 years the time needed for a simulation to reach equilibrium in m lpjg ranges from about 100 years locations fin ger saf to about 500 years uga simulated leaf biomass density in the two vegetation models differs markedly in the m lpjg simulations the amount of evergreen leaf biomass barely changes over the course of a year in contrast to the seasonal oscillation seen in deciduous leaf biomass this is clearly visible for example in the boreal and temperate climate regions with a high seasonality represented by fin and ger m lpjg in the fin ger and saf m m setups both evergreens and deciduous stocks fluctuate strongly over the course of a year while also having a higher amplitude and lower winter minima when compared to m lpjg simulations in both uga m m and uga m lpjg the leaf biomass stocks fluctuate only little leaf biomass stocks in saf m lpjg are more variable than in saf m m in the fin m lpjg simulation simulated carnivores and omnivores show similar biomass densities while omnivore biomass density exceeds carnivore biomass density in fin m m all other simulations show similar hierarchies in heterotroph biomass densities between the m m and m lpjg simulations in all simulations herbivores dominate heterotroph biomass densities 3 2 experiment 2 canopy composition as indicated already in fig 2 significant differences between lpj guess and the miami model emerge from the simulated vegetation composition fig 2 shows simulated autotrophic biomass split into the evergreen and deciduous stocks for the m lpjg and m m setups a more detailed pft composition for each location can be found in the supplementary information s2 in the fin and ger location the miami model simulates large seasonal fluctuations throughout a year for both evergreen and deciduous stocks lpj guesss simulated vegetation stocks are much more stable throughout the year for evergreen leaf biomass and show the expected seasonal fluctuations in deciduous leaf biomass under sub tropical and tropical climate conditions m lpjg simulates substantially less deciduous leaf biomass than m m in saf variability in evergreen leaf biomass is higher in the m lpjg simulations and less regular likely due to fire impact in these fire prone environments while m m is parameterised to burn a fixed percentage of leaf biomass annually depending on climatic conditions m lpjg uses the statistically based fire model simfire blaze which simulates fire frequencies fire intensities fire related fluxes and responses in vegetation launiainen et al 2022 rabin et al 2017 3 3 experiment 3 community level analysis all community level simulations show differences between the m m and m lpjg simulations figs 4 and 5 the average leaf biomass is smaller in fin m lpjg 16 ger m lpjg 5 and saf m lpjg 15 compared to the m m results in uga m lpjg simulates 66 more average leaf biomass than m m the overall herbivore biomass of the m lpjg simulations exceed those of the m m simulations in every location fig 3 most dominantly in uga 170 average carnivore biomass in the m lpjg simulations is greater in fin 93 saf 34 and again most dominantly in uga 542 average omnivore biomass in the m lpjg simulations is decreased in fin 39 and ger 51 and is increased in uga 453 compared to m m in fin and ger all biomass fluxes besides l h h c and c o show similar medians in both m m and m lpjg simulations in saf all fluxes show a slight increase in m lpjg up to 20 in uga all fluxes show a significant increase in m lpjg up to 500 fig 5 in fin ger and saf with the m lpjg coupling the size distribution spectrum shows a tendency towards individuals with a higher abundance and lower biomasses fig 6 in the m lpjg runs at the uga location the high and low end of the body mass spectrum of endotherms shows higher individual numbers when compared to the m m simulations especially ectotherms show larger individual numbers at the lower end of the body mass spectrum under boreal and temperate climate conditions the m lpjg coupling showed the largest increases in the number of endotherm cohorts in contrast at the tropical and sub tropical sites ectotherm cohorts increase more in the runs using m lpjg vegetation fig 6 at all four sites the m lpjg coupling consistently results in larger cohort numbers of carnivore endotherms in fin m m the whole functional group of carnivore endotherms disappear in the first years of the simulation without any reestablishment afterwards herbivore endotherms are concentrated at the higher end of the body mass spectrum in fin m lpjg carnivore endotherms are present throughout the simulation and herbivore endotherms populate a wider range of the body mass spectrum 3 4 experiment 4 individual level analysis the individual level analysis shows general similarities between the m m and m lpjg setups for each location fig 7a growth rates are slightly larger in the m lpjg runs most notable is an increased growth rate of the smallest individuals in saf and uga the lifespan of bigger individuals individuals that have body mass 100 g decreases in the m lpjg simulations for all locations fig 7b consequently the mortality rate for cohorts containing bigger individuals increases this effect is most dominant in uga in fin and saf the time endotherm cohorts need to reach maturity state decreases noticeably in m lpjg fig 7c besides an increased growth rate and a shorter time to reach maturity the shorter lifespan seems to be the dominant effect leading to the cohorts having a reduced lifetime reproduction success rate in all m lpjg simulations fig 7d 3 5 comparison to external sources at all experiment locations m lpjg consistently predicts the npp better than m m when compared to the modis dataset fig 8 the best lpj guess predictions were found in the fin 9 ger 5 and saf 3 setup while the only larger difference was found in uga 17 the m m simulations show a larger gap between miamis predicted npp and the data derived from the modis dataset fin 21 ger 20 saf 45 and uga 25 beyond comparing the vegetation model outputs to the modis v6 1 dataset we also made an assessment of whether the realism of the entire model system output was increased according to cebrian 2004 terrestrial ecosystems npp is related to herbivore biomass and herbivore consumption by the following logarithmic power laws 2 log b i o m a s s 3 43 1 30 log n p p 3 log p r i m a r y c o n s u m p t i o n 0 24 0 82 log n p p we were able to determine similar shaped power law relations from the m lpjg simulations by applying a logarithmic fit for the last ten annual sums of herbivore biomass and consumption we derived the following power law relationships 4 log b i o m a s s 1 75 1 03 log n p p 5 log p r i m a r y c o n s u m p t i o n 1 94 1 55 log n p p these power law relationships are shown in fig 9 notable is the high herbivore biomass and herbivory consumption in saf m lpjg which is the ecosystem with the lowest simulated productivity since the miami model predicts a smaller range of npp throughout diverse ecosystems when compared to m lpjg all data points for the m m simulations are clustered in a narrow range this renders a logarithmic fit for herbivore biomass and herbivory consumption unreasonable so these are not provided here however it is worth noting that in the m m simulations both herbivore biomass and herbivory consumption consistently show lower values in ecosystems with slightly higher npp providing weak support for an inverse relationship in that model 4 discussion the large differences between m m and m lpjg simulations show a complex interconnectivity of coupling related effects throughout the experiments to analyse their validity we first want to explain the observed changes and the underlying processes secondly we want to discuss the differences to the modis dataset and the power laws derived by cebrian 2004 4 1 development of the animal population the model reaches a dynamic steady state in all m lpjg and m m setups the longer time needed for the uga m lpjg simulation is most likely caused by the much larger amount of edible leaf biomass simulated for this location in lpj guess compared with miami cohorts of heterotrophs were initialised in the same way for all four locations their subsequent growth is therefore not only limited by food availability but also by climatic conditions and predation ugas warm climate lengthen the active time of ectotherms and thus increases their food uptake and metabolic cost therefore uga m lpjgs larger vegetation biomass supply funnels through to the higher trophic levels which increases predation stress for the lower trophic levels these interactions increase the growth limit of the cohorts and thus result in a longer period necessary to reach the model systems dynamic steady state this effect appears to be most visible in enhancing herbivore and carnivore biomasses omnivores also responded to the changes in vegetation stocks but not as much as the other groups possibly because while omnivores have the ability to feed both from plants and other cohorts they do so with a less efficient assimilation strategy in contrast to uga leaf biomass was lower at the other three locations in the m lpjg simulations compared to m m the larger total herbivore biomass in the m lpjg runs was thus unexpected since the reported leaf biomass data represents the stock state after the cohorts feed from it one might argue that the reduced leaf biomass stock simply reflects a larger degree of herbivory however this seemingly simple explanation does not capture the complexity of the underlying processes that affect the development of the emergent animal populations in the following we want to discuss the ecological responses to the coupling related changes in total leaf biomass and varying climate conditions total leaf biomass is the chief alteration to the original madingley model all differences that can be observed between the m m and m lpjg setups originate from shifts in the simulated vegetation in m lpjg more leaf biomass is available as a food source during the cold season compared to m m thus m lpjg supports a larger biomass flux from autotrophs to herbivores over winter the larger total cohort biomasses that correspond to the lower average leaf biomasses but higher minimum leaf biomasses as computed in m lpjg compared to m m indicates that total cohort biomasses are more sensitive to the minimum leaf biomass this is plausible since at least at locations with a temperate or boreal climate the cohorts growth limitations are more likely to be reached during the cold season in fin m lpjg endotherms need significantly less time to reach maturity than in fin m m this indicates that an increased minimum leaf biomass also increases the leaf biomass flux to herbivores on an individual level thus the herbivores assimilate more biomass throughout the m lpjg simulation and reach their adult body mass more quickly a similar effect can be found in saf m lpjg where a higher minimum in the leaf biomass pool results in a higher flux from autotrophic biomass to herbivores this is quite remarkable since the average leaf biomass in saf m lpjg is lower than in saf m m and explains how despite the lower leaf biomass pool the herbivore biomass pool can be higher in m lpjg in three out of four locations m lpjg predicts a lower average annual leaf biomass when compared to m m this seems to shift the size distributions towards smaller individuals most visible in the increased abundance of individuals lighter than 1 g fig 6 this result is consistent with the increased number of cohorts going extinct in the m lpjg simulations and their lower lifespans which in turn reflects increased predation stress on the smaller individuals the larger total annual leaf biomass supports cohorts of heavier individual body mass in the m m simulations while this observation is consistent with the megafauna theory evans et al 2012 the default madingley version nonetheless overestimates the size of large herbivores by four to six times compared to field studies harfoot et al 2014 it was also observed that the smaller the gap between the predicted m m and the m lpjg vegetation the higher the herbivore biomass in the m lpjg run compare ger m lpjg and saf m lpjg this indicates that a uniform increase in vegetation biomass without changing its evergreen deciduous composition still enhances herbivore biomass climatic conditions under colder conditions animals are less active and thus have less time to fulfil their metabolic cost harfoot et al 2014 while ectotherms become inactive below a certain temperature threshold endotherms constantly need to be active under tropical and boreal conditions alike climatic conditions thus contribute to the cohorts stress by enhancing the effect of calorific shortages fig 6 shows that the coupling leads to an increase in ectotherm herbivore abundance under warm climate uga and saf in these locations the smallest individuals which are typically ectotherm herbivores show overall higher growth rates in m lpjg compared to m m fig 7b shows this effect also on an individual level in m m the smallest individuals which are typically ectotherms are showing a wide pattern of growth rates in similar weight classes this is an indicator that most individuals are not reaching their maximum potential growth rate therefore the amount of leaf biomass seems to be the limiting factor in contrast in m lpjg the smallest individuals all have similar growth rates under similar climatic conditions this again indicates that the higher leaf biomass no longer limits the growth rate under colder climate conditions fin and ger the ectotherm herbivore abundance did not show significant changes due to the coupling in these locations the growth rates of similar individuals are not enhanced by lpj guess vegetation input significantly we expect the climatic conditions to be the limiting factors in both m m and m lpjg simulations these two examples have shown that climatic conditions can weaken or enhance the effect of changes in leaf biomass as the most noticeable example we want to highlight the extinction of carnivore endotherms in fin m m simulations during the first few timesteps the endotherm herbivore population grows faster in fin m lpjg as a result of a higher minimum in leaf biomass during the cold season than in fin m m this keeps the total biomass of herbivores in fin m lpjg large enough to feed endotherm carnivores in contrast to the fin m m simulations the reduced growth of endotherm herbivores in fin m m leads to the total herbivore biomass being too low to support a carnivore endotherm population as a result endothermic carnivores in fin m m go extinct during the first few timesteps since there are no mechanisms that would allow these extinct functional group to enter the simulation besides the initialisation they stay extinct for the rest of the simulation after the first decades the established herbivore population grows without the top down control of predation and thus their body mass size distribution shows fewer heavier individuals than in the fin m lpjg simulation this effect of the absence of large carnivores in madingley leading to the non regulated growth of the lower trophic levels is consistent with observations elmhagen et al 2010 brose et al 2019 and highlights the importance of representing all trophic levels in a simulation overall the individual level characteristics only show minor differences when comparing the m lpjg simulations to the m m simulations but at the same time we observe huge variations in the traits on a community level this leads us to the conclusion that relatively small changes in individual processes can lead to substantial changes in the dynamics of a whole animal community minor differences on the individual level also indicate that madingley still successfully predicts ecological processes for individuals and thus still produces reasonable assumptions for animal communities 4 2 comparison to external sources m lpjg consistently predicts npp that is closer to empirical observations than the npp predicted by m m madingleys chosen npp parameterisation miami does not seem to fit well for temperature or precipitation extremes very hot very arid or very wet in arid ecosystems such as saf m lpjg also includes wildfires in its simulations while the miami model predicts a lower npp than lpj guess in fin and ger we see higher leaf biomass stocks in m m rather than in m lpjg this is caused by madingley assuming that 64 fin and 68 ger of the monthly available npp is allocated towards leaves see also supplementary information s3 lpj guess is typically accounting about 30 of the allocation towards leaves de kauwe et al 2014 the simulation derived power law for herbivore biomass to npp is more consistent with empirical relationships in the m lpjg setup still while the power laws slope is similar the magnitude of the simulated herbivore biomass is higher than seen in the empirical data from cebrian 2004 there is an ongoing discussion in the scientific community about whether a higher biomass density of herbivores increases the ecosystems productivity through accelerating nutrient cycles enquist et al 2020 significantly reduces plant biomass through damaging individuals jia et al 2018 or shifts ecosystems plant species distributions schmitz et al 2014 the strength of these effects likely are highly site and ecosystem specific we aim to include the effects described by the scientific community in our future model development such as implementing c n stoichiometry in madingley implementing a feedback loop from madingley to lpj guess affecting leaf area and photosynthesis and installing a litter pool in madingley to track animal faeces such additional model development will allow to explore further which process underpins the overestimation of herbivore biomass in fig 9 still the madingley model can for the first time predict similar kinds of power laws as observable in nature which is a major improvement of the model and lays the foundation for future model developments in saf m lpjg both herbivore biomass and herbivory consumption are overestimated when compared to the power law relationships we expect this to result from every cohort having access to 10 of the leaf biomass stock in madingley while this value may be accurate for large insect swarms we find it unlikely for a herd of mammals to access 10 of the leaf biomass in an area of 2 500 km2 one grid cell in saf over the course of one month while the cohorts are limited by the accessible leaf biomass they do not necessarily consume all of it but only try to fulfil their metabolic cost in saf herbivores consume a higher portion of the standing stock due to the ecosystems lower productivity interpretation of previous madingley publications we have shown that madingleys build in npp parameterisation by the miami is only predicting realistic npp in one out of the four simulated locations even in european temperate forest npp is underestimated by 30 in ecosystems with extremely low or high productivity it is very likely that miami has made a completely unrealistic npp prediction we have also shown that not only the average npp but also the miamis high yearly fluctuations of both evergreen and deciduous stocks more specifically the vegetation stocks winter minima and the length of the growing season are very likely to affect the development of animal populations in conclusion we expect that previous publications have underestimated the abundance and growth rates of ectothermic animals in high or low productivity ecosystems while also overestimating the cohorts lifespan and reproduction cycles in all terrestrial ecosystems 4 3 limitations and future priorities while we explicitly chose the four experiment locations to represent ecosystems under different climatic conditions it remains to be tested how m lpjgs leaf biomass simulation compares globally to that of m m and whether this will align herbivore biomass better with observations we assume that the improved modelling of the vegetation by lpj guess and thus shifts to more realistic canopy compositions enhance the realism of the ecological processes in madingley the next step will be the full coupling of both models and thus reduce the leaf mass from the individuals in lpj guess according to the herbivory activity in madingley during this process we also want to make the leaf biomass accessible to the herbivores based on their traits instead of giving every cohort access to 10 of the stocks we expect this to also improve the representation of low productivity ecosystems in out model system in addition to the full coupling we aim to implement a litter pool in madingley and track animal faeces which are currently escaping the model environment there is an ongoing effort to include nitrogen in madingley and to include this compartment of the code in the fully coupled version this would enable further investigations if the model system can track an accelerated nutrient cycle and thus an enhanced ecosystem productivity another plan we are pursuing is the implementation of different herbivory types like grazing and browsing a new version of madingley is also being developed which would enable ground vs canopy feeding 4 4 conclusion the upcoming un decade of restoration undoubtedly imposes huge challenges upon decision makers and emphasises the urgent need of understanding processes and interconnectivity in ecosystems a large focus lies on nature based solutions and the increased interest in protecting animal population and biodiversity european commission 2020 modelling is a strong tool for making assessments on ecosystem functioning and interconnectivity of living organisms with this study we show that coupling the madingley model with the process based dynamic global vegetation model lpj guess is improving the realism of madingleys modelled animal populations on multiple levels simulated animal cohorts were facing a wider range of net primary production and realistic fluctuations in seasonal vegetation biomass and composition these changes lead to significant differences when compared to madingleys default version such as the persistence of whole ecological groups which otherwise go extinct we found general shifts in the animal populations towards smaller but more abundant individuals and demonstrated that our model system is consistently portraying and preserving all ecological groups which is a major improvement at the same time the model still presents the underlying ecological processes which is the foundation of the simulation of functional diversity this ensures that that changes in the model output correspond to changes in the models boundary conditions and are in fact not based on statistical disruptions in the food chain or numeric instabilities ultimately we conclude that our implementations were in fact improving the realism of the model systems prediction by comparing our results to empirical data madingley is a powerful tool in assessing an ecosystems functioning by modelling its whole trophic pyramid and we are keen to implement further processes and feedbacks in our model system in the future with further development out model system will help making informed decisions on ecosystem management in regards of animal biodiversity and overall ecosystem functioning 4 5 code availability the lpj guess model code is managed and maintained by the department of

24398,animal biodiversity and its key roles in ecosystem state and functioning is facing critical challenges in the wake of anthropogenic activities it is urgently necessary to improve understanding of the interconnections between animals and the vegetation within ecosystems process based modelling has shown to be a mighty tool in making assessments on ecological processes we assess the effect of different vegetation models on simulated animal biodiversity by replacing the vegetation module within madingley a multi trophic model of functional diversity with lpj guess a dynamic global vegetation model we compare the output metrics of the model system to madingley s default version for four ecosystem types around the globe and analyse whether the realism of the simulation results increased as a result of the coupling between madingley and lpj guess simulated animal populations react to the coupling by shifting towards smaller individuals with a higher abundance general shifts in body mass and animal distributions can be traced back to ecological processes allowing in depth analysis of heterotrophic responses to changes in leaf biomass we also derive power law relationships for herbivory to npp and herbivore biomass to npp and conclude that the coupled model system simulates animal populations that follow reasonable power laws which are similar to power laws derived from empirical data our results indicate that developing process based model systems is a viable way to assess multi trophic interconnections between animal populations and the ecosystems vegetation keywords modelling animal populations in terrestrial ecosystem advances refinement in methods for ecological modelling data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction animals can play a key role in controlling the state and function of all terrestrial ecosystems schmitz et al 2014 2018 by consuming autotrophic biomass herbivory enhances light transfer into plant canopies and affects net carbon assimilation cascading trophic effects triggered by top predators or the largest herbivores propagate through food webs regulating levels of herbivory and affecting soil carbon and nitrogen cycling through excreta and dead bodies schmitz et al 2014 however anthropogenic activities such as habitat modification harvesting and increasingly anthropogenic climate change are driving large declines in biodiversity cardinale et al 2012 pacifici et al 2015 arneth et al 2020 therefore a better understanding of how changes and losses of plant and animal functional diversity will affect ecosystem functioning is needed from the perspective of both an ecosystems role for both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation however the diverse mixture of species and the interconnectivity in food webs makes quantifying the link between ecosystem biogeochemical cycling and an ecosystems functional diversity a challenge schmitz et al 2018 animals comprise lower total biomass overall compared to plants bar on et al 2018 which could easily result in the assumption that animals play a relatively minor role in terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycling but this view is being challenged by an increasing body of literature for instance for eastern africa holdo et al 2009 extrapolated impacts of strongly reduced wildebeest numbers due to the rinderpest into the future and hypothesised that major future wildebeest die offs might lead to a significant increase in grass biomass leading to changes in fire regimes and a potential shift of ecosystems into a net carbon source hooper et al 2012 suggested that the absence or presence of herbivores and carnivores within an ecosystem can lead to similar magnitude impacts as caused by other environmental change drivers such as global warming enhanced co2 or nitrogen pollution wilmers and schmitz 2016 estimated based on measurements that wolves preying upon moose in northern american boreal forests enhance net primary productivity npp and net ecosystem carbon uptake by up to 30 by decreasing moose co2 respiration and increasing growth of deciduous trees due to releasing herbivory pressure sobral et al 2017 carried out an analysis based on observations in the amazonian region which showed animal diversity influencing the carbon cycle directly via metabolism and indirectly via seed dispersal and altering the vegetations species composition nevertheless so far studies and extrapolations of their results that seek to link animal impacts to ecosystem biogeochemical cycles are typically limited by their temporal or spatial scale holdo et al 2009 staver and bond 2014 sobral et al 2017 or focus on a few distinct animal species schmitz et al 2018 nichols et al 2016 so limiting the general applicability of their conclusion process based models can help to overcome observation limitations and improve our knowledge about the complex interactions within ecosystems by expanding the scope to the whole ecosystem a few model studies have started to explore the role of animals berzaghi et al 2019 included elephant disturbances into an ecosystem demography model and showed that the resulting reduction in tree stem density altered competition for light and water and actually enhanced aboveground biomass pachzelt et al 2015 coupled a physiological grazer population model with a dynamic vegetation model and identified npp and the length of the dry season as the main determinants of grazer population size in african savannah ecosystems they found that the presence or absence of grazers substantially impacts the standing grass and tree vegetation biomass as well as the area vulnerable to burning dangal et al 2017 coupled a herbivore population dynamics model with a dynamic land ecosystem model and were able to preproduce observed herbivore populations for livestock species the presence of these herbivores reduced the npp in all nine modelled regions while revealing a vulnerability of herbivores to climate extremes while these studies contribute important information to the understanding of animals roles in ecosystem functioning they also focus on distinct animal species or species classes and neglect complexities such as the top down control predators impose on herbivores and omnivores and thus food webs in ecosystems the madingley model harfoot et al 2014 adopts a different approach linking fluxes of biomasses between above ground autotrophs and heterotrophs by modelling the fundamental processes affecting the ecology of these organisms trophic structures in the modelled ecosystems emerge from the representation of individual and community level biological processes and interactions between organisms and their environment madingley has been shown to reproduce patterns and functional processes in animal populations and has been used to model terrestrial and marine ecosystems harfoot et al 2014 enquist et al 2020 and to analyse complex food chains hoeks et al 2020 at present the vegetation which drives herbivory is modelled by an empirical carbon cycling model smith et al 2013 in which primary production is determined by the miami model lieth 1975 however the miami model does not capture important dynamics such as interannual variability and trends in vegetation composition and productivity introduced by weather climate change carbon nitrogen interactions and changes in atmospheric co2 which modern dynamic vegetation models do this limits madingleys applicability to explore future global environmental change impacts on ecosystem functional diversity here we couple madingley to the advanced dynamic global vegetation model dgvm lpj guess to test how more complex vegetation dynamics affects characteristics of simulated animal populations the work presented here is the first step towards creating a fully coupled multi trophic model of functional diversity which combines the advantages of complex process based vegetation and animal modelling allowing comprehensive assessment of animal vegetation feedbacks in ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 the madingley model madingley represents herbivores omnivores and carnivores of all size classes from very large to very small the heterotrophs are organised into functional groups according to a set of categorical functional traits related to feeding modes metabolic pathways reproduction and movement the model is defined at the level of individual organisms to avoid impractical computational requirements within each functional group individuals are grouped together into cohorts in which all individuals possess the same set of categorical traits plus identical continuous traits defining their juvenile adult and current body mass and age these continuous traits vary across cohorts which share a functional group cohorts of individuals undergo a set of ecological processes metabolism predation feeding reproduction and mortality harfoot et al 2014 dividing the model domain into distinct grid cells makes it possible for cohorts to disperse between those grid cells the lowest levels of the heterotrophic pyramid the herbivores are feeding upon evergreen and deciduous leaf biomass stocks simulated by the carbon cycle model of smith et al 2013 while the deciduous stock is showing seasonal availability herbivores assimilate relatively more biomass when compared to the same amount of evergreen leaf biomass being consumed evergreen and deciduous stock therefore represent a trade off between food availability and food quality at higher trophic levels carnivores prey upon other animal cohorts with a prey size preference omnivores feed from the leaf biomass stocks and heterotroph cohorts alike but are less effective doing so due to a lower assimilation rate for both herbivory and carnivory these feeding processes are limited to the stocks and cohorts of the respective grid cell herbivory is not uniform e g different types of herbivores access different amounts and types of leaf biomass in an ecosystem processes that are currently not yet captured in madingley as a conservative assumption implemented in madingley as ϕ h e r b f 0 1 table 6 in harfoot et al 2014 the total biomass consumed is thus limited to 10 of the gridcells leaf biomass stock the growth of individuals is handled as the difference between their nutrition uptake and metabolic cost once an individual reaches its maturity it starts accumulating its nutrition uptake towards reproduction for this study we adopted and modified the latest version of the model described by hoeks et al 2020 so far the leaf biomass stocks which apply a bottom up control on the simulated trophic pyramid are modelled by the carbon cycle model of smith et al 2013 which includes the miami model by lieth 1975 the miami model predicts the total annual net primary production npp based on the yearly mean temperature and total precipitation sum in the following way 1 n p p t p m i n 0 916645 1 e x p 0 23747 0 006 t 0 916645 1 e x p 0 00118 p in madingley the annual simulated npp is converted to wet matter which animals consume via an estimate of 9 813 gwetmatter gc kattge et al 2011 the annual values are then split into monthly fractions using a seasonality factor leaf mortality and carbon partitioning to leaves is also parameterised through temperature related factors the resulting monthly wet matter leaf increment is divided between evergreen and deciduous vegetation according to the fraction of the year prone to frost in the specific grid cell 2 2 forcing madingley with lpj guess vegetation data lpj guess is a biogeochemical dynamic global vegetation model that combines the advantages of a global macroscopic nutrient cycle and carbon assimilation model with the advantages of an individual based growth model smith et al 2014 wårlind et al 2014 plant individuals are represented by age cohorts which share key ecological properties and traits categorising them into plant functional types pfts distinguished by their bioclimatic preferences photosynthesis pathways and growth strategies plant cohorts compete for nitrogen light water and space annual processes like biomass allocation leaf root and sapwood turnover disturbances or mortality are simulated at the beginning of a year short term processes like soil hydrology stomata regulation photosynthesis plant respiration decomposition and phenology are simulated on a daily basis the overall accuracy of the modelled processes and interactions has been evaluated extensively hickler et al 2006 wramneby et al 2008 lindeskog et al 2021 smith et al 2014 and has shown lpj guesss skills in capturing large scale vegetation patterns and vegetation dynamics lpj guesss physiological vegetation process representation goes far beyond madingleys current approach to estimate the biomass of deciduous and evergreen leave lpj guess requires multiple years of climate data to ensure sufficient variability for computing the models stochastics interannual disturbances and for the model spin up for our purposes here we chose to cycle the crujra v2 1 climatology harris 2020 based on the years 1950 to 1979 this approach allows us to compare vegetation simulated with lpj guess and miami since miami was parameterised based on empirical data available during the 1960s we cycled atmospheric co2 concentrations ranging from 311 to 335 ppm during the lpj guess simulations since the crujra dataset has a 6 h resolution we used daily postprocessing methods supplementary information s1 lpj guess simulates 12 woody and 2 grassy plant functional types which were converted based on their phenology into the evergreen and deciduous leaf biomass stocks that are available for herbivory in madingley table 1 since lpj guess is running on a daily timestep we account leaf biomass from all pft cohorts during every timestep and produce a monthly average of the total evergreen and deciduous leaf biomass per grid cell we then pass this information to madingley using a file transfer method and replace madingleys parameterised autotroph stocks during every timestep fig 1 shows a simplified technical blueprint to illustrate how we realised the coupling of the two models the latest version of madingley hoeks et al 2020 cycles a single year of environmental input data throughout the simulation climate does not only affect the vegetation but also the animals metabolism due to its ecto and endothermic thermoregulation method to ensure that the animals in madingley are exposed to the same climate used for the vegetation prediction in lpj guess we expanded the length of madingleys environmental forcing from the single year cycle to a 30 year time series we used the same crujra v2 1 climate data but due to madingleys monthly timestep we needed to process the data monthly supplementary information s1 both model setups represent a solid and stable version of the model the computational time necessary to carry out a single simulation did not change noticeably when coupling madingley with lpj guess the additional time needed to precompile the lpj guess is small in comparison to the average madingley runtime thus we did not increase the computational cost for a single run significantly however the madingley simulations with the c version are quite time and memory consuming so we decided to carry out smaller scale simulations at different locations instead of a continental or global run other recent studies with madingley followed a similar approach newbold et al 2020 or used a coarser grid for their simulations hoeks et al 2020 2 3 madingley simulation setup we compared madingley output simulated with its standard miami based vegetation with simulations in which at the beginning of each timestep the leaf biomass was replaced by the modelled leaf biomass from lpj guess summed up for deciduous and evergreen pfts four experiments are presented here to test how lpj guess vs miami vegetation affects model stability community structures and individual traits to investigate how ecosystem productivity and climatic conditions affect the coupling responses we performed simulations for four locations representing three different types of forest ecosystems and one savanna ecosystem table 2 each location was resolved by a grid of three by three cells spanning a 1 5 latitude by 1 5 longitude model domain with a resolution of 0 5 in each direction both madingley and lpj guess run on a 0 5 resolution so we did not need to up or downscale any of the exchanged data in all four studies we compared both setups madingley miami model m m and madingley lpj guess m lpjg and check what effects our coupling implies on the model system all simulations include the same animal functional group definitions these groups are distinguished by their feeding mode their reproductive strategy and their thermoregulation strategy table 3 each grid cell was initialised with 100 cohorts of each functional group with initial body masses that are drawn randomly from the cohorts juvenile and adult body mass during a simulation cohorts die out or are newly created in response to predation mortality and reproduction the total number of cohorts that are allowed to coexist in one grid cell is limited to 1000 for all experiments we carried out runs at each of the four locations from table 2 all the data extracted from the model were collected at the end of each timestep and thus represent the state of the ecosystem after all ecological processes have been executed this is true for all animal functional groups and autotroph stocks alike in the first experiment we ran an ensemble of ten long term simulations to investigate the development of leaf biomass and heterotrophic functional group dynamics each simulation covered 1000 years of simulation time the objective here was to test whether madingleys model dynamics reaches equilibrium conditions with lpj guesss as well as with miamis vegetation input when a simulation reaches a state where aggregated biomass densities of both autotroph stocks and heterotroph cohorts are not trending up or downwards anymore we assume the model system has reached its dynamic equilibrium stage for the second experiment we compared the canopy compositions of the simulated vegetation from both lpj guess and the miami model the objective here was to visualise the differences between the two vegetation models since these differences are the key drivers for all coupling related changes understanding them is essential for the interpretation of all other experiments in our third experiment we focussed on how the coupling alters the basic shape of the trophic pyramid and how it affects the animal population on a community level as a whole to do so we investigated the biomass pools of the trophic pyramid and the fluxes between those pools we used an ensemble of ten simulations to capture stochastic variation within the pools shifts in leaf biomass density are likely to affect the size distribution of animals as a result of the bottom up regulation of autotrophs in the trophic pyramid so we also compared the emergent size distribution of cohorts driven by the two vegetation models after investigating the effects of our coupling on the community level our fourth experiment focussed on the effects on an individual level by taking a closer look at power law relationships between individual body mass and growth rate per timestep days needed to reach maturity lifespan and lifetime reproduction successes the simulations for the third and fourth experiments differ in terms of simulation length due to the longer time needed for the uga setup to reach its dynamic equilibrium as found in experiment 1 the uga simulations covered 600 years of simulation time while all other setups covered 250 years of simulation time we extracted detailed information on cohort characteristics during the last year of every simulation a table with all setup descriptions and the most relevant output for each experimental setup can be found in the supporting information s4 to set the effects of our coupling into context we compared both m lpjgs and m ms simulated npp for the four experiment locations since the npp parameterised by the miami model forms the foundation of the m m simulations we wanted to test if the npp simulated by lpj guess is more realistic for the comparison we used npp data derived from the modis 17ashgfv061 dataset running and zhao 2021 as the average npp of the area corresponding to the model domains the modis data layers are derived from the rue radiation use efficiency concept hatfield and dold 2019 and therefore are produced by a model themselves we also compared the results of our simulations with power law relationships cebrian 2004 derived from a huge body of literature on net primary production and herbivore biomass and consumption by primary consumers most authors estimate empirical data for herbivore biomass from a mean herbivore individual weight multiplied by the herbivore abundance which is similar to the total herbivore body mass calculation in madingley empirical data for consumption by primary consumers is commonly recreated based on animal evacuation exclosures enclosures parameterisation of herbivore metabolism reconstruction methods based on bite marks and leaf growth rates studies using these techniques derive their herbivory rate reconstruction by comparing ecosystem states with and without reduced herbivory stress it is worth noting that cebrian 2004 combined herbivore consumption and detritus consumption in one pool as primary consumption while madingley only includes herbivores we derived power laws for the same functional relationships from the last ten years of each simulation since long term measurement data is available for the ger and fin sites we included comparisons between madingley and lpj guess model runs and data from cebrian 2004 rebmann et al 2010 and launiainen et al 2022 in the supplementary information s5 3 results 3 1 experiment 1 long term analysis the left side of fig 2 shows the simulated biomasses resulting from the m m simulations while the right side shows those from m lpjg in m m the simulations reach a state of dynamic equilibrium after about 100 years the time needed for a simulation to reach equilibrium in m lpjg ranges from about 100 years locations fin ger saf to about 500 years uga simulated leaf biomass density in the two vegetation models differs markedly in the m lpjg simulations the amount of evergreen leaf biomass barely changes over the course of a year in contrast to the seasonal oscillation seen in deciduous leaf biomass this is clearly visible for example in the boreal and temperate climate regions with a high seasonality represented by fin and ger m lpjg in the fin ger and saf m m setups both evergreens and deciduous stocks fluctuate strongly over the course of a year while also having a higher amplitude and lower winter minima when compared to m lpjg simulations in both uga m m and uga m lpjg the leaf biomass stocks fluctuate only little leaf biomass stocks in saf m lpjg are more variable than in saf m m in the fin m lpjg simulation simulated carnivores and omnivores show similar biomass densities while omnivore biomass density exceeds carnivore biomass density in fin m m all other simulations show similar hierarchies in heterotroph biomass densities between the m m and m lpjg simulations in all simulations herbivores dominate heterotroph biomass densities 3 2 experiment 2 canopy composition as indicated already in fig 2 significant differences between lpj guess and the miami model emerge from the simulated vegetation composition fig 2 shows simulated autotrophic biomass split into the evergreen and deciduous stocks for the m lpjg and m m setups a more detailed pft composition for each location can be found in the supplementary information s2 in the fin and ger location the miami model simulates large seasonal fluctuations throughout a year for both evergreen and deciduous stocks lpj guesss simulated vegetation stocks are much more stable throughout the year for evergreen leaf biomass and show the expected seasonal fluctuations in deciduous leaf biomass under sub tropical and tropical climate conditions m lpjg simulates substantially less deciduous leaf biomass than m m in saf variability in evergreen leaf biomass is higher in the m lpjg simulations and less regular likely due to fire impact in these fire prone environments while m m is parameterised to burn a fixed percentage of leaf biomass annually depending on climatic conditions m lpjg uses the statistically based fire model simfire blaze which simulates fire frequencies fire intensities fire related fluxes and responses in vegetation launiainen et al 2022 rabin et al 2017 3 3 experiment 3 community level analysis all community level simulations show differences between the m m and m lpjg simulations figs 4 and 5 the average leaf biomass is smaller in fin m lpjg 16 ger m lpjg 5 and saf m lpjg 15 compared to the m m results in uga m lpjg simulates 66 more average leaf biomass than m m the overall herbivore biomass of the m lpjg simulations exceed those of the m m simulations in every location fig 3 most dominantly in uga 170 average carnivore biomass in the m lpjg simulations is greater in fin 93 saf 34 and again most dominantly in uga 542 average omnivore biomass in the m lpjg simulations is decreased in fin 39 and ger 51 and is increased in uga 453 compared to m m in fin and ger all biomass fluxes besides l h h c and c o show similar medians in both m m and m lpjg simulations in saf all fluxes show a slight increase in m lpjg up to 20 in uga all fluxes show a significant increase in m lpjg up to 500 fig 5 in fin ger and saf with the m lpjg coupling the size distribution spectrum shows a tendency towards individuals with a higher abundance and lower biomasses fig 6 in the m lpjg runs at the uga location the high and low end of the body mass spectrum of endotherms shows higher individual numbers when compared to the m m simulations especially ectotherms show larger individual numbers at the lower end of the body mass spectrum under boreal and temperate climate conditions the m lpjg coupling showed the largest increases in the number of endotherm cohorts in contrast at the tropical and sub tropical sites ectotherm cohorts increase more in the runs using m lpjg vegetation fig 6 at all four sites the m lpjg coupling consistently results in larger cohort numbers of carnivore endotherms in fin m m the whole functional group of carnivore endotherms disappear in the first years of the simulation without any reestablishment afterwards herbivore endotherms are concentrated at the higher end of the body mass spectrum in fin m lpjg carnivore endotherms are present throughout the simulation and herbivore endotherms populate a wider range of the body mass spectrum 3 4 experiment 4 individual level analysis the individual level analysis shows general similarities between the m m and m lpjg setups for each location fig 7a growth rates are slightly larger in the m lpjg runs most notable is an increased growth rate of the smallest individuals in saf and uga the lifespan of bigger individuals individuals that have body mass 100 g decreases in the m lpjg simulations for all locations fig 7b consequently the mortality rate for cohorts containing bigger individuals increases this effect is most dominant in uga in fin and saf the time endotherm cohorts need to reach maturity state decreases noticeably in m lpjg fig 7c besides an increased growth rate and a shorter time to reach maturity the shorter lifespan seems to be the dominant effect leading to the cohorts having a reduced lifetime reproduction success rate in all m lpjg simulations fig 7d 3 5 comparison to external sources at all experiment locations m lpjg consistently predicts the npp better than m m when compared to the modis dataset fig 8 the best lpj guess predictions were found in the fin 9 ger 5 and saf 3 setup while the only larger difference was found in uga 17 the m m simulations show a larger gap between miamis predicted npp and the data derived from the modis dataset fin 21 ger 20 saf 45 and uga 25 beyond comparing the vegetation model outputs to the modis v6 1 dataset we also made an assessment of whether the realism of the entire model system output was increased according to cebrian 2004 terrestrial ecosystems npp is related to herbivore biomass and herbivore consumption by the following logarithmic power laws 2 log b i o m a s s 3 43 1 30 log n p p 3 log p r i m a r y c o n s u m p t i o n 0 24 0 82 log n p p we were able to determine similar shaped power law relations from the m lpjg simulations by applying a logarithmic fit for the last ten annual sums of herbivore biomass and consumption we derived the following power law relationships 4 log b i o m a s s 1 75 1 03 log n p p 5 log p r i m a r y c o n s u m p t i o n 1 94 1 55 log n p p these power law relationships are shown in fig 9 notable is the high herbivore biomass and herbivory consumption in saf m lpjg which is the ecosystem with the lowest simulated productivity since the miami model predicts a smaller range of npp throughout diverse ecosystems when compared to m lpjg all data points for the m m simulations are clustered in a narrow range this renders a logarithmic fit for herbivore biomass and herbivory consumption unreasonable so these are not provided here however it is worth noting that in the m m simulations both herbivore biomass and herbivory consumption consistently show lower values in ecosystems with slightly higher npp providing weak support for an inverse relationship in that model 4 discussion the large differences between m m and m lpjg simulations show a complex interconnectivity of coupling related effects throughout the experiments to analyse their validity we first want to explain the observed changes and the underlying processes secondly we want to discuss the differences to the modis dataset and the power laws derived by cebrian 2004 4 1 development of the animal population the model reaches a dynamic steady state in all m lpjg and m m setups the longer time needed for the uga m lpjg simulation is most likely caused by the much larger amount of edible leaf biomass simulated for this location in lpj guess compared with miami cohorts of heterotrophs were initialised in the same way for all four locations their subsequent growth is therefore not only limited by food availability but also by climatic conditions and predation ugas warm climate lengthen the active time of ectotherms and thus increases their food uptake and metabolic cost therefore uga m lpjgs larger vegetation biomass supply funnels through to the higher trophic levels which increases predation stress for the lower trophic levels these interactions increase the growth limit of the cohorts and thus result in a longer period necessary to reach the model systems dynamic steady state this effect appears to be most visible in enhancing herbivore and carnivore biomasses omnivores also responded to the changes in vegetation stocks but not as much as the other groups possibly because while omnivores have the ability to feed both from plants and other cohorts they do so with a less efficient assimilation strategy in contrast to uga leaf biomass was lower at the other three locations in the m lpjg simulations compared to m m the larger total herbivore biomass in the m lpjg runs was thus unexpected since the reported leaf biomass data represents the stock state after the cohorts feed from it one might argue that the reduced leaf biomass stock simply reflects a larger degree of herbivory however this seemingly simple explanation does not capture the complexity of the underlying processes that affect the development of the emergent animal populations in the following we want to discuss the ecological responses to the coupling related changes in total leaf biomass and varying climate conditions total leaf biomass is the chief alteration to the original madingley model all differences that can be observed between the m m and m lpjg setups originate from shifts in the simulated vegetation in m lpjg more leaf biomass is available as a food source during the cold season compared to m m thus m lpjg supports a larger biomass flux from autotrophs to herbivores over winter the larger total cohort biomasses that correspond to the lower average leaf biomasses but higher minimum leaf biomasses as computed in m lpjg compared to m m indicates that total cohort biomasses are more sensitive to the minimum leaf biomass this is plausible since at least at locations with a temperate or boreal climate the cohorts growth limitations are more likely to be reached during the cold season in fin m lpjg endotherms need significantly less time to reach maturity than in fin m m this indicates that an increased minimum leaf biomass also increases the leaf biomass flux to herbivores on an individual level thus the herbivores assimilate more biomass throughout the m lpjg simulation and reach their adult body mass more quickly a similar effect can be found in saf m lpjg where a higher minimum in the leaf biomass pool results in a higher flux from autotrophic biomass to herbivores this is quite remarkable since the average leaf biomass in saf m lpjg is lower than in saf m m and explains how despite the lower leaf biomass pool the herbivore biomass pool can be higher in m lpjg in three out of four locations m lpjg predicts a lower average annual leaf biomass when compared to m m this seems to shift the size distributions towards smaller individuals most visible in the increased abundance of individuals lighter than 1 g fig 6 this result is consistent with the increased number of cohorts going extinct in the m lpjg simulations and their lower lifespans which in turn reflects increased predation stress on the smaller individuals the larger total annual leaf biomass supports cohorts of heavier individual body mass in the m m simulations while this observation is consistent with the megafauna theory evans et al 2012 the default madingley version nonetheless overestimates the size of large herbivores by four to six times compared to field studies harfoot et al 2014 it was also observed that the smaller the gap between the predicted m m and the m lpjg vegetation the higher the herbivore biomass in the m lpjg run compare ger m lpjg and saf m lpjg this indicates that a uniform increase in vegetation biomass without changing its evergreen deciduous composition still enhances herbivore biomass climatic conditions under colder conditions animals are less active and thus have less time to fulfil their metabolic cost harfoot et al 2014 while ectotherms become inactive below a certain temperature threshold endotherms constantly need to be active under tropical and boreal conditions alike climatic conditions thus contribute to the cohorts stress by enhancing the effect of calorific shortages fig 6 shows that the coupling leads to an increase in ectotherm herbivore abundance under warm climate uga and saf in these locations the smallest individuals which are typically ectotherm herbivores show overall higher growth rates in m lpjg compared to m m fig 7b shows this effect also on an individual level in m m the smallest individuals which are typically ectotherms are showing a wide pattern of growth rates in similar weight classes this is an indicator that most individuals are not reaching their maximum potential growth rate therefore the amount of leaf biomass seems to be the limiting factor in contrast in m lpjg the smallest individuals all have similar growth rates under similar climatic conditions this again indicates that the higher leaf biomass no longer limits the growth rate under colder climate conditions fin and ger the ectotherm herbivore abundance did not show significant changes due to the coupling in these locations the growth rates of similar individuals are not enhanced by lpj guess vegetation input significantly we expect the climatic conditions to be the limiting factors in both m m and m lpjg simulations these two examples have shown that climatic conditions can weaken or enhance the effect of changes in leaf biomass as the most noticeable example we want to highlight the extinction of carnivore endotherms in fin m m simulations during the first few timesteps the endotherm herbivore population grows faster in fin m lpjg as a result of a higher minimum in leaf biomass during the cold season than in fin m m this keeps the total biomass of herbivores in fin m lpjg large enough to feed endotherm carnivores in contrast to the fin m m simulations the reduced growth of endotherm herbivores in fin m m leads to the total herbivore biomass being too low to support a carnivore endotherm population as a result endothermic carnivores in fin m m go extinct during the first few timesteps since there are no mechanisms that would allow these extinct functional group to enter the simulation besides the initialisation they stay extinct for the rest of the simulation after the first decades the established herbivore population grows without the top down control of predation and thus their body mass size distribution shows fewer heavier individuals than in the fin m lpjg simulation this effect of the absence of large carnivores in madingley leading to the non regulated growth of the lower trophic levels is consistent with observations elmhagen et al 2010 brose et al 2019 and highlights the importance of representing all trophic levels in a simulation overall the individual level characteristics only show minor differences when comparing the m lpjg simulations to the m m simulations but at the same time we observe huge variations in the traits on a community level this leads us to the conclusion that relatively small changes in individual processes can lead to substantial changes in the dynamics of a whole animal community minor differences on the individual level also indicate that madingley still successfully predicts ecological processes for individuals and thus still produces reasonable assumptions for animal communities 4 2 comparison to external sources m lpjg consistently predicts npp that is closer to empirical observations than the npp predicted by m m madingleys chosen npp parameterisation miami does not seem to fit well for temperature or precipitation extremes very hot very arid or very wet in arid ecosystems such as saf m lpjg also includes wildfires in its simulations while the miami model predicts a lower npp than lpj guess in fin and ger we see higher leaf biomass stocks in m m rather than in m lpjg this is caused by madingley assuming that 64 fin and 68 ger of the monthly available npp is allocated towards leaves see also supplementary information s3 lpj guess is typically accounting about 30 of the allocation towards leaves de kauwe et al 2014 the simulation derived power law for herbivore biomass to npp is more consistent with empirical relationships in the m lpjg setup still while the power laws slope is similar the magnitude of the simulated herbivore biomass is higher than seen in the empirical data from cebrian 2004 there is an ongoing discussion in the scientific community about whether a higher biomass density of herbivores increases the ecosystems productivity through accelerating nutrient cycles enquist et al 2020 significantly reduces plant biomass through damaging individuals jia et al 2018 or shifts ecosystems plant species distributions schmitz et al 2014 the strength of these effects likely are highly site and ecosystem specific we aim to include the effects described by the scientific community in our future model development such as implementing c n stoichiometry in madingley implementing a feedback loop from madingley to lpj guess affecting leaf area and photosynthesis and installing a litter pool in madingley to track animal faeces such additional model development will allow to explore further which process underpins the overestimation of herbivore biomass in fig 9 still the madingley model can for the first time predict similar kinds of power laws as observable in nature which is a major improvement of the model and lays the foundation for future model developments in saf m lpjg both herbivore biomass and herbivory consumption are overestimated when compared to the power law relationships we expect this to result from every cohort having access to 10 of the leaf biomass stock in madingley while this value may be accurate for large insect swarms we find it unlikely for a herd of mammals to access 10 of the leaf biomass in an area of 2 500 km2 one grid cell in saf over the course of one month while the cohorts are limited by the accessible leaf biomass they do not necessarily consume all of it but only try to fulfil their metabolic cost in saf herbivores consume a higher portion of the standing stock due to the ecosystems lower productivity interpretation of previous madingley publications we have shown that madingleys build in npp parameterisation by the miami is only predicting realistic npp in one out of the four simulated locations even in european temperate forest npp is underestimated by 30 in ecosystems with extremely low or high productivity it is very likely that miami has made a completely unrealistic npp prediction we have also shown that not only the average npp but also the miamis high yearly fluctuations of both evergreen and deciduous stocks more specifically the vegetation stocks winter minima and the length of the growing season are very likely to affect the development of animal populations in conclusion we expect that previous publications have underestimated the abundance and growth rates of ectothermic animals in high or low productivity ecosystems while also overestimating the cohorts lifespan and reproduction cycles in all terrestrial ecosystems 4 3 limitations and future priorities while we explicitly chose the four experiment locations to represent ecosystems under different climatic conditions it remains to be tested how m lpjgs leaf biomass simulation compares globally to that of m m and whether this will align herbivore biomass better with observations we assume that the improved modelling of the vegetation by lpj guess and thus shifts to more realistic canopy compositions enhance the realism of the ecological processes in madingley the next step will be the full coupling of both models and thus reduce the leaf mass from the individuals in lpj guess according to the herbivory activity in madingley during this process we also want to make the leaf biomass accessible to the herbivores based on their traits instead of giving every cohort access to 10 of the stocks we expect this to also improve the representation of low productivity ecosystems in out model system in addition to the full coupling we aim to implement a litter pool in madingley and track animal faeces which are currently escaping the model environment there is an ongoing effort to include nitrogen in madingley and to include this compartment of the code in the fully coupled version this would enable further investigations if the model system can track an accelerated nutrient cycle and thus an enhanced ecosystem productivity another plan we are pursuing is the implementation of different herbivory types like grazing and browsing a new version of madingley is also being developed which would enable ground vs canopy feeding 4 4 conclusion the upcoming un decade of restoration undoubtedly imposes huge challenges upon decision makers and emphasises the urgent need of understanding processes and interconnectivity in ecosystems a large focus lies on nature based solutions and the increased interest in protecting animal population and biodiversity european commission 2020 modelling is a strong tool for making assessments on ecosystem functioning and interconnectivity of living organisms with this study we show that coupling the madingley model with the process based dynamic global vegetation model lpj guess is improving the realism of madingleys modelled animal populations on multiple levels simulated animal cohorts were facing a wider range of net primary production and realistic fluctuations in seasonal vegetation biomass and composition these changes lead to significant differences when compared to madingleys default version such as the persistence of whole ecological groups which otherwise go extinct we found general shifts in the animal populations towards smaller but more abundant individuals and demonstrated that our model system is consistently portraying and preserving all ecological groups which is a major improvement at the same time the model still presents the underlying ecological processes which is the foundation of the simulation of functional diversity this ensures that that changes in the model output correspond to changes in the models boundary conditions and are in fact not based on statistical disruptions in the food chain or numeric instabilities ultimately we conclude that our implementations were in fact improving the realism of the model systems prediction by comparing our results to empirical data madingley is a powerful tool in assessing an ecosystems functioning by modelling its whole trophic pyramid and we are keen to implement further processes and feedbacks in our model system in the future with further development out model system will help making informed decisions on ecosystem management in regards of animal biodiversity and overall ecosystem functioning 4 5 code availability the lpj guess model code is managed and maintained by the department of

24399,we present a broad class of semi parametric models for time series of random sums of positive variables our methodology allows the number of terms inside the sum to be time varying and is therefore well suited to many examples encountered in the natural sciences we study the stability properties of the models and provide a valid statistical inference procedure to estimate the model parameters it is shown that the proposed quasi maximum likelihood estimator is consistent and asymptotically gaussian distributed this work is complemented by simulation results and applied to time series representing growth rates of white spruce picea glauca trees from a few dozen sites in québec canada this time series spans 41 years including one major spruce budworm choristoneura fumiferana outbreak between 1968 and 1991 we found significant growth reductions related to budworm induced defoliation up to two years post outbreak our results also revealed the positive effects of maximum summer temperature precipitation and the climate moisture index on white spruce growth we also identified the negative effects of the climate moisture index in the spring and the maximum temperature of the previous summer however the model s performance on this data set was not improved when the interactions between climate and defoliation on growth were considered this study represents a major advance in our understanding of budworm climate tree interactions and provides a useful tool to project the combined effects of climate and insect defoliation on tree growth in a context of greater frequency and severity of outbreaks coupled with the anticipated increases in temperature keywords dendrochronology ecological modelling natural disturbances quasi likelihood estimation semi parametric autoregressive models data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction many ecological studies require measuring the positive dependent variables of random numbers of statistical individuals sampled over time girona et al 2019 this approach is often necessary as 1 researchers cannot observe the entire population and 2 the individuals observed by researchers depend on time varying resources applications of this statistical approach include studies of species behaviour and ecological services in forestry for example we can be interested in time series that represent the mass or size of a given tree species we then randomly sample individual trees each year and observe the corresponding mass or volume e g see vourlitis et al 2022 this approach is also applied to evaluate the area occupied by a species in relation to the available resources over time labrecque foy et al 2020 in fisheries we can use this approach to track temporal changes in the weight of fish caught e g chan et al 2020 in this paper we evaluate the impact of climate change and insect outbreak on tree growth as recorded by growth rings spruce budworm choristoneura fumiferana sbw is the most important defoliator of conifer trees in the eastern north american boreal forest girona et al 2018 in the province of québec canada the forest area affected by this species of lepidoptera over the last century covers more twice the size of the ukraine navarro et al 2018 at the epidemic stage massive populations of larvae cause widespread damage to tree foliage lavoie et al 2019 sbw affects the main conifer boreal species in canada including balsam fir abies balsamea white spruce picea glauca and black spruce picea mariana resulting in a major impact on boreal forest regeneration and dynamics martin et al 2020 moreover sbw outbreaks produce important economic consequences through the loss of forest productivity previous works have studied the changes of forest composition following insect outbreaks e g morin et al 2021 the response of sbw outbreaks to climate change e g fleming and volney 1995 and berguet et al 2021 and demography i e the rate of mortality of spruce during outbreaks gauthier et al 2015 however despite the major implications of future climate change we continue to have a limited understanding of the combined effects of sbw outbreak and climate change on tree growth given that temperature and its variations as well as the timing and amount of precipitation affect organisms survival reproduction cycles and spatial dispersion aber et al 2001 it is critical to understand the links between sbw outbreaks climate and tree growth to improve our understanding of the impacts of future climate change on forest productivity klapwijk et al 2013 this concern is amplified by the expected increase in sbw outbreak severity and frequency under future climate scenarios navarro et al 2018 seidl et al 2017 in this paper we contribute to filling this gap by proposing a broad class of semi parametric models for positive valued time series time series data are common in forestry and the standard statistical approaches include descriptive exploratory techniques and linear mixed effect models with time varying variables on transformed data e g girona et al 2016 and boulanger and arseneault 2004 and correlated error terms girardin et al 2016 however these approaches suffer from several drawbacks descriptive exploratory techniques do not allow the drawing of inferences from the data and linear mixed effect models as shown in several papers e g chou et al 2015 have demonstrated that specifying a linear model on transformed data often leads to a poor predictive performance applying a log transformation for instance can make the positive valued data more normal nonetheless the obtained predicted value underestimates the expected value because of jensen s inequality furthermore models having autocorrelated error terms do not account for the complex dependent structure of tree ring growth to provide a more robust and reliable approach we present a class of semi parametric autoregressive models and use them to investigate the relationships between climate sbw outbreak and the growth of white spruce we also discuss the advantages of applying a repeated measures design many previous studies have focused on modelling non gaussian time series such as positive valued processes gaussian processes can be represented as linear models whereas time series of count or binary data are modelled by non linear dynamics e g sim 1990 weiß 2018 and davis et al 2016 and references therein for positive valued time series data engle and russell 1998 proposed the range volatility model as an alternative to garch models in finance and its use has rapidly expanded because of its diverse applicability we refer the interested reader to the review by chou et al 2015 recently aknouche and francq 2020 considered a positive valued time series whose conditional distribution had a time varying mean dependent on exogenous variables our approach here differs slightly from theirs as the positive process under consideration is itself the sum of a random number of other positive variables our approach is driven strongly by the available data at hand which consist of multiple time series collected from several sites where the number of sampled individuals varies over time and between sites hence considering an aggregate value such as the sum or the mean of growth rings can produce a loss of variability linked to the sampling scheme moreover in fields such as finance some modelling relies on considering empirical quantities such as realized volatility historical returns of investment products within a defined period are then analysed e g allen et al 2010 unlike our framework which is typical for ecological studies all transactions on investment products are recorded i e the entire statistical population is observed our paper is organized as follows in section 2 we define the model used throughout this paper and discuss our modelling choice the time series properties of the models are also assessed in this section we then present the maximum likelihood based inference and its asymptotic properties in section 3 section 4 contains a small simulation study and an application to empirical data related to the growth of white spruce all auxiliary lemmas and mathematical proofs are presented in appendix 2 models and stability results we present a generalized linear dynamic model for the time series of random sums of positive variables this model relies on an empirical application where we analyse the annual growth of spruce trees subject to climate variation and sbw oubreak we measured growth using tree cores collected at 1 30 m height from the trunks of individual trees in a stand girona et al 2017 sample preparation measurement and analysis conformed to standard dendroecological protocols krause and morin 1995 cores were air dried mounted on wood boards and then sanded tree ring width was measured using windendro guay et al 1992 or a manual henson micrometer having an accuracy of 0 01 mm the tree ring series measurements covered the last 41 years and were cross dated using tsap wi rinntech heidelberg germany we denote by y k t t z k 1 k the time series of the total basal area increment related to the k th observational site i e the sum of increases in the trunk cross sectional area for the n k t trees sampled for site k in year t we aim to model the dynamics of this process both in terms of its own past and in the presence of m additional covariates x k t r m in the empirical application presented in section 4 the covariate process encompasses climate variables including temperature and precipitation and the level of sbw related defoliation of the previous years our model is given by 1 y k t l 1 n k t ζ l k t where conditionally on n k t x k t n k t n k t s s 1 and y k t y k t s s 1 the variables ζ l k t 1 l n k t which represent the basal area increments of individual sampled trees are distributed identically as a random variable ζ k t of mean λ k t moreover n k t t z is a sequence of i i d random variables where conditionally on n k t the variable n k t is independent from x k t and y k t the mean process is given by 2 φ δ λ k t η k t ω k j 1 p α j y k t j n k t j β x k t k 1 k and t 1 t such that ω k r α j r β β 1 β m r m and φ δ is a real valued function defined on r that can depend on a parameter δ it is worth mentioning without loss of generality that the covariate process considered at time t is included in the specification of λ k t because multiple lags of a given set of variables can be included by simply stacking them into a vector an example is the case of defoliation levels as shown in our application as growth can be affected by defoliation occurring up to five years before the present from t 5 to t 1 the variables ζ k t will be referred to as the unity random variables we do not make any assumptions about the distribution of the variables ζ k t any distribution on 0 can be chosen examples include the exponential distribution having the parameter 1 λ k t the log normal distribution having parameters log λ k t σ 2 2 and σ and a gamma distribution having the parameters α λ k t and α regardless of the distribution of unity random variables the conditional expectation of y k t is n k t λ k t however under the assumption of the independence of ζ l k t 1 l n k t if they are exponentially distributed the conditional variance is n k t λ k t 2 i e a quadratic function of λ k t in our example of gamma distributed unity random variables conditional variance is n k t λ k t α i e a linear function of λ k t in the case of a log normal distribution however the conditional variance is n k t λ k t 4 exp σ 2 1 with our semi parametric framework we will only focus on the estimation of regression parameters θ δ ω 1 ω k α 1 α p β without the need to perform any distributional goodness of fit tests note 1 copies of unity variables in our general setup the copies ζ l k t 1 l n k t of the unity random variables ζ k t are not required to be independent in practical applications where ζ l k t represents for example the measure of annual growth for a sampled tree the general assumption of being identically distributed can be thought as a local stationary condition inside site k at time t note 2 marginal stationary distributions note from eqs 1 and 2 that y k t f θ k x k t s n k t s ζ ℓ k t s s 0 ℓ 1 for θ k δ ω k α 1 α p β then for 1 k 1 k 2 k the distributions of y k 1 0 n k 1 0 x k 1 0 and y k 2 0 n k 1 0 x k 2 0 are not equal unless ω k 1 ω k 2 and x k 1 0 ζ ℓ k 1 0 ℓ 1 is equal in distribution to x k 2 0 ζ ℓ k 2 0 ℓ 1 in section 4 we will investigate the consequences of the latter conditions on the proposed estimation procedure note 3 regression function 2 note that η k t in 2 does not depend linearly on y k t i i 1 p but on y k t i n k t i i 1 p through 2 we can link the underlying mean process and the empirical estimate of the past mean process even for a constant size process i e n k t n k t because the regression parameter α i i 1 p is free of k we still cannot yet express η k t as a linear combination of y k t i i 1 p moreover one can expect y k t i n k t i λ k t i i 1 p or more generally h y k t i n k t i λ k t i i 1 p for some mapping h such that e h y k t i n k t i λ k t i 0 in 2 at the place of y k t i n k t i i 1 p with the latter two mentioned specifications the model 1 2 defines the glarma model see weiß 2018 for more details in its present form the model 1 2 shares similarities with the well known arch bollerslev 1986 and inarch weiß 2018 models we leave the topic of glarma specification for a future work note 4 contrast with the non linear mixed model the model 1 2 has some similarities to well known mixed models indeed as for mixed models ω k represents the site fixed effect where the random effect is embedded in the distribution of unity variables the simple example of ζ l k t λ k t ϵ l k t where ϵ l k t l 1 is a sequence of identically distributed random variables of mean 1 fit with the class of multiplicative random effect models cameron and trivedi 2013 nonetheless more complex random effects can be handled however the model 1 2 is more general because it allows the individuals sampled over time to change indeed as we will see in section 3 the individual measurements are no longer needed when the sequence y k t n k t is available moreover in terms of the application to resource management it is often of interest to model and predict a population quantity such as the sum of basal area growth in a forest choice of the link function φ the logarithmic link function is often applied and coincides with the well known log linear model see for example cameron and trivedi 2013 for models of count data this link function assumes a linear relationship between the logarithm of the mean process and the covariates however other link functions can preserve the linear correlation at least on the positive part of r consider for example the threshold mapping x max x 0 this mapping is not smooth and most of the time one makes some restrictions on model parameters to obtain the positiveness of the mean directly here we will apply the inverse of the softplus function as a link function indeed the softplus function see glorot et al 2011 is interesting for two reasons first in regard to modelling it preserves the linearity on the positive part of real line as shown by weißet al 2022 for count time series modelling the models defined with the softplus link function are quite close to the truly linear model this is also relevant for our biological application as we expect a linear effect of covariates on growth above a certain threshold representing the minimal favourable conditions for growth the minimum growth expected may not be exactly zero which is why we will later consider a slightly different version of softplus referred to as softplus δ for δ 0 defined as softplus δ x log 1 δ exp x second and also a technical advantage is that the mapping softplus δ is infinitely differentiable fig 1 in the appendix illustrates the difference between the softplus δ link function and max x 0 where softplus represents softplus 0 one can note that softplus δ is lower bounded by log 1 δ it is also worth noting that our generalization of the softplus function differs from that of mei and eisner 2017 and weißet al 2022 eq 3 2 as noted by the latter it is possible to mimic the behaviour of the tobit model with the softplus generalization of mei and eisner 2017 in contrast here we aim to lower bound the softplus link function by a non zero constant because we require a minimum basal area increment at any time note 5 model interpretation obviously with the softplus δ link function the mean process increases with the j th covariate process if β j 0 and decreases when β j 0 because softplus δ x x the mean process can be approximated by identity mapping therefore all other things remaining equal the regression function is similar to β j x j t for large values of x j t and β j 0 and then increases by β j α for increasing values α of x j t let us denote by rg x y the relative rate of growth of the mean process between x and y i e rg δ x y γ δ x γ δ y where γ δ is the derivative function of softplus δ for β 0 lim x rg δ β x α β x e β α therefore the rate towards log 1 δ driven by x j t is given by e β j α when β j 0 moreover when δ 0 by l hôpital s rule lim x rg 0 x y lim x softplus 0 β x α softplus 0 β x e β α therefore all other things remaining equal the mean process will be divided by e β α when x j t increases by α for large values of x j t and β j 0 theorem 1 provides some stability conditions of model 1 2 with the inverse of the softplus function as the link whereas lemma 1 in the appendix represents a general result for φ theorem 1 under the assumptions st 1 and st 2 in the appendix and j 1 p α j 1 there exists a unique set of k stationary ergodic sequences y k t n k t x k t k 1 k that are the solution of eqs 1 and 2 with e η k 0 k 1 k 3 estimation and asymptotic properties this section is devoted to the estimation of the conditional mean parameters by the quasi maximum likelihood estimator qmle based on a member of the exponential family we consider the exponential qmle eqmle because this estimator coincides with the maximum likelihood estimator mle when the unity random variables follow the exponential γ 1 λ k t 1 distribution and the copies ζ l k t 1 l n k t are independent for our application the k time series are observed between the time points 1 and t we provide an asymptotic theory for the estimated parameters and present the results of a small simulation study investigating the finite sample properties of the estimator in the following section we make λ k t dependent on the parameter θ θ a compact set that is log exp λ k t θ 1 δ ω k j 1 p α j y k t j n k t j β x k t η k t θ k 1 k and t 1 t where δ δ 0 let us denote the true data generating parameter value by θ 0 the loss function from the exponential quasi maximum likelihood is given by 3 r t θ k 1 k t 1 t 1 t y k t λ k t θ n k t log λ k t θ k 1 k t 1 t 1 t ℓ k t θ k 1 k ℓ k θ and 4 θ ˆ t argmin θ θ r t θ the derivative of λ k t θ with respect to θ is given by λ k t θ θ λ k t θ 1 1 δ e η k t θ e η k t θ 1 δ e η k t θ ι k y k t 1 n k t 1 y k t p n k t p x k t where ι k is a vector of size k with 1 at the k th position and 0 elsewhere we will denote by λ k t resp λ k t the vector λ k t θ resp λ k t θ evaluated at the point θ θ 0 we will study the asymptotic properties of the qmle estimator 4 to do so we employ taniguchi and kakizawa 2002 thm 3 2 23 which was extended in klimko and nelson 1978 the lemmas in our appendix produce the general result for the asymptotic properties of qmle 4 the following theorem represents the consistency and the asymptotic normality of 4 for the softplus δ link function let us set v k e 1 λ k 0 2 n k 0 y k

located in the interior of θ lim t t θ ˆ t θ 0 n 0 j 1 v j where j k 1 k j k and v k 1 k v k 4 application 4 1 simulation we examined the finite sample performance of the qmle presented in the previous section through a small simulation study we present the results for qmle under two different data generating processes here referred to as scenario 1 and scenario 2 with m 10 covariates first x k t does not depend on k and is a sequence of i i d random variables distributed as exponential random variables with means λ 1 λ m in the second for a fixed k x k t is sampled independently from exponential distributions of mean 0 4 k λ 1 0 4 k λ m for the two data generating processes for a fixed k the process n k t t 1 is independently sampled from a poisson distribution of mean τ k as follows for a fixed k τ 1 τ k are independent and distributed as an exponential random variable of mean k moreover we take p 1 and δ 0 5 β 0 1 1 0 5 0 5 1 5 1 5 2 2 0 α 1 0 6 and ω 1 ω k independently and uniformly sampling in the range 0 5 k 0 5 k for a fixed k we sequentially choose k 5 10 15 20 and t 50 100 the samples are nested i e the sample for the first scenario and k 5 t 50 is a subset of that of k 5 t 100 indeed our aim here is to evaluate the consequences of increasing k and t on the performance of our estimator for each sample we compute the estimator 4 and the corresponding theoretical standard errors tse given by the gaussian limit distribution we replicate b 100 times the experiment table 1 presents our simulation results the line eqml refers to the average estimated value of the parameters and tse refers to the average value of estimated theoretical standard errors eqml b 1 b 1 b θ ˆ t b and tse b 1 b 1 b diag j ˆ 1 b v ˆ b j ˆ b 1 2 where the superscript b represents the index of replication and diag m for a matrix m is the diagonal elements of m it appears that the model parameters are well estimated except for ω k k 1 k when k is very small relative to t which coincides here with k 5 t 50 100 we leave deep simulation studies for a future study 4 2 application to white spruce growth series dendrochronology i e the study of the time series of tree rings is a powerful tool for reconstructing past natural and anthropic disturbances girona et al 2016 boulanger and arseneault 2004 labrecque foy et al 2020 tree rings represent natural hard disks that record environmental changes and thereby offer the potential to understand the evolution of complex natural phenomena over time such as disturbances dendrochronological data have provided a better understanding of insect outbreak dynamics navarro et al 2018 camarero et al 2003 speer and kulakowski 2017 here we used the dendroecological series from jardon et al 2003 which includes annual tree ring width measurements for 631 white spruce picea glauca trees distributed across 45 sites in southwestern quebec canada with 1 to 23 trees per site these time series comprise between 63 and 247 rings we converted the ring width increments to basal area increments bai using the full series however because of covariate availability we limited our analysis to the ad 1955 1995 period 41 years to study only a single insect outbreak event see fig 2 in the appendix we interpolated climate variables at the study sites for these 41 years using biosim régnière et al 2014 a software package that interpolates daily climate station data on the basis of latitudinal and elevational climate gradients and the spatial correlations estimated from 30 year climate normals we computed the following climate summaries from daily data for the spring april june and summer july september seasons separately mean of daily maximum temperatures total precipitation and the climate moisture index cmi equal to the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet daily pet values were estimated using the penman monteith equation as implemented in the spei package beguería and vicente serrano 2017 in r on the basis of biosim interpolated values of the minimum and maximum temperature wind speed at 2 m solar radiation dew point temperature and atmospheric pressure using the tall crop model in spei one major sbw outbreak occurred in quebec during the study period spanning from 1967 to 1991 we obtained annual estimates of the severity of the sbw outbreak at the location of each study site through defoliation maps produced by the quebec ministry of forests wildlife and parks mffp 2019 these maps are digitized versions of hand drawn outlines of defoliated areas produced by aerial surveys of the affected regions the defoliation level for each area is classified on a scale of 1 to 3 corresponding to a low approx 1 35 moderate 36 70 or high 71 100 fraction of the year s foliage defoliated by sbw we note that these defoliation levels mainly reflect the status of balsam fir abies balsamea which is the main sbw host and is generally more severely affected than white spruce therefore these defoliation levels are a proxy for outbreak severity i e the potential herbivory pressure exerted by budworm on white spruce at the site because tree growth and its vulnerability to both climate and defoliation depend on tree age we split the data set and fit our models separately for the five age classes of 75 75 100 100 125 125 150 and 150 years we included as covariates the mean daily maximum of temperature the total precipitation and the mean cmi for the current and previous spring and summer only one of either precipitation and cmi appeared in a given model version because of the correlation between these two variables we also included as covariates the defoliation levels for the five preceding years a delay that estimates the time needed to fully regrow the lost foliage after an outbreak note that we do not expect defoliation to have a marked effect on the same year s growth ring krause et al 2003 finally we considered models having interaction effects of the preceding year s defoliation level and climate variables representing the possibility that climate conditions can increase or decrease a tree s sensitivity to sbw outbreaks data processing and analyses were performed in r r core team 2021 with the package dplr bunn 2008 used to process tree ring data we minimized the criterion 3 with the r command nlm dennis and schnabel 1983 all developed software is available under the creative commons cc license see data availability statements we used the qaic criterion for selecting the model the primary analysis based on partial autocorrelation plots led us to select p 1 according to the qaic the best models were those lacking an interaction between climate and defoliation our model results figs 3 and 4 revealed that higher defoliation levels led to reduced tree ring growth but this effect vanished after two years however note that while the direct effect vanished expected growth remained lower in the successive years because of the large estimated first order autocorrelation coefficient 0 8 0 9 depending on age class moreover there was no significant effect of defoliation on the following year s growth for the youngest and oldest trees although it produced an effect two years following the defoliation the results differed markedly for middle aged trees which were significantly affected one year after defoliation but not in the second year for the climate variables high maximum temperatures in the summer increased growth with up to a 5 6 cm² increase in basal area from a 10 c increase in summer maximum temperature however the previous summer s temperature had a negative effect on growth finally the spring cmi was negatively correlated with tree ring growth whereas the summer cmi had a positive effect however both the cmi and precipitation in the previous spring increased the tree ring growth of the current year 100 mm greater precipitation led to at least a 6 8 cm² increase in basal area growth it is worth mentioning that d orangeville et al 2018 reported a positive effect of temperature on tree ring growth and highlighted its transitory nature d orangeville et al 2018 found high temperatures to be unfavourable for ring growth our findings therefore differ slightly as we observed a negative long term effect of temperature rather than a reduced ring growth because of extreme temperature values moreover walker et al 2015 reported a negative radial growth response to temperature and a positive response to precipitation and cmi in constrast to these studies our approach here permitted a much closer inspection of the effects and we found a more complex relationship between climate and tree ring growth 5 conclusions here we developed a new time series model to handle data having a time varying number of sampled individuals we provided a valid statistical inference procedure and applied the model to assessing the combined effect of climate and sbw outbreak on white spruce tree ring growth in several sites in eastern canada we assumed a fixed number of ecological sites k for future work we plan to investigate the case of diverging k and the length n of observed series because many other ecological studies rely on binary variable or count data it may be useful to extend the framework of this paper to these data types credit authorship contribution

will write ζ k t ζ k t λ k t ζ t to denote the relationship between ζ k t and λ k t and ζ t accordingly ζ k t l λ k t ζ t l with ζ t l l 1 i i d with a mean of 1 or in general ζ k t l ζ k t l λ k t ζ

24399,we present a broad class of semi parametric models for time series of random sums of positive variables our methodology allows the number of terms inside the sum to be time varying and is therefore well suited to many examples encountered in the natural sciences we study the stability properties of the models and provide a valid statistical inference procedure to estimate the model parameters it is shown that the proposed quasi maximum likelihood estimator is consistent and asymptotically gaussian distributed this work is complemented by simulation results and applied to time series representing growth rates of white spruce picea glauca trees from a few dozen sites in québec canada this time series spans 41 years including one major spruce budworm choristoneura fumiferana outbreak between 1968 and 1991 we found significant growth reductions related to budworm induced defoliation up to two years post outbreak our results also revealed the positive effects of maximum summer temperature precipitation and the climate moisture index on white spruce growth we also identified the negative effects of the climate moisture index in the spring and the maximum temperature of the previous summer however the model s performance on this data set was not improved when the interactions between climate and defoliation on growth were considered this study represents a major advance in our understanding of budworm climate tree interactions and provides a useful tool to project the combined effects of climate and insect defoliation on tree growth in a context of greater frequency and severity of outbreaks coupled with the anticipated increases in temperature keywords dendrochronology ecological modelling natural disturbances quasi likelihood estimation semi parametric autoregressive models data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction many ecological studies require measuring the positive dependent variables of random numbers of statistical individuals sampled over time girona et al 2019 this approach is often necessary as 1 researchers cannot observe the entire population and 2 the individuals observed by researchers depend on time varying resources applications of this statistical approach include studies of species behaviour and ecological services in forestry for example we can be interested in time series that represent the mass or size of a given tree species we then randomly sample individual trees each year and observe the corresponding mass or volume e g see vourlitis et al 2022 this approach is also applied to evaluate the area occupied by a species in relation to the available resources over time labrecque foy et al 2020 in fisheries we can use this approach to track temporal changes in the weight of fish caught e g chan et al 2020 in this paper we evaluate the impact of climate change and insect outbreak on tree growth as recorded by growth rings spruce budworm choristoneura fumiferana sbw is the most important defoliator of conifer trees in the eastern north american boreal forest girona et al 2018 in the province of québec canada the forest area affected by this species of lepidoptera over the last century covers more twice the size of the ukraine navarro et al 2018 at the epidemic stage massive populations of larvae cause widespread damage to tree foliage lavoie et al 2019 sbw affects the main conifer boreal species in canada including balsam fir abies balsamea white spruce picea glauca and black spruce picea mariana resulting in a major impact on boreal forest regeneration and dynamics martin et al 2020 moreover sbw outbreaks produce important economic consequences through the loss of forest productivity previous works have studied the changes of forest composition following insect outbreaks e g morin et al 2021 the response of sbw outbreaks to climate change e g fleming and volney 1995 and berguet et al 2021 and demography i e the rate of mortality of spruce during outbreaks gauthier et al 2015 however despite the major implications of future climate change we continue to have a limited understanding of the combined effects of sbw outbreak and climate change on tree growth given that temperature and its variations as well as the timing and amount of precipitation affect organisms survival reproduction cycles and spatial dispersion aber et al 2001 it is critical to understand the links between sbw outbreaks climate and tree growth to improve our understanding of the impacts of future climate change on forest productivity klapwijk et al 2013 this concern is amplified by the expected increase in sbw outbreak severity and frequency under future climate scenarios navarro et al 2018 seidl et al 2017 in this paper we contribute to filling this gap by proposing a broad class of semi parametric models for positive valued time series time series data are common in forestry and the standard statistical approaches include descriptive exploratory techniques and linear mixed effect models with time varying variables on transformed data e g girona et al 2016 and boulanger and arseneault 2004 and correlated error terms girardin et al 2016 however these approaches suffer from several drawbacks descriptive exploratory techniques do not allow the drawing of inferences from the data and linear mixed effect models as shown in several papers e g chou et al 2015 have demonstrated that specifying a linear model on transformed data often leads to a poor predictive performance applying a log transformation for instance can make the positive valued data more normal nonetheless the obtained predicted value underestimates the expected value because of jensen s inequality furthermore models having autocorrelated error terms do not account for the complex dependent structure of tree ring growth to provide a more robust and reliable approach we present a class of semi parametric autoregressive models and use them to investigate the relationships between climate sbw outbreak and the growth of white spruce we also discuss the advantages of applying a repeated measures design many previous studies have focused on modelling non gaussian time series such as positive valued processes gaussian processes can be represented as linear models whereas time series of count or binary data are modelled by non linear dynamics e g sim 1990 weiß 2018 and davis et al 2016 and references therein for positive valued time series data engle and russell 1998 proposed the range volatility model as an alternative to garch models in finance and its use has rapidly expanded because of its diverse applicability we refer the interested reader to the review by chou et al 2015 recently aknouche and francq 2020 considered a positive valued time series whose conditional distribution had a time varying mean dependent on exogenous variables our approach here differs slightly from theirs as the positive process under consideration is itself the sum of a random number of other positive variables our approach is driven strongly by the available data at hand which consist of multiple time series collected from several sites where the number of sampled individuals varies over time and between sites hence considering an aggregate value such as the sum or the mean of growth rings can produce a loss of variability linked to the sampling scheme moreover in fields such as finance some modelling relies on considering empirical quantities such as realized volatility historical returns of investment products within a defined period are then analysed e g allen et al 2010 unlike our framework which is typical for ecological studies all transactions on investment products are recorded i e the entire statistical population is observed our paper is organized as follows in section 2 we define the model used throughout this paper and discuss our modelling choice the time series properties of the models are also assessed in this section we then present the maximum likelihood based inference and its asymptotic properties in section 3 section 4 contains a small simulation study and an application to empirical data related to the growth of white spruce all auxiliary lemmas and mathematical proofs are presented in appendix 2 models and stability results we present a generalized linear dynamic model for the time series of random sums of positive variables this model relies on an empirical application where we analyse the annual growth of spruce trees subject to climate variation and sbw oubreak we measured growth using tree cores collected at 1 30 m height from the trunks of individual trees in a stand girona et al 2017 sample preparation measurement and analysis conformed to standard dendroecological protocols krause and morin 1995 cores were air dried mounted on wood boards and then sanded tree ring width was measured using windendro guay et al 1992 or a manual henson micrometer having an accuracy of 0 01 mm the tree ring series measurements covered the last 41 years and were cross dated using tsap wi rinntech heidelberg germany we denote by y k t t z k 1 k the time series of the total basal area increment related to the k th observational site i e the sum of increases in the trunk cross sectional area for the n k t trees sampled for site k in year t we aim to model the dynamics of this process both in terms of its own past and in the presence of m additional covariates x k t r m in the empirical application presented in section 4 the covariate process encompasses climate variables including temperature and precipitation and the level of sbw related defoliation of the previous years our model is given by 1 y k t l 1 n k t ζ l k t where conditionally on n k t x k t n k t n k t s s 1 and y k t y k t s s 1 the variables ζ l k t 1 l n k t which represent the basal area increments of individual sampled trees are distributed identically as a random variable ζ k t of mean λ k t moreover n k t t z is a sequence of i i d random variables where conditionally on n k t the variable n k t is independent from x k t and y k t the mean process is given by 2 φ δ λ k t η k t ω k j 1 p α j y k t j n k t j β x k t k 1 k and t 1 t such that ω k r α j r β β 1 β m r m and φ δ is a real valued function defined on r that can depend on a parameter δ it is worth mentioning without loss of generality that the covariate process considered at time t is included in the specification of λ k t because multiple lags of a given set of variables can be included by simply stacking them into a vector an example is the case of defoliation levels as shown in our application as growth can be affected by defoliation occurring up to five years before the present from t 5 to t 1 the variables ζ k t will be referred to as the unity random variables we do not make any assumptions about the distribution of the variables ζ k t any distribution on 0 can be chosen examples include the exponential distribution having the parameter 1 λ k t the log normal distribution having parameters log λ k t σ 2 2 and σ and a gamma distribution having the parameters α λ k t and α regardless of the distribution of unity random variables the conditional expectation of y k t is n k t λ k t however under the assumption of the independence of ζ l k t 1 l n k t if they are exponentially distributed the conditional variance is n k t λ k t 2 i e a quadratic function of λ k t in our example of gamma distributed unity random variables conditional variance is n k t λ k t α i e a linear function of λ k t in the case of a log normal distribution however the conditional variance is n k t λ k t 4 exp σ 2 1 with our semi parametric framework we will only focus on the estimation of regression parameters θ δ ω 1 ω k α 1 α p β without the need to perform any distributional goodness of fit tests note 1 copies of unity variables in our general setup the copies ζ l k t 1 l n k t of the unity random variables ζ k t are not required to be independent in practical applications where ζ l k t represents for example the measure of annual growth for a sampled tree the general assumption of being identically distributed can be thought as a local stationary condition inside site k at time t note 2 marginal stationary distributions note from eqs 1 and 2 that y k t f θ k x k t s n k t s ζ ℓ k t s s 0 ℓ 1 for θ k δ ω k α 1 α p β then for 1 k 1 k 2 k the distributions of y k 1 0 n k 1 0 x k 1 0 and y k 2 0 n k 1 0 x k 2 0 are not equal unless ω k 1 ω k 2 and x k 1 0 ζ ℓ k 1 0 ℓ 1 is equal in distribution to x k 2 0 ζ ℓ k 2 0 ℓ 1 in section 4 we will investigate the consequences of the latter conditions on the proposed estimation procedure note 3 regression function 2 note that η k t in 2 does not depend linearly on y k t i i 1 p but on y k t i n k t i i 1 p through 2 we can link the underlying mean process and the empirical estimate of the past mean process even for a constant size process i e n k t n k t because the regression parameter α i i 1 p is free of k we still cannot yet express η k t as a linear combination of y k t i i 1 p moreover one can expect y k t i n k t i λ k t i i 1 p or more generally h y k t i n k t i λ k t i i 1 p for some mapping h such that e h y k t i n k t i λ k t i 0 in 2 at the place of y k t i n k t i i 1 p with the latter two mentioned specifications the model 1 2 defines the glarma model see weiß 2018 for more details in its present form the model 1 2 shares similarities with the well known arch bollerslev 1986 and inarch weiß 2018 models we leave the topic of glarma specification for a future work note 4 contrast with the non linear mixed model the model 1 2 has some similarities to well known mixed models indeed as for mixed models ω k represents the site fixed effect where the random effect is embedded in the distribution of unity variables the simple example of ζ l k t λ k t ϵ l k t where ϵ l k t l 1 is a sequence of identically distributed random variables of mean 1 fit with the class of multiplicative random effect models cameron and trivedi 2013 nonetheless more complex random effects can be handled however the model 1 2 is more general because it allows the individuals sampled over time to change indeed as we will see in section 3 the individual measurements are no longer needed when the sequence y k t n k t is available moreover in terms of the application to resource management it is often of interest to model and predict a population quantity such as the sum of basal area growth in a forest choice of the link function φ the logarithmic link function is often applied and coincides with the well known log linear model see for example cameron and trivedi 2013 for models of count data this link function assumes a linear relationship between the logarithm of the mean process and the covariates however other link functions can preserve the linear correlation at least on the positive part of r consider for example the threshold mapping x max x 0 this mapping is not smooth and most of the time one makes some restrictions on model parameters to obtain the positiveness of the mean directly here we will apply the inverse of the softplus function as a link function indeed the softplus function see glorot et al 2011 is interesting for two reasons first in regard to modelling it preserves the linearity on the positive part of real line as shown by weißet al 2022 for count time series modelling the models defined with the softplus link function are quite close to the truly linear model this is also relevant for our biological application as we expect a linear effect of covariates on growth above a certain threshold representing the minimal favourable conditions for growth the minimum growth expected may not be exactly zero which is why we will later consider a slightly different version of softplus referred to as softplus δ for δ 0 defined as softplus δ x log 1 δ exp x second and also a technical advantage is that the mapping softplus δ is infinitely differentiable fig 1 in the appendix illustrates the difference between the softplus δ link function and max x 0 where softplus represents softplus 0 one can note that softplus δ is lower bounded by log 1 δ it is also worth noting that our generalization of the softplus function differs from that of mei and eisner 2017 and weißet al 2022 eq 3 2 as noted by the latter it is possible to mimic the behaviour of the tobit model with the softplus generalization of mei and eisner 2017 in contrast here we aim to lower bound the softplus link function by a non zero constant because we require a minimum basal area increment at any time note 5 model interpretation obviously with the softplus δ link function the mean process increases with the j th covariate process if β j 0 and decreases when β j 0 because softplus δ x x the mean process can be approximated by identity mapping therefore all other things remaining equal the regression function is similar to β j x j t for large values of x j t and β j 0 and then increases by β j α for increasing values α of x j t let us denote by rg x y the relative rate of growth of the mean process between x and y i e rg δ x y γ δ x γ δ y where γ δ is the derivative function of softplus δ for β 0 lim x rg δ β x α β x e β α therefore the rate towards log 1 δ driven by x j t is given by e β j α when β j 0 moreover when δ 0 by l hôpital s rule lim x rg 0 x y lim x softplus 0 β x α softplus 0 β x e β α therefore all other things remaining equal the mean process will be divided by e β α when x j t increases by α for large values of x j t and β j 0 theorem 1 provides some stability conditions of model 1 2 with the inverse of the softplus function as the link whereas lemma 1 in the appendix represents a general result for φ theorem 1 under the assumptions st 1 and st 2 in the appendix and j 1 p α j 1 there exists a unique set of k stationary ergodic sequences y k t n k t x k t k 1 k that are the solution of eqs 1 and 2 with e η k 0 k 1 k 3 estimation and asymptotic properties this section is devoted to the estimation of the conditional mean parameters by the quasi maximum likelihood estimator qmle based on a member of the exponential family we consider the exponential qmle eqmle because this estimator coincides with the maximum likelihood estimator mle when the unity random variables follow the exponential γ 1 λ k t 1 distribution and the copies ζ l k t 1 l n k t are independent for our application the k time series are observed between the time points 1 and t we provide an asymptotic theory for the estimated parameters and present the results of a small simulation study investigating the finite sample properties of the estimator in the following section we make λ k t dependent on the parameter θ θ a compact set that is log exp λ k t θ 1 δ ω k j 1 p α j y k t j n k t j β x k t η k t θ k 1 k and t 1 t where δ δ 0 let us denote the true data generating parameter value by θ 0 the loss function from the exponential quasi maximum likelihood is given by 3 r t θ k 1 k t 1 t 1 t y k t λ k t θ n k t log λ k t θ k 1 k t 1 t 1 t ℓ k t θ k 1 k ℓ k θ and 4 θ ˆ t argmin θ θ r t θ the derivative of λ k t θ with respect to θ is given by λ k t θ θ λ k t θ 1 1 δ e η k t θ e η k t θ 1 δ e η k t θ ι k y k t 1 n k t 1 y k t p n k t p x k t where ι k is a vector of size k with 1 at the k th position and 0 elsewhere we will denote by λ k t resp λ k t the vector λ k t θ resp λ k t θ evaluated at the point θ θ 0 we will study the asymptotic properties of the qmle estimator 4 to do so we employ taniguchi and kakizawa 2002 thm 3 2 23 which was extended in klimko and nelson 1978 the lemmas in our appendix produce the general result for the asymptotic properties of qmle 4 the following theorem represents the consistency and the asymptotic normality of 4 for the softplus δ link function let us set v k e 1 λ k 0 2 n k 0 y k

located in the interior of θ lim t t θ ˆ t θ 0 n 0 j 1 v j where j k 1 k j k and v k 1 k v k 4 application 4 1 simulation we examined the finite sample performance of the qmle presented in the previous section through a small simulation study we present the results for qmle under two different data generating processes here referred to as scenario 1 and scenario 2 with m 10 covariates first x k t does not depend on k and is a sequence of i i d random variables distributed as exponential random variables with means λ 1 λ m in the second for a fixed k x k t is sampled independently from exponential distributions of mean 0 4 k λ 1 0 4 k λ m for the two data generating processes for a fixed k the process n k t t 1 is independently sampled from a poisson distribution of mean τ k as follows for a fixed k τ 1 τ k are independent and distributed as an exponential random variable of mean k moreover we take p 1 and δ 0 5 β 0 1 1 0 5 0 5 1 5 1 5 2 2 0 α 1 0 6 and ω 1 ω k independently and uniformly sampling in the range 0 5 k 0 5 k for a fixed k we sequentially choose k 5 10 15 20 and t 50 100 the samples are nested i e the sample for the first scenario and k 5 t 50 is a subset of that of k 5 t 100 indeed our aim here is to evaluate the consequences of increasing k and t on the performance of our estimator for each sample we compute the estimator 4 and the corresponding theoretical standard errors tse given by the gaussian limit distribution we replicate b 100 times the experiment table 1 presents our simulation results the line eqml refers to the average estimated value of the parameters and tse refers to the average value of estimated theoretical standard errors eqml b 1 b 1 b θ ˆ t b and tse b 1 b 1 b diag j ˆ 1 b v ˆ b j ˆ b 1 2 where the superscript b represents the index of replication and diag m for a matrix m is the diagonal elements of m it appears that the model parameters are well estimated except for ω k k 1 k when k is very small relative to t which coincides here with k 5 t 50 100 we leave deep simulation studies for a future study 4 2 application to white spruce growth series dendrochronology i e the study of the time series of tree rings is a powerful tool for reconstructing past natural and anthropic disturbances girona et al 2016 boulanger and arseneault 2004 labrecque foy et al 2020 tree rings represent natural hard disks that record environmental changes and thereby offer the potential to understand the evolution of complex natural phenomena over time such as disturbances dendrochronological data have provided a better understanding of insect outbreak dynamics navarro et al 2018 camarero et al 2003 speer and kulakowski 2017 here we used the dendroecological series from jardon et al 2003 which includes annual tree ring width measurements for 631 white spruce picea glauca trees distributed across 45 sites in southwestern quebec canada with 1 to 23 trees per site these time series comprise between 63 and 247 rings we converted the ring width increments to basal area increments bai using the full series however because of covariate availability we limited our analysis to the ad 1955 1995 period 41 years to study only a single insect outbreak event see fig 2 in the appendix we interpolated climate variables at the study sites for these 41 years using biosim régnière et al 2014 a software package that interpolates daily climate station data on the basis of latitudinal and elevational climate gradients and the spatial correlations estimated from 30 year climate normals we computed the following climate summaries from daily data for the spring april june and summer july september seasons separately mean of daily maximum temperatures total precipitation and the climate moisture index cmi equal to the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet daily pet values were estimated using the penman monteith equation as implemented in the spei package beguería and vicente serrano 2017 in r on the basis of biosim interpolated values of the minimum and maximum temperature wind speed at 2 m solar radiation dew point temperature and atmospheric pressure using the tall crop model in spei one major sbw outbreak occurred in quebec during the study period spanning from 1967 to 1991 we obtained annual estimates of the severity of the sbw outbreak at the location of each study site through defoliation maps produced by the quebec ministry of forests wildlife and parks mffp 2019 these maps are digitized versions of hand drawn outlines of defoliated areas produced by aerial surveys of the affected regions the defoliation level for each area is classified on a scale of 1 to 3 corresponding to a low approx 1 35 moderate 36 70 or high 71 100 fraction of the year s foliage defoliated by sbw we note that these defoliation levels mainly reflect the status of balsam fir abies balsamea which is the main sbw host and is generally more severely affected than white spruce therefore these defoliation levels are a proxy for outbreak severity i e the potential herbivory pressure exerted by budworm on white spruce at the site because tree growth and its vulnerability to both climate and defoliation depend on tree age we split the data set and fit our models separately for the five age classes of 75 75 100 100 125 125 150 and 150 years we included as covariates the mean daily maximum of temperature the total precipitation and the mean cmi for the current and previous spring and summer only one of either precipitation and cmi appeared in a given model version because of the correlation between these two variables we also included as covariates the defoliation levels for the five preceding years a delay that estimates the time needed to fully regrow the lost foliage after an outbreak note that we do not expect defoliation to have a marked effect on the same year s growth ring krause et al 2003 finally we considered models having interaction effects of the preceding year s defoliation level and climate variables representing the possibility that climate conditions can increase or decrease a tree s sensitivity to sbw outbreaks data processing and analyses were performed in r r core team 2021 with the package dplr bunn 2008 used to process tree ring data we minimized the criterion 3 with the r command nlm dennis and schnabel 1983 all developed software is available under the creative commons cc license see data availability statements we used the qaic criterion for selecting the model the primary analysis based on partial autocorrelation plots led us to select p 1 according to the qaic the best models were those lacking an interaction between climate and defoliation our model results figs 3 and 4 revealed that higher defoliation levels led to reduced tree ring growth but this effect vanished after two years however note that while the direct effect vanished expected growth remained lower in the successive years because of the large estimated first order autocorrelation coefficient 0 8 0 9 depending on age class moreover there was no significant effect of defoliation on the following year s growth for the youngest and oldest trees although it produced an effect two years following the defoliation the results differed markedly for middle aged trees which were significantly affected one year after defoliation but not in the second year for the climate variables high maximum temperatures in the summer increased growth with up to a 5 6 cm² increase in basal area from a 10 c increase in summer maximum temperature however the previous summer s temperature had a negative effect on growth finally the spring cmi was negatively correlated with tree ring growth whereas the summer cmi had a positive effect however both the cmi and precipitation in the previous spring increased the tree ring growth of the current year 100 mm greater precipitation led to at least a 6 8 cm² increase in basal area growth it is worth mentioning that d orangeville et al 2018 reported a positive effect of temperature on tree ring growth and highlighted its transitory nature d orangeville et al 2018 found high temperatures to be unfavourable for ring growth our findings therefore differ slightly as we observed a negative long term effect of temperature rather than a reduced ring growth because of extreme temperature values moreover walker et al 2015 reported a negative radial growth response to temperature and a positive response to precipitation and cmi in constrast to these studies our approach here permitted a much closer inspection of the effects and we found a more complex relationship between climate and tree ring growth 5 conclusions here we developed a new time series model to handle data having a time varying number of sampled individuals we provided a valid statistical inference procedure and applied the model to assessing the combined effect of climate and sbw outbreak on white spruce tree ring growth in several sites in eastern canada we assumed a fixed number of ecological sites k for future work we plan to investigate the case of diverging k and the length n of observed series because many other ecological studies rely on binary variable or count data it may be useful to extend the framework of this paper to these data types credit authorship contribution

will write ζ k t ζ k t λ k t ζ t to denote the relationship between ζ k t and λ k t and ζ t accordingly ζ k t l λ k t ζ t l with ζ t l l 1 i i d with a mean of 1 or in general ζ k t l ζ k t l λ k t ζ
