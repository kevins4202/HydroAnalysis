15590,in china urea degradants are often used in combination with chlorine in swimming pool water to remove urea here we report the first study about the impacts of urea degradants on urea degradation disinfection byproduct dbp formation and estimated dbp associated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity firstly four groups of typical dbps from six real indoor swimming pools were analyzed the concentration of dbps in swimming pool waters was about 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that source tap water notably a rapid increase in dbps was observed after urea degradant treatment simulated processes of urea removal using three commonly used urea degradants were therefore conducted in laboratory neither urea degradant nor chlorine alone removed urea effectively within 48 h when applied in combination urea degradant with sufficient chlorine rapidly removed urea by 100 within 3 h and anti chlorourea oligomer in urea degradants was the main contributor meanwhile a remarkable increase in dbps especially brominated dbps was observed due to bromide introduction by urea degradants for this reason bromine incorporation factor bif of dbps dramatically increased for instance the bif of dihaloacetic acids increased by 2665 4025 after applying three urea degradants as the highly toxic brominated dbps were generated attention should be paid into the potential dbp related health risks from the use of urea degradants together with chlorine graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords swimming pool water disinfection byproducts urea degradant toxicity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction swimming is a popular leisure activity and there are 29 200 swimming venue in china by the end of 2020 in shanghai city alone the number of swimming pools totaled 741 in 2017 with more than 9 36 million swimming pool visits in a typical summer shi et al 2020 to ensure safety chlorine based disinfectants are commonly applied to swimming pools to prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases who 2006a however the addition of disinfectants in swimming pools increases chemical risks related to disinfection byproducts dbps the situation is further complicated by the wide array of water matrix components such as natural organic matter nom in tap water that fills the pools yan et al 2014 human body excretions e g sweat urine de laat et al 2011a kim et al 2002 pharmaceutical and personal care products e g sunscreen hair dyes richardson 2010 these substances would react with disinfectants to form dbps carter and joll 2017 richardson and kimura 2020 it has been noted in human epidemiological studies that adverse health effects such as asthma irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes were associated with exposure to disinfected swimming pool water bernard et al 2006 compared with drinking water swimmers are exposed to dbps in more ways e g ingestion dermal absorption and inhalation carter and joll 2017 chowdhury et al 2014 cantor et al 2010 found that dermal inhalation exposure from showering bathing and swimming was a significant bladder cancer risk factor previous studies reported that serum levels of inhibin b or of total testosterone were strongly correlated with the time that adolescents had spent in chlorinated swimming pool water nickmilder and bernard 2011 in a 12 week swimming training program in rats the health training effect and metabolic status of the rats in simulated chlorinated pools were remarkablely affected li et al 2015 therefore swimming pool associated dbp exposure and the relevant potential health risk demand attention urea is abundantly present in human body fluids e g sweat and urine human epidermis and urea containing moisturizers and it has been reported that an average urine release per swimmer could be 25 77 ml de laat et al 2011b urea is considered to be the main nitrogen contaminant introduced into swimming pool water by swimmers de laat et al 2011a who 2006b surveys conducted by zhang et al 2018 showed that the concentration of urea in swimming places in beijing in china varied from 0 07 to 18 73 mg l swimming pool water is usually recycled after treatment zwiener et al 2007 however urea and dbps cannot be efficiently removed due to low molecular weight and thus accumulate in swimming pool water skibinski et al 2019 urea is an important indicator of swimming pool water quality and hygiene and is regulated at 3 5 mg l in swimming pool water in china ministry of health of the people s republic of china 2016 to meet the water quality requirements several attempts were made to control urea ultraviolet uv based technologies have been applied to remove urea long et al 2019 according to the study of kim et al 2019 photoelectrocatalysis and ozonation were able to remove 54 and 73 of urea when the initial concentration was 20 and 10 mg l in practice urea degradants currently are commonly used in swimming pool in china to control urea due to low cost and handling ease urea degradants are commercial products containing anti chlorourea oligomer activation agents e g kcl nacl kbr and nabr and water wang et al 2020 unfortunately high organic inorganic chlorine addition is required when urea degradants are used which would inevitably affect the formation of dbps urea could also be a dbp precursor especially to nitrogenous dbps n dbps richardson and ternes 2018 however detailed research into the impacts of urea degradants on the formation of the health concerning dbps and dbp associated toxicity are lacking here we reported the first comprehensive study of the use of urea degradants in swimming pool water including the effects of chlorine dosage and reaction time on urea degradation the mechanism of urea degradation using urea degradants the impacts of urea degradant treatment on dbp formation and the associated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity the results of this study could offer insights of the potential health risk during urea degradant application in swimming pool 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and samples the standards of four trihalomethanes thms and six haas were purchased as a mixture epa 501 601 thms

shanghai china three kinds of urea degradants urea degradant a b and c were obtained from online retailers ultrapure water was produced from a milli q water purification system 18mώ cm billerica usa all other chemical reagents were of at least analytical grade and obtained from aladdin industrial inc shanghai china unless otherwise specified 2 2 swimming pool water sample collection swimming pool water for dbp occurrence occurrence of dbps were determined in six real indoor swimming pool water and source water that was used to fill swimming pools for each pool source water and pool water were all sampled swimming pools are in a city in eastern china and they are from different recreational facility the source water of all swimming pools came from municipal water supply system and chloramine was used as disinfectant swimming pool water was recycled after sand filtration in all six swimming pools fig s1 chlorine was used as disinfectant in all six pools selected dbps elaborated further below in section analytical methods dissolved organic carbon doc total nitrogen tn inorganic nitrogen i e nh4 no2 and no3 free chlorine and total chlorine were measured details about sample collection and parameter determination were provided in text s1 and table s1 swimming pool water for simulated experiments the impacts of urea degradant treatment on urea degradation and dbp formation were investigated by laboratory simulation to avoid introducing new precursors due to daily operation of the pool and one real swimming pool water swimming pool 3 that has never been treated with urea degradant was used in all simulated tests swimming pool water was freshly sampled before simulated experiments and parameters of sample used for the simulated experiments were shown in table s2 2 3 simulated urea removal processes using urea degradants batch experiments were performed in 1 l brown unsealed glass bottles using real pool water that was not treated with urea degradants as described above the reactors were kept at 25 0 1 c the original urea concentration upon collection was 3 1 mg l to maintain same original urea concentration in all experiments the initial urea concentration in the batch test was adjusted to 5 mg l by adding urea three commonly used commercial urea degradants designated as urea degradant a b and c were selected urea degradants were added at 3 mg l in all experiments according to manufacturers recipe then chlorination was conducted by adding sodium hypochlorite naclo solution the solutions were stirred by magnetic stirrers at a speed of 500 r min to simulate disturbance in swimming pool water after a reaction time of 3 6 9 12 24 and 48 h the solutions were filtered through 0 45 mm glass fiber filters for residual free chlorine total chlorine and urea analysis doc tn dbps and total organic halogen tox determination were carried out at the reaction time of 48 h 2 4 analytical methods urea was measured colorimetrically using diacetyl monoxime according to the chinese national standard analytical method gb t 18204 2 the method detection limit mdl is 0 07 mg l detailed information on urea measurement was reported previously long et al 2019

methods of these dbps are available elsewhere he et al 2019 hou et al 2018 tox of the solutions were determined using a tox analyzer multi x 2000 aox jena germany zhang et al 2020 chloride and bromide was measured using an ion chromatography equipped with a conductivity detector aquion dionex sunnyvale usa and a hydroxide selective analytical column as 19 4 250 mm dionex sunnyvale usa all experiments were conducted in duplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of dbps in swimming pool water and source tap water the concentrations of typical dbps in swimming pool water and the corresponding source tap water were determined swimming pool water was all recycled through a sand filtration fig s1 as is shown in fig 1 the concentration of most dbps in swimming pool water was about 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in source tap water thms contributed to the highest fraction of the tested dbps tcm in swimming pool waters ranged from 85 5 to 403 4 μg l with an average of 203 9 μg l for swimming pool 3 the concentration of tcm was as high as 403 4 μg l which was 891 of the tcm in the corresponding source tap water the four thms averaged 286 9 μg l in the collected swimming pool water samples the thms in this study was higher than the tested 44 indoor swimming pools in the uk where the four thms levels averaged 133 μg l chu and nieuwenhuijsen 2002 much higher thm concentration was observed in seawater sourced swimming pool waters where thms were tested from 234 to 996 μg l parinet et al 2012 a large portion of thms could evaporate into the air aggazzotti et al 1995 indicating that actual thm formation was more than the detected in swimming pool water six haas were determined in this study averaging 139 μg l wang et al found that haa levels in indoor pools in china averaged 117 ug l wang et al 2014 haas tested in this study were dramatically lower than united states swimming pool water where haas were determined at 1650 μg l maximum in an indoor swimming pool tang 2011 the hals and hans were also determined as they express higher levels of mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity compared with thms and haas dcal and tcal were the predominant fractions of hals dcal and tcal ranged from 14 2 to 45 2 and 63 2 to 125 6 μg l respectively fig 1 bromated hals were much lower dbal dbcal and tbal were less than 5 4 μg l with an average concentration of 1 6 2 0 and 0 9 μg l respectively high tcal concentration was also observed in swimming pool water in the united states where the concentration of tcal was up to 439 μg l allen et al 2021 for hans dcan and bcan are the main han components in the tested samples dcan concentration ranged from 6 7 to 25 9 μg l with an average value of 15 5 μg l bcan ranged from 2 8 to 20 8 μg l with an average concentration of 8 5 μg l the concentration of other hans dban tban and tcan was about 1 μg l brominated dbps accounted for a much higher proportion of tox in swimming pool water than that in tap water e g 31 of tap water and 41 of swimming pool water in swimming pool 3 high concentration of brominated dbps in swimming pools has also been reported before kanan et al 2015 and it may be caused by the introduction of bromide during the operation of swimming pool disinfectant tablets are usually used to disinfect swimming pool water and a previous study reported that 33 out of 40 hypochlorite feedstock solutions were positive in bromate detection owing to the high content of bromide in the raw brines employed by the manufacturers garcia villanova et al 2010 human inputs e g sweat and urine hair and other personal care products also contain bromide weisel et al 2009 hypochlorous acid hocl can rapidly oxidize bromide to hypobromous acid hobr k 1550 m s hua et al 2006 then hobr can react with organic matter to form brominated dbps through electrophilic substitution bromine substitution with nom was about an order of magnitude faster than chlorine substitution hua et al 2006 westerhoff et al 2004 resulting in the high concentration of most of the brominated dbps in swimming pool water almost all tested dbps were in highest concentration in swimming pool 3 however the dbps in tap water filling swimming pool 3 was similar to any other tap water to identify the key factor that triggered the high dbp generation water parameters and dbp concentration in swimming pool 3 was continuously monitored a remarkable increase of dbps was observed after the urea removal using urea degradant concentration of urea degradant is 3 mg l and residual free chlorine is 3 mg l after 1 h reaction and most of the dbps continued to increase for a period of time fig 2 as is shown in fig 2 tcm increased from 54 6 to 111 8 μg l after 12 h urea degradant addition and finally increased to 309 μg l in addition a rapid increase of brominated dbps was observed for instance dbaa increased from 20 1 to 68 1 μg l within 24 h and dban increased from 0 8 μg l to 35 μg l within 12 h the effect of urea degradants on the urea removal and dbp formation should be further investigated 3 2 urea removal using urea degradants three commonly used urea degradants i e urea degradant a b and c were obtained and simulated urea removal processes using urea degradants were performed according to the product manual urea degradant should be dosed in conjunction with chlorine the effect of chlorine on the removal of urea was firstly investigated as is shown in fig 3 a the concentration of urea did not change when urea degradant a was used alone the reaction between urea and chlorine was very slow and more than 50 urea remained after 48 h reaction even when up to 16 mg l of chlorine was added fig 3a this was consistent with a previous study blatchley and cheng 2010 the combined use of urea degradant a and free chlorine effectively removed urea and urea completely degraded within 3 h fig 3a similar phenomenon was observed for urea degradant b and c fig s2 the effect of chlorine dosage on urea degradation was also studied for urea degradant a as is shown in fig 3c as the chlorine dosage increased the removal percentage of urea increased the degradation rates of urea were calculated as shown in fig s3a the degradation rates were 3 1 4 9 5 5 10 5 and 18 6 µm l h of samples with 1 2 4 8 and 16 mg l free chlorine addition respectively the degradation of urea was always accompanied by the depletion of chlorine fig 3b and d the urea removal percentage slightly increased with increasing free chlorine dosage 14 20 and 27 of samples with 1 2 and 4 mg l free chlorine addition respectively owning to the lack of chlorine fig 3d the urea removal ratio increased to 54 5 and 100 when the initial free chlorine concentration increased to 8 and 16 mg l indicating the important role of free chlorine it should be noted that 0 6 h was the critical period for urea removal for solutions dosed with 16 mg l free chlorine and urea degradant a urea degradation rate reached 18 6 µm l h 0 3 h and 8 1 µm l h 3 6 h respectively however the urea removal rate dropped to below 0 4 µm l h after 6 h due to the lack of free chlorine fig s3a compared with urea degradant a the free chlorine demand for complete urea removal within 48 h increased from 16 to 32 mg l for urea degradant b and c fig s4a and s4c for solutions dosed with urea degradant b urea decayed at a rate of 3 5 3 8 5 6 13 4 11 4 and 20 5 µm l h for solutions dosed with 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 mg l free chlorine during the first 3 h fig s5a and the urea removal slowed down after 3 h the similar trend was observed with urea degradant c fig s5 similar to urea degradant a urea removal rates of solutions dosed with urea degradant b c and 1 2 and 4 mg l of free chlorine were low fig s5 while the urea removal sped up markedly when the free chlorine concentration increased to 8 16 and 32 mg l urea degradants have been reported to include anti chlorourea oligomer activation agents e g kcl nacl kbr and nabr and water wang et al 2020 anti chlorourea oligomer as doc bromide and chloride of three urea degradants were determined table 1 the exact mechanism of urea degradation has not been reported due to commercial confidentiality urea tn no3 nh4 free chlorine and combined chlorine in ultrapure water were monitored after urea degradant treatment table 2 tn decreased dramatically table 2 and no3 and combined chlorine were much lower than that chlorine was used alone table 2 indicating that urea was transferred to gaseous substances and was discharged from the water it has been reported that the chlorination of urea led to increase in ncl3 according to reaction 1 and nitrate could also be formed through reaction 2 n2o could also be formed at a slow rate reactions 3 and 4 blatchley and cheng 2010 the rapid decrease of urea in the presence of urea degradant should be caused by accelerated reaction 3 and 4 little chloride is contained in urea degradants table 1 three urea degradants contain 1479 7 2125 6 μg l bromide table 1 however bromide had little effect on urea degradation fig 3a therefore anti chlorourea oligomer in urea degradant was the main contributor that promoted the reaction 3 and 4 and the final product was n2o high chlorine demand and reduced tn indirectly support this inference table 2 1 co n h 2 2 hocl h c l c o 2 nc l 3 ncl 2 nc l 3 hocl 2 h 2 o no 3 4 c l 5 h 3 ncl o h noh c l 4 2 noh h 2 n 2 o 2 n 2 o h 2 o with the same free chlorine concentration of 16 mg l removal percentage of urea after 3 h dropped from 100 to 67 when the water changed from ultrapure water to swimming pool water fig 3a and c the chlorine demand increased dramatically fig 3b and d indicating that there were various chlorine reactive substances in actual swimming pool water that consumed chlorine in a study by lee and westerhoff 2009 chlorination of nom isolates produced maximum concentrations of organic chloramines e g n chloramines n chloramino acids n chloraldimines and n chloramides within 10 min and then the organic chloramines degraded to numerous dbps how et al 2017 it showed that combined chlorine increased in the first 3 h and gradually decreased thereafter fig s3b it is hypothesized that a large amount of combined chlorine formed rapidly within 0 3 h due to the reaction between free chlorine and chlorine reactive substances in swimming pool water and then transformed into other dbps as time passed therefore dbp formation would be affected after urea degradant addition 3 3 the impacts of urea degradant treatment on dbp formation the variation of dbp formation of swimming pool water treated by three urea degradants were investigated as is shown in figs 4 a s6a and s7a the concentrations of tcm decreased dramatically in solutions treated with chlorine and urea degradants however the total thm4 in samples treated with urea degradants did not change significantly due to the dramatic increase of brominated thms i e dcbm dbcm and tbm tbm formation increased from 0 86 ug l original concentration to 92 1 99 9 ug l in solutions with 32 mg l of free chlorine and urea degradant b c and concentration of bdcm and dbcm also increased significantly in solutions treated with chlorine and urea degradants figs 4a s6a and s7a indicating the enhanced incorporation of bromine into the organics a significant increase of brominated dbps of the other three group of dbps e g dbal dbcal tbal bcan dban dbaa bdcaa dbcaa and tbaa can also be observed after the addition of urea degradants the same dosage of chlorine 16 mg l was added to swimming pool water and increase of bromated dbps was much lower than urea degradant treatment sodium hypochlorite containing no bromide was used so the increased brominated dbps was associated with urea degradant addition bromide in three urea degradants were determined and high bromide was contained in urea degradants it showed that 3 mg l urea degradant a b and c contain 2125 6 1479 7 and 1612 7 μg l bromide respectively table 1 chlorination of solutions containing urea and three urea degradants was also conducted as is shown in fig s8 about 4 4 5 8 μg l tcm and 6 8 7 8 μg l tcaa were detected during the chlorination of urea and urea degradants and little brominated dbps was generated during chlorination of urea and three urea degradants compared with urea degradant a and c higher brominated thms were observed during the chlorination of urea degradant b and about 5 μg l tbm was generated brominated dbps were rarely produced when urea or urea degradant was chlorinated alone when bromide similar concentration to that of urea degradants and free chlorine were added in swimming pool water dbp formation was similar to urea degradant treatment that high bromated dbps were generated fig s9 indicating that the changes of dbp was related to bromide introduction by urea degradants as mentioned above hypochlorous acid can rapidly oxidize bromide to hypobromous acid which can react with organic matter in swimming pool water to form brominated dbps through electrophilic substitution hua et al 2006 westerhoff et al 2004 no dramatic increase in dcaa and tcaa were observed in solutions with 4 to 16 mg l of free chlorine and urea degradants dcaa increased obviously when the initial free chlorine concentration increased to 32 mg l for urea degradant b and c figs 4b s6b and s7b high chlorine addition favored the transformation from macromolecular substance to micromolecular substance westerhoff et al 2004 involving more haa precursors the formation of brominated haas was closely associated with the concentration of the added free chlorine the increase in dbcaa bdcaa tbaa was slight because these haas could form corresponding dbcm bdcm and tbm through the decarboxylation pathway zhang and minear 2002 for hals there was no significant association between hal formation and free chlorine concentration figs 4c s6c and s7c after adding 16 mg l chlorine to swimming pool water dcal increased dramatically compared to the original swimming pool water while decreased when urea degradants were added fig 4c it might have been caused by the reaction between hals and monochloramine that was formed during urea removal monochloramine could react quickly with chlorinated hals cl hals in neutral and weak alkaline conditions forming and reaching pseudo equilibrium with the carbinolamine 2 chloro 1 chloroamino ethanol which slowly dehydrated to form the imine 1 chloro 2 chloroimino ethane that decomposed at a faster rate to hans kimura et al 2013 it is speculated that the rapid decrease in urea in the presence of urea degradants caused formation of chloramine figs s3b s5b s5d mainly monochloramine in alkaline condition which facilitated the reaction between dcal tcal and monochloramine in swimming pool water monochloramine is also available in abundance range from 100 to 400 ug l carter and joll 2017 and chlorination of urea also contributes to the formation of monochloramine blatchley and cheng 2010 favoring the reactions of dcal tcal and monochloramine for hans a dramatic decrease of dcan was observed when chlorine was used alone together with the condition when chlorine and urea degradant were both used figs 4d s6d and s7d in the presence of sufficient chlorine hans would rapidly react with hypochlorite through nucleophilic attack on the nitrile carbon resulting in the formation of haas yu and reckhow 2015 and it might explain the slight increase of haas when urea degradants and chlorine were used the decrease of dcan can be explained by the enhanced conversion from chlorinated hans i e dcan to brominated hans i e bcan dban and tban dban showed tendency to increase with the increasing free chlorine concentration especially for initial free chlorine concentration of 32 mg l figs 4d s6d and s7d dban was stable under neutral ph conditions or in the presence of chlorine compared to dcan and bcan yu and reckhow 2015 resulting in more preservation tox was also determined during the urea removal process according to figs 4e s6e and s7e remarkable increase of tox was observed when urea was completely removed after treatment using urea degradant a b and c tox increased by 382 479 and 594 μg l respectively indicating the increased dbp formation according to table s7 there was no obvious increase in doc after urea degradant addition it is speculated that the reactive sites of the precursors in swimming pool water are limited and the urea removal process promoted the conversion of organic matters to chlorinated dbps and then to brominated dbps 3 4 changes in bromine incorporation factor bif bif values can be used to describe the percentage of the dbps that were partially or fully brominated chu et al 2016 high bif indicates high bromine incorporation in this research bif of thm dihaloacetaldehydes dhals trihaloacetaldehydes thals dihaloacetonitriles dhans and trihaloacetic acids thaas were calculated based on eqs 5 9 5 bif thms bdcm 2 dbcm 3 tbm tcm dbcm bdcm tbm 6 bif dhals 2 dbal dcal dbal 7 bif thals 2 dbcal 2 dbcm 3 tbal tcal dbcal tbal 8 bif dhans bcan 2 dban dcan dban bcan 9 bif thaas bdcaa 2 dbcaa 3 tbaa tcaa bdcaa dbcaa tbaa figs 4f s6f and s7f show the changes in bif after the complete urea removal using three urea degradants i e 16 mg l chlorine for urea degradant a and 32 mg l chlorine for urea degradant b and c compared with original swimming pool water the percentage increase in bif of thals was most impressive as the bif of thals for urea degradant a b and c increased by 1631 4280 and 2810 respectively compared with the solutions with chlorine alone the growth of bif for dhaas showed a marked increase of 3349 4025 and 2665 respectively bif increased with the increasing chlorine addition it is speculated that hypobromous acid formation increased with increasing chlorine addition resulting in more brominated dbp formation more macromolecular substances or intermediate substances can be oxidized into stable forms and the oxidation of bromide as well as the incorporation of hobr to organics are less limited by the concentration of free chlorine 3 5 changes of the integrated toxic risk during urea removal cytotoxicity index cti and genotoxicity index gti were introduced as a comprehensive toxicity indicator to estimate toxicity changes hu et al 2018 and the calculation formula is shown in eqs 10 and 11 the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity values were derived from plewa s in vitro toxicity test using chinese hamster ovary cells wagner and plewa 2017 10 c t i 1 c 1 2 x c x 11 g t i 1 g e n o t o x i c p o t e n c y x c x c1 2x and genotoxic potencyx expressed cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as defined elsewhere 46 cx is concentration nm 1 of each dbp x tcm dbcm dcbm tbm dcal tcal dbal dbcal tbal dcan bcan dban tban dcaa tcaa dbaa bdcaa and dbcaa fig 5 illustrates the cti and gti of swimming pool water and swimming pool water treated with three urea degradants to compare the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity risks caused by urea addition the amount of chlorine added was selected as the chlorine dosage that could remove 5 mg l urea within 6 h i e 16 mg l for urea degradant a and 32 mg l for urea degradant b and c samples treated with urea degradant a b and c were 2 9 7 4 and 7 5 more cytotoxic and 4 3 9 4 and 9 6 more genotoxic than the original swimming pool water respectively hals and hans are important cytotoxicity and genotoxicity contributors the remarkable increase of brominated dbps could be the major contributor of the high cytotoxicity and genotoxicity translating to a potentially high dbp related health risk therefore the use of urea degradants should be weighted 4 conclusions for the first time we report the use of urea degradant and the impacts of urea degradant treatment on dbp formation and dbp associated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity with the following main outcomes neither urea degradant nor chlorine alone removed urea effectively within 48 h when applied in combination urea degradant with sufficient chlorine rapidly removed urea by 100 within 3 h the formation of dbp visibly increased after urea degradant treatment especially for brominated dbps due to the introduction of bromide by urea degradant remarkable increase in bif could also be observed for instance bif of thal after applying urea degradant a b and c increased by 1631 4280 and 2810 respectively a significant increase in highly toxic bromated dbps resulting in a 2 9 7 5 fold increase in the cytotoxicity and a 4 3 9 6 fold increase in the genotoxicity respectively better managed use of urea degradants in swimming pool water should be encouraged for instance balancing urea compliance vs dbp toxicity formation techniques for urea removal without introducing other harmful substances should be developed declaration of competing interest the authors declare

pool water bernard et al 2006 compared with drinking water swimmers are exposed to dbps in more ways e g ingestion dermal absorption and inhalation carter and joll 2017 chowdhury et al 2014 cantor et al 2010 found that dermal inhalation exposure from showering bathing and swimming was a significant bladder cancer risk factor previous studies reported that serum levels of inhibin b or of total testosterone were strongly correlated with the time that adolescents had spent in chlorinated swimming pool water nickmilder and bernard 2011 in a 12 week swimming training program in rats the health training effect and metabolic status of the rats in simulated chlorinated pools were remarkablely affected li et al 2015 therefore swimming pool associated dbp exposure and the relevant potential health risk demand attention urea is abundantly present in human body fluids e g sweat and urine human epidermis and urea containing moisturizers and it has been reported that an average urine release per swimmer could be 25 77 ml de laat et al 2011b urea is considered to be the main nitrogen contaminant introduced into swimming pool water by swimmers de laat et al 2011a who 2006b surveys conducted by zhang et al 2018 showed that the concentration of urea in swimming places in beijing in china varied from 0 07 to 18 73 mg l swimming pool water is usually recycled after treatment zwiener et al 2007 however urea and dbps cannot be efficiently removed due to low molecular weight and thus accumulate in swimming pool water skibinski et al 2019 urea is an important indicator of swimming pool water quality and hygiene and is regulated at 3 5 mg l in swimming pool water in china ministry of health of the people s republic of china 2016 to meet the water quality requirements several attempts were made to control urea ultraviolet uv based technologies have been applied to remove urea long et al 2019 according to the study of kim et al 2019 photoelectrocatalysis and ozonation were able to remove 54 and 73 of urea when the initial concentration was 20 and 10 mg l in practice urea degradants currently are commonly used in swimming pool in china to control urea due to low cost and handling ease urea degradants are commercial products containing anti chlorourea oligomer activation agents e g kcl nacl kbr and nabr and water wang et al 2020 unfortunately high organic inorganic chlorine addition is required when urea degradants are used which would inevitably affect the formation of dbps urea could also be a dbp precursor especially to nitrogenous dbps n dbps richardson and ternes 2018 however detailed research into the impacts of urea degradants on the formation of the health concerning dbps and dbp associated toxicity are lacking here we reported the first comprehensive study of the use of urea degradants in swimming pool water including the effects of chlorine dosage and reaction time on urea degradation the mechanism of urea degradation using urea degradants the impacts of urea degradant treatment on dbp formation and the associated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity the results of this study could offer insights of the potential health risk during urea degradant application in swimming pool 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and samples the standards of four trihalomethanes thms and six haas were purchased as a mixture epa 501 601 thms

water for dbp occurrence occurrence of dbps were determined in six real indoor swimming pool water and source water that was used to fill swimming pools for each pool source water and pool water were all sampled swimming pools are in a city in eastern china and they are from different recreational facility the source water of all swimming pools came from municipal water supply system and chloramine was used as disinfectant swimming pool water was recycled after sand filtration in all six swimming pools fig s1 chlorine was used as disinfectant in all six pools selected dbps elaborated further below in section analytical methods dissolved organic carbon doc total nitrogen tn inorganic nitrogen i e nh4 no2 and no3 free chlorine and total chlorine were measured details about sample collection and parameter determination were provided in text s1 and table s1 swimming pool water for simulated experiments the impacts of urea degradant treatment on urea degradation and dbp formation were investigated by laboratory simulation to avoid introducing new precursors due to daily operation of the pool and one real swimming pool water swimming pool 3 that has never been treated with urea degradant was used in all simulated tests swimming pool water was freshly sampled before simulated experiments and parameters of sample used for the simulated experiments were shown in table s2 2 3 simulated urea removal processes using urea degradants batch experiments were performed in 1 l brown unsealed glass bottles using real pool water that was not treated with urea degradants as described above the reactors were kept at 25 0 1 c the original urea concentration upon collection was 3 1 mg l to maintain same original urea concentration in all experiments the initial urea concentration in the batch test was adjusted to 5 mg l by adding urea three commonly used commercial urea degradants designated as urea degradant a b and c were selected urea degradants were added at 3 mg l in all experiments according to manufacturers recipe then chlorination was conducted by adding sodium hypochlorite naclo solution the solutions were stirred by magnetic stirrers at a speed of 500 r min to simulate disturbance in swimming pool water after a reaction time of 3 6 9 12 24 and 48 h the solutions were filtered through 0 45 mm glass fiber filters for residual free chlorine total chlorine and

was measured using an ion chromatography equipped with a conductivity detector aquion dionex sunnyvale usa and a hydroxide selective analytical column as 19 4 250 mm dionex sunnyvale usa all experiments were conducted in duplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of dbps in swimming pool water and source tap water the concentrations of typical dbps in swimming pool water and the corresponding source tap water were determined swimming pool water was all recycled through a sand filtration fig s1 as is shown in fig 1 the concentration of most dbps in swimming pool water was about 1 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in source tap water thms contributed to the highest fraction of the tested dbps tcm in swimming pool waters ranged from 85 5 to 403 4 μg l with an average of 203 9 μg l for swimming pool 3 the concentration of tcm was as high as 403 4 μg l which was 891 of the tcm in the corresponding source tap water the four thms averaged 286 9 μg l in the collected swimming pool water samples the thms in this study was higher than the tested 44 indoor swimming pools in the uk where the four thms levels averaged 133 μg l chu and nieuwenhuijsen 2002 much higher thm concentration was observed in seawater sourced swimming pool waters where thms were tested from 234 to 996 μg l parinet et al 2012 a large portion of thms could evaporate into the air aggazzotti et al 1995 indicating that actual thm formation was more than the detected in swimming pool water six haas were determined in this study averaging 139 μg l wang et al found that haa levels in indoor pools in china averaged 117 ug l wang et al 2014 haas tested in this study were dramatically lower than united states swimming pool water where haas were determined at 1650 μg l maximum in an indoor swimming pool tang 2011 the hals and hans were also determined as they express higher levels of mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity compared with thms and haas dcal and tcal were the predominant fractions of hals dcal and tcal ranged from 14 2 to 45 2 and 63 2 to 125 6 μg l respectively fig 1 bromated hals were much lower dbal dbcal and tbal were less than 5 4 μg l with an average concentration of 1 6 2 0 and 0 9 μg l respectively high tcal concentration was also observed in swimming pool water in the united states where the concentration of tcal was up to 439 μg l allen et al 2021 for hans dcan and bcan are the main han components in the tested samples dcan concentration ranged from 6 7 to 25 9 μg l with an average value of 15 5 μg l bcan ranged from 2 8 to 20 8 μg l with an average concentration of 8 5 μg l the concentration of other hans dban tban and tcan was about 1 μg l brominated dbps accounted for a much higher proportion of tox in swimming pool water than that in tap water e g 31 of tap water and 41 of swimming pool water in swimming pool 3 high concentration of brominated dbps in swimming pools has also been reported before kanan et al 2015 and it may be caused by the introduction of bromide during the operation of swimming pool disinfectant tablets are usually used to disinfect swimming pool water and a previous study reported that 33 out of 40 hypochlorite feedstock solutions were positive in bromate detection owing to the high content of bromide in the raw brines employed by the manufacturers garcia villanova et al 2010 human inputs e g sweat and urine hair and other personal care products also contain bromide weisel et al 2009 hypochlorous acid hocl can rapidly oxidize bromide to hypobromous acid hobr k 1550 m s hua et al 2006 then hobr can react with organic matter to form brominated dbps through electrophilic substitution bromine substitution with nom was about an order of magnitude faster than chlorine substitution hua et al 2006 westerhoff et al 2004 resulting in the high concentration of most of the brominated dbps in swimming pool water almost all tested dbps were in highest concentration in swimming pool 3 however the dbps in tap water filling swimming pool 3 was similar to any other tap water to identify the key factor that triggered the high dbp generation water parameters and dbp concentration in swimming pool 3 was continuously monitored a remarkable increase of dbps was observed after the urea removal using urea degradant concentration of urea degradant is 3 mg l and residual free chlorine is 3 mg l after 1 h reaction and most of the dbps continued to increase for a period of time fig 2 as is shown in fig 2 tcm increased from 54 6 to 111 8 μg l after 12 h urea degradant addition and finally increased to 309 μg l in addition a rapid increase of brominated dbps was observed for instance dbaa increased from 20 1 to 68 1 μg l within 24 h and dban increased from 0 8 μg l to 35 μg l within 12 h the effect of urea degradants on the urea removal and dbp formation should be further investigated 3 2 urea removal using urea degradants three commonly used urea degradants i e urea degradant a b and c were obtained and simulated urea removal processes using urea degradants were performed according to the product manual urea degradant should be dosed in conjunction with chlorine the effect of chlorine on the removal of urea was firstly investigated as is shown in fig 3 a the concentration of urea did not change when urea degradant a was used alone the reaction between urea and chlorine was very slow and more than 50 urea remained after 48 h reaction even when up to 16 mg l of chlorine was added fig 3a this was consistent with a previous study blatchley and cheng 2010 the combined use of urea degradant a and free chlorine effectively removed urea and urea completely degraded within 3 h fig 3a similar phenomenon was observed for urea degradant b and c fig s2 the effect of chlorine dosage on urea degradation was also studied for urea degradant a as is shown in fig 3c as the chlorine dosage increased the removal percentage of urea increased the degradation rates of urea were calculated as shown in fig s3a the degradation rates were 3 1 4 9 5 5 10 5 and 18 6 µm l h of samples with 1 2 4 8 and 16 mg l free chlorine addition respectively the degradation of urea was always accompanied by the depletion of chlorine fig 3b and d the urea removal percentage slightly increased with increasing free chlorine dosage 14 20 and 27 of samples with 1 2 and 4 mg l free chlorine addition respectively owning to the lack of chlorine fig 3d the urea removal ratio increased to 54 5 and 100 when the initial free chlorine concentration increased to 8 and 16 mg l indicating the important role of free chlorine it should be noted that 0 6 h was the critical period for urea removal for solutions dosed with 16 mg l free chlorine and urea degradant a urea degradation rate reached 18 6 µm l h 0 3 h and 8 1 µm l h 3 6 h respectively however the urea removal rate dropped to below 0 4 µm l h after 6 h due to the lack of free chlorine fig s3a compared with urea degradant a the free chlorine demand for complete urea removal within 48 h increased from 16 to 32 mg l for urea degradant b and c fig s4a and s4c for solutions dosed with urea degradant b urea decayed at a rate of 3 5 3 8 5 6 13 4 11 4 and 20 5 µm l h for solutions dosed with 1 2 4 8 16 and 32 mg l free chlorine during the first 3 h fig s5a and the urea removal slowed down after 3 h the similar trend was observed with urea degradant c fig s5 similar to urea degradant a urea removal rates of solutions dosed with urea degradant b c and 1 2 and 4 mg l of free chlorine were low fig s5 while the urea removal sped up markedly when the free chlorine concentration increased to 8 16 and 32 mg l urea degradants have been reported to include anti chlorourea oligomer activation agents e g kcl nacl kbr and nabr and water wang et al 2020 anti chlorourea oligomer as doc bromide and chloride of three urea degradants were determined table 1 the exact mechanism of urea degradation has not been reported due to commercial confidentiality urea tn no3 nh4 free chlorine and combined chlorine in ultrapure water were monitored after urea degradant treatment table 2 tn decreased dramatically table 2 and no3 and combined chlorine were much lower than that chlorine was used alone table 2 indicating that urea was transferred to gaseous substances and was discharged from the water it has been reported that the chlorination of urea led to increase in ncl3 according to reaction 1 and nitrate could also be formed through reaction 2 n2o could also be formed at a slow rate reactions 3 and 4 blatchley and cheng 2010 the rapid decrease of urea in the presence of urea degradant should be caused by accelerated reaction 3 and 4 little chloride is contained in urea degradants table 1 three urea degradants contain 1479 7 2125 6 μg l bromide table 1 however bromide had little effect on urea degradation fig 3a therefore anti chlorourea oligomer in urea degradant was the main contributor that promoted the reaction 3 and 4 and the final product was n2o high chlorine demand and reduced tn indirectly support this inference table 2 1 co n h 2 2 hocl h c l c o 2 nc l 3 ncl 2 nc l 3 hocl 2 h 2 o no 3 4 c l 5 h 3 ncl o h noh c l 4 2 noh h 2 n 2 o 2 n 2 o h 2 o with the same free chlorine concentration of 16 mg l removal percentage of urea after 3 h dropped from 100 to 67 when the water changed from ultrapure water to swimming pool water fig 3a and c the chlorine demand increased dramatically fig 3b and d indicating that there were various chlorine reactive substances in actual swimming pool water that consumed chlorine in a study by lee and westerhoff 2009 chlorination of nom isolates produced maximum concentrations of organic chloramines e g n chloramines n chloramino acids n chloraldimines and n chloramides within 10 min and then the organic chloramines degraded to numerous dbps how et al 2017 it showed that combined chlorine increased in the first 3 h and gradually decreased thereafter fig s3b it is hypothesized that a large amount of combined chlorine formed rapidly within 0 3 h due to the reaction between free chlorine and chlorine reactive substances in swimming pool water and then transformed into other dbps as time passed therefore dbp formation would be affected after urea degradant addition 3 3 the impacts of urea degradant treatment on dbp formation the variation of dbp formation of swimming pool water treated by three urea degradants were investigated as is shown in figs 4 a s6a and s7a the concentrations of tcm decreased dramatically in solutions treated with chlorine and urea degradants however the total thm4 in samples treated with urea degradants did not change significantly due to the dramatic increase of brominated thms i e dcbm dbcm and tbm tbm formation increased from 0 86 ug l original concentration to 92 1 99 9 ug l in solutions with 32 mg l of free chlorine and urea degradant b c and concentration of bdcm and dbcm also increased significantly in solutions treated with chlorine and urea degradants figs 4a s6a and s7a indicating the enhanced incorporation of bromine into the organics a significant increase of brominated dbps of the other three group of dbps e g dbal dbcal tbal bcan dban dbaa bdcaa dbcaa and tbaa can also be observed after the addition of urea degradants the same dosage of chlorine 16 mg l was added to swimming pool water and increase of bromated dbps was much lower than urea degradant treatment sodium hypochlorite containing no bromide was used so the increased brominated dbps was associated with urea degradant addition bromide in three urea degradants were determined and high bromide was contained in urea degradants it showed that 3 mg l urea degradant a b and c contain 2125 6 1479 7 and 1612 7 μg l bromide respectively table 1 chlorination of solutions containing urea and three urea degradants was also conducted as is shown in fig s8 about 4 4 5 8 μg l tcm and 6 8 7 8 μg l tcaa were detected during the chlorination of urea and urea degradants and little brominated dbps was generated during chlorination of urea and three urea degradants compared with urea degradant a and c higher brominated thms were observed during the chlorination of urea degradant b and about 5 μg l tbm was generated brominated dbps were rarely produced when urea or urea degradant was chlorinated alone when bromide similar concentration to that of urea degradants and free chlorine were added in swimming pool water dbp formation was similar to urea degradant treatment that high bromated dbps were generated fig s9 indicating that the changes of dbp was related to bromide introduction by urea degradants as mentioned above hypochlorous acid can rapidly oxidize bromide to hypobromous acid which can react with organic matter in swimming pool water to form brominated dbps through electrophilic substitution hua et al 2006 westerhoff et al 2004 no dramatic increase in dcaa and tcaa were observed in solutions with 4 to 16 mg l of free chlorine and urea degradants dcaa increased obviously when the initial free chlorine concentration increased to 32 mg l for urea degradant b and c figs 4b s6b and s7b high chlorine addition favored the transformation from macromolecular substance to micromolecular substance westerhoff et al 2004 involving more haa precursors the formation of brominated haas was closely associated with the concentration of the added free chlorine the increase in dbcaa bdcaa tbaa was slight because these haas could form corresponding dbcm bdcm and tbm through the decarboxylation pathway zhang and minear 2002 for hals there was no significant association between hal formation and free chlorine concentration figs 4c s6c and s7c after adding 16 mg l chlorine to swimming pool water dcal increased dramatically compared to the original swimming pool water while decreased when urea degradants were added fig 4c it might have been caused by the reaction between hals and monochloramine that was formed during urea removal monochloramine could react quickly with chlorinated hals cl hals in neutral and weak alkaline conditions forming and reaching pseudo equilibrium with the carbinolamine 2 chloro 1 chloroamino ethanol which slowly dehydrated to form the imine 1 chloro 2 chloroimino ethane that decomposed at a faster rate to hans kimura et al 2013 it is speculated that the rapid decrease in urea in the presence of urea degradants caused formation of chloramine figs s3b s5b s5d mainly monochloramine in alkaline condition which facilitated the reaction between dcal tcal and monochloramine in swimming pool water monochloramine is also available in abundance range from 100 to 400 ug l carter and joll 2017 and chlorination of urea also contributes to the formation of monochloramine blatchley and cheng 2010 favoring the reactions of dcal tcal and monochloramine for hans a dramatic decrease of dcan was observed when chlorine was used alone together with the condition when chlorine and urea degradant were both used figs 4d s6d and s7d in the presence of sufficient chlorine hans would rapidly react with hypochlorite through nucleophilic attack on the nitrile carbon resulting in the formation of haas yu and reckhow 2015 and it might explain the slight increase of haas when urea degradants and chlorine were used the decrease of dcan can be explained by the enhanced conversion from chlorinated hans i e dcan to brominated hans i e bcan dban and tban dban showed tendency to increase with the increasing free chlorine concentration especially for initial free chlorine concentration of 32 mg l figs 4d s6d and s7d dban was stable under neutral ph conditions or in the presence of chlorine compared to dcan and bcan yu and reckhow 2015 resulting in more preservation tox was also determined during the urea removal process according to figs 4e s6e and s7e remarkable increase of tox was observed when urea was completely removed after treatment using urea degradant a b and c tox increased by 382 479 and 594 μg l respectively indicating the increased dbp formation according to table s7 there was no obvious increase in doc after urea degradant addition it is speculated that the reactive sites of the precursors in swimming pool water are limited and the urea removal process promoted the conversion of organic matters to chlorinated dbps and then to brominated dbps 3 4 changes in bromine incorporation factor bif bif values can be used to describe the percentage of the dbps that were partially or fully brominated chu et al 2016 high bif indicates high bromine incorporation in this research bif of thm dihaloacetaldehydes dhals trihaloacetaldehydes thals dihaloacetonitriles dhans and trihaloacetic acids thaas were calculated based on eqs 5 9 5 bif thms bdcm 2 dbcm 3 tbm tcm dbcm bdcm tbm 6 bif dhals 2 dbal dcal dbal 7 bif thals 2 dbcal 2 dbcm 3 tbal tcal dbcal tbal 8 bif dhans bcan 2 dban dcan dban bcan 9 bif thaas bdcaa 2 dbcaa 3 tbaa tcaa bdcaa dbcaa tbaa figs 4f s6f and s7f show the changes in bif after the complete urea removal using three urea degradants i e 16 mg l chlorine for urea degradant a and 32 mg l chlorine for urea degradant b and c compared with original swimming pool water the percentage increase in bif of thals was most impressive as the bif of thals for urea degradant a b and c increased by 1631 4280 and 2810 respectively compared with the solutions with chlorine alone the growth of bif for dhaas showed a marked increase of 3349 4025 and 2665 respectively bif increased with the increasing chlorine addition it is speculated that hypobromous acid formation increased with increasing chlorine addition resulting in more brominated dbp formation more macromolecular substances or intermediate substances can be oxidized into stable forms and the oxidation of bromide as well as the incorporation of hobr to organics are less limited by the concentration of free chlorine 3 5 changes of the integrated toxic risk during urea removal cytotoxicity index cti and genotoxicity index gti were introduced as a comprehensive toxicity indicator to estimate toxicity changes hu et al 2018 and the calculation formula is shown in eqs 10 and 11 the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity values were derived from plewa s in vitro toxicity test using chinese hamster ovary cells wagner and plewa 2017 10 c t i 1 c 1 2 x c x 11 g t i 1 g e n o t o x i c p o t e n c y x c x c1 2x and genotoxic potencyx expressed cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as defined elsewhere 46 cx is concentration nm 1 of each dbp x tcm dbcm dcbm tbm dcal tcal dbal dbcal tbal dcan bcan dban tban dcaa tcaa dbaa bdcaa and dbcaa fig 5 illustrates the cti and gti of swimming pool water and swimming pool water treated with three urea degradants to compare the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity risks caused by urea addition the amount of chlorine added was selected as the chlorine dosage that could remove 5 mg l urea within 6 h i e 16 mg l for urea degradant a and 32 mg l for urea degradant b and c samples treated with urea degradant a b and c were 2 9 7 4 and 7 5 more cytotoxic and 4 3 9 4 and 9 6 more genotoxic than the original swimming pool water respectively hals and hans are important cytotoxicity and genotoxicity contributors the remarkable increase of brominated dbps could be the major contributor of the high cytotoxicity and genotoxicity translating to a potentially high dbp related health risk therefore the use of urea degradants should be weighted 4 conclusions for the first time we report the use of urea degradant and the impacts of urea degradant treatment on dbp formation and dbp associated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity with the following main outcomes neither urea degradant nor chlorine alone removed urea effectively within 48 h when applied in combination urea degradant with sufficient chlorine rapidly removed urea by 100 within 3 h the formation of dbp visibly increased after urea degradant treatment especially for brominated dbps due to the introduction of bromide by urea degradant remarkable increase in bif could also be observed for instance bif of thal after applying urea degradant a b and c increased by 1631 4280 and 2810 respectively a significant increase in highly toxic bromated dbps resulting in a 2 9 7 5 fold increase in the cytotoxicity and a 4 3 9 6 fold increase in the genotoxicity respectively better managed use of urea degradants in swimming pool water should be encouraged for instance balancing urea compliance vs dbp toxicity formation techniques for urea removal without introducing other harmful substances should be developed declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15591,the use of mathematical models is a well established procedure in the field of waste water engineering to virtually evaluate the feasibility of novel process modifications in this way only options with the highest chance of success are further developed to be implemented at full scale while less interesting proposals can be disregarded at an early stage nevertheless there is still lack of studies where different plant wide model predictions effluent quality process economics and technical aspects are comprehensibly verified in the field with full scale data in this work a set of analysis evaluation tools are used to assess alternative retrofitting options in the largest industrial wastewater treatment plant in northern europe a mechanistic mathematical model is simulated to reproduce process behavior deviation 11 multiple criteria are defined and verified with plant data deviation 5 the feasibility of three types of scenarios is tested 1 stream refluxing 2 change of operational conditions and 3 the implementation of new technologies experimental measurements and computer simulations show that the current plant s main revenues are obtained from the electricity produced by the biogas engine 54 and sales of the inactivated bio solids for off site biogas production 33 the main expenditures are the discharge fee 39 and transportation and handling of bio solids 30 selective treatment of bio solid streams strongly modifies the fate of cod and n compounds within the plant in addition it increases revenues 3 reduces cost 9 and liberates capacity in both activated sludge 25 and inactivation reactors 50 better management of the buffer tank promotes heterotrophic denitrification instead of dissimilatory nitrate conversion to ammonia in this way 11 of the incoming nitrogen is removed within the anaerobic water line and does not overload the activated sludge reactors only a marginal increase in process performance is achieved when the anaerobic granular sludge reactor operates at full capacity the latter reveals that influent biodegradability is the main limiting factor rather than volume usage of either naoh or heat instead of cao as inactivation agents allows anaerobic treatment of the reject water which substantially benefits revenues derived from higher electricity recovery 44 however there is a high toll paid on chemicals 73

inactivation step implies the hydrolysis of the particulate material liberating soluble cod and n that need to be removed the inactivated bio solids proceed to the dewatering station resulting in two streams dewatered cake which is used as feedstock by an off site biogas facility and reject water which can be sent to either the anaerobic or the aerobic water lines a non dewatered fraction of the inactivated bio solids is used to dilute the dewatered cake to facilitate handling at the external biogas facility more specifically a dilution to approx 15 dw in the influent stream to the biogas

statistical methods used for data treatment can be found in both monje et al 2022 and supplemental information table s2 the pwm approach developed for this study is based on the following blocks 1 biological 2 physico chemical 3 interfaces 4 fractionation model and 5 ancillary elements the biological models comprise an anaerobic digestion model adm and an activated sludge model asm the adm batstone et al 2002 solon et al 2017 is used to describe influent conditions and the following reactors buffer tank for liquids the pre acidification tank anaerobic granular sludge reactors and the inactivation tanks the asm henze et al 2002 flores alsina et al 2019 describes the aerobic anoxic reactors a comprehensive description of the model with verified continuity can be found in supplemental information see excel file with the verified continuity the physico chemical model pcm includes an aqueous phase precipitation model and a gas transfer model the model interfaces include an adm asm adm interface and pcm adm asm interface flores alsina et al 2016 prim sec flot and dew are described as ideal splitters jeppsson et al 2007 the model is adjusted to reflect the experiments carried out by ekama and wentzel 2004 where organic and inorganic compounds show different settling velocities separation efficiencies btl is modelled assuming that there is 1 3 of biomass accumulation in the total volume the angsr model considers both reactor hydraulics and biofilm growth the multi scale approach presented by feldman et al 2017 is used to predict the behaviour of both units the mass balance assumes that the transport of soluble compounds is governed solely by homogenous diffusion whereas movement of particulate compounds takes place by convection saravanan and sreekrishnan 2006 biofilm thickness l is given as the radial distance z and varies due to two phenomena 1 the net growth of the particulate species and 2 detachment from the biofilm surface lackner et al 2008 the resulting system of partial differential equations pdes is solved using the method of lines press et al 2007 pat asr it are described as a series of continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs influent fractionation is based on the principles presented in feldman et al 2017 and monje et al 2021 2022 essentially adm states were estimated by assuming 1 degree of cod biodegradability in both codsol and codpart 2 degree of acidification in codsol 3 fraction of ethanol hence it is possible to determine soluble si and particulate xi inerts acetate sac and ethanol set once this is established lipids xli proteins xprot and amino acids saa are estimated using p and n standard content of the aforementioned compounds since the influent wastewater is coming from the fermentation industry sugars ssu 0 and carbohydrates xch 0 should not be present consumed upstream the quantity of p not associated with organics is assumed to be inorganic and precipitated calcium phosphate xca p any remaining of particulate ca and mg is assumed to be in form of carbonate salt xcaco3 xmgco3 the influent inorganics xiss0 are determined using the tss vss ratio minus explicitly represented precipitates 2 2

carried out using reconciled data and model predictions see section 2 2 2 3 economic indicators economic evaluation criteria are divided between income and expenditure indicators on the one hand income includes 1 energy recovery er and 2 mass of bio solids mbiosolids er is comprised of electricity erelectricity and heat erheat erelectricity is consumed within the factory a fraction of erheat is used to reach mesophilic conditions in the heat exchangers prior to the angsr erheat process see flow diagram fig 1 there is another fraction sold for internal use erheat sold mbiosolids are further processed into an external biogas plant also collecting streams from other factories within the same industrial cluster on the other hand expenditure accounts for 1 volume of treated water released to the sewer network veffluent 2 volume of bio solids having to be handled and transported vbiosolids 3 quantity of dosed chemicals chem and 4 energy use eu more specifically dosed chemicals chem account for sodium hydroxide naoh poly aluminium chloride pac iron sulphate fe iii and lime cao see specific dosing points in fig 1 energy usage eu includes aeration euaeration and pumping eupumping in different plant locations activated sludge reactor eupumping asr anaerobic granular sludge reactor eupumping angsr influent biomass stream eupumping sbm and reject water stream eupumping dew er eu chem vbiosolids and veffluent are available as on line data and were retrieved from the supervisory control and data acquisition system which receives the signals from flow meters biogas engine pumps and blowers experimental measurements are combined with on line data to estimate mbiosolids the economic quantification was based on different model outputs er is calculated by applying the energy content 50 mj kg ch4 to the predicted methane gas flow rate a 40 and 42 gas engine efficiency for electricity erelectricity and heat erheat total generation is assumed mbiosolids is the cod load of the dewatering underflow dewunder and the non dewatered liquor of the inactivation tank iteff ext vbiosolids and veffluent are predicted using the hydraulic model the quantity of dosed chemicals was always set on a flow proportional basis with the exception of the cao in the inactivation tanks where it was done based on the demand of the chemical to reach the desired ph set point eaeration is based on the oxygen uptake rate using 1 6 kwh kg o2 as conversion factor eupumping is calculated by multiplying the volumetric flow of the stream by appropriate weighting factors that take into account pump efficiency and hydrostatic pressure once income and expenditures are quantified plant data model predictions revenues rev and costs cost can be estimated based on prices from literature a comprehensive list of literature estimates of prices can be found in supplemental information table s3 hence it is possible to estimate specific revenues from energy recovery revelectricity revheat and off site treatment of produced bio solids revbiosolids when it comes to expenditures these are classified into transportation costtransport and use of chemicals costchem and energy costenergy a special case is the discharge fee costdischarge which is applied upon volumetric flow based on data quality from the previous year 2 4 technical indicators in addition the analysis includes the assumed capacity for three critical units angsr asr and it in case a given scenario requires less reactor volume to maintain the same hydraulic retention time hrt a certain degree of capacity liberation is obtained this means that the plant would have extra processing capacity allowing for more treatment duty or milder operation conditions the cod n ratios the sludge retention time srt and the quantity of inorganics vss tss in both activated sludge and dewatered cake are also quantified using plant measurements and model predictions 2 5 environmental indicators environmental indicators are derived from life cycle impact assessment lcia carried out to compare different operational strategies and evaluate improvement potentials of the iwts installations for this purpose endpoint impact indicators are used also referred to as characterization factors at endpoint level cf those indicate potential environmental damage per unit of stressor e g per kg of resource used or emission released to either 1 human health hh represented by disability adjusted loss of life years daly in yr and or 2 ecosystems quality eq represented by time integrated species loss in species yr or 3 resource scarcity rs represented by surplus cost in usd2013 contributions from different emissions and resource use each contributing to one or more environmental problems in lcia referred to as midpoint impact categories like global warming or freshwater eutrophication etc are aggregated based on their potential to cause damage to the three endpoints all 20 midpoint environmental impact categories included in the recipe 2016 lcia methodology v1 1 were considered for the calculation of final damage scores huijbregts et al 2017 the lcia followed the european union commission s international life cycle data system ilcd guideline in line with iso 14040 14044 standards european commission joint research center 2010 as the lcia is used to quantify environmental impacts which can be attributed to the life cycle of the iwts systems the study is considered a micro level decision support type a thus the assessment applies an attributional approach to modelling life cycle inventories consistently with ilcd recommendations for this modelling framework system expansion is the preferred way of solving multifunctionality provided that subdivision is not possible and average market consumption mixes and average processes are preferred over marginal processes bjørn et al 2017 this implies that co generation of heat and power from biogas replaces heat and electricity according to the current mixes in denmark and that sludge replaces nitrogen n and phosphorus p fertilizers produced using a global market average the functional unit which ensures equivalence between all the compared systems was defined as treatment of 1 m3 of an average industrial wastewater representing 5 process waste water influents and 1 high solid content stream coming from biotech enzyme and pharma industry the product systems were modelled in simapro version 9 2 0 2 pré consultants bv the netherlands data for foreground processes like chemical and energy inputs for the iwts plant are based on modelled values in this study data for generic processes such as electricity production are based on those available in the ecoinvent database version 3 7 1 wernet et al 2016 treatment of iwts effluent in a municipal wastewater treatment plant is modelled using an adapted process taken from ecoinvent ecoinvent is currently one of the most comprehensive databases of life cycle inventories i e aggregates of resource consumptions and pollutant emissions for specific processes taken from their life cycle perspective details of unit processes are presented in supplemental information 2 6 scenario analysis different optimization scenarios are considered in this work and a summary can be found in table 1 the scenarios are evaluated following three principles 1 refluxing 2 change of operational conditions and 3 implementation of new technologies the first consists of redirecting a certain stream or part of it to a different unit it is the simplest strategy and requires the lowest degree of extrapolation since it only implies a decrease in load towards a certain unit and an increase towards another the second principle implies that a certain unit works under different process variables but following the same fundamental principle in these strategies the same performance as in the original has been assumed the last set of scenarios implies a complete change of the layout in the sense that new technology units are added it implies the highest degree of extrapolation and similar performance compared to literature values has been assumed a simplified graphical representation of the current mode of operation fig s1 and the defined scenarios figs s2 s8 can be found in supplemental information 3 technical and economical analysis 3 1 baseline scenario measurements vs model table 2 summarizes the fate of cod n and p with the plant under study it is important to mention that the proposed approach shows remarkable prediction capabilities average deviation between measurements and simulations is 5 plant data indicate that for the incoming cod 32 is recovered as energy in the anaerobic granular sludge reactor angsr 23 is removed in the activated sludge reactor asr 32 is captured within the bio solids cake stream iteff ext dewunder 12 is lost during the fermentation process in the buffer btl and pre acidification tanks pat and 1 leaves the plant via the effluent iwtseff with respect to n 65 is removed in the asr 33 is captured in the bio solids cake stream iteff ext dewunder and 2 ends up in the effluent iwtseff finally when it comes to p 2 leaves the plant via the effluent iwtseff and 98 is accumulated in the bio solids stream iteff ext dewunder as a result of precipitation additional simulations reveal that the average deviation between measurements and model simulations for q compounds cod n p s na k ca mg al ph vss tss ratio at different plant locations is 11 see figs s9 s10 and table s4 in supplemental information the measured simulated values for all defined economic indicators income expenditures can be found in table 3 regarding economy plant data correspond to price estimations based on literature data table s3 again a low deviation between estimated plant economics and model predictions demonstrates that the model is well suited to estimate both cost 2 2 and revenues 2 0 calculations reveal that the highest source of revenue comes from electricity production in the biogas engine revelectricity and the external processing of bio solids revbiosolids with a contribution of 54 and 33 respectively heat sold revheat sold is the smallest source of income making up 13 with respect to costs the main contribution are the discharge fee costdischarge 39 transportation and handling of bio solids costbiosolids 30 dosed chemicals costchem 18 and power consumption costaeration costpumping 13 the ratio revenue total cost is 0 41 the daily difference revtotal costtotal is 16289 day when extrapolated for a year this corresponds to 5 95 million euros a condensed version only with simulated values can be found in table 4 with respect to capacity data table 5 both asr and inactivation tank it are assumed to operate at 100 of capacity nevertheless the angsr is assumed to be underperforming see table 5 the average deviation between measurements and simulations for the remaining technical criteria see table 6 is 6 5 the cod n in the input of the activated sludge reactor asr and sludge retention time srt is higher than 7 which indicates good potential nitrification denitrification conditions the low vss tss ratios in both activated sludge reactor asr and dewatering underflow dewunder indicate the important role of precipitates within the system under investigation see table 6 3 2 refluxing in solids line s1 3 2 1 rationale assumed simulation conditions this scenario is focused on modifications affecting the bio solids processing line the main function of this section of the plant is to effectively inactivate 1 spent biomass sbm from upstream production and 2 waste activated sludge secwas generated within the water line see fig 1 s1 departs from the knowledge that due to production features 1 3 of the production biomass stream sbm can be inactivated partly in a high solids form and be sent directly to the off site biogas facility the remaining 2 3 follow a normal inactivation step in addition the waste activated sludge stream secwas by passes the inactivation tank it and is sent directly to the dewatering units dew this is possible because the stream does not contain genetically modified microorganisms and therefore its inactivation before leaving the production site is not required european parliament and the council 2009 the inactivation process hydrolyzes particulate cod and n where a lower amount of treated biomass will reduce the amount of hydrolyzed material thus reducing the global load of pollutants that the plant has to remove a schematic representation can be found in supplemental information fig s2 s1 is formulated assuming a 50 and 75 use of the total inactivation tanks and activated sludge reactors volume see table 5 the first reduction is based on the fact that lower flow and mass loads will arrive to the it the second reduction is due to a potential decrease of returning loads via reject water in order to make a fair comparison the sludge retention time in the asr is set to be constant as in s0 by controlling the flow rate of the waste activated sludge stream secwas see table 6 the flow of it liquor directly sent to the biogas facility iteff ext is also manipulated to maintain an overall solids concentration leaving the plant of 15 average iteff ext and dewunder this applies to all the evaluated scenarios in this study s1 s7 3 2 2 model predictions simulations show that potential implementation of s1 will change the cod distribution within the plant see table 2 hence instead of being removed aerobically anoxically in the asr cod will be accumulated in the bio solids from 31 up to 37 this is mainly due to a lower degree of particulate solubilization in the it and therefore lower loads returning via reject water dewover this scenario leaves the anaerobic water line of the plant unaltered with respect to the baseline scenario thus no changes in cod recovery or loss are predicted similar to cod a higher n accumulation in the bio solids is predicted from 34 up to 38 see table 2 nevertheless there is an increased quantity of nitrogen leaving with the effluent from 2 to 3 this is caused by the modified c n ratio at the influent see table 6 which decreases the availability of electron donor for denitrification and the overall nitrogen removal moreover the assumed shorter retention time contributes to a lower n removal efficiency p removal is also suffering from a shorter retention time in the asr p in the effluent increased from 2 to 7 where the flow proportional dosage does not seem to be enough to achieve the previous precipitation levels cod redistribution has important implication on plant economic indicators see table 4 with respect to revenues it increases the income from sales of bio solids up to 10 revbiosolids which leads to an increase of revtotal by three percentage points regarding expenses the model forecasts that s1 will substantially decrease the use of lime by half which translates into 19 in chemical costs costchem less usage of cao reduces the quantity of inorganics present in the cake which also contributes to lower bio solids handling and transportation costs 17 costtransport this is also reflected in the vss tss ratio in dewunder see table 6 in addition savings in energy utilization due to a lower oxygen demand in the asr could be expected 4 costenergy there is no impact on the effluent discharge fee costdischarge the total decrease on expenditures costtotal is 9 based on a yearly extrapolation the potential implementation of s1 would save 1 1 m year 3 3 improved operation in anaerobic line s2 s3 3 3 1 rationale assumed simulation conditions two sets of scenarios are evaluated under this category previous investigation revealed that the tss accumulation together with the high cod n ratio 17 promoted dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra monje et al 2022 microbes undertaking dnra oxidize organic matter and use nitrate all the way to ammonium no3 no2 nh4 kraft et al 2011 data showed a reduction of nox in the liquids buffer tank btl but the total nitrogen values are maintained see figs s9 and s10 in supplemental information the dnra activity represents a loss of valuable cod that could be recovered plus an extra nh4 load that will need to be treated in the asr in s2 a better management of the btl is assumed to stop all biological activity in this unit and a promotion of complete heterotrophic denitrification inside the pre acidification tank pat this is achieved by 1 increasing the quantity of ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho being recycled from the activated sludge reactor asr to the pat and 2 adjusting the operation hrt in s3 the plant is simulated assuming that the anaerobic granular sludge reactor angsr capacity can be increased see table 5 these new scenarios build on the results obtained from s1 a schematic representation can be found in supplemental information figs s3 and s4 3 3 2 model predictions from the results summarized in table 2 one may see an increase in cod recovery when btl is assumed non reactive from 32 to 33 this is mainly due to a reduction of the cod losses in the btl 5 of the total influent load previous studies reported that 68 of the lost cod is attributed to fermentation processes and consequently production of h2 while the remaining 32 goes to n reduction monje et al 2022 only a small increase in cod recovery is predicted when the angsr is operated at full capacity s3 from 33 to 34 this indicates that the influent biodegradability is the limiting factor rather than reactor volume another important factor is that n removal is distributed in both pre acidification tank pat 11 and asr 38 instead of solely being handled in the asr in s0 s1 finally it should be mentioned that these changes alter again the c n ratio at the inlet of the asr and improve the denitrification efficiency it is important to highlight the negative effect of s2 and s3 on the overall p removal efficiency up to 14 ends up in the effluent this is mainly caused by an increased p load entering the asr indeed when btl was assumed to be reactive a large fraction of p was originally precipitated and removed in the prim but now it is sent to the anaerobic pat angsr and then to the aerobic line asr sec flot under the new circumstances the flow proportional dosage of pac is not suitable and should be modified and or adapted both s2 and s3 slightly increase the energy recovery revenues revelectricity since higher conversions are achieved within the angsr 6 and 8 respectively see values in table 4 the latter has a small effect on the income from off site treatment of bio solids from 10 in s1 to 9 and 8 in s2 and s3 respectively revbiosolids this is attributed to the fact that the organics are recovered in site and there is no need to transport them to an external facility this has an impact on the total revenues revtot i e it increased by three percentage points compared to s1 and up to seven respect to s0 the redistribution of n removal between the pat and the asr decreases the energy requirements down to 7 costenergy particularly due to aeration however it is poorly reflected in the total cost costtotal there is no impact on effluent discharge fee costdischarge and cost of chemicals costchem nevertheless a higher dosage of pac would be required to handle the extra p arriving via the anaerobic reactor as done in section 3 2 2 based on a yearly extrapolation the potential implementation of these two scenarios s2 and s3 would save 1 2 and 1 3 m year respectively 3 4 change of inactivation agent s4 s6 3 4 1 rationale assumed simulation conditions in this set of scenarios the premise departs from the replacement of inactivation agent from cao to naoh s4 or heat s6 this modification would allow the anaerobic treatment of reject water since the absence of calcium would not compromise the long term operation of the anaerobic granular sludge reactors angsr due to intra granular precipitation and sludge blanket cementation this fact was extensively tested in previous experimental and modelling studies by feldman et al 2017 2019 in this way the cod rich reject water stream can be processed anaerobically yielding a significant increase in biogas production and removing this duty from the activated sludge units in s4 alkaline inactivation is considered using a 25 naoh solution to reach the same ph as in s0 12 in s6 thermal inactivation is considered assuming a 20 c difference in temperature between inactivation influent and effluent this temperature gradient together with the assumption that the sbm stream has the same specific heat as water and the hydraulic flow rate were used to calculate the heat demand of the thermal inactivation the necessary heat is sourced directly from the waste heat produced in the biogas engine plus a fraction of the heat that now is sold as district heating the hydrolysis kinetics of particulate material are assumed to remain the same as in s0 all the other plant wide model parameters have been kept constant a schematic representation can be found in supplemental information figs s5 and s7 3 4 2 model predictions the reject water stream is highly loaded in cod and n when treated anaerobically an increase in the recovered cod is achieved from 34 in s3 to 45 in both s4 and s6 see values in table 2 hence the higher flux of cod towards biogas makes a lower aerobic cod oxidation contribution from 18 in s3 to 13 and 12 in s4 and s6 and less production of bio solids from 36 in s3 to 30 in both s4 and s6 n distribution suffers from a more negative impact these differences are attributed to the fact that s4 and s6 fail to complete nox denitrification due to insufficient carbon source availability see cod n ratio in table 6 as a result the n in the effluent increases up to 11 the situation with p is not good either as up to 75 of p remains in the effluent again the flow proportional strategy is not suitable to dose al and there is not enough precipitation and consequently removal in terms of economy see table 4 the model predicts an electricity generation increase up to 45 revelectricity s4 and s6 in s4 the utilization of naoh increases the expenditures for chemicals 73 costchem whereas in s6 the substitution of the chemical inactivation by a physical method lowers chemical costs down to 53 costchem however the higher heat demand in s6 causes a decrease in the availability of heat that can be sold as district heating by 19 revheat the higher cod recovery in the angsr leaves less electrons for biomass formation in the asr thus leading to a decrease of 11 in the income from bio solids off site treatment revbiosolids interestingly the lower bio solids production in s4 and s6 is counterbalanced by a strong decrease in the transportation cost 44 costtransport the lower level of precipitated material in the dewatering underflow stream see vss tss ratio in dewunder table 6 pronounces this finally it is important to mention the substantial reduction of the energy consumption up to 26 with respect to the baseline scenario costenergy this is attributed to the increased anaerobic treatment of incoming cod where less oxygen and consequently aeration energy is required there is no impact on the effluent discharge fee costdischarge in global terms s4 and s6 increase substantially the total revenues derived from the process 17 however with substantial differences when it comes to the cost to achieve it 2 and 27 of costtotal reduction with respect to s0 as done in section 3 2 2 based on a yearly extrapolation the potential implementation of these two scenarios s4 and s6 would save 1 1 and 3 4 m year respectively 3 5 partial nitration anammox and in situ feedback metal addition s5 s7 3 5 1 rationale assumed simulation conditions in the last scenarios the problem with poor n and p removal is tackled by 1 adding a partial nitration anammox pn anx unit and 2 implementing an improved pac dosage strategy based on an in situ feedback control loop for these scenarios four out of the seven original aerobic tanks are operated as high rate activated sludge reactors hasr and function as pre treatment previous studies have shown that pre treatment prior to pn anx reactors increases cod h2s oxidation ch4 co2 stripping precipitation removal and the ph flores alsina et al 2019 the presence of h2s may be critical due to it being a strong inhibitor for ammonium oxidizing organisms aob and favoring of sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob instead of anammox anx organisms when competing for electrons acceptors no2 then a new aerobic granular sludge reactor aegsr is set in place for autotrophic nitrogen removal the remaining three tanks stay as asr and receive a fraction of the concentrated ethanol stream pww5 that provides the cod for denitrification and achieving a final polish the idea behind the p controller based on pac addition can be found in ingildsen and wendelboe 2003 where phosphate sensors are located at the end of the flocculation activated sludge section to provide a feedback signal to the chemical dosage equipment to achieve a certain effluent phosphate set point the aegsr in s5 and s7 is modelled by assuming one single cstr and one single granule size zmax type additional information can be found in vangsgaard et al 2012 and flores alsina et al 2019 the exact same strategy as described in section 2 2 predicts competition for substrate space within the biofilm by the different microorganisms accounted for by the asm an ideal separator sep avoids that the granules leave the aegsr the operational do concentration within the reactor is 0 5 g m3 biofilm thickness is 1 mm and density is 50 000 g m3 the ratio between vbulk vtot is 0 8 concerning the p control an ideal sensor is located at the end of the pre and post treatment the control algorithm is proportional integral pi measured variables are phosphate values in both reactors control variables are the quantity of pac two dosage points are assumed pre and post treatment set point values are 5 and 2 g m3 respectively a schematic representation can be found in supplemental information figs s6 and s8 3 5 2 model predictions the implementation of pn anx and the improved p controller has important implications from a process point of view the lower yields of anx bacteria substantially reduces the quantity of cod accumulated in the cake this reduces the quantity of cod in reject water and consequently results in lower methane levels in the angsr from 45 in s4 s6 to 44 in s5 s7 n removal is substantially increased from 42 in s4 s6 to 52 in s5 s7 this is mainly due to a more effective reduction of nox to n2 since it is done autotrophically and it is no longer dependent of the presence of organics similar improvements can be seen in p removal where the new strategy ensures suitable pac dosage to reach the desired p levels i e p accumulated in bio solids is increased up to 98 as a result the quantity of n and p leaving the plant is back at the desired levels of 2 for both s5 and s7 see table 2 there are several impacts from a process economics point of view first partial nitration requires a much lower quantity of oxygen since nhx does not have to be oxidized all the way to no3 instead conversion stops at no2 as a result energy consumption costenergy is drastically reduced by 44 compared to the baseline scenario s0 second anx requires that only half of the nhx is oxidized in order to remove the incoming n load the lower yield of anx bacteria reduces the quantity of bio solids this is reflected in the income generated from off site treatment of bio solids from 11 in s4 s6 to 3 in s5 s7 revbiosolids but also by the quantity of methane produced in the angsr from 45 in s4 s6 to 40 in s5 s7 revelectricity interestingly even though the quantity of bio solids generated by the anx is lower the transport costs are higher compared to s4 and s6 costtransport this is mainly due to the increased quantity of precipitates as a result of a better al dosing and resulting improved p removal this is also reflected in the chemical costs i e costchem is increased there is no impact on the effluent discharge fee costdischarge as done in section 3 2 2 based on a yearly extrapolation the potential implementation of these two scenarios s5 and s7 would save 0 5 and 2 8 m year respectively 4 environmental considerations in this section of the manuscript the environmental impacts derived from the implementation of the 1 new refluxing schemes s1 2 new operational procedures s2 s3 and 3 new technologies s4 s7 are quantified using life cycle impact assessment lcia fig 2 shows the damage scores in terms of human health hh ecosystem quality eq and resource scarcity rs for all the evaluated scenarios positive results for hh and eq reveal that the treatment of pww1 5 and sbm is not burden free by contrast negative values for rs indicate potential environmental benefits for this area of protection details about process inventory used to quantify impact categories are summarized in tables s5 and s7 in supplemental information 4 1 human health taking a closer look at hh see fig 2a one may notice that it is strongly dominated by stressors related to global warming for all the evaluated scenarios 82 96 of total positive impact ionizing radiation fine particulate organic formation human non carcinogenic toxicity stratospheric ozone depletion ozone formation human carcinogenic toxicity and water consumption have a relatively small contribution to hh 4 18 of total positive impact more specifically for global warming see fig 3 a nitrous oxide n2o formation during aerobic treatment has the highest contribution this is mainly due to its nearly 300 fold stronger effect than co2 huijbregts et al 2016 the second in importance is production of chemicals for inactivation either cao or naoh energy consumption does not seem to have a major impact since it comes from wind power it is important to highlight that the iwts system under study is credited for co generation of heat and power in the biogas engine and for the replaced production of inorganic fertilizer processed bio solids this results in human health benefits for the fine particular matter formation impact category mainly due to avoided emissions of fine particulate matter and its precursors like sulfur dioxides ammonia and nitrogen oxides however human health benefits which can be attributed to these impact offsets are not large enough to outweigh human health burden stemming from emissions of greenhouse gases contributing to human health damage for more information about process contribution for the hh related impact categories the reader is referred to the figs s9 and s10 model predictions versus plant measurements and s11 s18 contribution of life cycle process to total impacts in supplemental material section fig 2a reveals that s1 s3 get better scores on hh compared to s0 this is attributed to 1 the increased quantity of n accumulated in the cake and therefore not returning to the asr via reject water and 2 the potential heterotrophic denitrification instead of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia in the btl see ncaptured and nlost values in table 2 the latter has paramount importance on n2o production since it is estimated as 2 5 of the incoming n entering the asr scenarios s4 s5 worsen hh again mainly due to the high use of naoh as inactivation agent see table 4 indeed the comparatively higher energy recovery resulting from in situ anaerobic treatment of reject water does not seem to compensate the derived impact of chemicals production finally the options with thermal inactivation s6 and s7 achieve the best compromise between energy use energy production and n2o emissions resulting in the best hh performance among the compared alternatives see tables 2 and 4 4 2 ecosystems quality damages to ecosystems are mainly driven by stressors contributing to global warming impacts on terrestrial ecosystems 48 98 of total positive impact for all the evaluated scenarios environmental benefits are seen for impacts related to terrestrial acidification corresponding to 1 12 of total positive impact and land use corresponding to 3 8 of total positive impact see fig 2b freshwater eutrophication marine ecotoxicity global warming freshwater ecosystems marine eutrophication ozone formation terrestrial ecosystems water consumption freshwater ecotoxicity and water consumption have a very small effect on eq see fig 2b as discussed in section 4 1 human health the main contribution to global warming is driven by n2o formation in the asr and production of chemicals for inactivation see also fig 3b again the system is credited by n and p values in the cake fertilizers avoided and combined heat and power generation in the biogas engine the latter reduces impacts stemming from land use and terrestrial acidification due to avoided emissions of sulfur dioxide and ammonia and avoided transformation of land also for this area of protection however these benefits are not large enough to outweigh the burden from other stressors contributing to ecosystem damage mainly greenhouse gas emissions for more information about process contribution to impact categories related to eq the reader is referred to figs s9 and s10 model predictions versus plant measurements and s11 s18 contribution of life cycle process to total impacts in supplemental information fig 2b shows that lower n2o emissions and use of chemicals decrease global warming impacts as described in section 4 1 differences in n and p removal substantially increase the damage on freshwater and marine eutrophication see fig 3b and c they reach maximum values in s4 and s6 when reject water is recirculated to the angsr with the subsequent damage on denitrification efficiency on the asr due to lack of carbon only the implementation of pn anx and pac control dosage based on in situ sensors s5 and s7 can lower n and p emissions however these differences in n and p removal and resulting differences in emissions of n and p compounds do not propagate to the ranking of alternatives because they are outweighed by benefits from replaced heat and power and fertilizers and further contribution of freshwater and marine eutrophication impacts to damage is relatively small when compared to that of global warming hence s6 performs best among compared alternatives 4 3 resources scarcity damages on resource scarcity are driven by mineral 2 3 contribution to total damage and fossil resource scarcity 97 98 contribution to total damage for all the evaluated scenarios see fig 2c both elements represent avoided use of fossil resources like natural gas crude oil and fossil coal when the iwts is credited for replaced inorganic fertilizers and co generation of heat and power these benefits outweigh burdens stemming from production of chemicals and production of power for operation of the plant for more details about which life cycle processes contribute to the two resource related impact categories the reader is referred to the tables in supplemental information figs s11 s18 fig 2c reveals that s1 s3 decrease the use of resources compared to the current baseline s0 this is mainly due to a higher content of n in the bio solids cake table 2 and higher energy recovery lower energy and chemical use see table 4 caused by 1 sbm reflux 2 change of operation in the btl and 3 full capacity of the angsr nevertheless the use of resources is increased in s4 and s5 due to an increased use of chemicals for bio solids deactivation even though there is a higher recovery in the angsr the situation seems to get better when pac dosage is improved and the quantity of p recovered is back to normal values deactivation using heat seems to be a more environmentally friendly option compared to naoh achieving the best values of all 4 4 outlook exclusion of modelling of the iwts plant equipment is not expected to change our findings owing to the relatively long lifetime of iwts installations 20 30 yr and the relatively large capacity of the installations 10 000 m3 d the amounts of steel and other raw materials needed for plant equipment are expected to be relatively insignificant when scaled to the functional unit i e treatment of 1 m3 of waste streams others showed that plant equipment generally does not contribute significantly to total life cycle impacts except for mineral resource use where the contribution of plant equipment can be higher than 10 owsianiak et al 2022 based on information for other processes for wastewater treatment which are available in the ecoinvent database wernet et al 2016 we estimate the contribution of the raw materials used for construction of the iwts facility to damages on resource scarcity to be in the range of 0 01 0 02 per 1 m3 this would represent 6 12 of the total damage to resource scarcity showing the relative insignificance of plant equipment to total life cycle damages 5 discussion the results generated in this study have demonstrated again what many authors have been preaching for years i e the importance of using integrated approaches when assessing either urban or industrial water treatment systems solon et al 2017 fernández arévalo et al 2017 seco et al 2020 sheik et al 2021 the proposed set of tools presented in this manuscript allowed to virtually quantify cod n and p mass balances revenues expenses and some technical aspects of future plant expansions in addition baseline simulation results were validated with full scale data collected during a dedicated measuring campaign the low deviation between measurements and simulations for 1 cod n p mass balances 5 and 2 process revenues 2 and costs 2 2 substantially increase the credibility of this study another important point more related to the case studies is the economic feasibility of s1 s3 s6 and s7 it was also disclosed that n and p removal has a strong effect on the two lcia mid point impact categories which address eutrophication and are therefore key performance indicators of the waste treatment process however from the environmental damage perspective eutrophication impacts did not contribute significantly to total ecosystem damage in particular contribution of freshwater eutrophication to total damage was small because direct wastewater treatment plant emissions of p occur to sea rather than to freshwater where p has strong fertilizing effect thus in our case ecosystem damage is mainly driven by global warming impacts dominated by direct emissions of two potent greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide future iwts optimization actions should therefore focus on minimizing direct emissions of methane and nitrous oxide 5 1 multi objective nature of the optimization problem and generation of additional scenarios the results reported in the analysis showed the multi objective nature of wastewater treatment plant optimization the authors have quantified multiple criteria to assess the degree of satisfaction of mostly economic objectives nevertheless technical comas et al 2008 legal gernaey et al 2014 and adaptability aspects juan garcía et al 2017 have not been included in one single objective function huang et al 2011 belton and stewart 2002 this may lead to systemic problems within the plant such as lack of flexibility robustness constant microbiology related total suspended solids tss separation problems or excessive ghg emissions solis et al 2022 the latter can be a game changer in denmark where ghg will start to be taxed in 2025 the options evaluated in this case study have been systematically generated but they are based on general process knowledge the combination of plant wide models with environmental decision support systems edss for suggesting process flow sheets poch et al 2004 garrido baserba et al 2012 castillo et al 2016 is a promising line of research indeed the combination of process heuristics with mixed integer non linear programming could yield a good set of technologies to be further evaluated using dynamic process models other promising options such as thermal inactivation struvite recovery and or intensification technologies such as membrane aerated biofilm reactors could be also included there is a bright future if both tools go hand in hand when retrofitting an existing plant during the transition from wastewater treatment plants to resource recovery facilities 5 2 experimental validation of the simulation findings the figures revealed that the results of this project strongly depend on the assumptions upon which the models are constructed this will be critical for the scenarios with the highest degree of extrapolation s4 s7 additional pilot studies are necessary in case one would like to redirect reject water to the anaerobic granular sludge reactor angsr combine different inactivation agents naoh heat or complement the traditional activated sludge reactor with partial nitration anammox units there are multiple factors that can have strong influence on the overall process performance particularly when dealing with industrial wastewater namely inhibition toxicity which are not considered in the model for example default values have been used to describe sulfide inhibition jin et al 2012 2013 other aspects that may be considered are the complex interactions between anx and sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob the same applies when predicting precipitates johansson et al 2017 magri et al 2021 the model clearly identified that some of these compounds are oversaturated but careful kinetic studies should be conducted in order to determine precipitation potential mbamba et al 2015 agrawal et al 2018 lastly the authors are aware that additional measurements and a higher degree of model complexity are necessary to correctly predict n2o emissions ni and yuan 2015 massara et al 2017 and how this can be combined with effluent quality and cost flores alsina et al 2014 all in all we can say that the study pointed out interesting directions for further exploration and where not to 6 conclusions a plant wide model of the largest iwts in northern europe is adjusted to assess future operational strategies the key messages of the presented study can be summarized as follows 1 reconciled data and model predictions show that for the incoming cod 32 is recovered as energy in the anaerobic granular sludge reactor angsr 23 is removed in the activated sludge reactor asr 32 is captured in bio solids 12 is lost during fermentation processes in either the buffer btl or pre acidification pat tanks and 1 leaves the plant via effluent with respect to n 65 is removed in the asr 31 is captured in the bio solids and 2 ends up in the effluent p is mainly accumulated in bio solids 98 the model also describes other process metrics such as c n ratio srt and vss tss ratio in both asr and dewatered cake 2 both plant data and computer simulations also reveal that the main source of revenue comes from the electricity production within the anaerobic granular sludge reactor 54 and external treatment of bio solids 33 regarding costs the main expenditures are the discharge fee 39 transportation and handling of bio solids 30 dosed chemicals 18 and power consumption 13 3 carbon refluxing s1 increases the accumulation of cod and n in the bio solids stream and reduces the quantity removed in the asr total revenues are increased by 3 due to a higher profit from external treatment of bio solids lower energy use consumption of chemicals and sludge volumes to be transported reduce total cost down to 9 inactivation tank and activated sludge reactor capacity is liberated by 50 and 25 4 change of operational conditions in the buffer tank anaerobic digester promotes heterotrophic denitrification instead of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia s2 hence 5 of the incoming cod is not lost due to fermentative processes cod recovery is increased up to 34and 11 of the nitrogen is handled in the pre acidification tank p is no longer precipitated in the buffer tank and overloads the activated sludge reactor these changes have implications on revenues derived from energy production energy and transportation costs increasing and decreasing the total revenues and expenditures up to 7 and down to 10 respectively 5 the change of inactivation agent allows for the anaerobic treatment of reject water s4 and s6 as a result recovery of incoming cod escalates up to 45 this brings the highest increase in revenues to electricity production 44 even though the profits coming from external bio solids treatment are decreased to 1 use of naoh substantially increases chemical costs while thermal treatment reduces the revenues derived from heat production overall heat treatment largely overpasses the yearly savings compared to chemical inactivation making it the recommended technology to be developed in the future 6 partial nitration anammox and p control dosage are absolutely necessary to recover the initial effluent values s5 and s7 the added benefits of pn anx are lower energy consumption and biomass production the results also show that it is necessary to have a more adaptive control system for pac dosage to achieve acceptable effluent p levels 7 life cycle impact assessment categories reveal that carbon refluxing change of operational conditions in the buffer tank anaerobic digester thermal inactivation and pn anx p control achieve the best scores on human health ecosystems quality and resource scarcity 8 the study has demonstrated the huge potential of virtual evaluation of retrofitting options using a full scale study the good predictions between model predictions and plant data 5 increase the credibility of the proposed set of tools presented in this manuscript results pints points both strengths and weakness of each implementation

15591,the use of mathematical models is a well established procedure in the field of waste water engineering to virtually evaluate the feasibility of novel process modifications in this way only options with the highest chance of success are further developed to be implemented at full scale while less interesting proposals can be disregarded at an early stage nevertheless there is still lack of studies where different plant wide model predictions effluent quality process economics and technical aspects are comprehensibly verified in the field with full scale data in this work a set of analysis evaluation tools are used to assess alternative retrofitting options in the largest industrial wastewater treatment plant in northern europe a mechanistic mathematical model is simulated to reproduce process behavior deviation 11 multiple criteria are defined and verified with plant data deviation 5 the feasibility of three types of scenarios is tested 1 stream refluxing 2 change of operational conditions and 3 the implementation of new technologies experimental measurements and computer simulations show that the current plant s main revenues are obtained from the electricity produced by the biogas engine 54 and sales of the inactivated bio solids for off site biogas production 33 the main expenditures are the discharge fee 39 and transportation and handling of bio solids 30 selective treatment of bio solid streams strongly modifies the fate of cod and n compounds within the plant in addition it increases revenues 3 reduces cost 9 and liberates capacity in both activated sludge 25 and inactivation reactors 50 better management of the buffer tank promotes heterotrophic denitrification instead of dissimilatory nitrate conversion to ammonia in this way 11 of the incoming nitrogen is removed within the anaerobic water line and does not overload the activated sludge reactors only a marginal increase in process performance is achieved when the anaerobic granular sludge reactor operates at full capacity the latter reveals that influent biodegradability is the main limiting factor rather than volume usage of either naoh or heat instead of cao as inactivation agents allows anaerobic treatment of the reject water which substantially benefits revenues derived from higher electricity recovery 44 however there is a high toll paid on chemicals 73 or heat recovery 19 depending on the inactivation technology in addition partial nitration anammox and a better poly aluminum chloride pac dosage strategy is necessary to achieve acceptable 2 n and p levels in the effluent the scenarios are evaluated from a sustainability angle by using life cycle impact assessment lcia in form of damage stressors grouped into three categories human health

can be employed to improve process efficiency product quality as well as safety udugama et al 2021 combining the power of data analytics including artificial intelligence with existing and future urban water infrastructure represents a significant untapped opportunity for the operation maintenance and rehabilitation of water infrastructure to achieve economic and environmental sustainability garrido baserba et al 2020 in this line of thinking the use of data reconciliation techniques plant wide modelling process simulation and computer aided process engineering methodologies are promising tools to face some of these challenges the importance of plant wide modelling has been emphasized for long time by the process systems engineering community skogestad 2000 gernaey et al 2014 a wastewater treatment plant should be considered as an integrated process where primary secondary clarifiers activated sludge reactors anaerobic digesters thickener flotation units and dewatering systems are linked together these units need to be operated and controlled not as individual units but taking into account their potential interactions to avoid having sub optimal local outcomes flores alsina et al 2019 the latter promoted the development of integrated modelling tools handling these issues barker and dold 1997 ekama 2009 barat et al 2013 gernaey et al 2014 fernández arévalo et al 2017 plant wide models substantially increase the number of potential operational strategies that can be simulated it also enables the study of a new dimension of control possibilities such as the impact of activated sludge control strategies on the sludge line jeppsson et al 2007 the effect of primary sedimentation on biogas production flores alsina et al 2014 and the handling of nitrogen n rich anaerobic digester effluent seco et al 2020 sheik et al 2021 the recent developments in the field of physico chemical modeling serralta et al 2004 flores alsina et al 2015 lizarralde et al 2015 allowed to handle problems not solved until now such as the mechanistic description of phosphorus p compounds and their close interaction with the sulfur s and the iron fe cycles solon et al 2017

been focused on benchmark treatment facilities gernaey et al 2014 dealt with diluted streams lizarralde et al 2019 used non validated models fernández arévalo et al 2017 or counted with limited supply and quality of data without putting too much emphasis on the process economics and sustainability martí et al 2017 to circumvent these limitations we present a model based evaluation study of plant wide operational strategies in an industrial water treatment system iwts treating the effluents from two big biotech companies the case study is the largest iwts in northern europe handling a pollution load of 2 5 million person equivalents in only 10 000 m3 day this will be done using a full scale validated plant wide model pwm capable of reproducing and forecasting mass and volumetric flows monje et al 2022 finally economic aspects such as energy expenditures use of chemicals bio solids handling and transportation discharge fee and potential on off site energy recovery will be combined with several technical e g removal rates capacity liberation and environmental i e human health ecosystem quality resource scarcity performances this study presents both collected and model

to the activated sludge reactors asr the sbm combined with the waste sludge streams from prim sec flot is chemically inactivated in alkaline conditions ph 12 from the process point of view the inactivation step implies the hydrolysis of the particulate material liberating soluble cod and n that need to be removed the inactivated bio solids proceed to the dewatering station resulting in two streams dewatered cake which is used as feedstock by an off site biogas facility and reject water which can be sent to either the anaerobic or the aerobic water lines a non dewatered fraction of the inactivated bio solids is used to dilute the dewatered cake to facilitate handling at the external biogas facility more specifically a dilution to approx 15 dw in the influent stream to the biogas

statistical methods used for data treatment can be found in both monje et al 2022 and supplemental information table s2 the pwm approach developed for this study is based on the following blocks 1 biological 2 physico chemical 3 interfaces 4 fractionation model and 5 ancillary elements the biological models comprise an anaerobic digestion model adm and an activated sludge model asm the adm

an adm asm adm interface and pcm adm asm interface flores alsina et al 2016 prim sec flot and dew are described as ideal splitters jeppsson et al 2007 the model is adjusted to reflect the experiments carried out by ekama and wentzel 2004 where organic and inorganic compounds show different settling velocities separation efficiencies btl is modelled assuming that there is 1 3 of biomass accumulation in the total volume the angsr model considers both reactor hydraulics and biofilm growth the multi scale approach presented by feldman et al 2017 is used to predict the behaviour of both units the mass balance assumes that the transport of soluble compounds is governed solely by homogenous diffusion whereas movement of particulate compounds takes place by convection saravanan and sreekrishnan 2006 biofilm thickness l is given as the radial distance z and varies due to two phenomena 1 the net growth of the particulate species and 2 detachment from the biofilm surface lackner et al 2008 the resulting system of partial differential equations pdes is solved using the method of lines press et al 2007 pat asr it are described as a series of continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs influent fractionation is based on the principles presented in feldman et al 2017 and monje et al 2021 2022 essentially adm states were estimated by assuming 1 degree of cod biodegradability in both codsol and codpart 2 degree of acidification in codsol 3 fraction of ethanol hence it is possible to determine soluble si and particulate xi inerts acetate sac and ethanol set once this is established lipids xli proteins xprot and amino acids saa are estimated using p and n standard content of the aforementioned compounds since the influent wastewater is coming from the fermentation industry sugars ssu 0 and carbohydrates xch 0 should not be present consumed upstream the quantity of p not associated with organics is assumed to be inorganic and precipitated calcium phosphate xca p any remaining

take into account pump efficiency and hydrostatic pressure once income and expenditures are quantified plant data model predictions revenues rev and costs cost can be estimated based on prices from

time srt and the quantity of inorganics vss tss in both activated sludge and dewatered cake are also quantified using plant measurements and model predictions 2 5 environmental indicators environmental indicators are derived from life cycle impact assessment lcia carried out to compare different operational strategies and evaluate improvement potentials of the iwts installations for this purpose endpoint impact indicators are used also referred to as characterization factors at endpoint level cf those indicate potential environmental damage per unit of stressor e g per kg of resource used or emission released to either 1 human health hh represented by disability adjusted loss of life years daly in yr and or 2 ecosystems quality eq represented by time integrated species loss in species yr or 3 resource scarcity rs represented by surplus cost in usd2013 contributions from different emissions and resource use each contributing to one or more environmental problems in lcia referred to as midpoint impact categories like global warming or freshwater eutrophication etc are aggregated based on their potential to cause damage to the three endpoints all 20 midpoint environmental impact categories included in the recipe 2016 lcia methodology v1 1 were considered for the calculation of final damage scores huijbregts et al 2017 the lcia followed the european union commission s international life cycle data system ilcd guideline in line with iso 14040 14044 standards european commission joint research center 2010 as the lcia is used to quantify environmental impacts which can be attributed to the life cycle of the iwts systems the study is considered a micro level decision support type a thus the assessment applies an attributional approach to modelling life cycle inventories consistently with ilcd recommendations for this modelling framework system expansion is the preferred way of solving multifunctionality provided that subdivision is not possible and average market consumption mixes and average processes are preferred over marginal processes bjørn et al 2017 this implies that co generation of heat and power from biogas replaces heat and electricity according to the current mixes in denmark and that sludge replaces nitrogen n and phosphorus p fertilizers produced using a global market average the functional unit which ensures equivalence between all the compared systems was defined as treatment of 1 m3 of an average industrial wastewater representing 5 process waste water influents and 1 high solid content stream coming from biotech enzyme and pharma industry the product systems were modelled in simapro version 9 2 0 2 pré consultants bv the netherlands data for foreground processes like chemical and energy inputs for the iwts plant are based on modelled values in this study data for generic processes such as electricity production are based on those available in the ecoinvent database version 3 7 1 wernet et al 2016 treatment of iwts effluent in a municipal wastewater treatment plant is modelled using an adapted process taken from ecoinvent ecoinvent is currently one of the most comprehensive databases of life cycle inventories i e aggregates of resource consumptions and pollutant emissions for specific processes taken from their life cycle perspective details of unit processes are presented in supplemental information 2 6 scenario analysis different optimization scenarios are considered in this work and a summary can be found in table 1 the scenarios are evaluated following three principles 1 refluxing 2 change of operational conditions and 3 implementation of new technologies the first consists of redirecting a certain stream or part of it to a different unit it is the simplest strategy and requires the lowest degree of extrapolation since it only implies a decrease in load towards a certain unit and an increase towards another the second principle implies that a certain unit works under different process variables but following the same fundamental principle in these strategies the same performance as in the original has been assumed the last set of scenarios implies a complete change of the layout in the sense that new technology units are added it implies the highest degree of extrapolation and similar performance compared to literature values has been assumed a simplified graphical representation of the current mode of operation fig s1 and the defined scenarios figs s2 s8 can be found in supplemental information 3 technical and economical analysis 3 1 baseline scenario measurements vs model table 2 summarizes the fate of cod n and p with the plant under study it is important to mention that the proposed approach shows remarkable prediction capabilities average deviation between measurements and simulations is 5 plant data indicate that for the incoming cod 32 is recovered as energy in the anaerobic granular sludge reactor angsr 23 is removed in the activated sludge reactor asr 32 is captured within the bio solids cake stream iteff ext dewunder 12 is lost during the fermentation process in the buffer btl and pre acidification tanks pat and 1 leaves the plant via the effluent iwtseff with respect to n 65 is removed in the asr 33 is captured in the bio solids cake stream iteff ext dewunder and 2 ends up in the effluent iwtseff finally when it comes to p 2 leaves the plant via the effluent iwtseff and 98 is accumulated in the bio solids stream iteff ext dewunder as a result of precipitation additional simulations reveal that the average deviation between measurements and model simulations for q compounds cod n p s na k ca mg al ph vss tss ratio at different plant locations is 11 see figs s9 s10 and table s4 in supplemental information the measured simulated values for all defined economic indicators income expenditures can be found in table 3 regarding economy plant data correspond to price estimations based on literature data table s3 again a low deviation between estimated plant economics and model predictions demonstrates that the model is well suited to estimate both cost 2 2 and revenues 2 0 calculations reveal that the highest source of revenue comes from electricity production in the biogas engine revelectricity and the external processing of bio solids revbiosolids with a contribution of 54 and 33 respectively heat sold revheat sold is the smallest source of income making up 13 with respect to costs the main contribution are the discharge fee costdischarge 39 transportation and handling of bio solids costbiosolids 30 dosed chemicals costchem 18 and power consumption costaeration costpumping 13 the ratio revenue total cost is 0 41 the daily difference revtotal costtotal is 16289 day when extrapolated for a year this corresponds to 5 95 million euros a condensed version only with simulated values can be found in table 4 with respect to capacity data table 5 both asr and inactivation tank it are assumed to operate at 100 of capacity nevertheless the angsr is assumed to be underperforming see table 5 the average deviation between measurements and simulations for the remaining technical criteria see table 6 is 6 5 the cod n in the input of the activated sludge reactor asr and sludge retention time srt is higher than 7 which indicates good potential nitrification denitrification conditions the low vss tss ratios in both activated sludge reactor asr and dewatering underflow dewunder indicate the important role of precipitates within the system under investigation see table 6 3 2 refluxing in solids line s1 3 2 1 rationale assumed simulation conditions this scenario is focused on modifications affecting the bio solids processing line the main function of this section of the plant is to effectively inactivate 1 spent biomass sbm from upstream production and 2 waste activated sludge secwas generated within the water line see fig 1 s1 departs from the knowledge that due to production features 1 3 of the production biomass stream sbm can be inactivated partly in a high solids form and be sent directly to the off site biogas facility the remaining 2 3 follow a normal inactivation step in addition the waste activated sludge stream secwas by passes the inactivation tank it and is sent directly to the dewatering units dew this is possible because the stream does not contain genetically modified microorganisms and therefore its inactivation before leaving the production site is not required european parliament and the council 2009 the inactivation process hydrolyzes particulate cod and n where a lower amount of treated biomass will reduce the amount of hydrolyzed material thus reducing the global load of pollutants that the plant has to remove a schematic representation can be found in supplemental information fig s2 s1 is formulated assuming a 50 and 75 use of the total inactivation tanks and activated sludge reactors volume see table 5 the first reduction is based on the fact that lower flow and mass loads will arrive to the it the second reduction is due to a potential decrease of returning loads via reject water in order to make a fair comparison the sludge retention time in the asr is set to be constant as in s0 by controlling the flow rate of the waste activated sludge stream secwas see table 6 the flow of it liquor directly sent to the biogas facility iteff ext is also manipulated to maintain an overall solids concentration leaving the plant of 15 average iteff ext and dewunder this applies to all the evaluated scenarios in this study s1 s7 3 2 2 model predictions simulations show that potential implementation of s1 will change the cod distribution within the plant see table 2 hence instead of being removed aerobically anoxically in the asr cod will be accumulated in the bio solids from 31 up to 37 this is mainly due to a lower degree of particulate solubilization in the it and therefore lower loads returning via reject water dewover this scenario leaves the anaerobic water line of the plant unaltered with respect to the baseline scenario thus no changes in cod recovery or loss are predicted similar to cod a higher n accumulation in the bio solids is predicted from 34 up to 38 see table 2 nevertheless there is an increased quantity of nitrogen leaving with the effluent from 2 to 3 this is caused by the modified c n ratio at the influent see table 6 which decreases the availability of electron donor for denitrification and the overall nitrogen removal moreover the assumed shorter retention time contributes to a lower n removal efficiency p removal is also suffering from a shorter retention time in the asr p in the effluent increased from 2 to 7 where the flow proportional dosage does not seem to be enough to achieve the previous precipitation levels cod redistribution has important implication on plant economic indicators see table 4 with respect to revenues it increases the income from sales of bio solids up to 10 revbiosolids which leads to an increase of revtotal by three percentage points regarding expenses the model forecasts that s1 will substantially decrease the use of lime by half which translates into 19 in chemical costs costchem less usage of cao reduces the quantity of inorganics present in the cake which also contributes to lower bio solids handling and transportation costs 17 costtransport this is also reflected in the vss tss ratio in dewunder see table 6 in addition savings in energy utilization due to a lower oxygen demand in the asr could be expected 4 costenergy there is no impact on the effluent discharge fee costdischarge the total decrease on expenditures costtotal is 9 based on a yearly extrapolation the potential implementation of s1 would save 1 1 m year 3 3 improved operation in anaerobic line s2 s3 3 3 1 rationale assumed simulation conditions two sets of scenarios are evaluated under this category previous investigation revealed that the tss accumulation together with the high cod n ratio 17 promoted dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra monje et al 2022 microbes undertaking dnra oxidize organic matter and use nitrate all the way to ammonium no3 no2 nh4 kraft et al 2011 data showed a reduction of nox in the liquids buffer tank btl but the total nitrogen values are maintained see figs s9 and s10 in supplemental information the dnra activity represents a loss of valuable cod that could be recovered plus an extra nh4 load that will need to be treated in the asr in s2 a better management of the btl is assumed to stop all biological activity in this unit and a promotion of complete heterotrophic denitrification inside the pre acidification tank pat this is achieved by 1 increasing the quantity of ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho being recycled from the activated sludge reactor asr to the pat and 2 adjusting the operation hrt in s3 the plant is simulated assuming that the anaerobic granular sludge reactor angsr capacity can be increased see table 5 these new scenarios build on the results obtained from s1 a schematic representation can be found in supplemental information figs s3 and s4 3 3 2 model predictions from the results summarized in table 2 one may see an increase in cod recovery when btl is assumed non reactive from 32 to 33 this is mainly due to a reduction of the cod losses in the btl 5 of the total influent load previous studies reported that 68 of the lost cod is attributed to fermentation processes and consequently production of h2 while the remaining 32 goes to n reduction monje et al 2022 only a small increase in cod recovery is predicted when the angsr is operated at full capacity s3 from 33 to 34 this indicates that the influent biodegradability is the limiting factor rather than reactor volume another important factor is that n removal is distributed in both pre acidification tank pat 11 and asr 38 instead of solely being handled in the asr in s0 s1 finally it should be mentioned that these changes alter again the c n ratio at the inlet of the asr and improve the denitrification efficiency it is important to highlight the negative effect of s2 and s3 on the overall p removal efficiency up to 14 ends up in the effluent this is mainly caused by an increased p load entering the asr indeed when btl was assumed to be reactive a large fraction of p was originally precipitated and removed in the prim but now it is sent to the anaerobic pat angsr and then to the aerobic line asr sec flot under the new circumstances the flow proportional dosage of pac is not suitable and should be modified and or adapted both s2 and s3 slightly increase the energy recovery revenues revelectricity since higher conversions are achieved within the angsr 6 and 8 respectively see values in table 4 the latter has a small effect on the income from off site treatment of bio solids from 10 in s1 to 9 and 8 in s2 and s3 respectively revbiosolids this is attributed to the fact that the organics are recovered in site and there is no need to transport them to an external facility this has an impact on the total revenues revtot i e it increased by three percentage points compared to s1 and up to seven respect to s0 the redistribution of n removal between the pat and the asr decreases the energy requirements down to 7 costenergy particularly due to aeration however it is poorly reflected in the total cost costtotal there is no impact on effluent discharge fee costdischarge and cost of chemicals costchem nevertheless a higher dosage of pac would be required to handle the extra p arriving via the anaerobic reactor as done in section 3 2 2 based on a yearly extrapolation the potential implementation of these two scenarios s2 and s3 would save 1 2 and 1 3 m year respectively 3 4 change of inactivation agent s4 s6 3 4 1 rationale assumed simulation conditions in this set of scenarios the premise departs from the replacement of inactivation agent from cao to naoh s4 or heat s6 this modification would allow the anaerobic treatment of reject water since the absence of calcium would not compromise the long term operation of the anaerobic granular sludge reactors angsr due to intra granular precipitation and sludge blanket cementation this fact was extensively tested in previous experimental and modelling studies by feldman et al 2017 2019 in this way the cod rich reject water stream can be processed anaerobically yielding a significant increase in biogas production and removing this duty from the activated sludge units in s4 alkaline inactivation is considered using a 25 naoh solution to reach the same ph as in s0 12 in s6 thermal inactivation is considered assuming a 20 c difference in temperature between inactivation influent and effluent this temperature gradient together with the assumption that the sbm stream has the same specific heat as water and the hydraulic flow rate were used to calculate the heat demand of the thermal inactivation the necessary heat is sourced directly from the waste heat produced in the biogas engine plus a fraction of the heat that now is sold as district heating the hydrolysis kinetics of particulate material are assumed to remain the same as in s0 all the other plant wide model parameters have been kept constant a schematic representation can be found in supplemental information figs s5 and s7 3 4 2 model predictions the reject water stream is highly loaded in cod and n when treated anaerobically an increase in the recovered cod is achieved from 34 in s3 to 45 in both s4 and s6 see values in table 2 hence the higher flux of cod towards biogas makes a lower aerobic cod oxidation contribution from 18 in s3 to 13 and 12 in s4 and s6 and less production of bio solids from 36 in s3 to 30 in both s4 and s6 n distribution suffers from a more negative impact these differences are attributed to the fact that s4 and s6 fail to complete nox denitrification due to insufficient carbon source availability see cod n ratio in table 6 as a result the n in the effluent increases up to 11 the situation with p is not good either as up to 75 of p remains in the effluent again the flow proportional strategy is not suitable to dose al and there is not enough precipitation and consequently removal in terms of economy see table 4 the model predicts an electricity generation increase up to 45 revelectricity s4 and s6 in s4 the utilization of naoh increases the expenditures for chemicals 73 costchem whereas in s6 the substitution of the chemical inactivation by a physical method lowers chemical costs down to 53 costchem however the higher heat demand in s6 causes a decrease in the availability of heat that can be sold as district heating by 19 revheat the higher cod recovery in the angsr leaves less electrons for biomass formation in the asr thus leading to a decrease of 11 in the income from bio solids off site treatment revbiosolids interestingly the lower bio solids production in s4 and s6 is counterbalanced by a strong decrease in the transportation cost 44 costtransport the lower level of precipitated material in the dewatering underflow stream see vss tss ratio in dewunder table 6 pronounces this finally it is important to mention the substantial reduction of the energy consumption up to 26 with respect to the baseline scenario costenergy this is attributed to the increased anaerobic treatment of incoming cod where less oxygen and consequently aeration energy is required there is no impact on the effluent discharge fee costdischarge in global terms s4 and s6 increase substantially the total revenues derived from the process 17 however with substantial differences when it comes to the cost to achieve it 2 and 27 of costtotal reduction with respect to s0 as done in section 3 2 2 based on a yearly extrapolation the potential implementation of these two scenarios s4 and s6 would save 1 1 and 3 4 m year respectively 3 5 partial nitration anammox and in situ feedback metal addition s5 s7 3 5 1 rationale assumed simulation conditions in the last scenarios the problem with poor n and p removal is tackled by 1 adding a partial nitration anammox pn anx unit and 2 implementing an improved pac dosage strategy based on an in situ feedback control loop for these scenarios four out of the seven original aerobic tanks are operated as high rate activated sludge reactors hasr and function as pre treatment previous studies have shown that pre treatment prior to pn anx reactors increases cod h2s oxidation ch4 co2 stripping precipitation removal and the ph flores alsina et al 2019 the presence of h2s may be critical due to it being a strong inhibitor for ammonium oxidizing organisms aob and favoring of sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob instead of anammox anx organisms when competing for electrons acceptors no2 then a new aerobic granular sludge reactor aegsr is set in place for autotrophic nitrogen removal the remaining three tanks stay as asr and receive a fraction of the concentrated ethanol stream pww5 that provides the cod for denitrification and achieving a final polish the idea behind the p controller based on pac addition can be found in ingildsen and wendelboe 2003 where phosphate sensors are located at the end of the flocculation activated sludge section to provide a feedback signal to the chemical dosage equipment to achieve a certain effluent phosphate set point the aegsr in s5 and s7 is modelled by assuming one single cstr and one single granule size zmax type additional information can be found in vangsgaard et al 2012 and flores alsina et al 2019 the exact same strategy as described in section 2 2 predicts competition for substrate space within the biofilm by the different microorganisms accounted for by the asm an ideal separator sep avoids that the granules leave the aegsr the operational do concentration within the reactor is 0 5 g m3 biofilm thickness is 1 mm and density is 50 000 g m3 the ratio between vbulk vtot is 0 8 concerning the p control an ideal sensor is located at the end of the pre and post treatment the control algorithm is proportional integral pi measured variables are phosphate values in both reactors control variables are the quantity of pac two dosage points are assumed pre and post treatment set point values are 5 and 2 g m3 respectively a schematic representation can be found in supplemental information figs s6 and s8 3 5 2 model predictions the implementation of pn anx and the improved p controller has important implications from a process point of view the lower yields of anx bacteria substantially reduces the quantity of cod accumulated in the cake this reduces the quantity of cod in reject water and consequently results in lower methane levels in the angsr from 45 in s4 s6 to 44 in s5 s7 n removal is substantially increased from 42 in s4 s6 to 52 in s5 s7 this is mainly due to a more effective reduction of nox to n2 since it is done autotrophically and it is no longer dependent of the presence of organics similar improvements can be seen in p removal where the new strategy ensures suitable pac dosage to reach the desired p levels i e p accumulated in bio solids is increased up to 98 as a result the quantity of n and p leaving the plant is back at the desired levels of 2 for both s5 and s7 see table 2 there are several impacts from a process economics point of view first partial nitration requires a much lower quantity of oxygen since nhx does not have to be oxidized all the way to no3 instead conversion stops at no2 as a result energy consumption costenergy is drastically reduced by 44 compared to the baseline scenario s0 second anx requires that only half of the nhx is oxidized in order to remove the incoming n load the lower yield of anx bacteria reduces the quantity of bio solids this is reflected in the income generated from off site treatment of bio solids from 11 in s4 s6 to 3 in s5 s7 revbiosolids but also by the quantity of methane produced in the angsr from 45 in s4 s6 to 40 in s5 s7 revelectricity interestingly even though the quantity of bio solids generated by the anx is lower the transport costs are higher compared to s4 and s6 costtransport this is mainly due to the increased quantity of precipitates as a result of a better al dosing and resulting improved p removal this is also reflected in the chemical costs i e costchem is increased there is no impact on the effluent discharge fee costdischarge as done in section 3 2 2 based on a yearly extrapolation the potential implementation of these two scenarios s5 and s7 would save 0 5 and 2 8 m year respectively 4 environmental considerations in this section of the manuscript the environmental impacts derived from the implementation of the 1 new refluxing schemes s1 2 new operational procedures s2 s3 and 3 new technologies s4 s7 are quantified using life cycle impact assessment lcia fig 2 shows the damage scores in terms of human health hh ecosystem quality eq and resource scarcity rs for all the evaluated scenarios positive results for hh and eq reveal that the treatment of pww1 5 and sbm is not burden free by contrast negative values for rs indicate potential environmental benefits for this area of protection details about process inventory used to quantify impact categories are summarized in tables s5 and s7 in supplemental information 4 1 human health taking a closer look at hh see fig 2a one may notice that it is strongly dominated by stressors related to global warming for all the evaluated scenarios 82 96 of total positive impact ionizing radiation fine particulate organic formation human non carcinogenic toxicity stratospheric ozone depletion ozone formation human carcinogenic toxicity and water consumption have a relatively small contribution to hh 4 18 of total positive impact more specifically for global warming see fig 3 a nitrous oxide n2o formation during aerobic treatment has the highest contribution this is mainly due to its nearly 300 fold stronger effect than co2 huijbregts et al 2016 the second in importance is production of chemicals for inactivation either cao or naoh energy consumption does not seem to have a major impact since it comes from wind power it is important to highlight that the iwts system under study is credited for co generation of heat and power in the biogas engine and for the replaced production of inorganic fertilizer processed bio solids this results in human health benefits for the fine particular matter formation impact category mainly due to avoided emissions of fine particulate matter and its precursors like sulfur dioxides ammonia and nitrogen oxides however human health benefits which can be attributed to these impact offsets are not large enough to outweigh human health burden stemming from emissions of greenhouse gases contributing to human health damage for more information about process contribution for the hh related impact categories the reader is referred to the figs s9 and s10 model predictions versus plant measurements and s11 s18 contribution of life cycle process to total impacts in supplemental material section fig 2a reveals that s1 s3 get better scores on hh compared to s0 this is attributed to 1 the increased quantity of n accumulated in the cake and therefore not returning to the asr via reject water and 2 the potential heterotrophic denitrification instead of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia in the btl see ncaptured and nlost values in table 2 the latter has paramount importance on n2o production since it is estimated as 2 5 of the incoming n entering the asr scenarios s4 s5 worsen hh again mainly due to the high use of naoh as inactivation agent see table 4 indeed the comparatively higher energy recovery resulting from in situ anaerobic treatment of reject water does not seem to compensate the derived impact of chemicals production finally the options with thermal inactivation s6 and s7 achieve the best compromise between energy use energy production and n2o emissions resulting in the best hh performance among the compared alternatives see tables 2 and 4 4 2 ecosystems quality damages to ecosystems are mainly driven by stressors contributing to global warming impacts on terrestrial ecosystems 48 98 of total positive impact for all the evaluated scenarios environmental benefits are seen for impacts related to terrestrial acidification corresponding to 1 12 of total positive impact and land use corresponding to 3 8 of total positive impact see fig 2b freshwater eutrophication marine ecotoxicity global warming freshwater ecosystems marine eutrophication ozone formation terrestrial ecosystems water consumption freshwater ecotoxicity and water consumption have a very small effect on eq see fig 2b as discussed in section 4 1 human health the main contribution to global warming is driven by n2o formation in the asr and production of chemicals for inactivation see also fig 3b again the system is credited by n and p values in the cake fertilizers avoided and combined heat and power generation in the biogas engine the latter reduces impacts stemming from land use and terrestrial acidification due to avoided emissions of sulfur dioxide and ammonia and avoided transformation of land also for this area of protection however these benefits are not large enough to outweigh the burden from other stressors contributing to ecosystem damage mainly greenhouse gas emissions for more information about process contribution to impact categories related to eq the reader is referred to figs s9 and s10 model predictions versus plant measurements and s11 s18 contribution of life cycle process to total impacts in supplemental information fig 2b shows that lower n2o emissions and use of chemicals decrease global warming impacts as described in section 4 1 differences in n and p removal substantially increase the damage on freshwater and marine eutrophication see fig 3b and c they reach maximum values in s4 and s6 when reject water is recirculated to the angsr with the subsequent damage on denitrification efficiency on the asr due to lack of carbon only the implementation of pn anx and pac control dosage based on in situ sensors s5 and s7 can lower n and p emissions however these differences in n and p removal and resulting differences in emissions of n and p compounds do not propagate to the ranking of alternatives because they are outweighed by benefits from replaced heat and power and fertilizers and further contribution of freshwater and marine eutrophication impacts to damage is relatively small when compared to that of global warming hence s6 performs best among compared alternatives 4 3 resources scarcity damages on resource scarcity are driven by mineral 2 3 contribution to total damage and fossil resource scarcity 97 98 contribution to total damage for all the evaluated scenarios see fig 2c both elements represent avoided use of fossil resources like natural gas crude oil and fossil coal when the iwts is credited for replaced inorganic fertilizers and co generation of heat and power these benefits outweigh burdens stemming from production of chemicals and production of power for operation of the plant for more details about which life cycle processes contribute to the two resource related impact categories the reader is referred to the tables in supplemental information figs s11 s18 fig 2c reveals that s1 s3 decrease the use of resources compared to the current baseline s0 this is mainly due to a higher content of n in the bio solids cake table 2 and higher energy recovery lower energy and chemical use see table 4 caused by 1 sbm reflux 2 change of operation in the btl and 3 full capacity of the angsr nevertheless the use of resources is increased in s4 and s5 due to an increased use of chemicals for bio solids deactivation even though there is a higher recovery in the angsr the situation seems to get better when pac dosage is improved and the quantity of p recovered is back to normal values deactivation using heat seems to be a more environmentally friendly option compared to naoh achieving the best values of all 4 4 outlook exclusion of modelling of the iwts plant equipment is not expected to change our findings owing to the relatively long lifetime of iwts installations 20 30 yr and the relatively large capacity of the installations 10 000 m3 d the amounts of steel and other raw materials needed for plant equipment are expected to be relatively insignificant when scaled to the functional unit i e treatment of 1 m3 of waste streams others showed that plant equipment generally does not contribute significantly to total life cycle impacts except for mineral resource use where the contribution of plant equipment can be higher than 10 owsianiak et al 2022 based on information for other processes for wastewater treatment which are available in the ecoinvent database wernet et al 2016 we estimate the contribution of the raw materials used for construction of the iwts facility to damages on resource scarcity to be in the range of 0 01 0 02 per 1 m3 this would represent 6 12 of the total damage to resource scarcity showing the relative insignificance of plant equipment to total life cycle damages 5 discussion the results generated in this study have demonstrated again what many authors have been preaching for years i e the importance of using integrated approaches when assessing either urban or industrial water treatment systems solon et al 2017 fernández arévalo et al 2017 seco et al 2020 sheik et al 2021 the proposed set of tools presented in this manuscript allowed to virtually quantify cod n and p mass balances revenues expenses and some technical aspects of future plant expansions in addition baseline simulation results were validated with full scale data collected during a dedicated measuring campaign the low deviation between measurements and simulations for 1 cod n p mass balances 5 and 2 process revenues 2 and costs 2 2 substantially increase the credibility of this study another important point more related to the case studies is the economic feasibility of s1 s3 s6 and s7 it was also disclosed that n and p removal has a strong effect on the two lcia mid point impact categories which address eutrophication and are therefore key performance indicators of the waste treatment process however from the environmental damage perspective eutrophication impacts did not contribute significantly to total ecosystem damage in particular contribution of freshwater eutrophication to total damage was small because direct wastewater treatment plant emissions of p occur to sea rather than to freshwater where p has strong fertilizing effect thus in our case ecosystem damage is mainly driven by global warming impacts dominated by direct emissions of two potent greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide future iwts optimization actions should therefore focus on minimizing direct emissions of methane and nitrous oxide 5 1 multi objective nature of the optimization problem and generation of additional scenarios the results reported in the analysis showed the multi objective nature of wastewater treatment plant optimization the authors have quantified multiple criteria to assess the degree of satisfaction of mostly economic objectives nevertheless technical comas et al 2008 legal gernaey et al 2014 and adaptability aspects juan garcía et al 2017 have not been included in one single objective function huang et al 2011 belton and stewart 2002 this may lead to systemic problems within the plant such as lack of flexibility robustness constant microbiology related total suspended solids tss separation problems or excessive ghg emissions solis et al 2022 the latter can be a game changer in denmark where ghg will start to be taxed in 2025 the options evaluated in this case study have been systematically generated but they are based on general process knowledge the combination of plant wide models with environmental decision support systems edss for suggesting process flow sheets poch et al 2004 garrido baserba et al 2012 castillo et al 2016 is a promising line of research indeed the combination of process heuristics with mixed integer non linear programming could yield a good set of technologies to be further evaluated using dynamic process models other promising options such as thermal inactivation struvite recovery and or intensification technologies such as membrane aerated biofilm reactors could be also included there is a bright future if both tools go hand in hand when retrofitting an existing plant during the transition from wastewater treatment plants to resource recovery facilities 5 2 experimental validation of the simulation findings the figures revealed that the results of this project strongly depend on the assumptions upon which the models are constructed this will be critical for the scenarios with the highest degree of extrapolation s4 s7 additional pilot studies are necessary in case one would like to redirect reject water to the anaerobic granular sludge reactor angsr combine different inactivation agents naoh heat or complement the traditional activated sludge reactor with partial nitration anammox units there are multiple factors that can have strong influence on the overall process performance particularly when dealing with industrial wastewater namely inhibition toxicity which are not considered in the model for example default values have been used to describe sulfide inhibition jin et al 2012 2013 other aspects that may be considered are the complex interactions between anx and sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob the same applies when predicting precipitates johansson et al 2017 magri et al 2021 the model clearly identified that some of these compounds are oversaturated but careful kinetic studies should be conducted in order to determine precipitation potential mbamba et al 2015 agrawal et al 2018 lastly the authors are aware that additional measurements and a higher degree of model complexity are necessary to correctly predict n2o emissions ni and yuan 2015 massara et al 2017 and how this can be combined with effluent quality and cost flores alsina et al 2014 all in all we can say that the study pointed out interesting directions for further exploration and where not to 6 conclusions a plant wide model of the largest iwts in northern europe is adjusted to assess future operational strategies the key messages of the presented study can be summarized as follows 1 reconciled data and model predictions show that for the incoming cod 32 is recovered as energy in the anaerobic granular sludge reactor angsr 23 is removed in the activated sludge reactor asr 32 is captured in bio solids 12 is lost during fermentation processes in either the buffer btl or pre acidification pat tanks and 1 leaves the plant via effluent with respect to n 65 is removed in the asr 31 is captured in the bio solids and 2 ends up in the effluent p is mainly accumulated in bio solids 98 the model also describes other process metrics such as c n ratio srt and vss tss ratio in both asr and dewatered cake 2 both plant data and computer simulations also reveal that the main source of revenue comes from the electricity production within the anaerobic granular sludge reactor 54 and external treatment of bio solids 33 regarding costs the main expenditures are the discharge fee 39 transportation and handling of bio solids 30 dosed chemicals 18 and power consumption 13 3 carbon refluxing s1 increases the accumulation of cod and n in the bio solids stream and reduces the quantity removed in the asr total revenues are increased by 3 due to a higher profit from external treatment of bio solids lower energy use consumption of chemicals and sludge volumes to be transported reduce total cost down to 9 inactivation tank and activated sludge reactor capacity is liberated by 50 and 25 4 change of operational conditions in the buffer tank anaerobic digester promotes heterotrophic denitrification instead of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia s2 hence 5 of the incoming cod is not lost due to fermentative processes cod recovery is increased up to 34and 11 of the nitrogen is handled in the pre acidification tank p is no longer precipitated in the buffer tank and overloads the activated sludge reactor these changes have implications on revenues derived from energy production energy and transportation costs increasing and decreasing the total revenues and expenditures up to 7 and down to 10 respectively 5 the change of inactivation agent allows for the anaerobic treatment of reject water s4 and s6 as a result recovery of incoming cod escalates up to 45 this brings the highest increase in revenues to electricity production 44 even though the profits coming from external bio solids treatment are decreased to 1 use of naoh substantially increases chemical costs while thermal treatment reduces the revenues derived from heat production overall heat treatment largely overpasses the yearly savings compared to chemical inactivation making it the recommended technology to be developed in the future 6 partial nitration anammox and p control dosage are absolutely necessary to recover the initial effluent values s5 and s7 the added benefits of pn anx are lower energy consumption and biomass production the results also show that it is necessary to have a more adaptive control system for pac dosage to achieve acceptable effluent p levels 7 life cycle impact assessment categories reveal that carbon refluxing change of operational conditions in the buffer tank anaerobic digester thermal inactivation and pn anx p control achieve the best scores

15592,wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been one of the most cost effective approaches to track the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 levels in the communities since the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 outbreak in 2020 normalizing sars cov 2 concentrations by the population biomarkers in wastewater is critical for interpreting the viral loads comparing the epidemiological trends among the sewersheds and identifying the vulnerable communities in this study five population biomarkers pepper mild mottle virus pmmov creatinine cre 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid 5 hiaa caffeine caf and its metabolite paraxanthine para were investigated and validated for their utility in normalizing the sars cov 2 loads through two normalizing approaches using the data from 64 wastewater treatment plants wwtps in missouri their utility in assessing the real time population contributing to the wastewater was also evaluated the best performing candidate was further tested for its capacity for improving correlation between normalized sars cov 2 loads and the clinical cases reported in the city of columbia missouri a university town with a constantly fluctuating population our results showed that except cre the direct and indirect normalization approaches using biomarkers allow accounting for the changes in wastewater dilution and differences in relative human waste input over time regardless flow volume and population of the given wwtp among selected biomarkers para is the most reliable population biomarker in determining the sars cov 2 load per capita due to its high accuracy low variability and high temporal consistency to reflect the change in population dynamics and dilution in wastewater it also demonstrated its excellent utility for real time assessment of the population contributing to the wastewater in addition the viral loads normalized by the para estimated population significantly improved the correlation rho 0 5878 p 0 05 between sars cov 2 load per capita and case numbers per capita this chemical biomarker complements the current normalization scheme recommended by cdc and helps us understand the size distribution and dynamics of local populations for forecasting the prevalence of sars cov2 within each sewershed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords population biomarker sars cov 2 paraxanthine

global pandemic declared by the world health organization who on march 11th 2020 who n d despite clinical tests being sufficient and accurate their time consuming and often expensive process has not always been sufficient enough to track sars cov 2 outbreaks at the population scale gonzalez et al 2020 wastewater based epidemiology wbe offers near real time information about the outbreak to track sars cov 2 in the communities polo et al 2020 it has been successfully used to predict the overall status of infection and to capture asymptomatic and pre symptomatic infections in the given wastewater treatment plant wwtp served area agrawal et al 2021 several studies in europe australia japan singapore and the united states had used wbe approach agrawal et al 2021 ahmed et al 2020a haramoto et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 sherchan et al 2020 wong et al 2021 wu et al 2020 the state of missouri launched a statewide wastewater sars cov 2 surveillance program in may 2020 state of missouri 2021 it has been successfully applied to 1 provide the early warning 2 determine the distribution of sars cov 2 and its variants in missouri 3 identify trends in sars cov 2 prevalence in areas surveilled and 4 monitor for indicators of sars cov 2 reemergence to inform mitigation efforts for long term wastewater sars cov 2 surveillance normalizing sars cov 2 wastewater concentrations prior to calculating trends is recommended by the united states centers for disease control cdc and the european commission to account for changes in wastewater dilution and differences in relative human waste input over time due to tourism weekday commuters temporary workers and pandemic lockdowns etc normalizing sars cov 2 concentrations by the amount of human excreta in wastewater can be crucial for interpreting and comparing viral concentrations in the sewage samples over time cdc 2021a european commission 2021 the population biomarkers include but are not limited to viral or bacterial molecular targets cross assembly phage or pepper mild mottle virus pmmov are recommended by both cdc and european commission cdc 2021b european commission 2021 pmmov a viral pathogen in capsicum sp that had been identified in several pepper based products and diets zhang et al 2005 is one of the fecal indicator viral molecular targets genda et al 2005 pmmov was utilized to track human fecal sources due to its abundance in pepper based food unaffected by seasonal change persistence in the wastewater with half life from 6 10 days from the populated area kitajima et al 2014 rosario et al 2009 in recent studies pmmov was utilized for sars cov 2 normalization of external factors such as flow rate of the wastewater jafferali et al 2021 and background noise associated with systematic variation d aoust et al 2021 however these viral or bacterial molecular have not been used to estimate the population contributing to the wastewater yet on the other hand the chemical population biomarkers specific to human and majorly excreted through feces and or urine contributing to wastewater had be utilized to estimate the size of the population chen et al 2014 driver et al 2020 gracia lor et al 2017 o brien et al 2017 2014 polo et al 2020 rico et al 2017 senta et al 2015 several chemical markers such as creatinine cre 5 hydroxyindoleacetic

creatinine is the metabolite of creatine and phosphorylcreatine in the muscles it is produced at a steady state diffused out of muscle cells and further excreted by kidneys into urine wyss and kaddurah daouk 2000 urinary cre was routinely used to account for dilution when testing human urine for illicit substances barr dana et al 2005 brewer et al 2012 the serotonin metabolite 5 hiaa is another promising endogenous molecule for this purpose clinical urinary 5 hiaa analysis is commonly performed to evaluate patients with suspected carcinoid syndrome nuttall and pingree 1998 the 5 hiaa

through grab sampling manhole or passive sampling process the conventional normalization process simply divides the concentration of viral load by the concentrations of pmmov and generate a unitless normalized values ai et al 2021 d aoust et al 2021 feng et al 2021 greenwald et al 2021 our approaches are similar to the currently widely used population normalization scheme unitless but they are more advanced by normalizing the viral concentrations into copies person so it could be directly compared against the infection rates clinical cases population within each sewershed in addition since the outcome is a universal unit copies person it will allow us to compare the results among different wwtf facilities our approaches could be particularly useful when the metadata e g flow rates size of population are not available or not reliable under the same scenarios described above two approaches were proposed to normalize sars cov 2 concentration in the wastewater using the concentrations of biomarkers and established regression functions from the linear regression models the direct approach utilized the ratio of population contributing to the wastewater to wastewater volume pr size of the population l estimated by biomarker concentration to directly normalize sars cov 2 load which is similar to the pmmov normalization scheme recommended by cdc as well as european commission and adopted by the majority of the wastewater based epidemiology programs as for indirect approach the nominator of biomarker concentration was utilized and replaced with the estimated population during the normalization process both approaches assumed that the biomarker load is proportional to the population in the wastewater composite fig 1 this section presented the methods of 1 determining the

al 2009 2 6 2 estimation of real time populations for city of columbia college town and a tourist town the population contributing to the sewershed was expected to fluctuate over the surveillance period due to tourism weekday commuters temporary workers and quarantine etc to monitor the population fluctuation wastewater samples were collected from the wwtps of city of columbia college town and a tourist town over 10 time points table s2 the para load at each given time was calculated using para concentration and the daily flow volume reported in the metadata as in eq 3 the population at each given time was further estimated using the linear regression model built from eq 4 and the calculated para loads 2 7 relationships between sars cov 2 load in wastewater and clinical prevalence the weekly average of sars cov 2 clinical case numbers in city of columbia was collected by the missouri department of health and senior services from may to september 2021 c0 was calculated using

used to assess the correlation between biomarkers and pr ratio of population contributing to wastewater to wastewater volume using eq 2 or biomarker and population using eq 4 the linear regression models were fitted by either the biomarker concentration and pr in eq 2 or biomarker loads and population in eq 4 the r square r2 represents the variation of population pr explained by the model the pearson s correlation coefficient r represents the strength of the correlation the concentrations of caf showed the highest correlation pearson coefficients r 0 810 with the pr followed by the concentrations of para r 0 774 pmmov r 0 598 5 hiaa r 0 59 and cre r 0 06 fig s4 and table s4 log transformation has been widely used to process the skewed data it helps to decrease the variability of data and make data conform more closely to the normal distribution feng et al 2013 after log transformation the r was increased to 0 886 for caf 0 861 for para 0 720 for 5 hiaa and 0 707 for pmmov fig 2 however it was not improved for cre the daily load of caf exhibited the highest correlation r 0 99 with population followed by the daily load of 5 hiaa r 0 98 pmmov r 0 98 para r 0 97 and cre r 0 22 fig s5 and table s5 similarly log transformation significantly improved the correlation of all five coefficients the para and caf daily load showed the highest correlation r 0 97 and 0 97 respectively with the population followed pmmov load r 0 92 5 hiaa load r 0 87 and cre load r 0 33 after log transformation fig 3 3 2 comparison of normalization coefficients among different biomarkers the normalization coefficient c1 i or c2 i calculated from biomarker concentration were utilized to normalize sars cov 2 viral load a reliable biomarker for population normalization should achieve high precision and low variability meaning that the normalization coefficient c1 i or c2 i for biomarker i should be comparable to c0 calculated from the population and daily flow volume derived from metadata hence when the normalization coefficients from different biomarkers were standardized by c0 as fold change c1 i c0 the closer to 1 y 1 the fold change is the higher precision and lower variability the biomarker obtains in the direct normalization approach c1 i were calculated using the eq 7 and biomarker concentrations caf outperformed other biomarkers resulting from the lower variation and higher precision in comparison of the c1 i of all other biomarkers fig 4 and table s6 most of c1 5 hiaa and c1 pmmov among wastewater facilities showed variation above the baseline y 1 which could result in over normalization of sars cov 2 the relatively high variation of c1 5 hiaa and c1 pmmov could over normalize or under normalize the c1 cre results were not included in this comparison due to its poor correlation with population therefore the results suggested that the caf should be the most suitable biomarker for the direct normalization approach followed by para 5 hiaa and then pmmov at last in the indirect normalization approach the normalization coefficients c2 i were calculated with the data transformed biomarker concentrations in eq 9 followed by standardization by c0 and expressed as fold change c2 i c0 the fold change c2 para c0 of para outperformed other biomarkers due to its lower variation and higher precision fig 5 and table s7 among all biomarkers cre exhibited the highest variation and lowest precision thus the most suitable biomarker for the indirect normalization approach would be para followed by caf pmmov and 5 hiaa 3 3 normalization of sars cov 2 load per capita the sars cov 2 loads normalized by biomarkers copies person were directly calculated by multiplying the viral concentrations with the normalization coefficient of the corresponding biomarker fig 6 demonstrated the biomarker normalized viral per capita of each selected facility in the state of missouri for the week of january 19th and week of january 23rd 2021 unlike most of the current sars cov 2 wastewater based epidemiology programs our normalization strategy allows us to compare the viral load per capita among the sewersheds cross the geographic gradient the vulnerability meant high risk of the exposure and transmissibility among the communities due to the potential of the high infection rates e g viral load per capital in wastewater high clinical cases population high risk the vulnerable community was identified by comparing the viral load per capita among the sewersheds as function of time the viral load per capita was determined by the sars cov 2 load normalized by the population which was estimated with the population biomarkers for example viral load per capita at brook wwtp in week of january 19th fig 6b and d was significantly higher than other sewersheds and the viral load per capita in week of january 19th was much higher than a week earlier fig 6a and c suggesting that the brook was a vulnerable community that might soon encounter high covid 19 illness and high infection rate 3 4 validation of normalization coefficients based on the value of fold change caf and para achieved the lowest variability and highest accuracy and precision figs 4 and 5 these normalization approaches were further validated the using wastewater samples collected from 64 wwtps in the state of missouri in may 2021 table s1 the normalization coefficients c1 caf c1 para c2 caf and c2 para for each wwtp was calculated using the established regression functions between caf para and population tables s4 and s5 without metadata these coefficients were normalized by c0 derived from metadata to assess the fitness precision and variability there was no significant difference between the normalization coefficients of caf and para when the direct approach or indirect approach was applied fig 7 tables s8 and s9 the mean of fold change of caf and para from direct and indirect approach were both close to 1 high precision with few outliers low variability these results not only concurred with the results shown in figs 4 and 5 but also indicated that the regression functions developed in this study could be used for normalizing sars cov 2 load without metadata in the future 3 5 estimation of real time population contributing to the wastewater the precision of real time biomarker estimated populations were assessed by fitting regression models with the biomarker loads using r program para achieved the highest adjusted r square followed by caf 5 hiaa pmmov and cre table 4 the para showed the lowest mean square error mse which is the parameter used for assessing the prediction accuracy by the developed model and it was increased in the order of caf pmmov 5 hiaa and cre again para obtained the lowest 5 fold cross validation mse suggesting that para is the most suitable biomarker for estimating the population to accurately normalize sars cov 2 loads per capita over time the populations at a college town and a tourist town were estimated using the para concentrations in wastewater samples collected through may to early september in 2021 when the daily flow volume was available the real time population was predicted by the biomarker loads using the established biomarker loads vs populations regression functions in eq 3 table s5 the results showed the real time population dynamic of population at city of columbia especially in late may august and early september fig 8 a the variation of estimated populations in columbia were from 36 to 8 compared to the population reported in metadata the change in the real time population from may to early september in a tourist town were observed in similar pattern fig 8b 3 6 correlation between sars cov 2 load per capita and clinical prevalence it was demonstrated in fig 9 that the relation between sars cov 2 levels in the wastewater and clinical cases could be mispresented without a proper normalization using a reliable population marker this is mainly attributed to that the population in the city of columbia was constantly fluctuating over the surveillance period fig 8a the spearman s rank correlation was performed to understand the correlation between viral loads and prevalence data udovičić et al 2007 spearman s correlation coefficient rho represents strength of the correlation between viral loads and prevalence data for instance the correlation between the average weekly case number and the sars cov 2 concentration over time was insignificant rho 0 5152 p 0 1 before normalization fig 9a the rho was reduced to 0 47 p 0 1 after the viral concentration and clinical case number were both normalized by the fixed population from the metadata through population census fig 9b similarly as the viral concentration normalized by para estimated population copies person plotted against the clinical case numbers normalized by metadata case number 100 000 people rho dropped to 0 50 p 0 1 fig 9c in contrast when both viral load and clinical case number were properly normalized by para estimated population the correlation was positive and moderate rho 0 59 p 0 05 fig 9d 4 discussion 4 1 population biomarker selection our findings suggested the chemical marker para is more reliable population biomarker than pmmov due to its 1 better population indicators with higher accuracy lower variability figs 4 and 5 and higher temporal consistency fig 8 2 very limited exogenous sources summers et al 2015 3 higher extraction efficiency with low variability table 5 4 higher stability in wastewater choi et al 2020 5 resistant to chemicals in the wastewater armanious et al 2016 and 6 low sample volume requirement with simple sample preparation process table 5 although pmmov is recommended by us cdc and european commission as population fecal biomarker to normalize sars cov 2 concentrations 4 1 1 population indicators pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and caffeine are commonly found in human diet the log transformed para caffeine metabolite daily load in wastewater demonstrated better correlation with population r 0 97 as compared to pmmov r 0 92 fig 3 resulting para outperformed pmmov no matter which normalization was applied the variability in biomarker shedding could result from different social and cultural variations influencing food habits the per capita availability of fresh bell pepper and processed chile pepper were 11 3 and 7 9 ponds in 2021 in the united states davis et al 2022 an early study holezer et al 2012 reported that women and members of high income households are the most likely subpopulations to consume peppers regarding ethnicity hispanic is more likely to consume peppers as compared to white black and others with respect to age elders 50 years old are more likely to consume peppers as compared to adults aged 14 to 49 years and children under 14 are less likely to do so as compared to adults although the metabolite of the caffeine para has been recognized as the reliable population biomarker caffeine intake could be affected by the ethnicity and age for example non hispanic black individuals consumed the smallest amounts 80 2 mg d non hispanic white individuals consumed the greatest amounts 194 3 mg d and asian individuals 126 7 mg d and hispanic individuals consumed intermediate amounts 127 3 mg d middle aged individuals aged 50 to 54 years consumed more caffeine 211 6 mg d than younger 107 4 mg d aged 20 to 24 years and older individuals 153 4 mg d aged 75 to 79 years lieberman et al 2019 daily caffeine intake from beverages was 14 mg day in children aged 1 to 5 years old and 22 mg day in children aged 6 to 9 years old knight et al 2004 interestingly the caffeine intake was not associated with physical activity economic status education level or employment status lieberman et al 2019 4 1 2 exogenous sources unlike caf and pmmov para is the metabolite product generated through the human consumption of the caffeinated products coffee tea and caffeinated drinks indicating that human is the major source contributing para in the wastewater in humans 80 of caffeine is metabolized into paraxanthine martínez bueno et al 2011 the production of the para could be also attributed to the microbial degradation of caffeine in the environments however since it is not the predominant microbial degradation pathway the amount of para produced through this process is very limited summers et al 2015 therefore we could assume that para loading in wwtp was mostly generated through human consumption of caffeine the exogenous sources of pmmov could be from chicken and seagull feces rosario et al 2009 the pmmov widely detected in the groundwater irrigation water and surface water rivers ponds asami et al 2016 hamza et al 2011 kuroda et al 2015 rosiles gonzález et al 2017 also suggested that pmmov might have other exogenous sources that could contribute to wastewater in addition recently several sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance projects in the u s have reported the increased levels of pmmov after the major stormwater events further investigation suggested the potential exogenous sources of the pmmov from agricultural soils suspended sediments and fertilizers personal communication 4 1 3 extraction efficiency variation in the extraction rates ahmed et al 2020b variations in the extraction rates of pmmov that have been widely reported is another drawback feng et al 2021 kato et al 2018 laturner et al 2021 feng et al reported a recovery of 45 26 pmmov using direct extraction with ha filters the pmmov was also poorly correlated with the recovery of the sars cov 2 enveloped virus similarly kato et al reported a wide variability of the pmmov recovery efficiencies with typical recovery rates only greater than 10 when concentrating using electronegative filters kato et al 2018 the high variability among different concentration techniques for pmmov analysis including direct extraction ha filtration filtration with bead bearing peg precipitation and ultrafiltration have been illustrated by laturner et al 2021 the coefficient of variation cv for these concentration techniques range from 25 9 to 49 8 feng et al reported that the variability in the pmmov extraction rates might have contributed to the decreased correlation coefficient between the normalized sars cov 2 concentration and the clinic cases in most of wwtp facilities reported by previous studies feng et al 2021 among the genic fecal markers although pmmov has demonstrated a less variable rna signal compared to bacteroides 16s rrna or human eukaryotic 18s rrna the variability of pmmov assay could be significant with ct variance from 1 18 to 1 34 d aoust et al 2021 feng et al 2021 4 1 4 stability in wastewater although pmmov has been known to be persistent in the soils the results of an incubation study suggested that the half lives of the pmmov in river water ranges from 7 to 10 days depending on the temperatures at 0 c pmmov showed 1 1 log10 reduction 7 9 remaining after 21 days of incubation in river water with pmmov half life of about 7 days at 25 c pmmov showed 3 7 log10 reduction 0 02 remaining after 21 days of incubation in river water with a half life of about 10 days as compared to more stable caf and para the relative short half life of the pmmov suggest that the pmmov assays need to be completed within 1 week after the samples are received even they are properly stored at 4 c 4 1 5 resistant to chemicals in the wastewater both caf and para the major metabolite of caffeine exhibited good consistent high recovery rates and high stability in the wastewater as compared to pmmpov table 5 the average recovery rates of caf and para in our study were 101 and 92 with standard deviation of 7 and 3 respectively similar to 73 to 109 for caf and its metabolites reported by driver et al 2020 both caf and para were found to be relatively stable in the sewer system choi et al 2020 the caf and para have several unique characteristics that are critical to serve as the reliable chemical fecal population markers they are highly soluble in water 13 g l 1 with a very low hydrophobicity octanol water coefficient log kow 0 07 insignificant volatility and its half life is about 10 years buerge et al 2006 chen et al 2012 froehner and martins 2008 lin et al 2009 due to the high polarity and water solubility caf and para will less likely to adhere to the solids fraction of wastewaters via electrostatic and or hydrophobic partitioning effects as the pmmov biomarker described by armanious et al 2016 as the wastewater stored at 20 c the para could be stable for at least 4 weeks or more choi et al 2020 senta et al 2015 with our new modified direct methanol dilution extraction protocol 50 methanol we anticipate that the caf and para extracts could be stable beyond several months when they are stored at 20 c under the 50 methanol sterilized solution buerge et al 2003 4 1 6 sample preparation and analysis the sample volume required for analysis for para is less than 2 ml 0 1ml with a modified methanol extraction protocol that is significantly less than 25 50 ml sample volume required for pmmov analysis table 5 another advantage for using para as the fecal marker is that it required less sample preparation time and processes an average sample preparation time for para analysis was less than 30 min 6 samples with new modified methanol extraction protocols it could be further reduced to 10 min 6 samples while the sample preparation time e g extraction and concentration for pmmov analysis often takes approximate 3 h pmmov can be used simultaneously quantified as the targets sars cov 2 viral nucleic acid using the rt qpcr multiplex platforms while caf and para were quantified using lc ms ms separately despite that no inhibition observed in the one step rt qpcr assay in our study rt qpcr inhibition have been reported by several studies kato et al 2018 quality control internal standards and dilution protocols are often required to account for any pcr inhibition incorporation of the internal positive control such as a modified targeted gene sequence or cgmmv are often required to correct the variation in the extraction efficiency plus any potential inhibition kato et al 2018 other emerging pcr based techniques such as rt droplet digital pcr rt ddpcr and digital qpcr were also used for quantifying pmmov hinkle et al 2022 p nevertheless they are less affordable and their implementation in the wbe pipeline requires more time without lc ms ms caf and para could be quantified by other less expensive alternative analytical techniques such as gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms high performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detector hplc pda due to their much higher concentrations in the wastewater sample chen et al 2002 thomas and foster 2004 additionally if the population within sewershed did not fluctuate over time quantification of para could be performed at core facilities equipped with lc ms ms once a while 4 1 7 other biomarkers other biomarkers selected in this study did not meet the criteria of population biomarker the levels of the creatinine the metabolite of muscle did not correlate with population consistent with the results reported by thai et al 2019 2014 the poor correlation could be due to its instability in wastewater treatment designs and processes high variance of intra and extra individual excretion daughton 2012 thai et al 2014 the 5 hiaa one of the major metabolites of serotonin correlated with population well and it has been reported to be stable in wastewater thai et al 2019 nevertheless the low concentrations in the wastewater and the observed coeluted interferences in the lcmsms analysis the time required for sample preparation and cleanup particular the time consuming concentration and cleanup processes through solid phase extraction spe make the 5 hiaa not an ideal marker candidate for real time and rapid analysis in addition a sensitive tandem mass spectrometer is the only option for quantifying the 5 hiaa in the wastewater due to its low sub ppb to ppb concentration range while although caf and para shared similar characteristics in wastewater caf loading might result from discarded caffeinated products and therefore make para more desirable population biomarker 4 2 normalization of sars cov 2 load and method validation the utility of chemical biomarkers for human fecal normalization in sras cov 2 wbe surveillance was so far very limited and the most normalization process simply divides the concentration of viral load by the concentrations of pmmov and generate a unitless normalized values ai et al 2021 d aoust et al 2021 feng et al 2021 greenwald et al 2021 isaksson et al 2022 this study investigated several alternative chemical population biomarkers in sars cov 2 wbe and normalization of sars cov 2 to copies per capital the concentrations of biomarkers determined by lc ms ms were applied to the exercise in correlation with population to generate their normalization coefficient the viral loads per capita were determined using the normalization coefficient of each chemical population biomarker both direct and indirect approaches aimed at precisely estimating the population contributing to wastewater that would be applied in the following determination of the viral load per capita figs 2 and 3 the normalization coefficient calculated from different biomarkers can be compared and evaluated before sars cov 2 concentration was involved most importantly our normalization approaches can be proceeded without daily flow volume and the size of the population using the developed regression functions tables s4 and s5 unlike the traditional normalization that requires the information of the daily flow volume and population size the sars cov 2 concentration was converted to mass using daily flow volume followed by being divided by population served by the wwtp fig 1a to obtain viral loads per capita copies 100 000 people in our normalization approaches the parameter fold changes the normalization coefficients c1 and c2 standardized by c0 from metadata were utilized to evaluate the fitness of the biomarkers for each normalization approach as compared to the traditional method the fold change that is closes to 1 indicates the highest accuracy for example in the direct approach fold changes for caf and para were 1 041 0 3111 mean standard deviation and 1 057 0 389 respectively in the indirectly approach fold changes for caf and para were 0 967 0 324 and 1 042 0 341 respectively both caf and para showed high accuracy and low variability in either approach on the contrary 5 hiaa and pmmov both showed significant difference in the values of the fold changes between two approaches the 5 hiaa fold change was 1 150 0 661 with the direct approach but 1 470 1 144 in the indirect approach whereas pmmov performed better 1 003 0 586 with the indirect approach than 1 166 0 737 in the direct approach tables s6 and 7 the high accuracy and low variability for caf and para are possibly attributed to high reproducibility of the analysis high recovery rates stability of these molecules and low adsorption affinity to the solids fraction of wastewaters furthermore the regression functions established by caf and para in our two approaches can be utilized to normalizing saras cov 2 in the long term monitoring without knowing daily flow volume and population size in the future wbe applications the normalization approaches were validated using additional 64 samples collected from may 2021 table s1 with the established regression functions of caf and para tables s4 and s5 the fold changes of caf and para calculated from these additional 64 samples exhibited high precision and low variation in both direct and indirect approaches fig 7 the results were consistent with our results from the developed models figs 4 and 5 indicating the validation was successful the indirect normalization approach is more accurate than the direct approach both approaches were assumed the mass of biomarker correlates to the population but the volume was taken into consideration in different ways for the direct approach the volume was utilized to calculate the ratio of population contributing to wastewater to the wastewater volume pr number of people l it could vary due to different designs of wwtps the correlation between biomarker concentrations µg l and pr was significantly positive fig 3 in the indirect approach the flow volume was incorporated when the biomarker concentration was converted to mass the correlation from both approaches remained positive even though flow volume was taken into consideration differently figs 3 and 4 however the correlation between biomarker mass and population was stronger as compared to the one between biomarker concentration and pr which affected the accuracy of population estimation tables s4 and s5 subsequently only the regression functions developed for indirect approaches were applied to estimate the real time population this is the first study to normalize the sars cov 2 load with biomarker estimated population and to accomplish viral load per capita with a universal unit copies person several previous studies utilized biomarker to normalize sars cov 2 concentrations but only achieved a unitless results eg n1 n2 copies copies of genetic biomarker green et al reported the ratio of sars cov 2 crassphage in the wastewater n1 or n2 copies copies of biomarker pmmov bcov hf183 crassphage and bacteroides rrna in the wastewater were reported by several studies d aoust et al and wolfe et al presented copies copy of pmmov in solids table s10 furthermore normalizing does not consistently improve correlations with covid 19 cases within sewershed wolfe et al 2021 for instance feng et al reported normalizing sars cov 2 to hf183 and pmmov reduced correlations in 5 and 8 of 12 wwtps respectively feng et al 2021 results from greenwald et al showed normalizing sars cov 2 n1 to pmmov or bacteroides rrna did not improve he correlation greenwald et al 2021 ali et al reported correlation was slightly improved by normalizing sars cov 2 n2 to pmmov but it was reduced by normalizing to crassphage ai et al 2021 nevertheless according to our findings fig 9 the biomarker estimated population should be incorporated into surveillance programs so the normalization can reflect the real viral load per capita to be compared over time and cross facilities and be further utilized for predicting the trend of covid 19 prevalence 4 3 relationship among estimated real time population sars cov 2 in wastewater and covid 19 incidences no matter which biomarker was used to estimate the population the population data from census or wwtp operators could introduce significant possibility for error despite estimating real time population was to examine its correlation with biomarker in the wastewater collected on census day o brien et al 2014 the census population still did not capture the daily commuters or tourists consequently the population provided by wwtp operators is the best available data for real time population assessment the fluctuations in the population posed a challenge to wbe long term monitoring polo et al 2020 when the population contributing to the sewershed is expected to constantly change over the surveillance period due to tourism weekday commuters temporary workers etc population normalization becomes extremely critical for interpreting sars cov 2 concentrations and predicting the trend and the infected population over time we successfully demonstrated the utility of para for gauging small area populations in real time and captured the population dynamics in a college town and a tourist town fig 8 since para gave the highest adjusted r square with lowest mse and 5 fold cross validation mse in the population predicting model table 4 our findings directly corresponded the fluctuations in the population due to seasonal activities in these tourist town and university community such as the summer breaks holidays e g labor day weekend in september and tourisms we strongly believe that population dynamic should be taken into consideration when the clinical cases are normalized for long term monitoring the caf and its metabolites para have been proposed as anthropogenic markers to assess the population size and trace the discharge of domestic wastewater in rivers and lakes buerge et al 2003 senta et al reported the para loads in the wastewater reflected the population dynamics senta et al 2015 we demonstrated the significantly improved correlation between para normalized sars cov 2 load per capita and the prevalence using a college town as an example fig 9 among 3 normalization scenarios fig 9 only the para normalized sars cov 2 load copies person and para normalized cases case number 100 000 people yielded a statistically significant correlation rho 0 5878 p 0 05 our results indicated that a fixed population often derived from population census is not ideal for long term monitoring it can be challenging to capture the population dynamic during the covid 19 pandemic with the conventional methodologies based on periodic public surveys such as census taking augmented with a wide array of demographic statistics most of the inaccurate population data often derived from aged or incomplete sources such as census surveys or utility customers billed e g anderson et al 2004 banta green et al 2009 clara et al 2011 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 neset et al 2010 ort et al 2009 rowsell et al 2010 tsuzuki 2006 particularly during current pandemic population dynamics often deviate significantly from the population estimated by the conventional methodologies due to the introduction of restrictions in control of the spread of sars cov 2 unreliable population biomarkers often result in the poor correlation between the normalized sars cov 2 levels and prevalence for example feng et al reported normalizing sars cov 2 concentration in the wastewater to fecal marker hf183 and pmmov reduced correlations in 5 and 8 of 12 wwtps respectively compared to the correlation before normalization feng et al 2021 greenwald et al also reported normalizing sars cov 2 load using crassphage pmmov and bacteroides rrna in the wastewater samples deteriorated the correlation with daily case number per capita in comparison with the correlation between non normalized concentrations and daily case numbers greenwald et al 2021 according to our results correlations could be significantly compromised when the fixed populations were applied to normalize the viral loads as well as the clinical cases 5 conclusion our findings suggested that the caf metabolite para is a reliable population biomarker in sars cov 2 wastewater based epidemiology studies due to its 1 better population indicators with higher accuracy lower variability and higher temporal consistency as a population indicator to reflect the change in population dynamics and dilution in wastewater 2 very limited exogenous sources 3 high extraction efficiency with low variability in the extraction rates 4 high stability 5 resistance to chemicals in the wastewater and 6 low sample volume requirement with simple sample preparation process this chemical biomarker offers an excellent alternative to the currently cdc recommended pmmov genetic biomarker to help us understand the size distribution and dynamics of local populations for forecasting the prevalence of sars cov2 within each sewershed furthermore the regression functions embedded in the direct and indirect approaches of normalizing viral loads by biomarker could be applied to new data without known daily flow volume and population finally the clinical cases should also be normalized by population dynamics when the correlation between sars cov 2 and prevalence were examined funding and acknowledgements the authors would like to

15592,wastewater based epidemiology wbe has been one of the most cost effective approaches to track the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 levels in the communities since the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 outbreak in 2020 normalizing sars cov 2 concentrations by the population biomarkers in wastewater is critical for interpreting the viral loads comparing the epidemiological trends among the sewersheds and identifying the vulnerable communities in this study five population biomarkers pepper mild mottle virus pmmov creatinine cre 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid 5 hiaa caffeine caf and its metabolite paraxanthine para were investigated and validated for their utility in normalizing the sars cov 2 loads through two normalizing approaches using the data from 64 wastewater treatment plants wwtps in missouri their utility in assessing the real time population contributing to the wastewater was also evaluated the best performing candidate was further tested for its capacity for improving correlation between normalized sars cov 2 loads and the clinical cases reported in the city of columbia missouri a university town with a constantly fluctuating population our results showed that except cre the direct and indirect normalization approaches using biomarkers allow accounting for the changes in wastewater dilution and differences in relative human waste input over time regardless flow volume and population of the given wwtp among selected biomarkers para is the most reliable population biomarker in determining the sars cov 2 load per capita due to its high accuracy low variability and high temporal consistency to reflect the change in population dynamics and dilution in wastewater it also demonstrated its excellent utility for real time assessment of the population contributing to the wastewater in addition the viral loads normalized by the para estimated population significantly improved the correlation rho 0 5878 p 0 05 between sars cov 2 load per capita and case numbers per capita this chemical biomarker complements the current normalization scheme recommended by cdc and helps us understand the size distribution and

population normalization wastewater based epidemiology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 has caused a global pandemic declared by the world health organization who on march 11th 2020 who n d despite clinical tests being sufficient and accurate their time consuming and often expensive process has not always been sufficient enough to track sars cov 2 outbreaks at the population scale gonzalez et al 2020 wastewater based epidemiology wbe offers near real time information about the outbreak to track sars cov 2 in the communities polo et al 2020 it has been successfully used to predict the overall status of infection and to capture asymptomatic and pre symptomatic infections in the given wastewater treatment plant wwtp served area agrawal et al 2021 several studies in europe australia japan singapore and the united states had used wbe approach agrawal et al 2021 ahmed et al 2020a

identify trends in sars cov 2 prevalence in areas surveilled and 4 monitor for indicators of sars cov 2 reemergence to inform mitigation efforts for long term wastewater sars cov 2 surveillance normalizing sars cov 2 wastewater concentrations prior to calculating trends is recommended by the united states centers for disease control cdc and the european commission to account for changes in wastewater dilution and differences in relative human waste input over time due to tourism weekday commuters temporary workers and pandemic lockdowns etc normalizing sars cov 2 concentrations by the amount of human excreta in wastewater can be crucial for interpreting and comparing viral concentrations in the sewage samples over time cdc 2021a european commission 2021 the population biomarkers include but are not limited to viral or bacterial molecular targets cross assembly phage or pepper mild mottle virus pmmov are recommended by both cdc and european commission cdc 2021b european commission 2021 pmmov a viral pathogen in capsicum sp that had been identified in several pepper based products and diets zhang et al 2005 is one of the fecal indicator viral molecular targets genda et al 2005 pmmov was utilized to track human fecal sources due to its abundance in pepper based food unaffected by seasonal change persistence in the wastewater with half life from 6 10 days from the populated area kitajima et al 2014 rosario et al 2009 in recent studies pmmov was utilized for sars cov 2 normalization of external factors such as flow rate of the wastewater jafferali et al 2021 and background noise associated with systematic variation d aoust et al 2021 however these viral or bacterial molecular have not been used to estimate the population contributing to the wastewater yet on the other hand the chemical population biomarkers specific to human and majorly excreted through feces and or urine contributing to wastewater had be utilized to estimate the size of the population chen et al 2014 driver et al 2020 gracia lor et al 2017 o brien et al 2017 2014 polo et al 2020 rico et al 2017 senta et al 2015 several chemical markers such as creatinine cre 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid 5 hiaa caffeine caf and its metabolite paraxanthine para have been reported as promising candidates chen et al 2014 driver et al 2020 o brien et al 2017 2014 rico et al 2017 senta et al 2015 creatinine is the metabolite of creatine and phosphorylcreatine in the muscles it is produced at a steady state diffused out of muscle cells and further excreted by kidneys into urine wyss and kaddurah daouk 2000 urinary cre was routinely used to account for dilution when testing human urine for illicit substances barr dana et al 2005 brewer et al 2012 the serotonin metabolite 5 hiaa is another promising endogenous molecule for this purpose clinical urinary 5 hiaa analysis is commonly performed to evaluate patients with suspected carcinoid syndrome nuttall and pingree 1998 the 5 hiaa been also used to estimate the population contributing to the wastewater rico et al 2017 both cre and 5 hiaa had been quantified in the samples from wwtps with the modern liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry chiaia et al 2008 jang et al 2019 ricoet al 2017 reported that 5 hiaa loads in the wwtp samples showed a positive correlation with the population calculated using the hydrochemical parameters chen et al 2014 reported that 5 hiaa levels were also correlated well with the census population besides endogenous molecules caf a widely consumed central nervous system cns stimulant depaula and farah 2019 is commonly found in food products including tea coffee energy drinks and chocolate as well as in some medications and dietary supplements the para is the major metabolite of caf through the cytochrome p4501a2 cyp1a2 catalyzed 3 demethylation crews et al 2010 several studies had detected caf and para in the wastewater chiaia et al 2008 driver et al 2020 gracia lor et al 2017 o brien et al 2014 senta et al 2015 similar to 5 hiaa research have reported a positive correlation between caf load and the population from census or population calculated by the hydrochemical parameters o brien et al 2014 rico et al 2017 the para level was found less affected by the genetic heterogeneity and population structure as compared to its parent compound caf crews et al 2010 suggesting para could also be a potential population biomarker the goal of this study was to determine the most suitable population biomarker for sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance specific objectives were 1 to compare the variability and accuracy of the selected biomarkers for normalizing the sars cov2 concentrations using two developed approaches derived from biomarker concentration 2 to identify the reliable biomarkers for estimating the real time population contributing to the wastewater and 3 to demonstrate the sars cov 2 loads normalized with the selected

in table 3 2 4 normalization of sars cov 2 concentration with biomarker concentration the cdc european commission recommended pmmov population normalization scheme has been widely used especially when 1 the metadata e g flow rates size of population are not available or not reliable fluctuated flow rates population dynamic dilution from industrial or natural discharges or 2 samples were collected through grab sampling manhole or passive sampling process the conventional normalization process simply divides the concentration of viral load by the concentrations of pmmov and generate a unitless normalized values ai et al 2021 d aoust et al 2021 feng et al 2021 greenwald et al 2021 our approaches are similar to the currently widely used population normalization scheme unitless but they are more advanced by normalizing the viral concentrations into copies person so it could be directly compared against the infection rates clinical cases population within each sewershed in addition since the outcome is a universal unit copies person it will allow us to compare the results among different wwtf facilities our approaches could be particularly useful when the metadata e g flow rates size of population are not available or not reliable under the same scenarios described above two approaches were proposed to normalize sars cov 2 concentration in the wastewater using the concentrations of biomarkers and established regression functions from the linear regression models the direct approach utilized the ratio of population contributing to the wastewater to wastewater volume pr size of the population l estimated by biomarker concentration to directly normalize sars cov 2 load which is similar to the pmmov normalization scheme recommended by cdc as well as european commission and adopted by the majority of the wastewater based epidemiology programs as for indirect approach the nominator of biomarker concentration was utilized and replaced with the estimated population during the normalization process both approaches assumed that the biomarker load is proportional to the population in the wastewater composite fig 1 this section presented the methods of 1 determining the regression functions and 2 normalizing sars cov 2 concentrations using biomarker concentrations are presented 2 4 1 relationships between biomarker concentration and ratio of population contributing to the wastewater to its volume the ratio of population contributing to the wastewater and wastewater volume pr size of the population l is expressed as 1 p r j p j v j in which pj and the daily flow volume vj litter for wwtp j are provided in metadata table 1 the pr is modeled as 2 b i j β i p r j i where b ij is the concentration of biomarker i in wwtp j sample the corresponding pr the error term i and the estimated parameter βi for biomarker i the error term accounts for differences in biomarker concentration from daily variations at the locations to avoid any skewness log transformed population and biomarker concentrations were further used to fit a linear regression model the pearson s correlation coefficient r was calculated 2 4 2 relationships between biomarker loads and population size daily flow volume was taken into consideration before the relationship between daily biomarker load and the population contributing to the wastewater was examined the biomarker load of biomarker i for wwtp j bij was calculated as 3 b i j b i j v j in which b ij the biomarker i concentration in wwtp j wastewater samples was determined by lc msms the population p is modeled as 4 b i j β i p j i where bij is the daily i biomarker load pj the population from metadata at wwtp j 2 4 3 developing the normalization scheme derived from metadata according to the cdc s guideline the

of wastewater daily flow volume v litter and population p are provided in metadata in the las line all variables and constants are designated as normalization coefficient 0 c0 except n1 n2 sars the unit of normalized sars cov 2 load per capita turns into copies per person 2 4 4 developing the normalization scheme derived from the relationship between biomarker concentration and pr pr the ratio of population contributing to wastewater and wastewater volume estimated by biomarker concentration in the wastewater was utilized in the direct normalization approach since pr is expressed as p i v i in eq 1 the correlation between the bi biomarker i concentrations and pr is expressed as 6 b i p r i b i p i v i 1 b i 1 p r i 1 b i v i p i in which population p i and daily flow volume v i were estimated using biomarker i concentration in the eq 2 the reciprocal of the estimated population p i and daily flow volume v i derived from pr were unitized in sars cov 2 load normalization process 7

replaced with p i and v i in eq 6 resulting in line 3 since p i v i correlated with bi v i p i is replaced with 1 b i in line 4 the pr i is furthered modeled using bi in line 5 except n1 n2 sars all of variables and constants were designated as normalization coefficient 1 c1 i for biomarker i in the direct approach the c1 i was further standardized by c0 as 8 f o l d c h a n g e c 1 i c 0 the fold change was utilized to assess the fitness precision and the variability of the biomarkers 2 4 5 developing the normalization scheme derived from the relationship between biomarker loads and population the population estimated by biomarker loads in the wastewater were used in the indirect biomarker to fall into the linear range of the correlation 9 b i 10 6 g l b i 10 3 10 9 g l in which b i is the concentration of biomarker i µg l or copies l the population was estimated using b 103 as b in the eq 4 and the unit of estimated population contributing to wastewater p became person l the

indirect approach the c2 i was further standardized by the c0 as 11 f o l d c h a n g e c 2 i c 0 2 5 validation of normalization coefficients the regression function of two approaches were established to normalize sars cov 2 load using the 24 samples collected in january 2021 table 1 samples collected from 64 wwtps in may 2021 table s1 were utilized as testing data set to validate the estimation of the normalization coefficients c1 i and c2 i from two approaches during the validation c0 was calculated using metadata in eq 5 the c1 i and c2 i were calculated using the concentration of caf and para with eqs 7 and 10 respectively followed by standardization with c0 to evaluate the fitness precision and the variability 2 6 estimation of population contributing to the wastewater 2 6 1 linear regression model to determine the accuracy and precision of population estimated by different biomarkers the log transformed biomarkers loads n 24 collected from 12 wwtps across the state of missouri table1 were used as predictor variable to fit the linear regression model in r 12 p β i b i ϵ i nineteen of the data points approximately 80 was randomly selected as training data set to fit the model and the rest 5 data points were used as test data set the adjusted r2 and the mean square error mse were utilized to evaluate the model fitting and prediction accuracy respectively a k fold cross validation k 5 was performed to eliminate the poor prediction from the outliers and determine the overall predictive capability of the model based the 5 fold cross validation mse refaeilzadeh et al 2009 2 6 2 estimation of real time populations for city of columbia college town and a tourist town the population contributing to the sewershed was expected to fluctuate over the surveillance period due to tourism weekday commuters temporary workers and quarantine etc to monitor the population fluctuation wastewater samples were collected from the wwtps of city of columbia college town and a tourist town over 10 time points table s2 the para load at each given time was calculated using para concentration and the daily flow volume reported in the metadata as in eq 3 the population at each given time was further estimated using the linear regression model built from eq 4 and the calculated para loads 2 7 relationships between sars cov 2 load in wastewater and clinical prevalence the weekly average of sars cov 2 clinical case numbers in city of columbia was collected by the missouri department of health and senior services from may to september 2021 c0 was calculated using metadata in eq 5 c2 para was calculated using the concentration of para in eq 10 sars cov 2 concentration was normalized by c0 and c2 para depending on the scenarios 1 sars cov 2 load per capita normalized by metadata versus clinical cases normalized by metadata 2 sars cov 2 load per capita normalized by c2 para versus clinical cases normalized by metadata and 3 sars cov 2 load per capita normalized by c2 para versus clinical cases normalized by para estimated population using eq 12 spearman s correlation analysis was performed to examine the correlation between normalized sars cov 2 concentration and one week average clinical case numbers 3 results 3 1 relationships between biomarkers and population twenty four samples collected from 12 wwtps in the state of missouri table 1 were used to assess the correlation between biomarkers and pr ratio of population contributing to wastewater to wastewater volume using eq 2 or biomarker and population using eq 4 the linear regression models were fitted by either the biomarker concentration and pr in eq 2 or biomarker loads and population in eq 4 the r square r2 represents the variation of population pr explained by the model the pearson s correlation coefficient r represents the strength of the correlation the concentrations of caf showed the highest correlation pearson coefficients r 0 810 with the pr followed by the concentrations of para r 0 774 pmmov r 0 598 5 hiaa r 0 59 and cre r 0 06 fig s4 and table s4 log transformation has been widely used to process the skewed data it helps to decrease the variability of data and make data conform more closely to the normal distribution feng et al 2013 after log transformation the r was increased to 0 886 for caf 0 861 for para 0 720 for 5 hiaa and 0 707 for pmmov fig 2 however it was not improved for cre the daily load of caf exhibited the highest correlation r 0 99 with population followed by the daily load of 5 hiaa r 0 98 pmmov r 0 98 para r 0 97 and cre r 0 22 fig s5 and table s5 similarly log transformation significantly improved the correlation of all five coefficients the para and caf daily load showed the highest correlation r 0 97 and 0 97 respectively with the population followed pmmov load r 0 92 5 hiaa load r 0 87 and cre load r 0 33 after log transformation fig 3 3 2 comparison of normalization coefficients among different biomarkers the normalization coefficient c1 i or c2 i calculated from biomarker concentration were utilized to normalize sars cov 2 viral load a reliable biomarker for population normalization should achieve high precision and low variability meaning that the normalization coefficient c1 i or c2 i for biomarker i should be comparable to c0 calculated from the population and daily flow volume derived from metadata hence when the normalization coefficients from different biomarkers were standardized by c0 as fold change c1 i c0 the closer to 1 y 1 the fold change is the higher precision and lower variability the biomarker obtains in the direct normalization approach c1 i were calculated using the eq 7 and biomarker concentrations caf outperformed other biomarkers resulting from the lower variation and higher precision in comparison of the c1 i of all other biomarkers fig 4 and table s6 most of c1 5 hiaa and c1 pmmov among wastewater facilities showed variation above the baseline y 1 which could result in over normalization of sars cov 2 the relatively high variation of c1 5 hiaa and c1 pmmov could over normalize or under normalize the c1 cre results were not included in this comparison due to its poor correlation with population therefore the results suggested that the caf should be the most suitable biomarker for the direct normalization approach followed by para 5 hiaa and then pmmov at last in the indirect normalization approach the normalization coefficients c2 i were calculated with the data transformed biomarker concentrations in eq 9 followed by standardization by c0 and expressed as fold change c2 i c0 the fold change c2 para c0 of para outperformed other biomarkers due to its lower variation and higher precision fig 5 and table s7 among all biomarkers cre exhibited the highest variation and lowest precision thus the most suitable biomarker for the indirect normalization approach would be para followed by caf pmmov and 5 hiaa 3 3 normalization of sars cov 2 load per capita the sars cov 2 loads normalized by biomarkers copies person were directly calculated by multiplying the viral concentrations with the normalization coefficient of the corresponding biomarker fig 6 demonstrated the biomarker normalized viral per capita of each selected facility in the state of missouri for the week of january 19th and week of january 23rd 2021 unlike most of the current sars cov 2 wastewater based epidemiology programs our normalization strategy allows us to compare the viral load per capita among the sewersheds cross the geographic gradient the vulnerability meant high risk of the exposure and transmissibility among the communities due to the potential of the high infection rates e g viral load per capital in wastewater high clinical cases population high risk the vulnerable community was identified by comparing the viral load per capita among the sewersheds as function of time the viral load per capita was determined by the sars cov 2 load normalized by the population which was estimated with the population biomarkers for example viral load per capita at brook wwtp in week of january 19th fig 6b and d was significantly higher than other sewersheds and the viral load per capita in week of january 19th was much higher than a week earlier fig 6a and c suggesting that the brook was a vulnerable community that might soon encounter high covid 19 illness and high infection rate 3 4 validation of normalization coefficients based on the value of fold change caf and para achieved the lowest variability and highest accuracy and precision figs 4 and 5 these normalization approaches were further validated the using wastewater samples collected from 64 wwtps in the state of missouri in may 2021 table s1 the normalization coefficients c1 caf c1 para c2 caf and c2 para for each wwtp was calculated using the established regression functions between caf para and population tables s4 and s5 without metadata these coefficients were normalized by c0 derived from metadata to assess the fitness precision and variability there was no significant difference between the normalization coefficients of caf and para when the direct approach or indirect approach was applied fig 7 tables s8 and s9 the mean of fold change of caf and para from direct and indirect approach were both close to 1 high precision with few outliers low variability these results not only concurred with the results shown in figs 4 and 5 but also indicated that the regression functions developed in this study could be used for normalizing sars cov 2 load without metadata in the future 3 5 estimation of real time population contributing to the wastewater the precision of real time biomarker estimated populations were assessed by fitting regression models with the biomarker loads using r program para achieved the highest adjusted r square followed by caf 5 hiaa pmmov and cre table 4 the para showed the lowest mean square error mse which is the parameter used for assessing the prediction accuracy by the developed model and it was increased in the order of caf pmmov 5 hiaa and cre again para obtained the lowest 5 fold cross validation mse suggesting that para is the most suitable biomarker for estimating the population to accurately normalize sars cov 2 loads per capita over time the populations at a college town and a tourist town were estimated using the para concentrations in wastewater samples collected through may to early september in 2021 when the daily flow volume was available the real time population was predicted by the biomarker loads using the established biomarker loads vs populations regression functions in eq 3 table s5 the results showed the real time population dynamic of population at city of columbia especially in late may august and early september fig 8 a the variation of estimated populations in columbia were from 36 to 8 compared to the population reported in metadata the change in the real time population from may to early september in a tourist town were observed in similar pattern fig 8b 3 6 correlation between sars cov 2 load per capita and clinical prevalence it was demonstrated in fig 9 that the relation between sars cov 2 levels in the wastewater and clinical cases could be mispresented without a proper normalization using a reliable population marker this is mainly attributed to that the population in the city of columbia was constantly fluctuating over the surveillance period fig 8a the spearman s rank correlation was performed to understand the correlation between viral loads and prevalence data udovičić et al 2007 spearman s correlation coefficient rho represents strength of the correlation between viral loads and prevalence data for instance the correlation between the average weekly case number and the sars cov 2 concentration over time was insignificant rho 0 5152 p 0 1 before normalization fig 9a the rho was reduced to 0 47 p 0 1 after the viral concentration and clinical case number were both normalized by the fixed population from the metadata through population census fig 9b similarly as the viral concentration normalized by para estimated population copies person plotted against the clinical case numbers normalized by metadata case number 100 000 people rho dropped to 0 50 p 0 1 fig 9c in contrast when both viral load and clinical case number were properly normalized by para estimated population the correlation was positive and moderate rho 0 59 p 0 05 fig 9d 4 discussion 4 1 population biomarker selection our findings suggested the chemical marker para is more reliable population biomarker than pmmov due to its 1 better population indicators with higher accuracy lower variability figs 4 and 5 and higher temporal consistency fig 8 2 very limited exogenous sources summers et al 2015 3 higher extraction efficiency with low variability table 5 4 higher stability in wastewater choi et al 2020 5 resistant to chemicals in the wastewater armanious et al 2016 and 6 low sample volume requirement with simple sample preparation process table 5 although pmmov is recommended by us cdc and european commission as population fecal biomarker to normalize sars cov 2 concentrations 4 1 1 population indicators pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and caffeine are commonly found in human diet the log transformed para caffeine metabolite daily load in wastewater demonstrated better correlation with population r 0 97 as compared to pmmov r 0 92 fig 3 resulting para outperformed pmmov no matter which normalization was applied the variability in biomarker shedding could result from different social and cultural variations influencing food habits the per capita availability of fresh bell pepper and processed chile pepper were 11 3 and 7 9 ponds in 2021 in the united states davis et al 2022 an early study holezer et al 2012 reported that women and members of high income households are the most likely subpopulations to consume peppers regarding ethnicity hispanic is more likely to consume peppers as compared to white black and others with respect to age elders 50 years old are more likely to consume peppers as compared to adults aged 14 to 49 years and children under 14 are less likely to do so as compared to adults although the metabolite of the caffeine para has been recognized as the reliable population biomarker caffeine intake could be affected by the ethnicity and age for example non hispanic black individuals consumed the smallest amounts 80 2 mg d non hispanic white individuals consumed the greatest amounts 194 3 mg d and asian individuals 126 7 mg d and hispanic individuals consumed intermediate amounts 127 3 mg d middle aged individuals aged 50 to 54 years consumed more caffeine 211 6 mg d than younger 107 4 mg d aged 20 to 24 years and older individuals 153 4 mg d aged 75 to 79 years lieberman et al 2019 daily caffeine intake from beverages was 14 mg day in children aged 1 to 5 years old and 22 mg day in children aged 6 to 9 years old knight et al 2004 interestingly the caffeine intake was not associated with physical activity economic status education level or employment status lieberman et al 2019 4 1 2 exogenous sources unlike caf and pmmov para is the metabolite product generated through the human consumption of the caffeinated products coffee tea and caffeinated drinks indicating that human is the major source contributing para in the wastewater in humans 80 of caffeine is metabolized into paraxanthine martínez bueno et al 2011 the production of the para could be also attributed to the microbial degradation of caffeine in the environments however since it is not the predominant microbial degradation pathway the amount of para produced through this process is very limited summers et al 2015 therefore we could assume that para loading in wwtp was mostly generated through human consumption of caffeine the exogenous sources of pmmov could be from chicken and seagull feces rosario et al 2009 the pmmov widely detected in the groundwater irrigation water and surface water rivers ponds asami et al 2016 hamza et al 2011 kuroda et al 2015 rosiles gonzález et al 2017 also suggested that pmmov might have other exogenous sources that could contribute to wastewater in addition recently several sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance projects in the u s have reported the increased levels of pmmov after the major stormwater events further investigation suggested the potential exogenous sources of the pmmov from agricultural soils suspended sediments and fertilizers personal communication 4 1 3 extraction efficiency variation in the extraction rates ahmed et al 2020b variations in the extraction rates of pmmov that have been widely reported is another drawback feng et al 2021 kato et al 2018 laturner et al 2021 feng et al reported a recovery of 45 26 pmmov using direct extraction with ha filters the pmmov was also poorly correlated with the recovery of the sars cov 2 enveloped virus similarly kato et al reported a wide variability of the pmmov recovery efficiencies with typical recovery rates only greater than 10 when concentrating using electronegative filters kato et al 2018 the high variability among different concentration techniques for pmmov analysis including direct extraction ha filtration filtration with bead bearing peg precipitation and ultrafiltration have been illustrated by laturner et al 2021 the coefficient of variation cv for these concentration techniques range from 25 9 to 49 8 feng et al reported that the variability in the pmmov extraction rates might have contributed to the decreased correlation coefficient between the normalized sars cov 2 concentration and the clinic cases in most of wwtp facilities reported by previous studies feng et al 2021 among the genic fecal markers although pmmov has demonstrated a less variable rna signal compared to bacteroides 16s rrna or human eukaryotic 18s rrna the variability of pmmov assay could be significant with ct variance from 1 18 to 1 34 d aoust et al 2021 feng et al 2021 4 1 4 stability in wastewater although pmmov has been known to be persistent in the soils the results of an incubation study suggested that the half lives of the pmmov in river water ranges from 7 to 10 days depending on the temperatures at 0 c pmmov showed 1 1 log10 reduction 7 9 remaining after 21 days of incubation in river water with pmmov half life of about 7 days at 25 c pmmov showed 3 7 log10 reduction 0 02 remaining after 21 days of incubation in river water with a half life of about 10 days as compared to more stable caf and para the relative short half life of the pmmov suggest that the pmmov assays need to be completed within 1 week after the samples are received even they are properly stored at 4 c 4 1 5 resistant to chemicals in the wastewater both caf and para the major metabolite of caffeine exhibited good consistent high recovery rates and high stability in the wastewater as compared to pmmpov table 5 the average recovery rates of caf and para in our study were 101 and 92 with standard deviation of 7 and 3 respectively similar to 73 to 109 for caf and its metabolites reported by driver et al 2020 both caf and para were found to be relatively stable in the sewer system choi et al 2020 the caf and para have several unique characteristics that are critical to serve as the reliable chemical fecal population markers they are highly soluble in water 13 g l 1 with a very low hydrophobicity octanol water coefficient log kow 0 07 insignificant volatility and its half life is about 10 years buerge et al 2006 chen et al 2012 froehner and martins 2008 lin et al 2009 due to the high polarity and water solubility caf and para will less likely to adhere to the solids fraction of wastewaters via electrostatic and or hydrophobic partitioning effects as the pmmov biomarker described by armanious et al 2016 as the wastewater stored at 20 c the para could be stable for at least 4 weeks or more choi et al 2020 senta et al 2015 with our new modified direct methanol dilution extraction protocol 50 methanol we anticipate that the caf and para extracts could be stable beyond several months when they are stored at 20 c under the 50 methanol sterilized solution buerge et al 2003 4 1 6 sample preparation and analysis the sample volume required for analysis for para is less than 2 ml 0 1ml with a modified methanol extraction protocol that is significantly less than 25 50 ml sample volume required for pmmov analysis table 5 another advantage for using para as the fecal marker is that it required less sample preparation time and processes an average sample preparation time for para analysis was less than 30 min 6 samples with new modified methanol extraction protocols it could be further reduced to 10 min 6 samples while the sample preparation time e g extraction and concentration for pmmov analysis often takes approximate 3 h pmmov can be used simultaneously quantified as the targets sars cov 2 viral nucleic acid using the rt qpcr multiplex platforms while caf and para were quantified using lc ms ms separately despite that no inhibition observed in the one step rt qpcr assay in our study rt qpcr inhibition have been reported by several studies kato et al 2018 quality control internal standards and dilution protocols are often required to account for any pcr inhibition incorporation of the internal positive control such as a modified targeted gene sequence or cgmmv are often required to correct the variation in the extraction efficiency plus any potential inhibition kato et al 2018 other emerging pcr based techniques such as rt droplet digital pcr rt ddpcr and digital qpcr were also used for quantifying pmmov hinkle et al 2022 p nevertheless they are less affordable and their implementation in the wbe pipeline requires more time without lc ms ms caf and para could be quantified by other less expensive alternative analytical techniques such as gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms high performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detector hplc pda due to their much higher concentrations in the wastewater sample chen et al 2002 thomas and foster 2004 additionally if the population within sewershed did not fluctuate over time quantification of para could be performed at core facilities equipped with lc ms ms once a while 4 1 7 other biomarkers other biomarkers selected in this study did not meet the criteria of population biomarker the levels of the creatinine the metabolite of muscle did not correlate with population consistent with the results reported by thai et al 2019 2014 the poor correlation could be due to its instability in wastewater treatment designs and processes high variance of intra and extra individual excretion daughton 2012 thai et al 2014 the 5 hiaa one of the major metabolites of serotonin correlated with population well and it has been reported to be stable in wastewater thai et al 2019 nevertheless the low concentrations in the wastewater and the observed coeluted interferences in the lcmsms analysis the time required for sample preparation and cleanup particular the time consuming concentration and cleanup processes through solid phase extraction spe make the 5 hiaa not an ideal marker candidate for real time and rapid analysis in addition a sensitive tandem mass spectrometer is the only option for quantifying the 5 hiaa in the wastewater due to its low sub ppb to ppb concentration range while although caf and para shared similar characteristics in wastewater caf loading might result from discarded caffeinated products and therefore make para more desirable population biomarker 4 2 normalization of sars cov 2 load and method validation the utility of chemical biomarkers for human fecal normalization in sras cov 2 wbe surveillance was so far very limited and the most normalization process simply divides the concentration of viral load by the concentrations of pmmov and generate a unitless normalized values ai et al 2021 d aoust et al 2021 feng et al 2021 greenwald et al 2021 isaksson et al 2022 this study investigated several alternative chemical population biomarkers in sars cov 2 wbe and normalization of sars cov 2 to copies per capital the concentrations of biomarkers determined by lc ms ms were applied to the exercise in correlation with population to generate their normalization coefficient the viral loads per capita were determined using the normalization coefficient of each chemical population biomarker both direct and indirect approaches aimed at precisely estimating the population contributing to wastewater that would be applied in the following determination of the viral load per capita figs 2 and 3 the normalization coefficient calculated from different biomarkers can be compared and evaluated before sars cov 2 concentration was involved most importantly our normalization approaches can be proceeded without daily flow volume and the size of the population using the developed regression functions tables s4 and s5 unlike the traditional normalization that requires the information of the daily flow volume and population size the sars cov 2 concentration was converted to mass using daily flow volume followed by being divided by population served by the wwtp fig 1a to obtain viral loads per capita copies 100 000 people in our normalization approaches the parameter fold changes the normalization coefficients c1 and c2 standardized by c0 from metadata were utilized to evaluate the fitness of the biomarkers for each normalization approach as compared to the traditional method the fold change that is closes to 1 indicates the highest accuracy for example in the direct approach fold changes for caf and para were 1 041 0 3111 mean standard deviation and 1 057 0 389 respectively in the indirectly approach fold changes for caf and para were 0 967 0 324 and 1 042 0 341 respectively both caf and para showed high accuracy and low variability in either approach on the contrary 5 hiaa and pmmov both showed significant difference in the values of the fold changes between two approaches the 5 hiaa fold change was 1 150 0 661 with the direct approach but 1 470 1 144 in the indirect approach whereas pmmov performed better 1 003 0 586 with the indirect approach than 1 166 0 737 in the direct approach tables s6 and 7 the high accuracy and low variability for caf and para are possibly attributed to high reproducibility of the analysis high recovery rates stability of these molecules and low adsorption affinity to the solids fraction of wastewaters furthermore the regression functions established by caf and para in our two approaches can be utilized to normalizing saras cov 2 in the long term monitoring without knowing daily flow volume and population size in the future wbe applications the normalization approaches were validated using additional 64 samples collected from may 2021 table s1 with the established regression functions of caf and para tables s4 and s5 the fold changes of caf and para calculated from these additional 64 samples exhibited high precision and low variation in both direct and indirect approaches fig 7 the results were consistent with our results from the developed models figs 4 and 5 indicating the validation was successful the indirect normalization approach is more accurate than the direct approach both approaches were assumed the mass of biomarker correlates to the population but the volume was taken into consideration in different ways for the direct approach the volume was utilized to calculate the ratio of population contributing to wastewater to the wastewater volume pr number of people l it could vary due to different designs of wwtps the correlation between biomarker concentrations µg l and pr was significantly positive fig 3 in the indirect approach the flow volume was incorporated when the biomarker concentration was converted to mass the correlation from both approaches remained positive even though flow volume was taken into consideration differently figs 3 and 4 however the correlation between biomarker mass and population was stronger as compared to the one between biomarker concentration and pr which affected the accuracy of population estimation tables s4 and s5 subsequently only the regression functions developed for indirect approaches were applied to estimate the real time population this is the first study to normalize the sars cov 2 load with biomarker estimated population and to accomplish viral load per capita with a universal unit copies person several previous studies utilized biomarker to normalize sars cov 2 concentrations but only achieved a unitless results eg n1 n2 copies copies of genetic biomarker green et al reported the ratio of sars cov 2 crassphage in the wastewater n1 or n2 copies copies of biomarker pmmov bcov hf183 crassphage and bacteroides rrna in the wastewater were reported by several studies d aoust et al and wolfe et al presented copies copy of pmmov in solids table s10 furthermore normalizing does not consistently improve correlations with covid 19 cases within sewershed wolfe et al 2021 for instance feng et al reported normalizing sars cov 2 to hf183 and pmmov reduced correlations in 5 and 8 of 12 wwtps respectively feng et al 2021 results from greenwald et al showed normalizing sars cov 2 n1 to pmmov or bacteroides rrna did not improve he correlation greenwald et al 2021 ali et al reported correlation was slightly improved by normalizing sars cov 2 n2 to pmmov but it was reduced by normalizing to crassphage ai et al 2021 nevertheless according to our findings fig 9 the biomarker estimated population should be incorporated into surveillance programs so the normalization can reflect the real viral load per capita to be compared over time and cross facilities and be further utilized for predicting the trend of covid 19 prevalence 4 3 relationship among estimated real time population sars cov 2 in wastewater and covid 19 incidences no matter which biomarker was used to estimate the population the population data from census or wwtp operators could introduce significant possibility for error despite estimating real time population was to examine its correlation with biomarker in the wastewater collected on census day o brien et al 2014 the census population still did not capture the daily commuters or tourists consequently the population provided by wwtp operators is the best available data for real time population assessment the fluctuations in the population posed a challenge to wbe long term monitoring polo et al 2020 when the population contributing to the sewershed is expected to constantly change over the surveillance period due to tourism weekday commuters temporary workers etc population normalization becomes extremely critical for interpreting sars cov 2 concentrations and predicting the trend and the infected population over time we successfully demonstrated the utility of para for gauging small area populations in real time and captured the population dynamics in a college town and a tourist town fig 8 since para gave the highest adjusted r square with lowest mse and 5 fold cross validation mse in the population predicting model table 4 our findings directly corresponded the fluctuations in the population due to seasonal activities in these tourist town and university community such as the summer breaks holidays e g labor day weekend in september and tourisms we strongly believe that population dynamic should be taken into consideration when the clinical cases are normalized for long term monitoring the caf and its metabolites para have been proposed as anthropogenic markers to assess the population size and trace the discharge of domestic wastewater in rivers and lakes buerge et al 2003 senta et al reported the para loads in the wastewater reflected the population dynamics senta et al 2015 we demonstrated the significantly improved correlation between para normalized sars cov 2 load per capita and the prevalence using a college town as an example fig 9 among 3 normalization scenarios fig 9 only the para normalized sars cov 2 load copies person and para normalized cases case number 100 000 people yielded a statistically significant correlation rho 0 5878 p 0 05 our results indicated that a fixed population often derived from population census is not ideal for long term monitoring it can be challenging to capture the population dynamic during the covid 19 pandemic with the conventional methodologies based on periodic public surveys such as census taking augmented with a wide array of demographic statistics most of the inaccurate population data often derived from aged or incomplete sources such as census surveys or utility customers billed e g anderson et al 2004 banta green et al 2009 clara et al 2011 kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 neset et al 2010 ort et al 2009 rowsell et al 2010 tsuzuki 2006 particularly during current pandemic population dynamics often deviate significantly from the population estimated by the conventional methodologies due to the introduction of restrictions in control of the spread of sars cov 2 unreliable population biomarkers often result in the poor correlation between the normalized sars cov 2 levels and prevalence for example feng et al reported normalizing sars cov 2 concentration in the wastewater to fecal marker hf183 and pmmov reduced correlations in 5 and 8 of 12 wwtps respectively compared to the correlation before normalization feng et al 2021 greenwald et al also reported normalizing sars cov 2 load using crassphage pmmov and bacteroides rrna in the wastewater samples deteriorated the correlation with daily case number per capita in comparison with the correlation between non normalized concentrations and daily case numbers greenwald et al 2021 according to our results correlations could be significantly compromised when the fixed populations were applied to normalize the viral loads as well as the clinical cases 5 conclusion our findings suggested that the caf metabolite para is a reliable population biomarker in sars cov 2 wastewater based epidemiology studies due to its 1 better population indicators with higher accuracy lower variability and higher temporal consistency as a population indicator to reflect the change in population dynamics and dilution in wastewater 2 very limited exogenous sources 3 high extraction efficiency with low variability in the extraction rates 4 high stability 5 resistance to chemicals in the wastewater and 6 low sample volume requirement with simple sample preparation process this chemical biomarker offers an excellent alternative to the currently cdc recommended pmmov genetic biomarker to help us understand the size distribution and dynamics of local populations for forecasting the prevalence of sars cov2 within each sewershed furthermore the regression functions embedded in the direct and indirect approaches of normalizing viral loads by biomarker could be applied to new data without known daily flow volume and population finally the clinical cases should also be normalized by population dynamics when the correlation between sars cov 2 and prevalence were examined funding and acknowledgements the authors would like to

15593,understanding the sources structure and fate of dissolved organic matter dom in groundwater is paramount for the protection and sustainable use of this vital resource on its passage through the critical zone dom is subject to biogeochemical conversions therefore it carries valuable cross habitat information for monitoring and predicting the stability of groundwater ecosystem services and assessing these ecosystems response to fluctuations caused by external impacts such as climatic extremes challenges arise from insufficient knowledge on groundwater metabolite composition and dynamics due to a lack of consistent analytical approaches for long term monitoring our study establishes groundwater metabolomics to decipher the complex biogeochemical transport and conversion of dom we explore fractured sedimentary bedrock along a hillslope recharge area by a 5 year untargeted metabolomics monitoring of oxic perched and anoxic phreatic groundwater a summer with extremely high temperatures and low precipitation was included in the monitoring water was accessed by a monitoring well transect and regularly collected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms investigation dimension reduction of the resulting complex data set by principal component analysis revealed that metabolome dissimilarities between distant wells coincide with transient cross stratal flow indicated by groundwater levels time series of the groundwater metabolome data provides detailed insights into subsurface responses to recharge dynamics we demonstrate that dissimilarity variability between groundwater bodies with contrasting aquifer properties coincides with recharge dynamics this includes groundwater high and lowstands as well as recharge and recession phases our monitoring approach allows to survey groundwater ecosystems even under extreme conditions notably the metabolome was highly variable lacking seasonal patterns and did not segregate by geographical location of sampling wells thus ruling out vegetation or agricultural land use as a primary driving factor patterns that emerge from metabolomics monitoring give insight into subsurface ecosystem

riebe et al 2017 for sustainable resource management and groundwater protection a sound understanding of recharge areas hydrogeological and ecological functioning is required lehmann and totsche 2020 multi disciplinary temporally highly resolved and long term monitoring efforts can provide valuable insight and support concepts for management however such approaches are still rare except for targeted investigations of contaminants fernandes et al 2021 to date we have no information about spatial and temporal patterns and dynamics of the entirety of metabolites and their transformation products here termed as metabolome in the groundwater such information is especially required for vulnerable recharge areas where cross compartment matter exchange lehmann and totsche 2020 and dynamics of microbial activity contribute to the evolution of groundwater quality benk et al 2019 fractured sedimentary bedrock with mixed lithologies hosts important groundwater reservoirs worldwide these reservoirs are challenging to investigate due to the interplay of transient flow patterns and various sedimentary or surface fed sources of organic matter in addition the dynamics of microbial communities their metabolic activity and their long term persistence influence the groundwater metabolome assessing the temporal dynamics of the groundwater metabolome may provide cross habitat information in multiple ways metabolic composition reflects the input from above ground and contributions from mobile and rock associated microbial populations in high permeability fractures and low permeability rock matrices environments in addition abiotic transformations contribute to metabolic diversity below ground chorover and amistadi 2001 untargeted metabolomics techniques are emerging

2019 wologo et al 2021 as sub surface metabolites are not well characterized exact compound annotation is challenging therefore previous studies focused on selected marker molecules and compound class categorization however fingerprint analyzes by multivariate approaches such as principal component analysis pca also proved a powerful tool for the analysis of aggregated monitoring data benk et al 2019 2018 schwab et al 2017 ueberschaar et al 2021 these approaches allowed for the categorization of similarities across compartments that can be linked to subsurface connectivity küsel et al 2016 lehmann and totsche 2020 and the composition of groundwater microbiomes benk et al 2019 yan et al 2020 here we present a long term high resolution analysis of groundwater metabolome patterns in triassic limestone mudstone alternations of a topographic recharge area fig 1 we profiled both perched and phreatic groundwater for over 5 years at multiple locations the assessment is based on untargeted metabolomics using data from liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry lc ms a two step data analysis approach is chosen metabolome data per individual monitoring well is analyzed over time giving seasonal and intra annual data at specific locations in addition data are analyzed by generating a dissimilarity score at each timepoint by which evolving metabolomes are investigated over time while a detailed analysis of the metabolomes at a single time point was conducted previously sanchez arcos et al 2022 the data analysis presented here aimed at exploring the metabolome structure and dynamics in distinct zones of the groundwater recharge area shown in fig 1 the metabolomic dataset is embedded in an extensive assessment of environmental data this includes water levels inorganic ions doc sum parameter and other basic hydrochemical parameters such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen and electric conductivity these large sets of basic parameters allow for the reconstruction of flow regimes and ecosystem compartmentalization lehmann and totsche 2020 in this context untargeted metabolomics enables the understanding of subsurface ecosystem functioning by untangling the specific information contained in dom the metabolome reflects the signal resulting from the surface and subsurface sources e g sedimentary carbon turnover and all abiotic and biotic transformations of organic metabolites within the critical zone until the time of sampling the groundwater metabolome thus contains cross habitat information potentially revealing whole ecosystem functioning and stability notably the metabolic output will not associate with individual organisms but with microbial communities thus metabolomic assessment represents a proxy for metabolic activity in cross habitat microbial populations 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the exemplary studied groundwater recharge area is part of the hainich critical zone exploratory or observatory in nw thuringia central germany it was established by the collaborative research center aquadiva focusing on subsurface biodiversity groundwater quality and its surface and subsurface controls the exploratory and the selection criteria for the wells are introduced in küsel et al 2016 the site represents fractured sedimentary bedrock environments or more specifically widely distributed mixed carbonate siliciclastic rock alternations as well as groundwater reservoirs in agricultural catchments with forested recharge areas in low mountain terrain the monitoring well transect spans ca 5 km along the eastern hillslope of the hainich mountain range comprising different relief positions aquifers and depths see fig 1 the wells access perched groundwater bodies in the upper slope of a thick aeration zone and phreatic groundwater in downslope positions with depths between 7 and 88 m below ground level kohlhepp et al 2017 in this study analysis includes data from each three wells in mid to footslope positions h41 h43 and h51 h53 phreatic zone only one upper midslope well h32 perched groundwater was included in the analysis since it was the only one at that site that accessed groundwater

during joint usually monthly sampling campaigns as described previously küsel et al 2016 lehmann and totsche 2020 each 5 l of groundwater per well were sampled in triplicate borosilicate bottles by

solid phase extraction spe on strata x 33 µm polymeric reversed phase cartridges 500 mg phenomenex 8b s100 hch prior to extraction the spe cartridges were placed on a supelco visiprep dl 24 manifold merck sigma aldrich 57 265 and conditioned with 5 ml lc ms grade methanol subsequently gf c filters placed in a swinnex 47 mm diameter filter holder carl roth xe88 1 were assembled onto the cartridges

2015 package xcms benton et al 2010 smith et al 2006 tautenhahn et al 2008 datasets were analyzed with standardized xcms parameters and crucial steps are described in the following during data conversion to mzxml by proteowizard positive mode lc ms traces were extracted in the time range 50 570 s in which recordings were overlapping for lc ms methods 1 to 3 as described above the converted files were read into and analyzed by xcms with function readmsdata peak identification and integration with parameters defined in centwaveparam retention time adjustment was carried out with the obiwarp method and grouping and peak filling from baseline data was executed with groupchrompeaks and fillchrompeaks respectively the table of integrated peaks was extracted with the featurevalues function for hierarchical clustering of metabolite feature traces peak intensities were z normalized cooksey 2020 miller et al 2015 and averages and standard deviations were calculated for the technical replicates i e triplicate lcms injections and groundwater replicates triplicates standard deviation via pooled variance clustering was carried out by the r function cor with pearson

intensities were changed to not applicable na and the peak intensity table was log2 transformed again averages and standard deviations were calculated for the technical replicates i e triplicate lc ms injections and groundwater replicates triplicates standard deviation via pooled variance principal component analysis ivanisevic and want 2019 nguyen and holmes 2019 worley and powers 2012 pca was carried out with r s prcomp function on centered peak intensity data omitting nas on the groundwater replicate averages dataset with the resulting rotation data sample averages and standard deviations were transformed into the pc1 pc2 space for long term analysis of consistent analysis periods data for one sampling point at different time points was fed into the pca notably measurement parameters may drift over time such as for a changes in chromatography columns and lc methods and b due to the long time period drifts in e g lc column capacities and separation efficiency that may complicate integrated data analysis involving retention time alignments of chromatograms we therefore conducted an additional analysis where pcas were carried out for each sampling campaign i e time points with a complete set of seven sampling locations from the hainich cze wells h32 h41 3 and h51 3 compare fig 1 distances between each two datapoints i e between the measurement averages in the pc1 pc2 space were calculated and the standard deviations of the distances were calculated via the pooled weighted variance in the direction of the connecting line as follows knowing the differences between datapoints in the direction of the pc1 and pc2 axis respectively the distance was inferred from pythagoras law as 1 δ well 1 well 2 δ well 1 well 2 2 p c 1 δ well 1 well 2 2 p c 2 where δwell1 well2 indicates the distance between two data points in the pc1 pc2 space and δ2 well1 well2 pc1 and δ2 well1 well2 pc2 the squares of the distances in the principal components 1 and 2 respectively the angle α of the connecting line measured from pc1 axis was inferred by 2 α a r c c o s δ well 1 well 2 2 p c 1 δ well 1 well 2 where arccos is the arccosine also sometimes expressed as cos 1 the standard deviation in the pc1 pc2 space was considered as elliptical space wang et al 2015 yuill 1971 with limits defined by the respective standard deviations in the first two principal components δ pc1 and δ pc2 from these limits the coordinates of the standard deviation ellipse for all angles α were associated with an angle ϕ on the limit circles so that 3 c o o r d i n a t e p c 1 c o o r d i n a t e p c 2 δ pc1 c o s ϕ δ pc2 s i n ϕ where coordinates define the standard deviation ellipse as vectors with respective values in the direction of pc1 and pc2 for each angle ϕ and δ signifies standard deviations the length of the standard deviation vector at the angle α that determines the orientation of the connecting line between the data points of well 1 and 2 can therefore be calculated from the individual standard deviations δ pc1 and δ pc2 by determining the angle ϕ defining angle that determines the value on the standard deviational ellipse in the orientation of α with the following equation 4 ϕ a r c c o s c o s α 2 δ y 2 δ x 2 1 c o s α 2 c o s α 2 δ y 2 δ x 2 and using pythagoras law as 5 δ δ well 1 α δ pc 1 well 1 c o s ϕ 2 δ pc 2 well 2 s i n ϕ 2 6 δ δ well 2 α δ pc 1 well 2 c o s ϕ 2 δ pc 2 well 2 s i n ϕ 2 this allows to calculate a standard deviation for each of the sampling wells in the pc1 pc2 space in the direction of the connecting line between the data points the standard deviation of the well distance was calculated via the pooled weighted variance from the individual standard deviations of the datapoints with equal sample sizes leaving the weighting term obsolete the difference between the wells was thereafter divided by the standard deviation of the difference which expresses the distance as multiples of its standard deviation 7 differences in multiples of σ δ w e l l 1 w e l l 2 δ δ w e l l 1 w e l l 2 α δ w e l l 1 w e l l 2 δ w e l l 1 2 α δ w e l l 2 2 α where σ sigma refers to the standard deviation of the distance between the data points for well 1 and well 2 in the pc1 pc2 space note for statistical assessment that for a normal distributed random sample the 1σ and 2σ ranges mark the intervals expectedly containing 68 and 95 of observations respectively wang et al 2015 to analyze the dissimilarity of wells over time the well differences in multiples of σ were compared by plotting them against the date of sampling campaigns 3 results and discussion 3 1 dimension reduction of metabolome data reveals responses to high flow conditions in the aeration and phreatic zone the long term monitoring of groundwater bodies with contrasting aquifer properties along a topographic recharge area provided a metabolomic data set suitable for determining spatiotemporal patterns groundwater sampling filtration and extraction on reversed phase material were optimized for reproducibility recovery and robustness extracts were measured with high resolution lc ms using reversed phase ultra high pressure liquid chromatography uhplc for separation recently a systematic analysis of the metabolomes from different wells at a single time point was reported sanchez arcos et al 2022 here we focus on pattern recognition in the long term data sets without the aim to elucidate the structure of the detected metabolites the five year monitoring dataset comprised 35 time points when data was collected at three geographical locations from sampling wells at one h32 or three h41 h43 h51 h53 depths this data set was systematically mined to identify patterns according to location depth season and recharge events in addition basic hydrochemical and conventional monitoring parameters including groundwater levels and temperature were collected along with the metabolome the thick hillslope aeration zone containing perched groundwater bodies fig 1 is accessed by well h32 multiple pronounced periods of recharge in the winter half year interspersed by low stand phases were observed there during the monitoring period from 2014 to 2020 fig 2 a during recharge the ca mg carbonate rich water is oxygenated up to 3 8 mg l dissolved oxygen not shown and the temperature dips fig 2a further nitrate is supplied via percolation in the winter half year fig s1 periods of low specific electrical conductivity during early recharge phases indicate short residence times figure s1 dissolved organic carbon doc sum parameter and potassium did not show significant responses to recharge whereas during recession phases warming increasing sulfur sulfate sodium and calcium point to longer residence fig s1 bakalowicz 1994 hudak 2004 the metabolome of well h32 from 09 2014 to 03 2017 consistent monitoring with mostly monthly sampling campaigns revealed a highly variable composition with more than 75 of the metabolite features significantly changing in intensity over time fig 2b d notably the metabolomes at different time points were characterized by singular emergences of metabolite features high z normalised intensities indicated in red rather than recurrent or seasonally reoccuring profiles fig 2b the lack of recurrent signals characterizing the studied setting of thin bedded alternations of carbonate siliciclastic rock may also apply for other groundwater bodies in widely distributed mixed lithology sedimentary reservoirs lacking large fractures or karst conduits thin bedded alternations represent retarded flow systems white 2012 thus generally exhibiting less pronounced dom dynamics by input from the subsurface dom dynamics might result from multidirectional flow dynamics within groundwater recharge areas lehmann and totsche 2020 supplying water and dom from different sources including sedimentary carbon such sediments are common in freshwater aquifers worldwide and the observed patterns might be prototypic franco et al 2017 interannual variability may generally depend on weather and climatic conditions droughts precipitation temperature humphrey et al 2016 phillips et al 2012 riedel and weber 2020 rodell et al 2018 united nations office for disaster risk reduction undrr 2021 elsewhere geochemical tracer investigations revealed that responses to intra annual periodicity in precipitation and associated recharge is reflected in the groundwater composition bonneau et al 2018 bowen et al 2019 jasechko et al 2014 tweed et al 2005 emergence and dissipation of metabolite signals could be linked to these factors within the course of a year the first two determining principle components revealed considerable patterns when metabolic signatures throughout the sampling period were analyzed fig 2c the most striking was an observed shift coinciding with the high flow period 12 2015 05 2016 causing a disturbance in the pca fig 2c lower half similarly the high flow periods 11 2014 06 2015 upper left of pca and 11 2016 04 2017 fig 2c upper right caused separate clusters interspersed by distinct phases such as the low stand phase 06 2015 11 2016 fig 2c center left the much deeper phreatic zone well h52 fig 1 was characterized by damped though high magnitude water table fluctuation of more than 18 m due to seasonal recharge dynamics figs 3 a supplementary fig s2 compared to the perched groundwater the oxygen free ca mg carbonate water is low in nitrate and high in sulfate as indicated by less surface fed input this aquifer zone is characterized by more isolated conditions lehmann and totsche 2020 during recharge phases increased calcium sulfate fig s2 and hydraulic heads indicate ascending flow from deeper strata lehmann and totsche 2020 increased ec25 associated with increasing sodium and potassium and higher hydraulic heads in the shallower observer h53 fig 3a indicate descending flow during recessions these observations highlight considerable cross stratal exchange lehmann and totsche 2020 in the stratified bedrock doc again showed insignificant fluctuation pointing to the limited merit of the sum parameter in such a sedimentary setting the metabolome in the phreatic groundwater 11 2014 to 03 2017 was also highly variable and exhibited singular emergences of metabolites at high intensities fig 3b d like in the well h32 in the uphill aeration zone and the other wells of the phreatic zone recurrent fluctuations of metabolite signals were missing nevertheless we again observed an association of the pca with the groundwater fluctuation fig 3a c the recharge phase 11 2015 05 2016 contained a clear dispersion in the bottom left of the pca while the subsequent discharge phase caused a cluster transition 08 09 2016 center right with another dispersion during the low stand 01 03 2017 center right while less distinct the recharge phase 12 2014 05 2015 caused a pca shift range 04 06 2015 3 2 general coincidence of temporal metabolome pattern changes and recharge dynamics across sampling sites the association of metabolome pcas with water levels emerged as a consistent observation across the recharge area this was observed in shallow as well as in deep wells spanning different habitat conditions lazar et al 2019 and microbial communities yan et al 2021 2020 we discuss here in detail results from wells h32 and h52 exemplarily as representatives for aeration zone and phreatic zone wells however in all cases h32 h41 to 43 h51 to 53 the metabolome was variable with pronounced shifts in the pca time series particularly in response to high flow recharge phases figs 2 and 3 for h32 and h52 as well as supplementary figs s3 to s8 for the other wells a summary is given in supplementary table 1 highlighting distinct phases in the pcas the association of the first two principal components with water level fluctuation representing cross stratal exchange in the fractured bedrock strata revealed the strong responses to recharge dynamics it is conceivable that high flow phases will modify the dom profile by co transporting organic matter into the groundwater in accordance the dissolved organic carbon doc levels in h32 and h52 were often variable during recharge periods supplementary figs s1 and s2 transport of organic matter by water fluxes can change the groundwater metabolome by the input of novel compounds and microbial biochemical transformations will cause additional variability at our study site it has been recently reported that the microbiome composition is impacted by water recharge phases as observed for the metabolome yan et al 2021 2020 it is conceivable that a changing microbiome will cause a shift in biochemical functions and therefore impact the metabolome composition other impacts on the metabolome will result from changing geochemical parameters for instance ph and oxygen levels that influence abiotic transformations such as mineral catalysed transformations zhang et al 2021 the abovementioned processes can rationalize most of the metabolome profile variations over time however there remain unexplained changes for instance a disturbance in 09 2015 was observed in h52 fig 3 which was also observed in the other h5 wells supplementary figs s7 and s8 table s1 but not in the shallow h32 fig 2 information on location h4 not available this disturbance could neither be explained by the sampling procedure identical nor did it have a clear representation in other measured parameters a possible explanation might be that the corresponding pronounced recession period followed by an extreme lasting groundwater highstand after 2013 might have influenced the prevalence of the specific metabolites 3 3 inter well metabolome similarity suggests cross compartment exchange having established that water level fluctuations leave an imprint in the metabolome over time we queried whether the metabolome also provides evidence for cross compartment exchange along the hillslope recharge area fig 1 in addition to the metabolome data we recorded quality parameters like temperature dissolved oxygen various solutes and doc that have been previously used as environmental tracers to explore local aquifer systems figs s1 and s2 benischke 2021 jiang et al 2021 these parameters fall short in resolution as aggregate parameters like doc are too general with only weak spatiotemporal variation also major inorganic ions only allow interpretation at low resolution compared to the numerous organic analytes accessed by metabolomics techniques other tracers like fluorescent dyes or trace metals need to be deliberately released thereby already impacting the environment we therefore considered that untargeted lc ms based metabolomics monitors a suitable naturally occurring organic tracer set for investigating cross compartment exchange while the extraction of individual marker signals from such datasets would carry the risk of extracting false positive correlations we relied again on dimensionality reduction by pca to determine fingerprints that are more robust against overfitting nguyen and holmes 2019 we considered metabolome data of the seven monitoring wells h32 h41 to 43 and h51 to 53 covering the period from 11 2014 to 06 2020 for each timepoint pcas were generated to determine the principal discriminating components for inter well dissimilarity see materials and methods from these the pca distances between every two wells were inferred and expressed as multiples of the distances standard deviations fig 4 and supplementary figs s9 s13 this allowed us to compare metabolome profiles acquired over the extended monitoring period well h52 was most distinct i e had high scores for the dissimilarity from the other wells fig 4 however phases of similarity to well h53 emerged in 06 07 2015 11 2016 04 2018 07 2019 and 04 2020 at all these timepoints the h5 wells were at or near a peak of groundwater highstand fig 3 and supplementary fig s3 suggesting that ascending flow caused cross stratal exchange and mixing there were also phases of similarity between h52 and the well h51 at times around the highstands in 06 2015 and 09 2016 and an additional phase in 03 2016 where h51 and h52 were approaching their highstand notably in several phases when h52 and h53 were similar the metabolome of the deeper well h51 diverged and had instead higher similarity to the aeration zone well h32 04 2018 2 5 km further upslope see fig 1 or the phreatic wells h41 to h43 07 2019 and 04 2020 than to the wells h52 and h53 supplementary fig s13 these metabolome observations support earlier findings benk et al 2019 of transient local flow patterns that connect even deep and isolated compartments with the surface or shallow upslope zones via ascending flow lehmann and totsche 2020 in accordance multivariate analyzes from aggregated long term hainich monitoring data on the microbiome yan et al 2020 physicochemical parameters kohlhepp et al 2017 schwab et al 2017 and phospholipid derived fatty acids plfa schwab et al 2017 classed the wells h52 and h53 as similar and distinct from the others while a previous metabolomics study benk et al 2019 placed h52 in proximity to h4 wells 1 km uphill see fig 1 but separate from h53 same location but 15 m above the present analysis synergizes these findings by clarifying the changes in well dissimilarities over longer monitoring periods the aeration zone well h32 accessing a perched oxic groundwater body showed variable similarities with all wells but h53 which was consistently different phases of similarities to other wells were consistently observed following to all high flow phases in h32 as follows 11 2014 01 2015 to h41 43 h51 52 06 2015 h41 h43 h51 52 03 04 2016 h42 07 2017 h41 43 h52 04 2018 h41 h51 07 2019 h41 h43 h51 and 04 05 2020 h41 h43 h51 this demonstrates that pca of metabolomics data from long term surveys can be used to derive time traces of dissimilarities by inferring the sample distances in the pc1 pc2 space acknowledging the obstacles of long term data acquisition where metabolomics measurement parameters such as operator device calibration separation column and method may have changed the extraction of pca distances per time point allows integration of long term monitoring data we can conclude that the sedimentary rock groundwaters vary in dissimilarity over time across the hillslope recharge area phases of low dissimilarity emerge coincident with groundwater recharge dynamics covering surface fed as well as subsurface matter exchange previously it has been queried to which extent the surface vegetation or agricultural land use in a recharge area impacts underlying groundwater systems küsel et al 2016 metabolome investigations of soil waters sampled in lysimeters revealed discrete profiles for the input metabolome in forest pasture and agricultural areas ueberschaar et al 2021 for the groundwater wells in fig 1 we have demonstrated elsewhere that the metabolomes of the wells studied on a single sampling day were discernible in relation to the factors land use type aquifer system and sampling depth sanchez arcos et al 2022 we can now show that for the long term groundwater metabolomes fig 4 vertical transport or the locations respective land use types on the surface are not the major determinants instead periods of similarity occur between h32 and wells at the h4 and h5 sites with different land use and different aquifer properties lazar et al 2019 lehmann and totsche 2020 no continuous segregation by land use type was observed implying that its impact on the well metabolomes is either transient or secondary changing similarities are meanwhile mainly driven by variable flow patterns and water stands notably these may become more fluctuating with weather and climatic extremes both which are expected to become more frequent under climate change predictions ipcc 2022 in effect it can be expected that groundwater metabolic diversity may rise further thus posing unprecedented challenges to groundwater microbes and ecosystems 4 conclusion we show that groundwater metabolomics can resolve the sum parameter doc with much detail and disclose hidden information on groundwater ecosystems functioning and dynamics we further demonstrate that groundwater flows exert a major impact on the groundwater metabolome variability which will thus affect the carbon and energy provision to belowground microbial communities such information is essential to discover ecosystem patterns and responses such as groundwater recharge events or climatic extremes that are expected to increase in severity as predicted in climate change scenarios and may impact the discharge recharge cycle generally the groundwater metabolome and its temporal dynamics provide cross habitat information from multiple sources of metabolites covering contributions from microbial populations as well as abiotic transformations this allows for example the recognition of similarities caused by high flow phases in wells that are several kilometers apart the metabolomics approach has the advantage over tracer experiments that it determines natural organic components of the groundwater without the need to introduce markers it closes a critical

15593,understanding the sources structure and fate of dissolved organic matter dom in groundwater is paramount for the protection and sustainable use of this vital resource on its passage through the critical zone dom is subject to biogeochemical conversions therefore it carries valuable cross habitat information for monitoring and predicting the stability of groundwater ecosystem services and assessing these ecosystems response to fluctuations caused by external impacts such as climatic extremes challenges arise from insufficient knowledge on groundwater metabolite composition and dynamics due to a lack of consistent analytical approaches for long term monitoring our study establishes groundwater metabolomics to decipher the complex biogeochemical transport and conversion of dom we explore fractured sedimentary bedrock along a hillslope recharge area by a 5 year untargeted metabolomics monitoring of oxic perched and anoxic phreatic groundwater a summer with extremely high temperatures and low precipitation was included in the monitoring water was accessed by a monitoring well transect and regularly collected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms investigation dimension reduction of the resulting complex data set by principal component analysis revealed that metabolome dissimilarities between distant wells coincide with transient cross stratal flow indicated by groundwater levels time series of the groundwater metabolome data provides detailed insights into subsurface responses to recharge dynamics we demonstrate that dissimilarity variability between groundwater bodies with contrasting aquifer properties coincides with recharge dynamics this includes groundwater high and lowstands as well as recharge and recession phases our monitoring approach allows to survey groundwater ecosystems even under extreme conditions notably the metabolome was highly variable lacking seasonal patterns and did not segregate by geographical

riebe et al 2017 for sustainable resource management and groundwater protection a sound understanding of recharge areas hydrogeological and ecological functioning is required lehmann and totsche 2020 multi disciplinary temporally highly resolved and long term monitoring efforts can provide valuable insight and support concepts for management however such approaches are still rare except for targeted investigations of contaminants fernandes et al 2021 to date we have no information about spatial and temporal patterns and dynamics of the entirety of metabolites and their transformation products here termed as metabolome in the groundwater such information is especially required for vulnerable recharge areas where cross compartment matter exchange lehmann and totsche 2020 and dynamics of microbial activity contribute to the evolution of groundwater quality benk et al 2019 fractured sedimentary bedrock with mixed lithologies hosts important groundwater reservoirs worldwide these reservoirs are challenging to investigate due to the interplay of transient flow patterns and various sedimentary or surface fed sources of organic matter in addition the dynamics of microbial communities their metabolic activity and their long term persistence influence the groundwater metabolome assessing the temporal dynamics of the groundwater metabolome may provide cross habitat information in multiple ways metabolic composition reflects the input from above ground and contributions from mobile and rock associated microbial populations in high permeability fractures and low

2019 wologo et al 2021 as sub surface metabolites are not well characterized exact compound annotation is challenging therefore previous studies focused on selected marker molecules and compound class categorization however fingerprint analyzes by multivariate approaches such as principal component analysis pca also proved a powerful tool for the analysis of aggregated monitoring data benk et al 2019 2018 schwab et al 2017 ueberschaar et al 2021 these approaches allowed for the categorization of similarities across compartments that can be linked to subsurface connectivity küsel et al 2016 lehmann and totsche 2020 and the composition of groundwater microbiomes benk et al 2019 yan et al 2020 here we present a long term high resolution analysis of groundwater metabolome patterns in triassic limestone mudstone alternations of a topographic recharge area fig 1 we profiled both perched and phreatic groundwater for over 5 years at multiple locations the assessment is based on untargeted metabolomics using data from liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry lc ms a two step data analysis approach is chosen metabolome data per individual monitoring well is analyzed over time giving seasonal and intra annual data at specific locations in addition data are analyzed by generating a dissimilarity score at each timepoint by which evolving metabolomes are investigated over time while a detailed analysis of the metabolomes at a single time point was conducted previously sanchez arcos et al 2022 the data analysis presented here aimed at exploring the metabolome structure and dynamics in distinct zones of the groundwater recharge area shown in fig 1 the metabolomic dataset is embedded in an extensive assessment of environmental data this includes water levels inorganic ions doc sum parameter and other basic hydrochemical parameters such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen and electric conductivity these large sets of basic parameters allow for the reconstruction of flow regimes and ecosystem compartmentalization lehmann and totsche 2020 in this context untargeted metabolomics enables the understanding of subsurface ecosystem functioning by untangling the specific information contained in dom the metabolome reflects the signal resulting from the surface and subsurface sources e g sedimentary carbon turnover and all abiotic and biotic transformations of organic metabolites within the critical zone until the time of sampling the groundwater metabolome thus contains cross habitat information potentially revealing whole ecosystem functioning and stability notably the metabolic output will not associate with individual organisms but with microbial communities thus metabolomic assessment represents a proxy for metabolic activity in cross habitat microbial populations 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the exemplary studied groundwater recharge area is part of the hainich critical zone exploratory or observatory in nw thuringia central germany it was established by the collaborative research center aquadiva focusing on subsurface biodiversity groundwater quality and its surface and subsurface controls the exploratory and the selection criteria for the wells are introduced in küsel et al 2016 the site represents fractured sedimentary bedrock environments or more specifically widely distributed mixed carbonate siliciclastic rock alternations as well as groundwater reservoirs in agricultural catchments with forested recharge areas in low mountain terrain the monitoring well transect spans ca 5 km along the eastern hillslope of the hainich mountain range comprising different relief positions aquifers and depths see fig 1 the wells access perched groundwater bodies in the upper slope of a thick aeration zone and phreatic groundwater in downslope positions with depths between 7 and 88 m below ground level kohlhepp et al 2017 in this study analysis includes data from each three wells in mid to footslope positions h41 h43 and h51 h53 phreatic zone only one upper midslope well h32 perched groundwater was included in the analysis since it was the only one at that site that accessed groundwater throughout the period of observation we demonstrate our metabolome analysis for two representative compartments within the studied groundwater recharge area perched groundwater in the shallow aeration

conversion to mzxml by proteowizard positive mode lc ms traces were extracted in the time range 50 570 s in which recordings were overlapping for lc ms methods 1 to 3 as described above the converted

obiwarp method and grouping and peak filling from baseline data was executed with groupchrompeaks and fillchrompeaks respectively the table of integrated peaks was extracted with the featurevalues

carried out with r s prcomp function on centered peak intensity data omitting nas on the groundwater replicate averages dataset with the resulting rotation data sample averages and standard deviations were transformed into the pc1 pc2 space for long term analysis of consistent analysis periods data for one sampling point at different time points was fed into the pca notably measurement parameters may drift over time such as for a changes in chromatography columns and lc methods and b due to the long time period drifts in e g lc column capacities and separation efficiency that may complicate integrated data analysis involving retention time alignments of chromatograms we therefore conducted an additional analysis where pcas were carried out for each sampling campaign i e time points with a complete set of seven sampling locations from the hainich cze wells h32 h41 3 and h51 3 compare fig 1 distances between each two datapoints i e between the measurement averages in the pc1 pc2 space were calculated and the standard deviations of the distances were calculated via the pooled weighted variance in the direction of the connecting line as follows knowing the differences between datapoints in the direction of the pc1 and pc2 axis respectively the distance was inferred from pythagoras law as 1 δ well 1 well 2 δ well 1 well 2 2 p c 1 δ well 1 well 2 2 p c 2 where δwell1 well2 indicates the distance between two data points in the pc1 pc2 space and δ2 well1 well2 pc1 and δ2 well1 well2 pc2 the squares of the distances in the principal components 1 and 2 respectively the angle α of the connecting line measured from pc1 axis was inferred by 2 α a r c c o s δ well 1 well 2 2 p c 1 δ well 1 well 2 where arccos is the arccosine also sometimes expressed as cos 1 the standard deviation in the pc1 pc2 space was considered as elliptical space wang et al 2015 yuill 1971 with limits defined by the respective standard deviations in the first two principal components δ pc1 and δ pc2 from these limits the coordinates of the standard deviation ellipse for all angles α were associated with an angle ϕ on the limit circles so that 3 c o o r d i n a t e p c 1 c o o r d i n a t e p c 2 δ pc1 c o s ϕ δ pc2 s i n ϕ where coordinates define the standard deviation ellipse as vectors with respective values in the direction of pc1 and pc2 for each angle ϕ and δ signifies standard deviations the length of the standard deviation vector at the angle α that determines the orientation of the connecting line between the data points of well 1 and 2 can therefore be calculated from the individual standard deviations δ pc1 and δ pc2 by determining the angle ϕ defining angle that determines the value on the standard deviational ellipse in the orientation of α with

data points the standard deviation of the well distance was calculated via the pooled weighted variance from the individual standard deviations of the datapoints with equal sample sizes leaving the weighting term obsolete the difference between the wells was thereafter divided by the standard deviation of the difference which expresses the distance as multiples of its standard deviation 7

containing 68 and 95 of observations respectively wang et al 2015 to analyze the dissimilarity of wells over time the well differences in multiples of σ were compared by plotting them against the date of sampling campaigns 3 results and discussion 3 1 dimension reduction of metabolome data reveals responses to high flow conditions in the aeration and phreatic zone the long term monitoring of groundwater bodies with contrasting aquifer properties along a topographic recharge area provided a metabolomic data set suitable for determining spatiotemporal patterns groundwater sampling filtration and extraction on reversed phase material were optimized for reproducibility recovery and robustness extracts were measured with high resolution lc ms using reversed phase ultra high pressure liquid chromatography uhplc for separation recently a systematic analysis of the metabolomes from different wells at a single time point was reported sanchez arcos et al 2022 here we focus on pattern recognition in the long term data sets without the aim to elucidate the structure of the detected metabolites the five year monitoring dataset comprised 35 time points when data was collected at three geographical locations from sampling wells at one h32 or three h41 h43 h51 h53 depths this data set was systematically mined to identify patterns according to location depth season and recharge events in addition basic hydrochemical and conventional monitoring parameters including groundwater levels and temperature were collected along with the metabolome the thick hillslope aeration zone containing perched groundwater bodies fig 1 is accessed by well h32 multiple pronounced periods of recharge in the winter half year interspersed by low stand phases were observed there during the monitoring period from 2014 to 2020 fig 2 a during recharge the ca mg carbonate rich water is oxygenated up to 3 8 mg l dissolved oxygen not shown and the temperature dips fig 2a further nitrate is supplied via percolation in the winter half year fig s1 periods of low specific electrical conductivity during early recharge phases indicate short residence times figure s1 dissolved organic carbon doc sum parameter and potassium did not show significant responses to recharge whereas during recession phases warming increasing sulfur sulfate sodium and calcium point to longer residence fig s1 bakalowicz 1994 hudak 2004 the metabolome of well h32 from 09 2014 to 03 2017 consistent monitoring with mostly monthly sampling campaigns revealed a highly variable composition with more than 75 of the metabolite features significantly changing in intensity over time fig 2b d notably the metabolomes at different time points were characterized by singular emergences of metabolite features high z normalised intensities indicated in red rather than recurrent or seasonally reoccuring profiles fig 2b the lack of recurrent signals characterizing the studied setting of thin bedded alternations of carbonate siliciclastic rock may also apply for other groundwater bodies in widely distributed mixed lithology sedimentary reservoirs lacking large fractures or karst conduits thin bedded alternations represent retarded flow systems white 2012 thus generally exhibiting less pronounced dom dynamics by input from the subsurface dom dynamics might result from multidirectional flow dynamics within groundwater recharge areas lehmann and totsche 2020 supplying water and dom from different sources including sedimentary carbon such sediments are common in freshwater aquifers worldwide and the observed patterns might be prototypic franco et al 2017 interannual variability may generally depend on weather and climatic conditions droughts precipitation temperature humphrey et al 2016 phillips et al 2012 riedel and weber 2020 rodell et al 2018 united nations office for disaster risk reduction undrr 2021 elsewhere geochemical tracer investigations revealed that responses to intra annual periodicity in precipitation and associated recharge is reflected in the groundwater composition bonneau et al 2018 bowen et al 2019 jasechko et al 2014 tweed et al 2005 emergence and dissipation of metabolite signals could be linked to these factors within the course of a year the first two determining principle components revealed considerable patterns when metabolic signatures throughout the sampling period were analyzed fig 2c the most striking was an observed shift coinciding with the high flow period 12 2015 05 2016 causing a disturbance in the pca fig 2c lower half similarly the high flow periods 11 2014 06 2015 upper left of pca and 11 2016 04 2017 fig 2c upper right caused separate clusters interspersed by distinct phases such as the low stand phase 06 2015 11 2016 fig 2c center left the much deeper phreatic zone well h52 fig 1 was characterized by damped though high magnitude water table fluctuation of more than 18 m due to seasonal recharge dynamics figs 3 a supplementary fig s2 compared to the perched groundwater the oxygen free ca mg carbonate water is low in nitrate and high in sulfate as indicated by less surface fed input this aquifer zone is characterized by more isolated conditions lehmann and totsche 2020 during recharge phases increased calcium sulfate fig s2 and hydraulic heads indicate ascending flow from deeper strata lehmann and totsche 2020 increased ec25 associated with increasing sodium and potassium and higher hydraulic heads in the shallower observer h53 fig 3a indicate descending flow during recessions these observations highlight considerable cross stratal exchange lehmann and totsche 2020 in the stratified bedrock doc again showed insignificant fluctuation pointing to the limited merit of the sum parameter in such a sedimentary setting the metabolome in the phreatic groundwater 11 2014 to 03 2017 was also highly variable and exhibited singular emergences of metabolites at high intensities fig 3b d like in the well h32 in the uphill aeration zone and the other wells of the phreatic zone recurrent fluctuations of metabolite signals were missing nevertheless we again observed an association of the pca with the groundwater fluctuation fig 3a c the recharge phase 11 2015 05 2016 contained a clear dispersion in the bottom left of the pca while the subsequent discharge phase caused a cluster transition 08 09 2016 center right with another dispersion during the low stand 01 03 2017 center right while less distinct the recharge phase 12 2014 05 2015 caused a pca shift range 04 06 2015 3 2 general coincidence of temporal metabolome pattern changes and recharge dynamics across sampling sites the association of metabolome pcas with water levels emerged as a consistent observation across the recharge area this was observed in shallow as well as in deep wells spanning different habitat conditions lazar et al 2019 and microbial communities yan et al 2021 2020 we discuss here in detail results from wells h32 and h52 exemplarily as representatives for aeration zone and phreatic zone wells however in all cases h32 h41 to 43 h51 to 53 the metabolome was variable with pronounced shifts in the pca time series particularly in response to high flow recharge phases figs 2 and 3 for h32 and h52 as well as supplementary figs s3 to s8 for the other wells a summary is given in supplementary table 1 highlighting distinct phases in the pcas the association of the first two principal components with water level fluctuation representing cross stratal exchange in the fractured bedrock strata revealed the strong responses to recharge dynamics it is conceivable that high flow phases will modify the dom profile by co transporting organic matter into the groundwater in accordance the dissolved organic carbon doc levels in h32 and h52 were often variable during recharge periods supplementary figs s1 and s2 transport of organic matter by water fluxes can change the groundwater metabolome by the input of novel compounds and microbial biochemical transformations will cause additional variability at our study site it has been recently reported that the microbiome composition is impacted by water recharge phases as observed for the metabolome yan et al 2021 2020 it is conceivable that a changing microbiome will cause a shift in biochemical functions and therefore impact the metabolome composition other impacts on the metabolome will result from changing geochemical parameters for instance ph and oxygen levels that influence abiotic transformations such as mineral catalysed transformations zhang et al 2021 the abovementioned processes can rationalize most of the metabolome profile variations over time however there remain unexplained changes for instance a disturbance in 09 2015 was observed in h52 fig 3 which was also observed in the other h5 wells supplementary figs s7 and s8 table s1 but not in the shallow h32 fig 2 information on location h4 not available this disturbance could neither be explained by the sampling procedure identical nor did it have a clear representation in other measured parameters a possible explanation might be that the corresponding pronounced recession period followed by an extreme lasting groundwater highstand after 2013 might have influenced the prevalence of the specific metabolites 3 3 inter well metabolome similarity suggests cross compartment exchange having established that water level fluctuations leave an imprint in the metabolome over time we queried whether the metabolome also provides evidence for cross compartment exchange along the hillslope recharge area fig 1 in addition to the metabolome data we recorded quality parameters like temperature dissolved oxygen various solutes and doc that have been previously used as environmental tracers to explore local aquifer systems figs s1 and s2 benischke 2021 jiang et al 2021 these parameters fall short in resolution as aggregate parameters like doc are too general with only weak spatiotemporal variation also major inorganic ions only allow interpretation at low resolution compared to the numerous organic analytes accessed by metabolomics techniques other tracers like fluorescent dyes or trace metals need to be deliberately released thereby already impacting the environment we therefore considered that untargeted lc ms based metabolomics monitors a suitable naturally occurring organic tracer set for investigating cross compartment exchange while the extraction of individual marker signals from such datasets would carry the risk of extracting false positive correlations we relied again on dimensionality reduction by pca to determine fingerprints that are more robust against overfitting nguyen and holmes 2019 we considered metabolome data of the seven monitoring wells h32 h41 to 43 and h51 to 53 covering the period from 11 2014 to 06 2020 for each timepoint pcas were generated to determine the principal discriminating components for inter well dissimilarity see materials and methods from these the pca distances between every two wells were inferred and expressed as multiples of the distances standard deviations fig 4 and supplementary figs s9 s13 this allowed us to compare metabolome profiles acquired over the extended monitoring period well h52 was most distinct i e had high scores for the dissimilarity from the other wells fig 4 however phases of similarity to well h53 emerged in 06 07 2015 11 2016 04 2018 07 2019 and 04 2020 at all these timepoints the h5 wells were at or near a peak of groundwater highstand fig 3 and supplementary fig s3 suggesting that ascending flow caused cross stratal exchange and mixing there were also phases of similarity between h52 and the well h51 at times around the highstands in 06 2015 and 09 2016 and an additional phase in 03 2016 where h51 and h52 were approaching their highstand notably in several phases when h52 and h53 were similar the metabolome of the deeper well h51 diverged and had instead higher similarity to the aeration zone well h32 04 2018 2 5 km further upslope see fig 1 or the phreatic wells h41 to h43 07 2019 and 04 2020 than to the wells h52 and h53 supplementary fig s13 these metabolome observations support earlier findings benk et al 2019 of transient local flow patterns that connect even deep and isolated compartments with the surface or shallow upslope zones via ascending flow lehmann and totsche 2020 in accordance multivariate analyzes from aggregated long term hainich monitoring data on the microbiome yan et al 2020 physicochemical parameters kohlhepp et al 2017 schwab et al 2017 and phospholipid derived fatty acids plfa schwab et al 2017 classed the wells h52 and h53 as similar and distinct from the others while a previous metabolomics study benk et al 2019 placed h52 in proximity to h4 wells 1 km uphill see fig 1 but separate from h53 same location but 15 m above the present analysis synergizes these findings by clarifying the changes in well dissimilarities over longer monitoring periods the aeration zone well h32 accessing a perched oxic groundwater body showed variable similarities with all wells but h53 which was consistently different phases of similarities to other wells were consistently observed following to all high flow phases in h32 as follows 11 2014 01 2015 to h41 43 h51 52 06 2015 h41 h43 h51 52 03 04 2016 h42 07 2017 h41 43 h52 04 2018 h41 h51 07 2019 h41 h43 h51 and 04 05 2020 h41 h43 h51 this demonstrates that pca of metabolomics data from long term surveys can be used to derive time traces of dissimilarities by inferring the sample distances in the pc1 pc2 space acknowledging the obstacles of long term data acquisition where metabolomics measurement parameters such as operator device calibration separation column and method may have changed the extraction of pca distances per time point allows integration of long term monitoring data we can conclude that the sedimentary rock groundwaters vary in dissimilarity over time across the hillslope recharge area phases of low dissimilarity emerge coincident with groundwater recharge dynamics covering surface fed as well as subsurface matter exchange previously it has been queried to which extent the surface vegetation or agricultural land use in a recharge area impacts underlying groundwater systems küsel et al 2016 metabolome investigations of soil waters sampled in lysimeters revealed discrete profiles for the input metabolome in forest pasture and agricultural areas ueberschaar et al 2021 for the groundwater wells in fig 1 we have demonstrated elsewhere that the metabolomes of the wells studied on a single sampling day were discernible in relation to the factors land use type aquifer system and sampling depth sanchez arcos et al 2022 we can now show that for the long term groundwater metabolomes fig 4 vertical transport or the locations respective land use types on the surface are not the major determinants instead periods of similarity occur between h32 and wells at the h4 and h5 sites with different land use and different aquifer properties lazar et al 2019 lehmann and totsche 2020 no continuous segregation by land use type was observed implying that its impact on the well metabolomes is either transient or secondary changing similarities are meanwhile mainly driven by variable flow patterns and water stands notably these may become more fluctuating with weather and climatic extremes both which are expected to become more frequent under climate change predictions ipcc 2022 in effect it can be expected that groundwater metabolic diversity may rise further thus posing unprecedented challenges to groundwater microbes and ecosystems 4 conclusion we show that groundwater metabolomics can resolve the sum parameter doc with much detail and disclose hidden information on groundwater ecosystems functioning and dynamics we further demonstrate that groundwater flows exert a major impact on the groundwater metabolome variability which will thus affect the carbon and energy provision to belowground microbial communities such information is essential to discover ecosystem patterns and responses such as groundwater recharge events or climatic extremes that are expected to increase in severity as predicted in climate change scenarios and may impact the discharge recharge cycle generally the groundwater metabolome and its temporal dynamics provide cross habitat information from multiple sources of metabolites covering contributions from microbial populations as well as abiotic transformations this allows for example the recognition of similarities caused by high flow phases in wells that are several kilometers apart the metabolomics approach has the advantage over tracer experiments that it determines natural organic components of the groundwater without the need to introduce markers it closes a critical

15594,with the rising concern over the depletion of phosphorus rock phosphorus recovery from wastewater has become a key step for sustainable economy herein simultaneous phosphorus leaching and nutrient recovery were accomplished in an electrochemical nutrient recovery cell enrc treating digested anaerobic sludge the anode reaction of water electrolysis lowered the sludge ph from 8 0 to 2 0 at a current density of 25 a m 2 elevating the po4 3 p concentration from 27 72 to 253 47 mg l 1 comparable to that from direct acid leaching the released po4 3 p was transferred to the cathode chamber for recovery where po4 3 p recovery efficiency was enhanced from 42 0 to 90 3 by 0 26 m hcl catholyte acidification the enrc recovered 90 98 of the coexisting nh4 n in the sludge increasing current density accelerated both phosphorus leaching and po4 3 p nh4 n recovery but at the expense of a higher energy consumption after five consecutive cycles of operation the po4 3 p and nh4 n concentrations reached 404 56 and 3493 56 mg l 1 respectively at a normalized energy consumption of 229 20 30 13 kwh kg 1 p or 25 67 3 07 kwh kg 1 n at ph 8 5 99 of the recovered aqueous po4 3 p in the recovery solution precipitated mainly as calcium phosphate that can have a good soil phosphorus availability the results of this study have provided a foundation for further exploration of electrochemically leaching p from waste sludge with simultaneous nutrient recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nutrient recovery sludge electrochemical system phosphorus leaching sustainability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus recovery is vital for circular economy due to its essential role in food production and the non renewable mining of phosphorus rocks cordell et al 2009 jupp et al 2021 municipal wastewater sludge holds around 40 of the phosphorus excreted by human and has become a promising secondary phosphorus source cordell and white 2014 klinglmair et al 2015 direct sludge application to agriculture is prohibited in many regions because of the concerns over potential pathogens persistent organic pollutants heavy metals and odor cieślik et al 2015 phosphorus can make up 2 15 of wastewater sludge dry mass and is usually bound to metal ions such as calcium iron and aluminum or encapsulated in biomass yu et al 2021 leaching phosphorus into the aqueous phase will significantly increase the potential for phosphorus recovery from wastewater sludge numerous methods have been applied to leach phosphorus including biological release ph adjustment ozonation mechanical and thermal treatment quist jensen et al 2018 saktaywin et al 2005 wang et al 2010 2013 xue and huang 2007 among them acidification is one of the most effective approaches owing to the dissolution of inorganic phosphorus e g apatite aluminum phosphate and ferric phosphate xu et al 2015 it was reported that under an acidic condition ph 2 30 34 of total sludge phosphorus was released into the aqueous phase elevating the phosphate po4 3 p concentration from 95 mg l 1 to 240 280 mg l 1 liu et al 2019 the ph of wastewater sludge can be adjusted with direct chemical addition or electrochemical treatment the latter of which is of strong interest because of eliminating the chemical handling flexible process control and potential use of renewable energy e g solar energy to intensify the electrolysis induced ph adjustment the anode of an electrochemical system needs to be separated from the cathode by ion exchange membranes for example in a two chamber electrochemical cell divided by cation exchange membrane cem the wastewater sludge was placed in the anode chamber for acidification by a proton generating half reaction where the ph was lowered to 2 under a current of 50 ma leading to 70 of phosphorus dissolution 527 mg po4 3 p l 1 from the dried anaerobic digestion sludge oliveira et al 2019 such a process could achieve a comparable phosphorus leaching efficiency to direct addition of 0 19 m h2so4 in the sludge ash ebbers et al 2015a after leaching phosphorus needs to be separated from wastewater sludge for recovery precipitation has been widely applied as a recovery method due to the low solubility of various phosphate minerals such as apatite ca3 po4 2 vivianite fe3 po4 2 strengite fepo4 and struvite nh4mgpo4 beaudry and sengupta 2021 quist jensen et al 2018 wilfert et al 2018 yu et al 2021 it was reported that 80 8 of the released phosphate 400 mg l 1 in the supernatant of an acidified wastewater sludge can be recovered as iron phosphate and calcium phosphate by adjusting the ph to 9 0 quist jensen et al 2018 phosphate can also be separated and recovered using electrochemical approaches such as electrolysis assisted precipitation and electrodialysis lei et al 2017 ye et al 2019 for example a two chamber electrolytic cell divided by anion exchange membrane aem moved 50 70 of the sludge phosphorus from its catholyte into the anolyte guedes et al 2016 integrating phosphorus leaching with separation in the same electrochemical system will allow the use of the same electrical energy to accomplish both goals but such an approach has not been well studied before in this study we have developed and investigated an electrochemical system for simultaneous phosphorus leaching and separation its design was based on our recent study where a three chamber electrochemical nutrient recovery cell enrc was capable of recovering both phosphate and ammonium wang et al 2021 unlike our previous study that used bioelectricity and focused only on ion separation without p leaching the present enrc was operated for both ph alteration and ion separation under a constant current the enrc also differed from a previously reported three chamber electrolytic cell in terms of phosphorus leaching from the sludge ebbers et al 2015b a previous study about electrohydromodulation reported electrochemical ph alteration to recover phosphate and ammonium different from the cross membrane migration of both ions in the enrc that protected the recovered nutrients from the potential contaminants in the raw sludge perera and englehardt 2020 the objectives of this study were to 1 examine the feasibility and performance of enrc in phosphorus leaching and nutrient recovery separation from the digested anaerobic sludge 2 evaluate the quality of the phosphate solid product precipitated from the final recovery solution 3 analyze the advantages and limitations of the enrc for applications to sludge nutrient recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 system setup and operation the enrc as shown in fig 1 consisted of an anode chamber a nutrient recovery chamber and a cathode chamber that were separated by a piece of 25 cm2 cem ultrex cmi7000 membranes international inc glen rock nj between the anode and the recovery chambers and a piece of 25 cm2 aem ultrex ami 7001 between the cathode and the recovery chambers the cem or aem was sandwiched by two pieces of neoprene rubber sheets 0 9 cm thickness with a 5 5 cm opening and bolted to polycarbonate outer plates we hypothesized that the anodic half reaction of the enrc could directly generate protons to mobilize sludge phosphorus into phosphate and drive the coexisting nh4 n to the recovery chamber meanwhile the phosphate rich anolyte effluent from the previous treatment cycle was manually transferred to the cathode chamber for po4 3 p recovery three chambers had an identical size of 20 ml but their effective liquid volumes varied due to the sludge volume reduction and electroosmosis during the operation actual liquid volume in each chamber was measured every time when sampling was performed a constant current was provided by a power supply 3644 a circuit specialists inc mesa az usa between the anode electrode 2 5 cm ruthenium and iridium oxide coated titanium plate and the cathode electrode 3 5 3 5 cm titanium plate to minimize precipitation 0 08 m hcl was used as an initial solution in the nutrient recovery chamber the digested anaerobic sludge whole digestate was collected from an anaerobic digester in the missouri river treatment plant st louis mo usa in late september of 2021 and stored at 4 c before use its properties and buffering capacity can be found in table s1 and fig s1 the sludge was fed into the anode chamber where electrochemical acidification and nh4 n migration across the cem occurred the treated sludge was centrifuged and the supernatant was manually fed to the cathode chamber for po4 3 p recovery in the next treatment cycle after each treatment cycle of 2 5 5 h all three chambers and both electrodes were washed with water and 0 1 m hcl to remove potential precipitates unless noted otherwise 2 2 experimental procedure to verify the electrochemical reactions in the enrc we performed cyclic voltammetry on both electrodes with an ag agcl reference electrode at 10 mv s 1 gamry instruments warminster pa usa to examine the anode leaching efficiency from the sludge the enrc was operated at 25 a m 2 for 5 h and the aqueous composition of the anolyte effluent was compared with a control group that was directly adjusted by 0 15 m hcl based on sludge buffering capacity shown in fig s1 and reacted for 2 5 h a manual acid addition in the cathode to keep ph below 2 was common in electrodialytic sludge phosphorus recovery studies ebbers et al 2015b oliveira et al 2019 to reduce acid consumption we examined the effect of catholyte hcl dosage at 0 0 07 m and 0 26 m acid amount normalized to the initial sludge volume during the 5 h operation at an applied current of 25 a m 2 the concentration of 0 07 m was selected to represent an equivalent hcl consumption as the direct hcl adjustment approach i e 0 15 m hcl after subtracting the 0 08 m hcl that was used as the initial recovery solution the concentration of 0 26 m represented excess hcl that could keep the catholyte under an acidic condition for 2 5 h in detail 0 07 m hcl was dosed at 0 5 h when the catholyte ph increased above 9 a total of 0 26 m hcl was intermittently dosed to the catholyte at 0 17 h 0 5 h 1 h and 1 5 h after each treatment cycle of 5 h the electrolytes in all three chambers were refreshed to improve energy efficiency we compared the enrc performance at a constant current density of 5 10 or 25 a m 2 with 0 07 m hcl dosage in the catholyte to produce a concentrated nutrient solution the enrc was operated for 5 consecutive cycles without refreshing the recovery solution a complete list of experimental conditions can be found in table s2 to perform a mass balance the phosphate loss e g precipitation in the recovery chamber and the cathode chamber were quantified by soaking each chamber with 20 ml of 0 1 m hcl for 2 h the final recovery solution was 1 micron filtered and dosed with 5 m naoh to precipitate the phosphate at ph 8 5 the precipitates were centrifuged at 6600 rcf for 4 min and the pellets were dried at 105 c overnight before analysis to harvest ammonia the phosphate depleted supernatant was further alkalized to ph 10 5 and air stripped in a 50 ml falcon tube by a household air pump 50 ml min 1 with gas to liquid volume ratio of 3000 1 the gas outlet flowed through 15 ml 1 m h2so4 for acid absorption at ambient temperature all the operations were conducted in triplicates 2 3 measurements and analysis the total suspended solids were measured by drying sludge overnight at 105 c the organic matters in the solid phase were removed at 550 c for 30 min total phosphorus and heavy metals in the dried sludge were quantified according to danish standards ebbers et al 2015b the buffer capacity of the sludge was measured by titrating 0 1 ml of 1 m h2so4 to 25 ml of sludge at a 10 min interval with continuous mixing at 200 rpm the precipitates from the recovery solution were dissolved in 1 hno3 for content analysis a 1 ω external resistance was added to the enrc circuit to monitor voltage via a data logger 2700 keithley instruments inc cleveland oh usa liquid samples were 0 45 micron pvdf filtered before analysis the solution ph and conductivity were measured by a benchtop ph meter oakton instruments vernon hills il usa and conductivity meter mettler toledo columbus oh usa respectively chemical oxygen demand cod was measured by hach method 8000 with a dr 890 colorimeter hach company loveland co usa the concentrations of na k nh4 n mg2 and ca2 were analyzed by a cation chromatography equipped with ionpac cs12a dionex easion madison wi usa the concentrations of cl so4 2 po4 3 p no3 hco3 were quantified by an anion chromatography equipped with ionpac as18 dionex integrion hpic madison wi usa the concentrations of metals and phosphorus were measured by icp oes perkin elmer optima 7300 dv waltham ma usa after removing the organic contents in the solids x ray powder diffraction xrd was performed with cu kα x ray source dmaxb xrd rigaku japan and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was conducted on a ftir spectrometer nicolettm istm 10 thermofisher st louis mo usa aquatic chemistry equilibrium was simulated in visual minteq ver 3 1 the calculation of nutrient recovery efficiency charge transfer efficiency and normalized energy consumption can be found in the supplementary information 3 results and discussions 3 1 electrochemical phosphorus leaching water electrolysis was the dominant redox reaction at both the anode and the cathode as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry fig s2 after reacting at 25 a m 2 for 5 h the sludge was acidified from ph 8 0 to 2 0 in the enrc anode chamber similar to the final ph of the hcl adjusted sludge fig 2 and table s3 shows the concentrations of major ions in the treated sludge one can see that both enrc anode leaching and hcl adjustment released 67 6 74 1 of total phosphorus in the sludge and achieved the comparable po4 3 p concentrations of 253 47 3 05 mg l 1 and 277 60 15 2 mg l 1 p value 0 05 rising from 27 72 0 95 mg l 1 in the untreated sludge table s1 however in contrast to the high nh4 n concentration of 995 07 53 11 mg l 1 in the hcl treated sludge electrochemical leaching removed 99 of nh4 n from the sludge less than 5 mg l 1 of no3 n was detected in the anolyte effluent indicating the limited nh4 oxidation to no3 at the anode the hcl adjustment increased ca2 and mg2 concentrations from 89 mg l 1 and 19 mg l 1 to 479 mg l 1 and 93 mg l 1 respectively much higher than 31 mg l 1 ca2 and 11 mg l 1 mg2 in the anolyte effluent from electrochemical leaching likely due to their migration through cem under an electrical field in the enrc this could minimize the precipitation of both ca2 and mg2 when the anolyte effluent was transferred to the cathode for p recovery where a high ph environment would occur both methods removed the major ph buffering species bicarbonate from the sludge because of the formation of co2 at an acidic ph the hcl treatment introduced a high concentration of cl 4700 mg l 1 while in the electrochemical leaching the cl concentration was only 120 mg l 1 the low cl level would minimize the oxidation of cl which is a key energy consumer and precursor of chlorinated byproducts during electrochemical treatment of wastewater garcia segura et al 2020 liu and he 2020 schmalz et al 2009 a preliminary estimation on economic cost suggested that to achieve a similar leaching efficiency the cost of hcl 0 041 l 1 sludge with 31 hcl bulk price of 1 49 l 1 could be as much as 3 times the electricity cost 0 012 l 1 sludge with industrial electricity price of 0 06 kwh 1 accurate analysis of economics needs to include reactor materials construction and chemical handling and would not be feasible for bench scale studies 3 2 catholyte acidification improves p recovery as a result of electrochemical reactions the catholyte ph would increase and may negatively affect the phosphate transport and energy efficiency ki et al 2016 lei et al 2017 to further understand this we operated the enrc with catholyte acidification at three different hcl dosages the anode reaction of the enrc successfully acidified the sludge to ph 2 within 2 5 h fig 3 a which increased the po4 3 p concentration from 60 mg l 1 to 206 255 0 mg l 1 or an increase in the absolute p mass from 960 μg to 2369 2933 μg fig 3b the final po4 3 p concentrations in the enrc anolyte were comparable among different catholyte acidifications p value 0 05 when this anolyte was transferred to the cathode chamber for po4 3 p separation and recovery a removal efficiency of 98 8 99 2 and 94 0 was obtained within the first 30 min at 0 0 07 m and 0 26 m hcl dosage respectively fig 3c the recovery chamber contained 67 96 6 47 mg l 1 922 1056 μg 120 69 13 67 mg l 1 1568 2037 μg and 133 22 18 14 mg l 1 1810 2454 ug of po4 3 p fig 3d representing a recovery efficiency of 42 0 3 2 or 29 of total sludge phosphorus 78 9 12 5 or 55 of total sludge phosphorus and 90 3 7 8 or 63 of total sludge phosphorus at 0 0 07 m and 0 26 m hcl dosage respectively despite a low ph 2 in the recovery chamber it was observed that the po4 3 p concentration started to decrease when the catholyte ph ascended to 10 e g 1 5 h with 0 07 m dosage in fig 3d possibly because of oh migration across aem that created microenvironments with a high ph leading to some po4 3 p precipitation ammonium removal and recovery was not directly affected by the catholyte acidification at all hcl dosages the nh4 n concentration in the anolyte rapidly decreased from 724 to 900 mg l 1 to 15 mg l 1 or 11 58 14 4 mg nh4 n in terms of absolute mass within 2 5 h fig 3b meanwhile the recovery chamber accumulated nh4 n at 839 80 26 75 mg l 1 12 20 12 56 mg 881 02 42 67 mg l 1 13 02 14 10 mg and 951 23 66 60 mg l 1 13 37 14 9 mg under three catholyte conditions representing a nh4 n recovery efficiency of 94 3 1 4 102 8 3 3 and 101 7 4 6 respectively an extended operation longer than 2 5 h caused a gradual decline of nh4 n in the nutrient recovery chamber fig 3d and increase in the catholyte fig 3c indicating that nh4 n could permeate through aem due to the lack of perm selectivity which was also observed in other studies ledezma et al 2017 we analyzed the charge transfer efficiency which can reveal the contribution of each cation or anion to electron transfer it was found that the catholyte acidification did not affect the charge transfer efficiency for nh4 migration which reached the peak of 26 3 28 9 at 0 5 h and dropped to 17 3 19 9 at 1 5 h fig 3e the key migrating cations shifted from unspecified cations mainly h 36 4 47 3 nh4 26 3 28 9 ca2 12 6 16 7 and na 7 2 16 6 at 0 5 h to a predominant ion h 86 2 89 8 at 5 h because of the increasingly acidic environment in the anolyte regarding the charge transfer efficiency for anion fig 3f 4 2 0 4 0 07 m hcl of total charges were used to move phosphate species significantly greater than 2 3 0 2 and 2 1 0 01 with zero and 0 26 m hcl dosage at 1 5 h p value 0 05 a lower phosphate charge transfer efficiency with 0 26 m hcl might be attributed to a stronger competition from cl during anion migration in addition the catholyte acidification lowered the cell overpotential that abated the normalized electrical energy consumption from 95 83 0 65 kwh kg 1 n or 1074 35 7 24 kwh kg 1 p at zero hcl to 56 25 0 36 kwh kg 1 n or 396 80 2 51 kwh kg 1 p at 0 26 m hcl dosage the ernc removed about 74 84 of soluble cod scod from the sludge liquid phase from 988 to 119 295 mg l 1 in the catholyte effluent at all hcl dosages to lower acid consumption a mild catholyte acidification with 0 07 m hcl was selected for the following experiments 3 3 effects of current density electrical current is a key factor to both phosphorus leaching and recovery under an open circuit condition there was negligible phosphorus leaching or recovery in the enrc fig s3 when the current density increased from 5 to 10 and then to 25 a m 2 the required time to lower the anolyte ph for example below 4 decreased from 2 5 to 1 9 h and then to 1 1 h fig 4 a this has accelerated the phosphorus peak leaching rate from 37 79 2 22 to 81 66 5 74 and then to 158 34 11 22 mg po4 3 p l 1 h 1 fig 4b due to the difference in the final analyte ph the leached po4 3 p ph 2 5 0 1 188 91 11 08 mg l 1 or 1958 4 2502 11 μg at 5 a m 2 was lower than that of 10 a m 2 ph 2 2 0 03 234 33 8 19 mg l 1 or 2702 2828 μg and 25 a m 2 ph 2 1 0 03 255 90 4 24 mg l 1 or 2929 2999 μg more than 98 of po4 3 p was removed from the catholyte at 1 5 h 2 5 h and 5 h under 25 10 and 5 a m 2 resulting in a remaining concentration below 4 mg l 1 fig 4c it was observed that there was a po4 3 p concentration spike at 1 h likely resulted from the dissolution of phosphate precipitates e g calcium phosphate under an acidic condition the po4 3 p concentration in the recovery chamber reached 88 20 20 22 mg l 1 1089 1985 μg 96 15 6 72 mg l 1 1292 1525 μg and 120 14 13 67 mg l 1 1568 2037 μg fig 4d at 5 10 and 25 a m 2 accounting for comparable recovery efficiencies of 60 4 70 1 p value 0 05 under an open circuit condition the nh4 n concentration in the anolyte slowly decreased from 900 mg l 1 to 450 mg l 1 within 5 h fig s3 likely due to the exchange of nh4 with h in the recovery chamber which contained 0 08 m hcl initially applying a current accelerated the nh4 n movement and decreased the anodic nh4 n concentration from 900 mg l 1 to less than 40 mg l 1 fig 4b resulting in removal rates of 173 36 351 72 and 587 91 mg l 1 h 1 at 5 10 and 25 a m 2 respectively the recovery chamber contained the peak nh4 n concentration of 881 951 mg l 1 fig 4d rendering a similar maximum recovery efficiency of 97 1 98 3 at all current densities however a higher current density might have contributed to a higher nh4 n aem leakage during prolonged operation for example an increase of nh4 n from 2 to 77 mg l 1 was detected in the catholyte after 5 h operation under 25 a m 2 4 fold of the increase under 5 a m 2 the charge transfer efficiency of individual ions varied under different current densities when the current density was increased from 5 to 25 a m 2 at 1 5 h the charge transfer efficiency of nh4 and ca2 decreased from 52 1 1 4 and 25 3 1 4 to 19 8 1 7 and 7 5 1 3 respectively fig 4e possibly due to a more intensive competition from h at a higher current density upon the maximum nh4 n recovery efficiency 33 0 3 2 29 5 0 9 and 19 8 1 7 of total charges were used to move nh4 at 5 10 and 25 a m 2 respectively the charge transfer efficiency of hpo4 2 which was 4 2 4 9 when the maximum po4 3 p recovery was achieved was not sensitive to varied current densities fig 4f cl and oh were two predominant anions that carried electrons but their charge transfer efficiencies showed an opposite trend when the current density was increased from 5 to 25 a m 2 at 1 5 h the charge transfer efficiency of oh increased from 41 2 8 0 to 68 7 2 2 while that of cl decreased from 47 0 8 1 to 26 0 2 6 therefore a higher current promoted the migration of both h and oh into the recovery chamber based on the voltage profile in fig s4 the normalized energy consumption was 22 82 1 59 31 58 2 95 74 17 2 67 kwh kg 1 n or 220 67 15 35 283 99 26 50 522 37 18 78 kwh kg 1 p under 5 10 and 25 a m 2 a comparable scod removal of 68 84 p value 0 05 from the liquid phase was achieved at all current densities because of a decent phosphorus leaching and energy efficiency 10 a m 2 and the operation period of 2 5 h were selected for the following experiments 3 4 concentrating nutrients in the recovery chamber high concentrations of the recovered nutrients can facilitate subsequent collection but one cycle of operation obtained n p concentrations in the recovery solution similar to or even less than their original concentrations in the leached sludge to increase the nutrient concentrations multiple cycles of the enrc operation were conducted with an unchanged solution in the recovery chamber so that nutrients could accumulate as shown in fig 5 a the enrc leached 147 59 215 24 mg l 1 po4 3 p from the sludge at the end of each cycle ph was lowered to around 4 0 fig s5 accounting for 40 58 of total phosphorus in the sludge the cathode removed 96 98 of the aqueous po4 3 p in the catholyte and produced a catholyte effluent with 5 mg po4 3 p l 1 the po4 3 p concentration in the recovery solution reached 142 62 7 78 mg l 1 after the first cycle and gradually accumulated to 404 56 20 44 mg l 1 after 5 cycles which accounted for 72 7 of the aqueous po4 3 p in the anolyte effluent or 29 1 42 2 of the total sludge phosphorus it was noticed that in the initial 0 5 h of each operation cycle the po4 3 p concentration in the recovery solution decreased slightly and then rebounded to a higher level in the following 2 h this was likely related to the precipitation of calcium and phosphate as indicated by a similar variation for calcium in the recovery solution fig s6 according to the precipitation equilibrium of amorphous ca3 po4 2 the precipitates could start to form at ph 5 0 5 2 although the bulk recovery solution had an acidic ph 2 there could be microenvironment of high ph especially adjacent to aem surface where ca3 po4 2 precipitation might occur due to oh migration from the catholyte mass balance revealed that after removing the recovery solution 6 9 of the released po4 3 p remained or adsorbed in the recovery chamber fig 5b in addition 9 8 of the released po4 3 p precipitated in the cathode chamber due to the high ph environment there was 10 6 of unaccounted po4 3 p possibly due to unknown loss during centrifugation and sampling the nh4 n concentration in the recovery solution was steadily increasing to 3493 56 194 13 mg l 1 h 1 after five cycles of operation fig 5a accounting for 90 of the total nh4 n in the sludge a linear removal at a rate of 285 50 7 95 mg l 1 h 1 was obtained for nh4 n to leave the anode and a similar rate of 271 39 5 18 mg l 1 h 1 was achieved for nh4 n to accumulate in the recovery chamber consistent with prior studies a total of 10 nh4 n remained in or leaked to the catholyte that resulted in an effluent containing 50 165 mg l 1 nh4 n ledezma et al 2017 overall the normalized energy consumption of five consecutive cycles was 25 67 3 07 kwh kg 1 n or 229 20 30 13 kwh kg 1 p the enrc removed 42 5 of the scod in the sludge liquid phase resulting in 572 51 mg l 1 cod in the catholyte effluent 3 5 product evaluation the high concentrations of both calcium 1600 mg l 1 and po4 3 p 400 mg l 1 in the recovery solution could enable the formation and precipitation of calcium phosphate by elevating the solution ph lei et al 2021 calcium phosphate is considered a potential product of phosphorus recovery hao et al 2013 at ph 8 5 more than 99 of the aqueous po4 3 p precipitated from the recovery solution to produce a solid with light brownish color table s3 and fig s7 the presence of po4 3 p group in the precipitate was confirmed by ftir spectrum fig 6 a at 566 cm 1 p o bond and 1017 cm 1 p o bond kong et al 2020 a prior study found iron phosphate and calcium phosphate co precipitation after elevating ph to 6 9 in an acidified sludge filtrate quist jensen et al 2018 however both ftir peak positions and xrd spectrum fig 6b of the precipitate were similar to that of the commercial hydroxyapatite indicating the predominance of hydroxyapatite calcium phosphate in the precipitate further analysis of the elemental contents showed that po4 3 p contributed to 13 6 of dry mass in the precipitate which was equivalent to 31 2 p2o5 content and would meet the 25 37 p2o5 requirement for economic grade phosphate rock gupta et al 2014 calcium was the major metal and took up 16 5 of the dry weight in the precipitate the presence of iron phosphate was highly possible as iron constituted to 7 2 of the precipitate dry weight the precipitate had a good soil phosphorus availability because of a al fe p molar ratio of 0 34 that was below the threshold of 1 shiba and ntuli 2017 migration of pb through the cem was possible as a pb content of 0 02 was detected in the precipitate below the 0 03 pb limit regulated by us epa biosolids agricultural land application other impurities including mg 1 92 mn 2 42 zn 0 43 cr 0 01 and ni 0 01 were also detected in the precipitate after recovering the solid phosphate products the recovery solution from the enrc was further stripped by air and 67 of ammonium was harvested as nh4 2so4 3 6 perspectives this study has demonstrated simultaneous electrochemical phosphorus leaching from the digested sludge and recovery of both nh4 n 90 and po4 3 p 72 in an enrc however several constraints need to be addressed before the practical application of the proposed system first the cost of chemicals assuming 31 hcl bulk price of 1 49 l 1 90 naoh bulk price of 0 5 kg 1 industrial electricity price of 0 06 kwh 1 was estimated to be 6 times higher than the cost of electricity in section 3 4 with catholyte acidification accounting for 80 of the chemical cost to eliminate catholyte acidification the po4 3 p recovery efficiency may be sacrificed i e from 72 to 42 furthermore the additional uses of hcl in the initial recovery solution and naoh in the po4 3 p precipitation step may also be replaced by a neutral electrolyte e g na2so4 to allow for po4 3 p precipitation inside the recovery chamber this study selected 0 08 m hcl as the initial recovery solution mainly for the accurate real time quantification of the recovered po4 3 p in its soluble form future efforts should be focused on reducing chemical consumption and optimizing phosphate precipitates management in the enrc system second the energy consumption by the enrc was relatively high 25 67 3 07 kwh kg 1 n or 229 20 30 13 kwh kg 1 p although the same energy was used for recovering two nutrients and those values are generally in the range of energy consumption by conventional electrodialysis methods 4 9 17 7 kwh kg 1 n and 92 6 619 9 kwh kg 1 p pan et al 2020 wang et al 2013 2018 ye et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 the high energy consumption can be related to the decreased electrolyte conductivity fig s8 and the increased overpotentials of an electrochemical system because the enrc cathode can produce h2 not collected in the present study theoretically the amount of h2 could provide 6 6 8 1 of the consumed energy assuming 100 electrons conversion to hydrogen gas and the energy calculation is based on a previous work luo et al 2017 renewable energy such as solar energy which has gained increasing popularity in wastewater treatment plants strazzabosco et al 2019 may be used to operate the enrc third the handling of the residue sludge needs to be a part of the enrc operation during the enrc anode treatment the total sludge volume initially expanded due to the foam formation but eventually decreased by 12 30 because of the dissolution of sludge particles guedes et al 2014 the volume fluctuation demands the anode design operation to be flexible in response to this change lastly the complicated nature of wastewater sludge might induce the fouling of electrodes and membranes over long term enrc operation shi et al 2019 a deeper understanding on the sludge fouling behavior and mechanism is imperative to guide the enrc development such as cleaning approach and cleaning frequency xia et al 2018 other parameters including facilitated mass transfer e g stirring during the anode sludge treatment electrode spacing and electrode surface area to volume ratio should also be optimized before practical application 4 conclusions in this study an innovative electrochemical system was investigated to achieve simultaneous phosphorus leaching from anaerobic digestion sludge and recovery of nh4 n and po4 3 p with the following conclusions 1 the enrc anodic acidification realized sludge phosphorus leaching efficiency of 67 65 74 06 and the po4 3 p concentration of 253 47 3 05 mg l 1 similar to that of direct hcl adjustment 2 catholyte acidification which prevented phosphate precipitation in the cathode chamber played a key role in improving the po4 3 p recovery efficiency from 41 99 to 90 26 and phosphate charge transfer efficiency from 2 3 to 4 2 nh4 n recovery efficiency could reach 94 and was not affected by catholyte acidification 3 a higher current density accelerated the phosphorus leaching and both nh4 n po4 3 p recovery but also led to a higher energy consumption at 10 a m 2 the enrc could achieve a leaching rate of 81 66 mg po4 3 p l 1 h 1 and recovery rates of 38 46 mg po4 3 p l 1 h 1 and 351 72 mg nh4 n l 1 h 1 at energy consumption of 25 67 3 07 kwh kg 1 n or 229 20 30 13 kwh kg 1 p 4 the recovery solution contained sufficient calcium and the aqueous po4 3 p could be precipitated without external metal addition around 29 1 42 2 of the total sludge phosphorus was recovered as solids that mainly consisted of calcium phosphate and had a phosphorus p2o5 content of 31 19 5 the challenges for further developing the enrc such as the trade off between po4 3 p recovery efficiency and energy chemical consumption

15594,with the rising concern over the depletion of phosphorus rock phosphorus recovery from wastewater has become a key step for sustainable economy herein simultaneous phosphorus leaching and nutrient recovery were accomplished in an electrochemical nutrient recovery cell enrc treating digested anaerobic sludge the anode reaction of water electrolysis lowered the sludge ph from 8 0 to 2 0 at a current density of 25 a m 2 elevating the po4 3 p concentration from 27 72 to 253 47 mg l 1 comparable to that from direct acid leaching the released po4 3 p was transferred to the cathode chamber for recovery where po4 3 p recovery efficiency was enhanced from 42 0 to 90 3 by 0 26 m hcl catholyte acidification the enrc recovered 90 98 of the coexisting nh4 n in the sludge increasing current density accelerated both phosphorus leaching and po4 3 p nh4 n recovery but at the expense of a higher energy consumption after five consecutive cycles of operation the po4 3 p and nh4 n concentrations reached 404 56 and 3493 56 mg l 1 respectively at a normalized energy consumption of 229 20 30 13 kwh kg 1 p or 25 67 3 07 kwh kg 1 n at ph 8 5 99 of the recovered aqueous po4 3 p in the recovery solution precipitated mainly as calcium phosphate that can have a good soil phosphorus availability the results of this study have provided a foundation for further exploration of electrochemically leaching p from waste sludge with simultaneous nutrient recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nutrient recovery sludge electrochemical system phosphorus leaching sustainability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus recovery is vital for circular economy due to its essential role in food production and the non renewable mining of phosphorus rocks cordell et al 2009 jupp et al 2021 municipal wastewater sludge holds around 40 of the phosphorus excreted by human and has become a promising secondary phosphorus source cordell and white 2014 klinglmair et al 2015 direct sludge application to agriculture is prohibited in many regions because of the concerns over potential pathogens persistent organic pollutants heavy metals and odor cieślik et al 2015 phosphorus can make up 2 15 of wastewater sludge dry mass and is usually bound to metal ions such as calcium iron and aluminum or encapsulated in biomass yu et al 2021 leaching phosphorus into the aqueous phase will significantly increase the potential for phosphorus recovery from wastewater sludge numerous methods have been applied to leach phosphorus including biological release ph adjustment ozonation mechanical and thermal treatment quist jensen et al 2018 saktaywin et al 2005 wang et al 2010 2013 xue and huang 2007 among them acidification is one of the most effective approaches owing to the dissolution of inorganic phosphorus e g apatite aluminum phosphate and ferric phosphate xu et al 2015 it was reported that under an acidic condition ph 2 30 34 of total sludge phosphorus was released into the aqueous phase elevating the phosphate po4 3 p concentration from 95 mg l 1 to 240 280 mg l 1 liu et al 2019 the ph of wastewater sludge can be adjusted with direct chemical addition or electrochemical treatment the latter of which is of strong interest because of eliminating the chemical handling flexible process control and potential use of renewable energy e g solar energy to intensify the electrolysis induced ph adjustment the anode of an electrochemical system needs to be separated from the cathode by ion exchange membranes for example in a two chamber electrochemical cell divided by cation exchange membrane cem the wastewater sludge was placed in the anode chamber for acidification by a proton generating half reaction where the ph was lowered to 2 under a current of 50 ma leading to 70 of phosphorus dissolution 527 mg po4 3 p l 1 from the dried anaerobic digestion sludge oliveira et al 2019 such a process could achieve a comparable phosphorus leaching efficiency to direct addition of 0 19 m h2so4 in the sludge ash ebbers et al 2015a after leaching phosphorus needs to be separated from wastewater sludge for recovery precipitation has been widely applied as a recovery method due to the low solubility of various phosphate minerals such as apatite ca3 po4 2 vivianite fe3 po4 2 strengite fepo4 and struvite nh4mgpo4 beaudry and sengupta 2021 quist jensen et al 2018 wilfert et al 2018 yu et al 2021 it was reported that 80 8 of the released phosphate 400 mg l 1 in the supernatant of an acidified wastewater sludge can be recovered as iron phosphate and calcium phosphate by adjusting the ph to 9 0 quist jensen et al 2018 phosphate can also be separated and recovered using electrochemical approaches such as electrolysis assisted precipitation and electrodialysis lei et al 2017 ye et al 2019 for example a two chamber electrolytic cell divided by anion exchange membrane aem moved 50 70 of the sludge phosphorus from its catholyte into the anolyte guedes et al 2016 integrating phosphorus leaching with separation in the same electrochemical system will allow the use of the same electrical energy to accomplish both goals but such an approach has not been well studied before in this study we have developed and investigated an electrochemical system for simultaneous phosphorus leaching and separation its design was based on our recent study where a three chamber electrochemical nutrient recovery cell enrc was capable of recovering both phosphate and ammonium wang et al 2021 unlike our previous study that used bioelectricity and focused only on ion separation without p leaching the present enrc was operated for both ph alteration and ion separation under a constant current the enrc also differed from a previously reported three chamber electrolytic cell in terms of phosphorus leaching from the sludge ebbers et al 2015b a previous study about electrohydromodulation reported electrochemical ph alteration to recover phosphate and ammonium different from the cross membrane migration of both ions in the enrc that protected the recovered nutrients from the potential contaminants in the raw sludge perera and englehardt 2020 the objectives of this study were to 1 examine the feasibility and performance of enrc in phosphorus leaching and nutrient recovery separation from the digested anaerobic sludge 2 evaluate the quality of the phosphate solid product precipitated from the final recovery solution 3 analyze the advantages and limitations of the enrc for applications to sludge nutrient recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 system setup and operation the enrc as shown in fig 1 consisted of an anode chamber a nutrient recovery chamber and a cathode chamber that were separated by a piece of 25 cm2 cem ultrex cmi7000 membranes international inc glen rock nj between the anode and the recovery chambers and a piece of 25 cm2 aem ultrex ami 7001 between the cathode and the recovery chambers the cem or aem was sandwiched by two pieces of neoprene rubber sheets 0 9 cm thickness with a 5 5 cm opening and bolted to polycarbonate outer plates we hypothesized that the anodic half reaction of the enrc could directly generate protons to mobilize sludge phosphorus into phosphate and drive the coexisting nh4 n to the recovery chamber meanwhile the phosphate rich anolyte effluent from the previous treatment cycle was manually transferred to the cathode chamber for po4 3 p recovery three chambers had an identical size of 20 ml but their effective liquid volumes varied due to the sludge volume reduction and electroosmosis during the operation actual liquid volume in each chamber was measured every time when sampling was performed a constant current was provided by a power supply 3644 a circuit specialists inc mesa az usa between the anode electrode 2 5 cm ruthenium and iridium oxide coated titanium plate and the cathode electrode 3 5 3 5 cm titanium plate to minimize precipitation 0 08 m hcl was used as an initial solution in the nutrient recovery chamber the digested anaerobic sludge whole digestate was collected from an anaerobic digester in the missouri river treatment plant st louis mo usa in late september of 2021 and stored at 4 c before use its properties and buffering capacity can be found in table s1 and fig s1 the sludge was fed into the anode chamber where electrochemical acidification and nh4 n migration across the cem occurred the treated sludge was centrifuged and the supernatant was manually fed to the cathode chamber for po4 3 p recovery in the next treatment cycle after each treatment cycle of 2 5 5 h all three chambers and both electrodes were washed with water and 0 1 m hcl to remove potential precipitates unless noted otherwise 2 2 experimental procedure to verify the electrochemical reactions in the enrc we performed cyclic voltammetry on both electrodes with an ag agcl reference electrode at 10 mv s 1 gamry instruments warminster pa usa to examine the anode leaching efficiency from the sludge the enrc was operated at 25 a m 2 for 5 h and the aqueous composition of the anolyte effluent was compared with a control group that was directly adjusted by 0 15 m hcl based on sludge buffering capacity shown in fig s1 and reacted for 2 5 h a manual acid addition in the cathode to keep ph below 2 was common in electrodialytic sludge phosphorus recovery studies ebbers et al 2015b oliveira et al 2019 to reduce acid consumption we examined the effect of catholyte hcl dosage at 0 0 07 m and 0 26 m acid amount normalized to the initial sludge volume during the 5 h operation at an applied current of 25 a m 2 the concentration of 0 07 m was selected to represent an equivalent hcl consumption as the direct hcl adjustment approach i e 0 15 m hcl after subtracting the 0 08 m hcl that was used as the initial recovery solution the concentration of 0 26 m represented excess hcl that could keep the catholyte under an acidic condition for 2 5 h in detail 0 07 m hcl was dosed at 0 5 h when the catholyte ph increased above 9 a total of 0 26 m hcl was intermittently dosed to the catholyte at 0 17 h 0 5 h 1 h and 1 5 h after each treatment cycle of 5 h the electrolytes in all three chambers were refreshed to improve energy efficiency we compared the enrc performance at a constant current density of 5 10 or 25 a m 2 with 0 07 m hcl dosage in the catholyte to produce a concentrated nutrient solution the enrc was operated for 5 consecutive cycles without refreshing the recovery solution a complete list of experimental conditions can be found in table s2 to perform a mass balance the phosphate loss e g precipitation in the recovery chamber and the cathode chamber were quantified by soaking each chamber with 20 ml of 0 1 m hcl for 2 h the final recovery solution was 1 micron filtered and dosed with 5 m naoh to precipitate the phosphate at ph 8 5 the precipitates were centrifuged at 6600 rcf for 4 min and the pellets were dried at 105 c overnight before analysis to harvest ammonia the phosphate depleted supernatant was further alkalized to ph 10 5 and air stripped in a 50 ml falcon tube by a household air pump 50 ml min 1 with gas to liquid volume ratio of 3000 1 the gas outlet flowed through 15 ml 1 m h2so4 for acid absorption at ambient temperature all the operations were conducted in triplicates 2 3 measurements and analysis the total suspended solids were measured by drying sludge overnight at 105 c the organic matters in the solid phase were removed at 550 c for 30 min total phosphorus and heavy metals in the dried sludge were quantified according to danish standards ebbers et al 2015b the buffer capacity of the sludge was measured by titrating 0 1 ml of 1 m h2so4 to 25 ml of sludge at a 10 min interval with continuous mixing at 200 rpm the precipitates from the

nicolettm istm 10 thermofisher st louis mo usa aquatic chemistry equilibrium was simulated in visual minteq ver 3 1 the calculation of nutrient recovery efficiency charge transfer efficiency and normalized energy consumption can be found in the supplementary information 3 results and discussions 3 1 electrochemical phosphorus leaching water electrolysis was the dominant redox reaction at both the anode and the cathode as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry fig s2 after reacting at 25 a m 2 for 5 h the sludge was acidified from ph 8 0 to 2 0 in the enrc anode chamber similar to the final ph of the hcl adjusted sludge fig 2 and table s3 shows the concentrations of major ions in the treated sludge one can see that both enrc anode leaching and hcl adjustment released 67 6 74 1 of total phosphorus in the sludge and achieved the comparable po4 3 p concentrations of 253 47 3 05 mg l 1 and 277 60 15 2 mg l 1 p value 0 05 rising from 27 72 0 95 mg l 1 in the untreated sludge table s1 however in contrast to the high nh4 n concentration of 995 07 53 11 mg l 1 in the hcl treated sludge electrochemical leaching removed 99 of nh4 n from the sludge less than 5 mg l 1 of no3 n was detected in the anolyte effluent indicating the limited nh4 oxidation to no3 at the anode the hcl adjustment increased ca2 and mg2 concentrations from 89 mg l 1 and 19 mg l 1 to 479 mg l 1 and 93 mg l 1 respectively much higher than 31 mg l 1 ca2 and 11 mg l 1 mg2 in the anolyte effluent from electrochemical leaching likely due to their migration through cem under an electrical field in the enrc this could minimize the precipitation of both ca2 and mg2 when the anolyte effluent was transferred to the cathode for p recovery where a high ph environment would occur both methods removed the major ph buffering species bicarbonate from the sludge because of the formation of co2 at an acidic ph the hcl treatment introduced a high concentration of cl 4700 mg l 1 while in the electrochemical leaching the cl concentration was only 120 mg l 1 the low cl level would minimize the oxidation of cl which is a key energy consumer and precursor of chlorinated byproducts during electrochemical treatment of wastewater garcia segura et al 2020 liu and he 2020 schmalz et al 2009 a preliminary estimation on economic cost suggested that to achieve a similar leaching efficiency the cost of hcl 0 041 l 1 sludge with 31 hcl bulk price of 1 49 l 1 could be as much as 3 times the electricity cost 0 012 l 1 sludge with industrial electricity price of 0 06 kwh 1 accurate analysis of economics needs to include reactor materials construction and chemical handling and would not be feasible for bench scale studies 3 2 catholyte acidification improves p recovery as a result of electrochemical reactions the catholyte ph would increase and may negatively affect the phosphate transport and energy efficiency ki et al 2016 lei et al 2017 to further understand this we operated the enrc with catholyte acidification at three different hcl dosages the anode reaction of the enrc successfully acidified the sludge to ph 2 within 2 5 h fig 3 a which increased the po4 3 p concentration from 60 mg l 1 to 206 255 0 mg l 1 or an increase in the absolute p mass from 960 μg to 2369 2933 μg fig 3b the final po4 3 p concentrations in the enrc anolyte were comparable among different catholyte acidifications p value 0 05 when this anolyte was transferred to the cathode chamber for po4 3 p separation and recovery a removal efficiency of 98 8 99 2 and 94 0 was obtained within the first 30 min at 0 0 07 m and 0 26 m hcl dosage respectively fig 3c the recovery chamber contained 67 96 6 47 mg l 1 922 1056 μg 120 69 13 67 mg l 1 1568 2037 μg and 133 22 18 14 mg l 1 1810 2454 ug of po4 3 p fig 3d representing a recovery efficiency of 42 0 3 2 or 29 of total sludge phosphorus 78 9 12 5 or 55 of total sludge phosphorus and 90 3 7 8 or 63 of total sludge phosphorus at 0 0 07 m and 0 26 m hcl dosage respectively despite a low ph 2 in the recovery chamber it was observed that the po4 3 p concentration started to decrease when the catholyte ph ascended to 10 e g 1 5 h with 0 07 m dosage in fig 3d possibly because of oh migration across aem that created microenvironments with a high ph leading to some po4 3 p precipitation ammonium removal and recovery was not directly affected by the catholyte acidification at all hcl dosages the nh4 n concentration in the anolyte rapidly decreased from 724 to 900 mg l 1 to 15 mg l 1 or 11 58 14 4 mg nh4 n in terms of absolute mass within 2 5 h fig 3b meanwhile the recovery chamber accumulated nh4 n at 839 80 26 75 mg l 1 12 20 12 56 mg 881 02 42 67 mg l 1 13 02 14 10 mg and 951 23 66 60 mg l 1 13 37 14 9 mg under three catholyte conditions representing a nh4 n recovery efficiency of 94 3 1 4 102 8 3 3 and 101 7 4 6 respectively an extended operation longer than 2 5 h caused a gradual decline of nh4 n in the nutrient recovery chamber fig 3d and increase in the catholyte fig 3c indicating that nh4 n could permeate through aem due to the lack of perm selectivity which was also observed in other studies ledezma et al 2017 we analyzed the charge transfer efficiency which can reveal the contribution of each cation or anion to electron transfer it was found that the catholyte acidification did not affect the charge transfer efficiency for nh4 migration which reached the peak of 26 3 28 9 at 0 5 h and dropped to 17 3 19 9 at 1 5 h fig 3e the key migrating cations shifted from unspecified cations mainly h 36 4 47 3 nh4 26 3 28 9 ca2 12 6 16 7 and na 7 2 16 6 at 0 5 h to a predominant ion h 86 2 89 8 at 5 h because of the increasingly acidic environment in the anolyte regarding the charge transfer efficiency for anion fig 3f 4 2 0 4 0 07 m hcl of total charges were used to move phosphate species significantly greater than 2 3 0 2 and 2 1 0 01 with zero and 0 26 m hcl dosage at 1 5 h p value 0 05 a lower phosphate charge transfer efficiency with 0 26 m hcl might be attributed to a stronger competition from cl during anion migration in addition the catholyte acidification lowered the cell overpotential that abated the normalized electrical energy consumption from 95 83 0 65 kwh kg 1 n or 1074 35 7 24 kwh kg 1 p at zero hcl to 56 25 0 36 kwh kg 1 n or 396 80 2 51 kwh kg 1 p at 0 26 m hcl dosage the ernc removed about 74 84 of soluble cod scod from the sludge liquid phase from 988 to 119 295 mg l 1 in the catholyte effluent at all hcl dosages to lower acid consumption a mild catholyte acidification with 0 07 m hcl was selected for the following experiments 3 3 effects of current density electrical current is a key factor to both phosphorus leaching and recovery under an open circuit condition there was negligible phosphorus leaching or recovery in the enrc fig s3 when the current density increased from 5 to 10 and then to 25 a m 2 the required time to lower the anolyte ph for example below 4 decreased from 2 5 to 1 9 h and then to 1 1 h fig 4 a this has accelerated the phosphorus peak leaching rate from 37 79 2 22 to 81 66 5 74 and then to 158 34 11 22 mg po4 3 p l 1 h 1 fig 4b due to the difference in the final analyte ph the leached po4 3 p ph 2 5 0 1 188 91 11 08 mg l 1 or 1958 4 2502 11 μg at 5 a m 2 was lower than that of 10 a m 2 ph 2 2 0 03 234 33 8 19 mg l 1 or 2702 2828 μg and 25 a m 2 ph 2 1 0 03 255 90 4 24 mg l 1 or 2929 2999 μg more than 98 of po4 3 p was removed from the catholyte at 1 5 h 2 5 h and 5 h under 25 10 and 5 a m 2 resulting in a remaining concentration below 4 mg l 1 fig 4c it was observed that there was a po4 3 p concentration spike at 1 h likely resulted from the dissolution of phosphate precipitates e g calcium phosphate under an acidic condition the po4 3 p concentration in the recovery chamber reached 88 20 20 22 mg l 1 1089 1985 μg 96 15 6 72 mg l 1 1292 1525 μg and 120 14 13 67 mg l 1 1568 2037 μg fig 4d at 5 10 and 25 a m 2 accounting for comparable recovery efficiencies of 60 4 70 1 p value 0 05 under an open circuit condition the nh4 n concentration in the anolyte slowly decreased from 900 mg l 1 to 450 mg l 1 within 5 h fig s3 likely due to the exchange of nh4 with h in the recovery chamber which contained 0 08 m hcl initially applying a current accelerated the nh4 n movement and decreased the anodic nh4 n concentration from 900 mg l 1 to less than 40 mg l 1 fig 4b resulting in removal rates of 173 36 351 72 and 587 91 mg l 1 h 1 at 5 10 and 25 a m 2 respectively the recovery chamber contained the peak nh4 n concentration of 881 951 mg l 1 fig 4d rendering a similar maximum recovery efficiency of 97 1 98 3 at all current densities however a higher current density might have contributed to a higher nh4 n aem leakage during prolonged operation for example an increase of nh4 n from 2 to 77 mg l 1 was detected in the catholyte after 5 h operation under 25 a m 2 4 fold of the increase under 5 a m 2 the charge transfer efficiency of individual ions varied under different current densities when the current density was increased from 5 to 25 a m 2 at 1 5 h the charge transfer efficiency of nh4 and ca2 decreased from 52 1 1 4 and 25 3 1 4 to 19 8 1 7 and 7 5 1 3 respectively fig 4e possibly due to a more intensive competition from h at a higher current density upon the maximum nh4 n recovery efficiency 33 0 3 2 29 5 0 9 and 19 8 1 7 of total charges were used to move nh4 at 5 10 and 25 a m 2 respectively the charge transfer efficiency of hpo4 2 which was 4 2 4 9 when the maximum po4 3 p recovery was achieved was not sensitive to varied current densities fig 4f cl and oh were two predominant anions that carried electrons but their charge transfer efficiencies showed an opposite trend when the current density was increased from 5 to 25 a m 2 at 1 5 h the charge transfer efficiency of oh increased from 41 2 8 0 to 68 7 2 2 while that of cl decreased from 47 0 8 1 to 26 0 2 6 therefore a higher current promoted the migration of both h and oh into the recovery chamber based on the voltage profile in fig s4 the normalized energy consumption was 22 82 1 59 31 58 2 95 74 17 2 67 kwh kg 1 n or 220 67 15 35 283 99 26 50 522 37 18 78 kwh kg 1 p under 5 10 and 25 a m 2 a comparable scod removal of 68 84 p value 0 05 from the liquid phase was achieved at all current densities because of a decent phosphorus leaching and energy efficiency 10 a m 2 and the operation period of 2 5 h were selected for the following experiments 3 4 concentrating nutrients in the recovery chamber high concentrations of the recovered nutrients can facilitate subsequent collection but one cycle of operation obtained n p concentrations in the recovery solution similar to or even less than their original concentrations in the leached sludge to increase the nutrient concentrations multiple cycles of the enrc operation were conducted with an unchanged solution in the recovery chamber so that nutrients could accumulate as shown in fig 5 a the enrc leached 147 59 215 24 mg l 1 po4 3 p from the sludge at the end of each cycle ph was lowered to around 4 0 fig s5 accounting for 40 58 of total phosphorus in the sludge the cathode removed 96 98 of the aqueous po4 3 p in the catholyte and produced a catholyte effluent with 5 mg po4 3 p l 1 the po4 3 p concentration in the recovery solution reached 142 62 7 78 mg l 1 after the first cycle and gradually accumulated to 404 56 20 44 mg l 1 after 5 cycles which accounted for 72 7 of the aqueous po4 3 p in the anolyte effluent or 29 1 42 2 of the total sludge phosphorus it was noticed that in the initial 0 5 h of each operation cycle the po4 3 p concentration in the recovery solution decreased slightly and then rebounded to a higher level in the following 2 h this was likely related to the precipitation of calcium and phosphate as indicated by a similar variation for calcium in the recovery solution fig s6 according to the precipitation equilibrium of amorphous ca3 po4 2 the precipitates could start to form at ph 5 0 5 2 although the bulk recovery solution had an acidic ph 2 there could be microenvironment of high ph especially adjacent to aem surface where ca3 po4 2 precipitation might occur due to oh migration from the catholyte mass balance revealed that after removing the recovery solution 6 9 of the released po4 3 p remained or adsorbed in the recovery chamber fig 5b in addition 9 8 of the released po4 3 p precipitated in the cathode chamber due to the high ph environment there was 10 6 of unaccounted po4 3 p possibly due to unknown loss during centrifugation and sampling the nh4 n concentration in the recovery solution was steadily increasing to 3493 56 194 13 mg l 1 h 1 after five cycles of operation fig 5a accounting for 90 of the total nh4 n in the sludge a linear removal at a rate of 285 50 7 95 mg l 1 h 1 was obtained for nh4 n to leave the anode and a similar rate of 271 39 5 18 mg l 1 h 1 was achieved for nh4 n to accumulate in the recovery chamber consistent with prior studies a total of 10 nh4 n remained in or leaked to the catholyte that resulted in an effluent containing 50 165 mg l 1 nh4 n ledezma et al 2017 overall the normalized energy consumption of five consecutive cycles was 25 67 3 07 kwh kg 1 n or 229 20 30 13 kwh kg 1 p the enrc removed 42 5 of the scod in the sludge liquid phase resulting in 572 51 mg l 1 cod in the catholyte effluent 3 5 product evaluation the high concentrations of both calcium 1600 mg l 1 and po4 3 p 400 mg l 1 in the recovery solution could enable the formation and precipitation of calcium phosphate by elevating the solution ph lei et al 2021 calcium phosphate is considered a potential product of phosphorus recovery hao et al 2013 at ph 8 5 more than 99 of the aqueous po4 3 p precipitated from the recovery solution to produce a solid with light brownish color table s3 and fig s7 the presence of po4 3 p group in the precipitate was confirmed by ftir spectrum fig 6 a at 566 cm 1 p o bond and 1017 cm 1 p o bond kong et al 2020 a prior study found iron phosphate and calcium phosphate co precipitation after elevating ph to 6 9 in an acidified sludge filtrate quist jensen et al 2018 however both ftir peak positions and xrd spectrum fig 6b of the precipitate were similar to that of the commercial hydroxyapatite indicating the predominance of hydroxyapatite calcium phosphate in the precipitate further analysis of the elemental contents showed that po4 3 p contributed to 13 6 of dry mass in the precipitate which was equivalent to 31 2 p2o5 content and would meet the 25 37 p2o5 requirement for economic grade phosphate rock gupta et al 2014 calcium was the major metal and took up 16 5 of the dry weight in the precipitate the presence of iron phosphate was highly possible as iron constituted to 7 2 of the precipitate dry weight the precipitate had a good soil phosphorus availability because of a al fe p molar ratio of 0 34 that was below the threshold of 1 shiba and ntuli 2017 migration of pb through the cem was possible as a pb content of 0 02 was detected in the precipitate below the 0 03 pb limit regulated by us epa biosolids agricultural land application other impurities including mg 1 92 mn 2 42 zn 0 43 cr 0 01 and ni 0 01 were also detected in the precipitate after recovering the solid phosphate products the recovery solution from the enrc was further stripped by air and 67 of ammonium was harvested as nh4 2so4 3 6 perspectives this study has demonstrated simultaneous electrochemical phosphorus leaching from the digested sludge and recovery of both nh4 n 90 and po4 3 p 72 in an enrc however several constraints need to be addressed before the practical application of the proposed system first the cost of chemicals assuming 31 hcl bulk price of 1 49 l 1 90 naoh bulk price of 0 5 kg 1 industrial electricity price of 0 06 kwh 1 was estimated to be 6 times higher than the cost of electricity in section 3 4 with catholyte acidification accounting for 80 of the chemical cost to eliminate catholyte acidification the po4 3 p recovery efficiency may be sacrificed i e from 72 to 42 furthermore the additional uses of hcl in the initial recovery solution and naoh in the po4 3 p precipitation step may also be replaced by a neutral electrolyte e g na2so4 to allow for po4 3 p precipitation inside the recovery chamber this study selected 0 08 m hcl as the initial recovery solution mainly for the accurate real time quantification of the recovered po4 3 p in its soluble form future efforts should be focused on reducing chemical consumption and optimizing phosphate precipitates management in the enrc system second the energy consumption by the enrc was relatively high 25 67 3 07 kwh kg 1 n or 229 20 30 13 kwh kg 1 p although the same energy was used for recovering two nutrients and those values are generally in the range of energy consumption by conventional electrodialysis methods 4 9 17 7 kwh kg 1 n and 92 6 619 9 kwh kg 1 p pan et al 2020 wang et al 2013 2018 ye et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 the high energy consumption can be related to the decreased electrolyte conductivity fig s8 and the increased overpotentials of an electrochemical system because the enrc cathode can produce h2 not collected in the present study theoretically the amount of h2 could provide 6 6 8 1 of the consumed energy assuming 100 electrons conversion to hydrogen gas and the energy calculation is based on a previous work luo et al 2017 renewable energy such as solar energy which has gained increasing popularity in wastewater treatment plants strazzabosco et al 2019 may be used to operate the enrc third the handling of the residue sludge needs to be a part of the enrc operation during the enrc anode treatment the total sludge volume initially expanded due to the foam formation but eventually decreased by 12 30 because of the dissolution of sludge particles guedes et al 2014 the volume fluctuation demands the anode design operation to be flexible in response to this change lastly the complicated nature of wastewater sludge might induce the fouling of electrodes and membranes over long term enrc operation shi et al 2019 a deeper understanding on the sludge fouling behavior and mechanism is imperative to guide the enrc development such as cleaning approach and cleaning frequency xia et al 2018 other parameters including facilitated mass transfer e g stirring during the anode sludge treatment electrode spacing and electrode surface area to volume ratio should also be optimized before practical application 4 conclusions in this study an innovative electrochemical system was investigated to achieve simultaneous phosphorus leaching from anaerobic digestion sludge and recovery of nh4 n and po4 3 p with the following conclusions 1 the enrc anodic acidification realized sludge phosphorus leaching efficiency of 67 65 74 06 and the po4 3 p concentration of 253 47 3 05 mg l 1 similar to that of direct hcl adjustment 2 catholyte acidification which prevented phosphate precipitation in the cathode chamber played a key role in improving the po4 3 p recovery efficiency from 41 99 to 90 26 and phosphate charge transfer efficiency from 2 3 to 4 2 nh4 n recovery efficiency could reach 94 and was not affected by catholyte acidification 3 a higher current density accelerated the phosphorus leaching and both nh4 n po4 3 p recovery but also led to a higher energy consumption at 10 a m 2 the enrc could achieve a leaching rate of 81 66 mg po4 3 p l 1 h 1 and recovery rates of 38 46 mg po4 3 p l 1 h 1 and 351 72 mg nh4 n l 1 h 1 at energy consumption of 25 67 3 07 kwh kg 1 n or 229 20 30 13 kwh kg 1 p 4 the recovery solution contained sufficient calcium and the aqueous po4 3 p could be precipitated without external metal addition around 29 1 42 2 of the total sludge phosphorus was recovered as solids that mainly consisted of calcium phosphate and had a phosphorus p2o5 content of 31 19 5 the challenges for further developing the enrc such as the trade off between po4 3 p recovery efficiency and energy chemical consumption
