19885,the efforts for implementing the anammox process at mainstream conditions with high nitrogen removal rates have gained much attention in the race for achieving an energy positive urban wastewater treatment plant here the successful and stable long term operation of an upflow anammox sludge bed uansb reactor treating a low strength synthetic influent amended with ammonium and nitrite for 420 days and a nitrite amended pre treated real urban wastewater for 110 days at temperatures as low as 11 c is presented the short and long term effects of temperature on anammox activity were assessed when the synthetic influent was treated and the uansb reactor was demonstrated to be a robust reactor to confront low temperatures typically found at mainstream conditions in fact a nitrogen loading rate as high as 1 8 0 1 g n l 1 d 1 with 82 4 of nitrogen removal was achieved at 11 c treating the low strength synthetic influent furthermore the effect of treating a nitrite amended pre treated real urban wastewater at 11 c at long term in the uansb reactor was evaluated and a stable operation was achieved with a high average nitrogen removal rate 1 2 0 5 g n l 1 d 1 the relative abundance of anammox bacteria was maintained higher than 70 according to fluorescence in situ hybridization during the whole operation being candidatus brocadia anammoxidans the predominant microbial species the presence of heterotrophs in the sludge bed was surmised through heterotrophic batch tests but anammox activity was demonstrated to be higher than heterotrophic activity even when the synthetic influent was replaced by the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater the feasibility of operating an enriched anammox reactor at high nitrogen removal rate at long term at mainstream conditions was demonstrated in this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox mainstream low temperature urban wastewater 1 introduction anammox based processes have been proposed as one of the most promising alternatives to achieve an energy producer urban wastewater treatment plant wwtp kartal et al 2010 siegrist et al 2008 over the past decade anammox based processes have been successfully implemented in the sidestream treatment of urban wwtps lackner et al 2014 however they have never been implemented in the mainstream the main challenge of the mainstream application of anammox based processes is to achieve high nitrogen removal rates which guarantee a good effluent quality together with a compact reactor design thus achieving a stable anammox operation in the long term at mainstream conditions is of paramount importance one of the challenges of the implementation of anammox process in the mainstream is the need of dealing with a much lower range of wastewater temperatures compared to the occurring in the sidestream process usually higher than 30 c in fact a gradient from 20 to 10 c was proposed by gilbert et al 2014 to simulate the temperature changes observed along the year in urban wwtps in moderate climates low temperatures have been reported to cause a considerable decrease of anammox activity dosta et al 2008 hoekstra et al 2017 hu et al 2013 vázquez padín et al 2011 despite that anammox bacteria were reported to grow in natural ecosystems at temperatures below 4 c such as the occurring in marine sediments rysgaard et al 2004 another challenge of the mainstream operation of anammox processes is dealing with a decreased net biomass production associated to the low nitrogen concentrations of the influent orders of magnitude lower than those of the sidestream and to the high influent flow causing a higher biomass wash out morales et al 2015 thus a system able to guarantee a high solids retention time would be needed to increase the biomass concentration i e to guarantee the growth of anammox at mainstream conditions therefore these two features are considered the main bottlenecks for implementing the anammox process in the main water line of urban wwtps since anammox bacteria were considered for a long time microorganisms with an intrinsic very long doubling time strous et al 1999 nevertheless recent studies have shown that the maximum specific growth rates of anammox bacteria are higher than previously assumed lotti et al 2015a zhang et al 2017 many studies focused on the implementation of anammox process at mainstream conditions either in one stage systems or in two stage systems with the separation of partial nitritation and the anammox processes in two different reactors on one hand a first approach to mainstream conditions was done using one stage reactors following the commonly called partial nitritation anammox pn a processes lotti et al 2014a reported a stable operation treating a synthetic influent at 15 c but process destabilization occurred in the long term operation at 10 c similar results were obtained by gilbert et al 2015 which compared different one stage pn a process configurations treating synthetic wastewater unfortunately destabilization of the system occurred at temperatures below 13 c in the case of one stage pn a systems treating real urban wastewater perspectives were not reported to be better as laureni et al 2016 recently reported the suppression of anammox activity at 11 c on the other hand previous results showed that stable partial nitritation could be feasible at mainstream conditions isanta et al 2015 reino et al 2016 and thus the two stage system approach appears as a good alternative to implement the anammox based process in the main water line of urban wwtps in this sense few studies reported stable operation of single anammox reactors i e fed with a mixture of ammonium and nitrite assuming therefore that a partial nitritation reactor would keep stable partial nitritation pérez et al 2015 treating real urban wastewater at low temperatures however these studies reported either low nitrogen removal rates which would lead to very large bioreactor volumes hendrickx et al 2014 laureni et al 2015 or high nitrogen removal rates but with high effluent recirculation ratios which would present a huge inconvenient to implement the process at full scale in the main water line of urban wwtps lotti et al 2014b ma et al 2013 in the present study the use of a lab scale upflow anammox sludge bed uansb reactor without effluent recirculation was proposed to implement the anammox process at mainstream conditions with the aim of obtaining high nitrogen removal rates first an exhaustive study of the effect of low temperatures 13 and 11 c on the reactor operation treating a synthetic influent amended with ammonium and nitrite was presented both short term and long term temperature effects were assessed to investigate how feasible would be the operation of the uansb reactor in a realistic temperature dropping scenario according to what would happen in the mainstream of an urban wwtp second the effect of replacing the synthetic influent by a nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater on the reactor operation at long term was evaluated at 11 c 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation a lab scale uansb reactor of 2 l of total volume including the gas liquid solid separator and 1 l of effective volume was used fig si 1 in supporting information ph was not controlled but measured off line and its value was rather constant at 8 1 0 3 during the whole operation influent tank was periodically flushed with dinitrogen gas n2 to guarantee a dissolved oxygen do concentration lower than 0 3 mg o2 l 1 additionally n2 gas was introduced into the reactor headspace do concentration was measured online in the reactor by using a do electrode do 60 50 crison instruments spain and concentration in the bulk liquid was always 0 0 mg l 1 temperature was measured and controlled by means of a cooling system and an electric heater hbsi 0 8 m horst germany connected to a temperature controller bs 2400 desin instruments spain the cooling system consisted of a tube surrounding the column of the uansb reactor with a continuous recycling of cold antifreeze liquid at temperature c a 5 c three different operating temperatures were tested 22 13 and 11 c liquid upflow velocity vup was in the range 0 3 1 0 m h 1 with an average value of 0 7 0 2 m h 1 during the operation to guarantee a stable granule diameter reino and carrera 2017 since no recirculation was used in the reactor liquid vup only changed when the inflow changed the operation of the uansb reactor was divided in two main periods regarding the type of influent treated between days 0 420 a synthetic influent was treated at sequentially decreasing temperatures 22 13 and 11 c and between days 420 528 a nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater was treated at 11 c 2 2 inoculum and wastewater characteristics the uansb reactor was previously operated at high temperatures 26 32 c treating a low strength synthetic influent reino and carrera 2017 thus at the beginning of the operation of the present study the sludge bed was highly enriched in anammox bacteria with an abundance of 93 2 of candidatus brocadia anammoxidans 5 2 of candidatus brocadia fulgida and 1 1 of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis as identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish from day 0 420 the uansb reactor treated a low strength synthetic influent amended mimicking the composition of the effluent of a previous partial nitritation reactor treating a municipal wastewater as the one described in reino et al 2016 the low strength synthetic influent contained 33 mg n nh4 l 1 38 mg n no2 l 1 1000 mg khco3 l 1 50 mg nah2po4 l 1 100 mg cacl2 2h2o l 1 200 mg mgso4 2h2o l 1 6 3 mg feso4 l 1 6 3 mg edta l 1 and 1 25 ml l 1 of a trace elements solution van de graaf et al 1996 from day 420 528 the uansb reactor treated a nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater as influent a real effluent from a partial nitritation reactor treating urban wastewater was not available at the time when the experiments were performed and thus a nitrite amended effluent from an urban wwtp without nitrogen removal treatment located in an industrial area of catalonia north east of spain was used as influent nitrite was added as nano2 to maintain a ratio between the nitrite and ammonium concentration of 1 3 0 2 ammonium and nitrite concentrations were 30 7 mg n nh4 l 1 and 40 7 mg n no2 l 1 respectively further characterization of the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater after the nitrite addition is provided in table si 1 in supporting information 2 3 maximum specific activities of heterotrophic bacteria maximum specific heterotrophic activity was evaluated on days 343 and 489 with batch tests according to a methodology adapted from dapena mora et al 2007 in this methodology the overpressure caused by the generation of n2 due to the activity of heterotrophic bacteria is measured in closed bottles temperature was set at 30 c and agitation was maintained at 150 rpm tests were performed in triplicates two sets of tests were performed i on day 343 with biomass treating a low strength synthetic influent and ii on day 489 with biomass treating the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater as influent tests were performed with different electron acceptors nitrite or nitrate and electron donors external organic matter i e acetate or internal organic matter i e decay products from cell lysis and in absence of ammonium the substrates used in each batch test and its corresponding concentration are detailed in table si 2 in supporting information tests were performed in triplicates 2 4 calculations and analytical methods nitrogen removal rate nrr was calculated as the removal of both ammonium and nitrite anammox substrates without considering the nitrate produced in the anammox reaction conversely nitrate produced was indeed considered for the calculation of the nitrogen removal efficiency nre since this parameter is more useful when talking about n removal from the point of view of real implementation samples of sludge bed were analysed to evaluate the presence of inorganic elements a semi quantitative analysis was performed on days 0 and 492 samples were pre treated as follows 0 1 g of lyophilised biomass were digested in a microwave digester mars cem with concentrated hno3 and hcl the analysis and quantification was done using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 7500ce agilent technologies by the analysis service of the universitat autònoma de barcelona barcelona spain relative abundances of anammox bacteria were assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish coupled to confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm hybridization

mastersizer series 2600 malvern instruments ltd uk sampling for size analysis was always performed at 145 mm of height of the uansb reactor 3 results and discussion 3 1 operation of the uansb reactor treating a low strength synthetic influent 3 1 1 long term effect of the temperature on the uansb reactor the lab scale uansb reactor was previously operated at high temperatures 26 32 c treating a low strength synthetic influent for 325 days as reported in reino and carrera 2017 afterwards temperature was directly lowered to 22 c day 0 of the present operation fig 1 during the reactor operation temperature was lowered to evaluate its effect on the anammox process in the long term initially the reactor was operated at 22 c for 3 months and then temperature was gradually decreased at a rate of 0 5 c per day during 3 consecutive weeks until achieving 13 c on day 344 temperature was directly lowered to 11 c and further maintained until day 420 a stable operation with high nitrogen removal rates was achieved for more than 10 months operating at temperatures between 13 and 11 c fig 1a and b although 10 months at such a low temperature is not too realistic in an urban wwtp this experiment is an undoubtable proof of the stability of the uansb reactor at such conditions in many other systems reported in the literature the operation at temperatures below 15 c triggered the destabilization of anammox process in the long term either in one stage laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a or in two stage systems jin et al 2013 sánchez guillén et al 2016 moreover the robustness of the uansb at low temperature was reflected by the high average nitrogen removal rates nrrs achieved at long term 2 0 0 3 g n l 1 d 1 at 13 c and 1 8 0 1 g n l 1 d 1 at 11 c these values are two orders of magnitude higher than those reported for other anammox systems treating synthetic wastewater operating at low temperature either in one or two stage systems gilbert et al 2014 sánchez guillén et al 2016 and higher to the achieved by lotti et al 2014b treating a real urban wastewater at 10 c in an upflow fluidized granular sludge anammox reactor with a high effluent recirculation flow rate nlr of 0 4 g n l 1 d 1 with a minimum recirculation ratio of 39 1 nevertheless the nrrs achieved did not represent the maximum capacity of the anammox biomass since they were directly obtained from the reactor operating in continuous mode and were probably affected by mass transfer limitations thus the real maximum capacity of the anammox biomass should be even greater than the one reported here the effect of temperature on the uansb reactor was successfully described according to the arrhenius equation in the range of temperatures 11 22 c specific nrr average values calculated after the long term operation at each temperature were plotted to a conventional arrhenius plot r2 0 998 and temperature dependency was described by a single apparent activation energy ea of 71 3 kj mol 1 this value is close to that initially reported by strous et al 1999 at high temperature ea of 70 kj mol 1 in a temperature range of 20 43 c and lower to the reported by lotti et al 2015b for different anammox sludge at low temperatures 22 11 c the value of apparent ea calculated for the uansb reactor was also lower than the reported by lotti et al 2014b in an upflow fluidized granular sludge anammox reactor at a temperature range of 20 10 c ea 100 160 kj mol 1 an instructive comparison between the obtained results with the uansb and the results reported by lotti et al 2015b 2014b is presented in terms of the relative anammox activities in fig 2 as can be seen the uansb reactor of the present study was less affected by the temperature decrease when temperature was lower than 15 c fig 2 this lower temperature effect compared to previous studies could represent an indication that the reactor could have developed certain degree of overcapacity which can be observed when analysing the short term effects of temperature decrease see next section for details the reactor overcapacity builds up due to a pull of cells retained in the granular sludge reactor exposed to substrate limiting conditions this pull of cells could contribute to buffer the effects of a temperature decrease or other changing conditions compared to cells in suspension i e planktonic cells see for instance leenen et al 1997 pérez et al 2004 this response is particularly relevant if the type of biomass in particular exhibits low decay rates against starvation as it is the case for anammox the term overcapacity has been previously used in the context of granular sludge reactors for nitrogen removal with anammox process hu et al 2013 lotti et al 2014a 2014c and it is also an old term used in nitrifying biofilm reactors tijhuis et al 1992 3 1 2 short term effect of temperature on the uansb reactor the short term effect of temperature on the uansb reactor was assessed by decreasing the temperature in the reactor i from 22 c to 13 c at a decreasing rate of 0 5 c per day and ii from 13 to 11 c in a single step down i e decreasing 2 c per day at once a zoomed in graph of the operation of the uansb reactor during these temperature drops is presented in fig si 2 in supporting information in both cases the decrease in temperature did not immediately affect the applied nlr and nrr in spite of the applied temperature decrease rates were faster than the proposed by gilbert et al 2014 as representative for urban wwtps in moderate climates 0 5 c per week when temperature was lowered from 20 to 13 c a decrease of 20 in nrr was recorded only after ca 25 days besides when temperature was sharply lowered to 11 c the temperature effect was even less noticeable and a decrease of 9 in nrr was observed only after a very long period ca day 398 see fig si 2 in supporting information hence the short term effect of decreasing temperature on the uansb reactor was demonstrated to be minor in the present study these results are in contrast with other studies about the short term effect of the temperature over pn a reactors in which a significant effect over the anammox activity was found at temperatures below 12 c gilbert et al 2014 lackner et al 2015 in the case of the upflow fluidized granular sludge anammox reactor reported by lotti et al 2014b which obtained considerably high conversion rates a sharp decrease in conversion rates was measured in the short term when temperature decreased in a rate of 0 3 c per day from 20 to 15 c and from 15 to 10 c immediate decrease of ca 60 in nrr thus the small temperature effect showed at short time in the uansb reactor together with the high anammox activity at temperatures below 15 c at long term figs 1a and 2 could be explained with the development of a reactor overcapacity associated to the plug flow configuration the plug flow behaviour of the uansb reactor was expected to lead to an anammox activity gradient along the height of the reactor anammox biomass in the bottom of the reactor was expected to be more active than anammox biomass in the upper part of it since the latter is expected to present more substrate limitations than the former ma et al 2017 thus anammox biomass in the bottom of the reactor could operate at a higher capacity than the biomass in the upper part therefore when temperature was lowered the anammox activity of the bottom part decreased and the biomass of the upper part could confront the substrate not consumed by the anammox biomass of the bottom part taking advantage of the above mentioned overcapacity previously developed at higher temperatures nevertheless the uansb reactor with its plug flow hydrodynamics presented external mass transfer limitations due to the low upflow velocity applied in this study 0 7 0 2 m h 1 reino and carrera 2017 in spite of these mass transfer limitations and the high nlr applied the average ammonium and nitrite concentration in the effluent were low 3 2 mg n nh4 l 1 and 4 2 mg n no2 l 1 throughout the study the external mass transfer limitations could be theoretically reduced using a high recycle ratio to improve the mixing and reduce the boundary layer this principle was applied by lotti et al 2014b in an upflow fluidized granular anammox reactor but that reactor also presented significant mass transfer limitations a fluidized granular sludge reactor was expected to present similar liquid flow hydrodynamics to a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr because of its high recycle ratio specifically in the range 39 1 to 99 1 for lotti et al 2014b thus the substrates concentration gradient i e the driving force of mass transport was expected to be reduced in an upflow fluidized granular sludge anammox reactor compared to an uansb reactor therefore in spite of reducing the boundary layer with the liquid recirculation mass transfer limitations are expected to still exist in well mixed granular reactors another effect of the cstr hydrodynamics is the homogenization of the anammox activity throughout the reactor and consequently less possibility of developing an overcapacity hence the uansb reactor with a plug flow hydrodynamics and high sludge retention capabilities could improve considerably the anammox activity at low temperatures despite the mass transfer limitations in addition to the high removal rates achieved at low temperatures the response of the uansb reactor during transient temperature events offers advantages for the particular development of technologies to remove nitrogen with anammox in the mainstream of the municipal wwtps 3 1 3 process stoichiometry solids concentration and granule size in the uansb reactor throughout the uansb reactor operation treating the synthetic influent the nitrite to ammonium consumption and the nitrate produced to ammonium consumed ratios were 1 2 0 1 and 0 25 0 07 respectively these values are close to the previously reported for anammox cultures lotti et al 2014c strous et al 1998 thus anammox process was expected to be the main process taking place in the reactor actually heterotrophic denitrification was not expected to be significant in the system since no organic carbon was present in the influent biomass concentration in the sludge bed of the uansb reactor was maintained stable during the operation at 22 c with an average value of 6 3 0 4 g vs l 1 total solids concentration was also stable during this period with an average value of 13 3 0 8 g ts l 1 biomass concentration slightly increased after the first 100 days of operation and was maintained at 10 3 0 9 g vs l 1 and 14 1 g ts l 1 during the operation treating a synthetic influent at 13 and 11 c respectively regarding the properties of the granules the settling velocity the sludge volumetric index at 5 min and the granule average diameter were maintained throughout the experimental period with average values of 41 6 m h 1 30 10 ml g 1 ts and 800 100 μm respectively consequently granulation was maintained stable endorsing that liquid upflow velocities below 1 m h 1 were enough to maintain good granulation in the uansb reactor as reported by reino and carrera 2017 3 1 4 microbiological characterization of the anammox enriched sludge biomass samples from days 69 22 c 108 13 c 309 13 c and 416 11 c were analysed by using the fish clsm technique to determine the changes in the abundance of specific anammox bacteria during the long term operation of the uansb reactor at low temperatures the relative abundance of the detected anammox species is depicted in fig 3 a a decrease of the initially most abundant species candidatus brocadia anammoxidans was observed in favour of the increase of abundance of candidatus brocadia fulgida after long term operation at 13 c in fact candidatus brocadia fulgida was barely detected at the beginning of the operation but showed a peak of relative abundance of 24 3 at day 309 this species was reported to be abundant in anammox reactors operating at low temperature hendrickx et al 2014 laureni et al 2015 lotti et al 2014b however it is noteworthy that candidatus brocadia anammoxidans was always the most abundant anammox species which is not usual in other reported anammox reactors at low temperature when temperature decreased to 11 c all the anammox species identified by fish decreased even candidatus brocadia fulgida however candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus was detected for the first time in the granules gonzalez martinez et al 2016 reported the appearance of candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus and the decrease of candidatus brocadia spp in a canon reactor when temperature was lowered from 35 to 25 c and suggested that the former could have a higher tolerance to low temperatures than the latter in addition to the three anammox species mentioned before candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis appeared in all the samples analysed but its abundance was always lower than 10 and no change in its abundance was observed when temperature decreased the changes in the relative abundance of the different anammox species throughout the operation at low temperature supports that microbial ecology was essentially determined by the operational conditions influent and bulk liquid substrate concentrations and or temperature rather than the inoculum used park et al 2010 to quantify the abundance of all anammox bacteria fish clsm was also used in the biomass samples by using a general probe amx368 table si 3 in supporting information with specificity for all anammox microorganisms fig 3b shows the abundance of all anammox bacteria versus the sum of abundances of the previous species identified a misbalance between the sum of the abundances of the anammox species previously identified and the total abundance of anammox species detected by the general anammox probe occurred when temperature was lowered to 11 c this result could suggest that different anammox species with high adaptation to low temperature developed in the granules of the uansb reactor in any case the total anammox bacteria abundance was maintained higher than 80 during the operation of the uansb reactor treating the synthetic influent this high enrichment could also contribute to the high stability of the uansb reactor 3 2 operation of the uansb reactor at mainstream conditions treating a nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater 3 2 1 nitrogen removal rates and long term operation of the uansb reactor after 10 months treating a synthetic influent at 13 11 c the influent was changed to a nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater from an urban wwtp located in an industrial area of catalonia north east of spain to study the effect of a real wastewater matrix on the uansb reactor fig 1c and d the replacement of the synthetic influent by the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater led to a decrease of nrr i e anammox activity after ca one week of operation fig 1c therefore the applied nlr was gradually decreased to adapt it to the actual nrr however an abrupt increase of the nlr occurred at day 452 this increase was unintentional and it was caused by an incorrect characterization of the urban wastewater during days 440 450 when this occurred the nrr also increased indicating that the system was operating under substrate limiting conditions the increase of nlr was associated to an increase of flow rate and thus to an increase of the liquid vup as a result during the period of the unintentional increase in nlr days 452 476 vup was twice the value measured during previous days 421 452 the higher liquid vup applied led to lower external mass transfer limitations in the system which allowed for a higher nrr than during previous days after this event nlr was decreased until achieving the values of the beginning of the period fig 1c from day 500 nlr was maintained stable and the decreasing trend of nrr was less pronounced for 25 days more long term operation of the uansb reactor treating a nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater at mainstream conditions was demonstrated to be feasible at high loading rates for more than 3 months at 11 c the average nrr achieved at 11 c 1 2 0 5 g n l 1 d 1 was considerably high compared to other anammox systems treating real influents at low temperatures for instance laureni et al 2015 reported a nrr of 0 046 g n l 1 d 1 in an anammox sequencing batch reactor sbr operating at 12 5 c and hendrickx et al 2014 reported a nrr of 0 027 g l 1 d 1 in a gas lift anammox reactor operating at 10 c which are more than one order of magnitude lower than that achieved in this study moreover for a one stage system laureni et al 2016 reported a maximum anammox activity of 0 1 g n l 1 d 1 in a pn a sbr reactor operating at 15 c with an almost complete suppression of anammox activity at 11 c again it seems that the overcapacity developed by the anammox sludge in the uansb reactor could explain such high nrr compared to other systems the nrr achieved by lotti et al 2014b in the lab scale upflow fluidized granular anammox reactor at 10 c nrr of 0 43 g n l 1 d 1 is the most comparable value to that achieved here and still the uansb reactor presents noticeable advantages compared to the reported study such as i higher removal rates which allow for lower reactor volumes together with a much lower temperature effect on anammox process both facts related to the overcapacity developed by the use of an uasb reactor and ii absence of effluent recirculation which implies higher energy savings associated to pumping compared to lotti et al 2014b the nitrite to ammonium consumption ratio increased until 1 4 0 2 and the nitrate produced to ammonium consumed ratio decreased until 0 21 0 05 compared to the obtained with the synthetic influent 1 2 0 1 and 0 25 0 07 respectively in addition an average value of cod removal of 50 10 c a 45 mg o2 l 1 removed was achieved regarding solids concentration in the reactor both vs and ts increased until average values of 16 8 0 5 g vs l 1 and 22 8 0 9 g ts l 1 the solids concentration in the effluent was maintained stable throughout the whole operational period including synthetic and real influent with an average value of 8 6 mg ts l 1 despite the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater had a high content of solids 10 3 mg ts l 1 compared to the synthetic influent negligible regarding the properties of the granules they were maintained in similar values than the obtained with the synthetic influent consequently the replacement of the synthetic influent by a real wastewater did not cause a deterioration of the granulation a picture of the granules before and after the change of influent is depicted in fig 4 3 2 2 decrease of anammox activity when treating the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater the decrease of nrr i e anammox activity in the uansb reactor observed when the synthetic influent was replaced by the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater cannot be explained by the temperature effect because temperature was already at 11 c 70 days before to the use of real wastewater as influent hence the lower anammox activity achieved with real wastewater should be associated to other factors rather than temperature such as i competition for nitrite between anammox and heterotrophic bacteria one of the main differences between the synthetic and the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater was the presence of organic matter in the latter the amount of organic matter in this real urban wastewater cod of 90 20 mg o2 l 1 could lead to the growth of heterotrophic bacteria which could use the nitrite and nitrate present in the bulk liquid as electron acceptors to perform heterotrophic denitrification henze et al 2008 liu et al 2007 destabilization of anammox process due to the competition for nitrite between anammox and heterotrophs was reported before chen et al 2016 lackner et al 2008 in this study heterotrophic denitrification was expected when treating the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater since a cod removal of 50 10 c a 45 mg o2 l 1 removed was achieved to corroborate this the maximum heterotrophic activity was evaluated for both synthetic and real wastewater periods of operation and anammox activity in the uansb reactor resulted considerably higher than the potential maximum heterotrophic activity determined in the granular sludge either treating synthetic or real influent fig 5 heterotrophic activity was barely observed in tests with biomass treating the synthetic wastewater day 343 except for the test with nitrite and decay products from lysis but it was indeed observed in tests with biomass treating the real urban wastewater and nitrate as electron acceptor hence heterotrophic activity tests surmised the presence of heterotrophs in the granules even when the synthetic influent was treated the heterotrophic activity tests showed that denitrification via nitrite was not relevant compared to denitrification via nitrate in the case of test performed with biomass treating the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater activity tests on day 489 see fig 5 perhaps heterotrophic bacteria present in the granules were not able to consume nitrite as electron acceptor due to the fact that anammox won the competition for nitrite thanks to its higher specific activity however nitrate was always available for denitrifiers and thus heterotrophic bacteria seemed to prefer nitrate over nitrite as electron acceptor fig 5 indeed a nitrite accumulation nitrite is an intermediate in the denitrification pathway from nitrate was observed in batch tests with nitrate as electron acceptor supporting the hypothesis of heterotrophs performing the denitrification of nitrate faster than that of nitrite in any case the heterotrophic denitrification via nitrate was useful to remove the nitrate produced by anammox and thus helped to guarantee low nitrogen compounds concentrations in the effluent 6 4 mg n nh4 l 1 6 5 mg n no2 l 1 and 7 2 mg n no3 l 1 hence the presence of heterotrophs in the granules of the uansb reactor is expected to be useful as long as they do not outcompete anammox bacteria the prevalence of anammox activity over heterotrophic denitrification was also reported before in anammox reactors treating real urban wastewater laureni et al 2015 malovany et al 2015 since in this study the prevalence of anammox activity over heterotrophic activity was demonstrated the high decrease in anammox activity when the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater was treated in the uansb reactor at 11 c cannot be explained by the competition with heterotrophic bacteria ii shift or decrease of anammox population in the anammox enriched sludge another explanation for the loss of anammox activity when the synthetic influent was replaced by the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater could be a decrease in anammox population however fish clsm results showed a high enrichment in anammox bacteria 72 6 with the general probe in the granules despite of the decrease of abundance compared with the synthetic influent treatment 90 3 this slight decrease does not explain the significant decrease of the nrr hence it could be hypothesised that a change in the anammox species present in the granules instead of the decrease of total anammox population could cause the nrr decrease in fact only candidatus brocadia anammoxidans maintained its relative abundance after the long term operation treating the real influent at 11 c fig 3a this indicates that the decrease in temperature to 11 c could have led to the appearance of other anammox species which were not identified by the specific fish probes used in this study the comparison of the relative abundances obtained with the general probe and the sum of the contributions of each specific anammox probe used in this study led to a misbalance in total anammox abundance fig 3b therefore such unidentified anammox species could present an adaptive advantage at very low temperatures or when organic matter is present the identification of these potentially highly adapted anammox bacteria to mainstream conditions would be of paramount importance thus the combination of further independent and complementary fish probes and even other molecular techniques should be applied to better understand the complex microbial community that could have appeared in the granules in any case it could be hypothesised that the unidentified anammox species that appeared in the granules had lower growth and consumption rates than the anammox species previously identified which could contribute to explain the decrease of activity in the uansb reactor when the influent was changed from low strength synthetic wastewater to a real one despite on being operating at the same temperature 11 c iii presence of potential toxic or inhibitory compounds for anammox bacteria in the real urban wastewater anammox bacteria can be inhibited by many substances present in urban wastewaters such as complex organic matter salts metals phosphate and sulphide among others jin et al 2012 the presence of toxic or inhibitory compounds for anammox bacteria in the real urban wastewater could also contribute to explain the decrease of nrr in the uansb reactor in this study since the real influent came from an urban wwtp of an industrial area where presence of heavy metals in the effluents is expected the presence of toxic or inhibitory metals was of concern the inhibitory effect of metals on anammox bacteria was previously demonstrated bi et al 2014 moreover lotti et al 2012 reported a considerable decreased in anammox activity caused by the prolonged exposure to copper cu and li et al 2015 reported inhibition after short term exposure to cu and zinc zn furthermore li et al 2015 determined nickel ni to be moderately toxic while lead pb was poorly toxic for anammox bacteria hence a general screening of the most common metals that could be present in the wastewater was done on biomass samples from day 0 and day 492 of the uansb reactor operation the results showed a high accumulation of metals in the granules after treating the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater table 1 this accumulation cannot be caused by the synthetic influent since it did not contain a significant amount of any of these metals the available information about anammox inhibition by metals is basically about the effect of concentration of metals dissolved in the bulk liquid however little has been published about the effect of the accumulation of metals in the anammox granules in this sense it was reported that an accumulation of cu in anammox granules caused disorders in metabolic pathways affecting to the energy metabolism and cell synthesis which led to the suppression of anammox activity zhang et al 2015 2016a still biomass acclimation to the presence of inhibitors could be hypothesised in the uansb reactor in the long term which could explain the anammox activity decrease at first and the subsequent much less pronounced decrease in the long term operation when the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater was treated in fact zhang et al 2016b suggested that anammox biomass gain self adaptation to cu through acclimation in any case due to the complexity of municipal wastewater the occurrence of inhibitory compounds other than metals cannot be excluded a priori as a cause for the decrease in activity the reason why the anammox activity decreased when the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater was treated in the long term at 11 c remains unclear but it could be the combination of the two last hypotheses previously exposed causes for the anammox activity suppression at 11 c in a pn amx sbr remained unclear in laureni et al 2016 and they suggested that further investigation would be needed for elucidating the mechanisms that limited anammox activity in such system laureni et al 2015 performed an extensive study to elucidate the causes of anammox activity decrease and reported that neither the heterotrophic competition for nitrite nor the shift of anammox population explained the adverse effects observed in anammox activity in a sbr treating a pre treated municipal wastewater and suggested that anammox population needed acclimation to the real influent and or the development of a side population beneficial to it in this study the reasons of losing activity also remained unclear though the high capability of the uansb reactor to confront low temperatures and adverse effects caused by a real urban wastewater was demonstrated making the uansb reactor a promising solution for the implementation of anammox in the mainstream of urban wwtps 3 3 implementation of the anammox process in the main water line of an urban wwtp through a two stage system a two stage autotrophic biological nitrogen removal bnr process has been proposed to face the challenge of implementing the anammox process in the main water line of urban wwtps ma et al 2011 pérez et al 2015 in such a process strategy partial nitritation and anammox processes are separated in two different reactors two stage systems certainly would present higher capital costs than one stage systems but they will allow for a more stable performance and control of both biological processes involved in in addition the use of two stage systems helps to avoid the presence of organic compounds in the influent on anammox reactor preventing its negative effects over this biomass and moreover it allows to have complete anoxic conditions in the anammox reactor nitrous oxide emissions in two stage systems compared to one stage systems could be of concern since the accumulation of nitrite and the use of low do concentrations might trigger significant n2o production during the partial nitritation process kampschreur et al 2009 however previous research has shown very low n2o emissions in granular sludge reactors performing partial nitritation at mainstream conditions with average gas emissions relative to conversion of ammonium in the range 0 2 1 5 at 10 c reino et al 2016 2017 for higher temperatures n2o emission values were reported in the range 1 2 4 0 for reactors performing partial nitritation of a low strength influent at 20 22 c reino et al 2017 wang et al 2016 these results show therefore a strong dependence between the n2o emission rate and the temperature of operation the influence of temperature on the n2o emission rates would advise for example for more intense monitoring campaigns and mitigation strategies during summer season one of the big challenges for the implementation of two stage systems for the autotrophic bnr at mainstream conditions relies on the stability of partial nitritation by achieving an effective repression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria in the long term previous research has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of operating granular sludge reactors performing stable partial nitritation at mainstream conditions with temperatures as low as 10 c in the long term isanta et al 2015 reino et al 2016 in addition to this challenge the implementation of autotrophic bnr as a two stage system also relies on the success of the anammox process at mainstream conditions thus the successful operation of a single anammox reactor at such adverse conditions is presented in this study 4 conclusions a stable long term operation with high nitrogen removal rates was achieved in a uasb anammox reactor at mainstream conditions the development of a reactor overcapacity related to the plug flow hydrodynamics and the high biomass concentration of the uansb reactor were suggested to be the reasons helping to confront the adverse conditions found when working at mainstream conditions the good response of the uansb reactor during transient temperature events offers advantages for the particular development of technologies to remove nitrogen with anammox in the mainstream of the municipal wastewater treatment plants

19885,the efforts for implementing the anammox process at mainstream conditions with high nitrogen removal rates have gained much attention in the race for achieving an energy positive urban wastewater treatment plant here the successful and stable long term operation of an upflow anammox sludge bed uansb reactor treating a low strength synthetic influent amended with ammonium and nitrite for 420 days and a nitrite amended pre treated real urban wastewater for 110 days at temperatures as low as 11 c is presented the short and long term effects of temperature on anammox activity were assessed when the synthetic influent was treated and the uansb reactor was demonstrated to be a robust reactor to confront low temperatures typically found at mainstream conditions in fact a nitrogen loading rate as high as 1 8 0 1 g n l 1 d 1 with 82 4 of nitrogen removal was achieved at 11 c treating the low strength synthetic influent furthermore the effect of treating a nitrite amended pre treated real urban wastewater at 11 c at long term in the uansb reactor was evaluated and a stable operation was achieved with a high average nitrogen removal rate 1 2 0 5 g n l 1 d 1 the relative abundance of anammox bacteria was maintained higher than 70 according to fluorescence in situ hybridization during the whole operation being candidatus brocadia anammoxidans the predominant microbial species the presence of heterotrophs in the sludge bed was surmised through heterotrophic batch tests but anammox activity was demonstrated to be higher than heterotrophic activity even when the synthetic influent was replaced by the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater the feasibility of operating an enriched anammox reactor at high nitrogen removal rate at long term at mainstream conditions was demonstrated in this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox mainstream low temperature urban wastewater 1 introduction anammox based processes have been proposed as one of the most promising alternatives to achieve an energy producer urban wastewater treatment plant wwtp kartal et al 2010 siegrist et al 2008 over the past decade anammox based processes have been successfully implemented in the sidestream treatment of urban wwtps lackner et al 2014 however they have never been implemented in the mainstream the main challenge of the mainstream application of anammox based processes is to achieve high nitrogen removal rates which guarantee a good effluent quality together with a compact reactor design thus achieving a stable anammox operation in the long term at mainstream conditions is of paramount importance one of the challenges of the implementation of anammox process in the mainstream is the need of dealing with a much lower range of wastewater temperatures compared to the occurring in the sidestream process usually higher than 30 c in fact a gradient from 20 to 10 c was proposed by gilbert et al 2014 to simulate the temperature changes observed along the year in urban wwtps in moderate climates low temperatures have been reported to cause a considerable decrease of anammox activity dosta et al 2008 hoekstra et al 2017 hu et al 2013 vázquez padín et al 2011 despite that anammox bacteria were reported to grow in natural ecosystems at temperatures below 4 c such as the occurring in marine sediments rysgaard et al 2004 another challenge of the mainstream operation of anammox processes is dealing with a decreased net biomass production associated to the low nitrogen concentrations of the influent orders of magnitude lower than those of the sidestream and to the high influent flow causing a higher biomass wash out morales et al 2015 thus a system able to guarantee a high solids retention time would be needed to increase the biomass concentration i e to guarantee the growth of anammox at mainstream conditions therefore these two features are considered the main bottlenecks for implementing the anammox process in the main water line of urban wwtps since anammox bacteria were considered for a long time microorganisms with an intrinsic very long doubling time strous et al 1999 nevertheless recent studies have shown that the maximum specific growth rates of anammox bacteria are higher than previously assumed lotti et al 2015a zhang et al 2017 many studies focused on the implementation of anammox process at mainstream conditions either in one stage systems or in two stage systems with the separation of partial nitritation and the anammox processes in two different reactors on one hand a first approach to mainstream conditions was done using one stage reactors following the commonly called partial nitritation anammox pn a processes lotti et al 2014a reported a stable operation treating a synthetic influent at 15 c but process destabilization occurred in the long term operation at 10 c similar results were obtained by gilbert et al 2015 which compared different one stage pn a process configurations treating synthetic wastewater unfortunately destabilization of the system occurred at temperatures below 13 c in the case of one stage pn a systems treating real urban wastewater perspectives were not reported to be better as laureni et al 2016 recently reported the suppression of anammox activity at 11 c on the other hand previous results showed that stable partial nitritation could be feasible at mainstream conditions isanta et al 2015 reino et al 2016 and thus the two stage system approach appears as a good alternative to implement the anammox based process in the main water line of urban wwtps in this sense few studies reported stable operation of single anammox reactors i e fed with a mixture of ammonium and nitrite assuming therefore that a partial nitritation reactor would keep stable partial nitritation pérez et al 2015 treating real urban wastewater at low temperatures however these studies reported either low nitrogen removal rates which would lead to very large bioreactor volumes hendrickx et al 2014 laureni et al 2015 or high nitrogen removal rates but with high effluent recirculation ratios which would present a huge inconvenient to implement the process at full scale in the main water line of urban wwtps lotti et al 2014b ma et al 2013 in the present study the use of a lab scale upflow anammox sludge bed uansb reactor without effluent recirculation was proposed to implement the anammox process at mainstream conditions with the aim of obtaining high nitrogen removal rates first an exhaustive study of the effect of low temperatures 13 and 11 c on the reactor operation treating a synthetic influent amended with ammonium and nitrite was presented both short term and long term temperature effects were assessed to investigate how feasible would be the operation of the uansb reactor in a realistic temperature dropping scenario according to what would happen in the mainstream of an urban wwtp second the effect of replacing the synthetic influent by a nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater on the reactor operation at long term was evaluated at 11 c 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation a lab scale uansb reactor of 2 l of total volume including the gas liquid solid separator and 1 l of effective volume was used fig si 1 in supporting information ph was not controlled but measured off line and its value was rather constant at 8 1 0 3 during the whole operation influent tank was periodically flushed with dinitrogen gas n2 to guarantee a dissolved oxygen do concentration lower than 0 3 mg o2 l 1 additionally n2 gas was introduced into the reactor headspace do concentration was measured online in the reactor by using a do electrode do 60 50 crison instruments spain and concentration in the bulk liquid was always 0 0 mg l 1 temperature was measured and controlled by means of a cooling system and an electric heater hbsi 0 8 m horst germany connected to a temperature controller bs 2400 desin instruments spain the cooling system consisted of a tube surrounding the column of the uansb reactor with a continuous recycling of cold antifreeze liquid at temperature c a 5 c three different operating temperatures were tested 22 13 and 11 c liquid upflow velocity vup was in the range 0 3 1 0 m h 1 with an average value of 0 7 0 2 m h 1 during the operation to guarantee a stable granule diameter reino and carrera 2017 since no recirculation was used in the reactor liquid vup only changed when the inflow changed the operation of the uansb reactor was divided in two main periods regarding the type of influent treated between days 0 420 a synthetic influent was treated at sequentially decreasing temperatures 22 13 and 11 c and between days 420 528 a nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater was treated at 11 c 2 2 inoculum and wastewater characteristics the uansb reactor was previously operated at high temperatures 26 32 c treating a low strength synthetic influent reino and carrera 2017 thus at the beginning of the operation of the present study the sludge bed was highly enriched in anammox bacteria with an abundance of 93 2 of candidatus brocadia anammoxidans 5 2 of candidatus brocadia fulgida and 1 1 of candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis as identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish from day 0 420 the uansb reactor treated a low strength synthetic influent amended mimicking the composition of the effluent of a previous partial nitritation reactor treating a municipal wastewater as the one described in reino et al 2016 the low strength synthetic influent contained 33 mg n nh4 l 1 38 mg n no2 l 1 1000 mg khco3 l 1 50 mg nah2po4 l 1 100 mg cacl2 2h2o l 1 200 mg mgso4 2h2o l 1 6 3 mg feso4 l 1 6 3 mg edta l 1 and 1 25 ml l 1 of a trace elements solution van de graaf et al 1996 from day 420 528 the uansb reactor treated a nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater as influent a real effluent from a partial nitritation reactor treating urban wastewater was not available at the time when the experiments were performed and thus a nitrite amended effluent from an urban wwtp without nitrogen removal treatment located in an industrial area of catalonia north east of spain was used as influent nitrite was added as nano2 to maintain a ratio between the nitrite and ammonium concentration of 1 3 0 2 ammonium and nitrite concentrations were 30 7 mg n nh4 l 1 and 40 7 mg n no2 l 1 respectively further characterization of the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater after the nitrite addition is provided in table si 1 in supporting information 2 3 maximum specific activities of heterotrophic bacteria maximum specific heterotrophic activity was evaluated on days 343 and 489 with batch tests according to a methodology adapted from dapena mora et al 2007 in this methodology the overpressure caused by the generation of n2 due to the activity of heterotrophic bacteria is measured in closed bottles temperature was set at 30 c and agitation was maintained at 150 rpm tests were performed in triplicates two sets of tests were performed i on day 343 with biomass treating a low strength synthetic influent and ii on day 489 with biomass treating the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater as influent tests were performed with different electron acceptors nitrite or nitrate and electron donors external organic matter i e acetate or internal organic matter i e decay products from cell lysis and in absence of ammonium the substrates used in each batch test and its corresponding concentration are detailed in table si 2 in supporting information tests were performed in triplicates 2 4 calculations and analytical methods nitrogen removal rate nrr was calculated as the removal of both ammonium and nitrite anammox substrates without considering the nitrate produced in the anammox reaction conversely nitrate produced was indeed considered for the calculation of the nitrogen removal efficiency nre since this parameter is more useful when talking about n removal from the point of view of real implementation samples of sludge bed were analysed to evaluate the presence of inorganic elements a semi quantitative analysis was performed on days 0 and 492 samples were pre treated as follows 0 1 g of lyophilised biomass were digested in a microwave digester mars cem with concentrated hno3 and hcl the analysis and quantification was done using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 7500ce agilent technologies by the analysis service of the universitat autònoma de barcelona barcelona spain relative abundances of anammox bacteria were assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish coupled to confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm hybridization

treating a low strength synthetic influent 3 1 1 long term effect of the temperature on the uansb reactor the lab scale uansb reactor was previously operated at high temperatures 26 32 c treating a low strength synthetic influent for 325 days as reported in reino and carrera 2017 afterwards temperature was directly lowered to 22 c day 0 of the present operation fig 1 during the reactor operation temperature was lowered to evaluate its effect on the anammox process in the long term initially the reactor was operated at 22 c for 3 months and then temperature was gradually decreased at a rate of 0 5 c per day during 3 consecutive weeks until achieving 13 c on day 344 temperature was directly lowered to 11 c and further maintained until day 420 a stable operation with high nitrogen removal rates was achieved for more than 10 months operating at temperatures between 13 and 11 c fig 1a and b although 10 months at such a low temperature is not too realistic in an urban wwtp this experiment is an undoubtable proof of the stability of the uansb reactor at such conditions in many other systems reported in the literature the operation at temperatures below 15 c triggered the destabilization of anammox process in the long term either in one stage laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a or in two stage systems jin et al 2013 sánchez guillén et al 2016 moreover the robustness of the uansb at low temperature was reflected by the high average nitrogen removal rates nrrs achieved at long term 2 0 0 3 g n l 1 d 1 at 13 c and 1 8 0 1 g n l 1 d 1 at 11 c these values are two orders of magnitude higher than those reported for other anammox systems treating synthetic wastewater operating at low temperature either in one or two stage systems gilbert et al 2014 sánchez guillén et al 2016 and higher to the achieved by lotti et al 2014b treating a real urban wastewater at 10 c in an upflow fluidized granular sludge anammox reactor with a high effluent recirculation flow rate nlr of 0 4 g n l 1 d 1 with a minimum recirculation ratio of 39 1 nevertheless the nrrs achieved did not represent the maximum capacity of the anammox biomass since they were directly obtained from the reactor operating in continuous mode and were probably affected by mass transfer limitations thus the real maximum capacity of the anammox biomass should be even greater than the one reported here the effect of temperature on the uansb reactor was successfully described according to the arrhenius equation in the range of temperatures 11 22 c specific nrr average values calculated after the long term operation at each temperature were plotted to a conventional arrhenius plot r2 0 998 and temperature dependency was described by a single apparent activation energy ea of 71 3 kj mol 1 this value is close to that initially reported by strous et al 1999 at high temperature ea of 70 kj mol 1 in a temperature range of 20 43 c and lower to the reported by lotti et al 2015b for different anammox sludge at low temperatures 22 11 c the value of apparent ea calculated for the uansb reactor was also lower than the reported by lotti et al 2014b in an upflow fluidized granular sludge anammox reactor at a temperature range of 20 10 c ea 100 160 kj mol 1 an instructive comparison between the obtained results with the uansb and the results reported by lotti et al 2015b 2014b is presented in terms of the relative anammox activities in fig 2 as can be seen the uansb reactor of the present study was less affected by the temperature decrease when temperature was lower than 15 c fig 2 this lower temperature effect compared to previous studies could represent an indication that the reactor could have developed certain degree of overcapacity which can be observed when analysing the short term effects of temperature decrease see next section for details the reactor overcapacity builds up due to a pull of cells retained in the granular sludge reactor exposed to substrate limiting conditions this pull of cells could contribute to buffer the effects of a temperature decrease or other changing conditions compared to cells in suspension i e planktonic cells see for instance leenen et al 1997 pérez et al 2004 this response is particularly relevant if the type of biomass in particular exhibits low decay rates against starvation as it is the case for anammox the term overcapacity has been previously used in the context of granular sludge reactors for nitrogen removal with anammox process hu et al 2013 lotti et al 2014a 2014c and it is also an old term used in nitrifying biofilm reactors tijhuis et al 1992 3 1 2 short term effect of temperature on the uansb reactor the short term effect of temperature on the uansb reactor was assessed by decreasing the temperature in the reactor i from 22 c to 13 c at a decreasing rate of 0 5 c per day and ii from 13 to 11 c in a single step down i e decreasing 2 c per day at once a zoomed in graph of the operation of the uansb reactor during these temperature drops is presented in fig si 2 in supporting information in both cases the decrease in temperature did not immediately affect the applied nlr and nrr in spite of the applied temperature decrease rates were faster than the proposed by gilbert et al 2014 as representative for urban wwtps in moderate climates 0 5 c per week when temperature was lowered from 20 to 13 c a decrease of 20 in nrr was recorded only after ca 25 days besides when temperature was sharply lowered to 11 c the temperature effect was even less noticeable and a decrease of 9 in nrr was observed only after a very long period ca day 398 see fig si 2 in supporting information hence the short term effect of decreasing temperature on the uansb reactor was demonstrated to be minor in the present study these results are in contrast with other studies about the short term effect of the temperature over pn a reactors in which a significant effect over the anammox activity was found at temperatures below 12 c gilbert et al 2014 lackner et al 2015 in the case of the upflow fluidized granular sludge anammox reactor reported by lotti et al 2014b which obtained considerably high conversion rates a sharp decrease in conversion rates was measured in the short term when temperature decreased in a rate of 0 3 c per day from 20 to 15 c and from 15 to 10 c immediate decrease of ca 60 in nrr thus the small temperature effect showed at short time in the uansb reactor together with the high anammox activity at temperatures below 15 c at long term figs 1a and 2 could be explained with the development of a reactor overcapacity associated to the plug flow configuration the plug flow behaviour of the uansb reactor was expected to lead to an anammox activity gradient along the height of the reactor anammox biomass in the bottom of the reactor was expected to be more active than anammox biomass in the upper part of it since the latter is expected to present more substrate limitations than the former ma et al 2017 thus anammox biomass in the bottom of the reactor could operate at a higher capacity than the biomass in the upper part therefore when temperature was lowered the anammox activity of the bottom part decreased and the biomass of the upper part could confront the substrate not consumed by the anammox biomass of the bottom part taking advantage of the above mentioned overcapacity previously developed at higher temperatures nevertheless the uansb reactor with its plug flow hydrodynamics presented external mass transfer limitations due to the low upflow velocity applied in this study 0 7 0 2 m h 1 reino and carrera 2017 in spite of these mass transfer limitations and the high nlr applied the average ammonium and nitrite concentration in the effluent were low 3 2 mg n nh4 l 1 and 4 2 mg n no2 l 1 throughout the study the external mass transfer limitations could be theoretically reduced using a high recycle ratio to improve the mixing and reduce the boundary layer this principle was applied by lotti et al 2014b in an upflow fluidized granular anammox reactor but that reactor also presented significant mass transfer limitations a fluidized granular sludge reactor was expected to present similar liquid flow hydrodynamics to a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr because of its high recycle ratio specifically in the range 39 1 to 99 1 for lotti et al 2014b thus the substrates concentration gradient i e the driving force of mass transport was expected to be reduced in an upflow fluidized granular sludge anammox reactor compared to an uansb reactor therefore in spite of reducing the boundary layer with the liquid recirculation mass transfer limitations are expected to still exist in well mixed granular reactors another effect of the cstr hydrodynamics is the homogenization of the anammox activity throughout the reactor and consequently less possibility of developing an overcapacity hence the uansb reactor with a plug flow hydrodynamics and high sludge retention capabilities could improve considerably the anammox activity at low temperatures despite the mass transfer limitations in addition to the high removal rates achieved at low temperatures the response of the uansb reactor during transient temperature events offers advantages for the particular development of technologies to remove nitrogen with anammox in the mainstream of the municipal wwtps 3 1 3 process stoichiometry solids concentration and granule size in the uansb reactor throughout the uansb reactor operation treating the synthetic influent the nitrite to ammonium consumption and the nitrate produced to ammonium consumed ratios were 1 2 0 1 and 0 25 0 07 respectively these values are close to the previously reported for anammox cultures lotti et al 2014c strous et al 1998 thus anammox process was expected to be the main process taking place in the reactor actually heterotrophic denitrification was not expected to be significant in the system since no organic carbon was present in the influent biomass concentration in the sludge bed of the uansb reactor was maintained stable during the operation at 22 c with an average value of 6 3 0 4 g vs l 1 total solids concentration was also stable during this period with an average value of 13 3 0 8 g ts l 1 biomass concentration slightly increased after the first 100 days of operation and was maintained at 10 3 0 9 g vs l 1 and 14 1 g ts l 1 during the operation treating a synthetic influent at 13 and 11 c respectively regarding the properties of the granules the settling velocity the sludge volumetric index at 5 min and the granule average diameter were maintained throughout the experimental period with average values of 41 6 m h 1 30 10 ml g 1 ts and 800 100 μm respectively consequently granulation was maintained stable endorsing that liquid upflow velocities below 1 m h 1 were enough to maintain good granulation in the uansb reactor as reported by reino and carrera 2017 3 1 4 microbiological characterization of the anammox enriched sludge biomass samples from days 69 22 c 108 13 c 309 13 c and 416 11 c were analysed by using the fish clsm technique to determine the changes in the abundance of specific anammox bacteria during the long term operation of the uansb reactor at low temperatures the relative abundance of the detected anammox species is depicted in fig 3 a a decrease of the initially most abundant species candidatus brocadia anammoxidans was observed in favour of the increase of abundance of candidatus brocadia fulgida after long term operation at 13 c in fact candidatus brocadia fulgida was barely detected at the beginning of the operation but showed a peak of relative abundance of 24 3 at day 309 this species was reported to be abundant in anammox reactors operating at low temperature hendrickx et al 2014 laureni et al 2015 lotti et al 2014b however it is noteworthy that candidatus brocadia anammoxidans was always the most abundant anammox species which is not usual in other reported anammox reactors at low temperature when temperature decreased to 11 c all the anammox species identified by fish decreased even candidatus brocadia fulgida however candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus was detected for the first time in the granules gonzalez martinez et al 2016 reported the appearance of candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus and the decrease of candidatus brocadia spp in a canon reactor when temperature was lowered from 35 to 25 c and suggested that the former could have a higher tolerance to low temperatures than the latter in addition to the three anammox species mentioned before candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis appeared in all the samples analysed but its abundance was always lower than 10 and no change in its abundance was observed when temperature decreased the changes in the relative abundance of the different anammox species throughout the operation at low temperature supports that microbial ecology was essentially determined by the operational conditions influent and bulk liquid substrate concentrations and or temperature rather than the inoculum used park et al 2010 to quantify the abundance of all anammox bacteria fish clsm was also used in the biomass samples by using a general probe amx368 table si 3 in supporting information with specificity for all anammox microorganisms fig 3b shows the abundance of all anammox bacteria versus the sum of abundances of the previous species identified a misbalance between the sum of the abundances of the anammox species previously identified and the total abundance of anammox species detected by the general anammox probe occurred when temperature was lowered to 11 c this result could suggest that different anammox species with high adaptation to low temperature developed in the granules of the uansb reactor in any case the total anammox bacteria abundance was maintained higher than 80 during the operation of the uansb reactor treating the synthetic influent this high enrichment could also contribute to the high stability of the uansb reactor 3 2 operation of the uansb reactor at mainstream conditions treating a nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater 3 2 1 nitrogen removal rates and long term operation of the uansb reactor after 10 months treating a synthetic influent at 13 11 c the influent was changed to a nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater from an urban wwtp located in an industrial area of catalonia north east of spain to study the effect of a real wastewater matrix on the uansb reactor fig 1c and d the replacement of the synthetic influent by the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater led to a decrease of nrr i e anammox activity after ca one week of operation fig 1c therefore the applied nlr was gradually decreased to adapt it to the actual nrr however an abrupt increase of the nlr occurred at day 452 this increase was unintentional and it was caused by an incorrect characterization of the urban wastewater during days 440 450 when this occurred the nrr also increased indicating that the system was operating under substrate limiting conditions the increase of nlr was associated to an increase of flow rate and thus to an increase of the liquid vup as a result during the period of the unintentional increase in nlr days 452 476 vup was twice the value measured during previous days 421 452 the higher liquid vup applied led to lower external mass transfer limitations in the system which allowed for a higher nrr than during previous days after this event nlr was decreased until achieving the values of the beginning of the period fig 1c from day 500 nlr was maintained stable and the decreasing trend of nrr was less pronounced for 25 days more long term operation of the uansb reactor treating a nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater at mainstream conditions was demonstrated to be feasible at high loading rates for more than 3 months at 11 c the average nrr achieved at 11 c 1 2 0 5 g n l 1 d 1 was considerably high compared to other anammox systems treating real influents at low temperatures for instance laureni et al 2015 reported a nrr of 0 046 g n l 1 d 1 in an anammox sequencing batch reactor sbr operating at 12 5 c and hendrickx et al 2014 reported a nrr of 0 027 g l 1 d 1 in a gas lift anammox reactor operating at 10 c which are more than one order of magnitude lower than that achieved in this study moreover for a one stage system laureni et al 2016 reported a maximum anammox activity of 0 1 g n l 1 d 1 in a pn a sbr reactor operating at 15 c with an almost complete suppression of anammox activity at 11 c again it seems that the overcapacity developed by the anammox sludge in the uansb reactor could explain such high nrr compared to other systems the nrr achieved by lotti et al 2014b in the lab scale upflow fluidized granular anammox reactor at 10 c nrr of 0 43 g n l 1 d 1 is the most comparable value to that achieved here and still the uansb reactor presents noticeable advantages compared to the reported study such as i higher removal rates which allow for lower reactor volumes together with a much lower temperature effect on anammox process both facts related to the overcapacity developed by the use of an uasb reactor and ii absence of effluent recirculation which implies higher energy savings associated to pumping compared to lotti et al 2014b the nitrite to ammonium consumption ratio increased until 1 4 0 2 and the nitrate produced to ammonium consumed ratio decreased until 0 21 0 05 compared to the obtained with the synthetic influent 1 2 0 1 and 0 25 0 07 respectively in addition an average value of cod removal of 50 10 c a 45 mg o2 l 1 removed was achieved regarding solids concentration in the reactor both vs and ts increased until average values of 16 8 0 5 g vs l 1 and 22 8 0 9 g ts l 1 the solids concentration in the effluent was maintained stable throughout the whole operational period including synthetic and real influent with an average value of 8 6 mg ts l 1 despite the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater had a high content of solids 10 3 mg ts l 1 compared to the synthetic influent negligible regarding the properties of the granules they were maintained in similar values than the obtained with the synthetic influent consequently the replacement of the synthetic influent by a real wastewater did not cause a deterioration of the granulation a picture of the granules before and after the change of influent is depicted in fig 4 3 2 2 decrease of anammox activity when treating the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater the decrease of nrr i e anammox activity in the uansb reactor observed when the synthetic influent was replaced by the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater cannot be explained by the temperature effect because temperature was already at 11 c 70 days before to the use of real wastewater as influent hence the lower anammox activity achieved with real wastewater should be associated to other factors rather than temperature such as i competition for nitrite between anammox and heterotrophic bacteria one of the main differences between the synthetic and the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater was the presence of organic matter in the latter the amount of organic matter in this real urban wastewater cod of 90 20 mg o2 l 1 could lead to the growth of heterotrophic bacteria which could use the nitrite and nitrate present in the bulk liquid as electron acceptors to perform heterotrophic denitrification henze et al 2008 liu et al 2007 destabilization of anammox process due to the competition for nitrite between anammox and heterotrophs was reported before chen et al 2016 lackner et al 2008 in this study heterotrophic denitrification was expected when treating the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater since a cod removal of 50 10 c a 45 mg o2 l 1 removed was achieved to corroborate this the maximum heterotrophic activity was evaluated for both synthetic and real wastewater periods of operation and anammox activity in the uansb reactor resulted considerably higher than the potential maximum heterotrophic activity determined in the granular sludge either treating synthetic or real influent fig 5 heterotrophic activity was barely observed in tests with biomass treating the synthetic wastewater day 343 except for the test with nitrite and decay products from lysis but it was indeed observed in tests with biomass treating the real urban wastewater and nitrate as electron acceptor hence heterotrophic activity tests surmised the presence of heterotrophs in the granules even when the synthetic influent was treated the heterotrophic activity tests showed that denitrification via nitrite was not relevant compared to denitrification via nitrate in the case of test performed with biomass treating the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater activity tests on day 489 see fig 5 perhaps heterotrophic bacteria present in the granules were not able to consume nitrite as electron acceptor due to the fact that anammox won the competition for nitrite thanks to its higher specific activity however nitrate was always available for denitrifiers and thus heterotrophic bacteria seemed to prefer nitrate over nitrite as electron acceptor fig 5 indeed a nitrite accumulation nitrite is an intermediate in the denitrification pathway from nitrate was observed in batch tests with nitrate as electron acceptor supporting the hypothesis of heterotrophs performing the denitrification of nitrate faster than that of nitrite in any case the heterotrophic denitrification via nitrate was useful to remove the nitrate produced by anammox and thus helped to guarantee low nitrogen compounds concentrations in the effluent 6 4 mg n nh4 l 1 6 5 mg n no2 l 1 and 7 2 mg n no3 l 1 hence the presence of heterotrophs in the granules of the uansb reactor is expected to be useful as long as they do not outcompete anammox bacteria the prevalence of anammox activity over heterotrophic denitrification was also reported before in anammox reactors treating real urban wastewater laureni et al 2015 malovany et al 2015 since in this study the prevalence of anammox activity over heterotrophic activity was demonstrated the high decrease in anammox activity when the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater was treated in the uansb reactor at 11 c cannot be explained by the competition with heterotrophic bacteria ii shift or decrease of anammox population in the anammox enriched sludge another explanation for the loss of anammox activity when the synthetic influent was replaced by the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater could be a decrease in anammox population however fish clsm results showed a high enrichment in anammox bacteria 72 6 with the general probe in the granules despite of the decrease of abundance compared with the synthetic influent treatment 90 3 this slight decrease does not explain the significant decrease of the nrr hence it could be hypothesised that a change in the anammox species present in the granules instead of the decrease of total anammox population could cause the nrr decrease in fact only candidatus brocadia anammoxidans maintained its relative abundance after the long term operation treating the real influent at 11 c fig 3a this indicates that the decrease in temperature to 11 c could have led to the appearance of other anammox species which were not identified by the specific fish probes used in this study the comparison of the relative abundances obtained with the general probe and the sum of the contributions of each specific anammox probe used in this study led to a misbalance in total anammox abundance fig 3b therefore such unidentified anammox species could present an adaptive advantage at very low temperatures or when organic matter is present the identification of these potentially highly adapted anammox bacteria to mainstream conditions would be of paramount importance thus the combination of further independent and complementary fish probes and even other molecular techniques should be applied to better understand the complex microbial community that could have appeared in the granules in any case it could be hypothesised that the unidentified anammox species that appeared in the granules had lower growth and consumption rates than the anammox species previously identified which could contribute to explain the decrease of activity in the uansb reactor when the influent was changed from low strength synthetic wastewater to a real one despite on being operating at the same temperature 11 c iii presence of potential toxic or inhibitory compounds for anammox bacteria in the real urban wastewater anammox bacteria can be inhibited by many substances present in urban wastewaters such as complex organic matter salts metals phosphate and sulphide among others jin et al 2012 the presence of toxic or inhibitory compounds for anammox bacteria in the real urban wastewater could also contribute to explain the decrease of nrr in the uansb reactor in this study since the real influent came from an urban wwtp of an industrial area where presence of heavy metals in the effluents is expected the presence of toxic or inhibitory metals was of concern the inhibitory effect of metals on anammox bacteria was previously demonstrated bi et al 2014 moreover lotti et al 2012 reported a considerable decreased in anammox activity caused by the prolonged exposure to copper cu and li et al 2015 reported inhibition after short term exposure to cu and zinc zn furthermore li et al 2015 determined nickel ni to be moderately toxic while lead pb was poorly toxic for anammox bacteria hence a general screening of the most common metals that could be present in the wastewater was done on biomass samples from day 0 and day 492 of the uansb reactor operation the results showed a high accumulation of metals in the granules after treating the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater table 1 this accumulation cannot be caused by the synthetic influent since it did not contain a significant amount of any of these metals the available information about anammox inhibition by metals is basically about the effect of concentration of metals dissolved in the bulk liquid however little has been published about the effect of the accumulation of metals in the anammox granules in this sense it was reported that an accumulation of cu in anammox granules caused disorders in metabolic pathways affecting to the energy metabolism and cell synthesis which led to the suppression of anammox activity zhang et al 2015 2016a still biomass acclimation to the presence of inhibitors could be hypothesised in the uansb reactor in the long term which could explain the anammox activity decrease at first and the subsequent much less pronounced decrease in the long term operation when the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater was treated in fact zhang et al 2016b suggested that anammox biomass gain self adaptation to cu through acclimation in any case due to the complexity of municipal wastewater the occurrence of inhibitory compounds other than metals cannot be excluded a priori as a cause for the decrease in activity the reason why the anammox activity decreased when the nitrite amended pre treated real wastewater was treated in the long term at 11 c remains unclear but it could be the combination of the two last hypotheses previously exposed causes for the anammox activity suppression at 11 c in a pn amx sbr remained unclear in laureni et al 2016 and they suggested that further investigation would be needed for elucidating the mechanisms that limited anammox activity in such system laureni et al 2015 performed an extensive study to elucidate the causes of anammox activity decrease and reported that neither the heterotrophic competition for nitrite nor the shift of anammox population explained the adverse effects observed in anammox activity in a sbr treating a pre treated municipal wastewater and suggested that anammox population needed acclimation to the real influent and or the development of a side population beneficial to it in this study the reasons of losing activity also remained unclear though the high capability of the uansb reactor to confront low temperatures and adverse effects caused by a real urban wastewater was demonstrated making the uansb reactor a promising solution for the implementation of anammox in the mainstream of urban wwtps 3 3 implementation of the anammox process in the main water line of an urban wwtp through a two stage system a two stage autotrophic biological nitrogen removal bnr process has been proposed to face the challenge of implementing the anammox process in the main water line of urban wwtps ma et al 2011 pérez et al 2015 in such a process strategy partial nitritation and anammox processes are separated in two different reactors two stage systems certainly would present higher capital costs than one stage systems but they will allow for a more stable performance and control of both biological processes involved in in addition the use of two stage systems helps to avoid the presence of organic compounds in the influent on anammox reactor preventing its negative effects over this biomass and moreover it allows to have complete anoxic conditions in the anammox reactor nitrous oxide emissions in two stage systems compared to one stage systems could be of concern since the accumulation of nitrite and the use of low do concentrations might trigger significant n2o production during the partial nitritation process kampschreur et al 2009 however previous research has shown very low n2o emissions in granular sludge reactors performing partial nitritation at mainstream conditions with average gas emissions relative to conversion of ammonium in the range 0 2 1 5 at 10 c reino et al 2016 2017 for higher temperatures n2o emission values were reported in the range 1 2 4 0 for reactors performing partial nitritation of a low strength influent at 20 22 c reino et al 2017 wang et al 2016 these results show therefore a strong dependence between the n2o emission rate and the temperature of operation the influence of temperature on the n2o emission rates would advise for example for more intense monitoring campaigns and mitigation strategies during summer season one of the big challenges for the implementation of two stage systems for the autotrophic bnr at mainstream conditions relies on the stability of partial nitritation by achieving an effective repression of nitrite oxidizing bacteria in the long term previous research has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of operating granular sludge reactors performing stable partial nitritation at mainstream conditions with temperatures as low as 10 c in the long term isanta et al 2015 reino et al 2016 in addition to this challenge the implementation of autotrophic bnr as a two stage system also relies on the success of the anammox process at mainstream conditions thus the successful operation of a single anammox reactor at such adverse conditions is presented in this study 4 conclusions a stable long term operation with high nitrogen removal rates was achieved in a uasb anammox reactor at mainstream conditions the development of a reactor overcapacity related to the plug flow hydrodynamics and the high biomass concentration of the uansb reactor were suggested to be the reasons helping to confront the adverse conditions found when working at mainstream conditions the good response of the uansb reactor during transient temperature events offers advantages for the particular development of technologies to remove nitrogen with anammox in the mainstream of the municipal wastewater treatment plants

19886,cyanobacteria blooming is a serious environmental issue throughout the world removal of cyanobacterial cells from surface water with controlled release of cyanobacterial organic matter com especially toxic microcystins mcs would potentially reduce the processing burden in follow up water treatment coagulation is a key technique in water treatment herein the potential application of a novel titanium xerogel coagulant txc was evaluated for the treatment of cyanobacteria laden water in terms of cyanobacteria removal efficiency variation of cell viability the release and evolution of com in the floc accumulation and storage process under acidic to neutral conditions txc showed a higher removal efficiency of approximately 99 for cyanobacteria and a lower residual ti concentration than the widely used commercial polyferric sulfate pfs and polyaluminum chloride pac another advantage of txc was the reduced mcs concentration caused by the released acetylacetone acac from the hydrolysis of txc under solar irradiation acac degraded the extracellular mcs from an initial concentration of 40 μg l to a residual concentration of 7 μg l during a 16 day floc storage process the low residual ti concentration 0 04 mg l and the efficient removal of com mcs following txc coagulation reduced the toxicity to photobacteria the results demonstrate that txc is a promising dual effect coagulant for treatment of cyanobacteria laden water graphical abstract image 1 keywords coagulation microcystis aeruginosa titanium xerogel coagulant secondary metabolites 1 introduction cyanobacteria blue green algae cyanophyceae are highly adaptable prokaryotes which are able to cause extensive and striking blooms especially in freshwater ponds or lakes briand et al 2002 they have become a growing concern for drinking water utilities because they can interfere with treatment in various ways primarily by plugging filters and by producing secondary metabolites and taste and odor causing substances graham et al 2010 carmichael 1992 microcystins mcs are a class of toxins produced by certain freshwater cyanobacteria such as microcystis primarily m aeruginosa anabaena oscillatoria and nostoc sangolkar et al 2006 mc lr is one of the most common mcs and is toxic to both humans and animals dawson 1998 the world health organization who has set a guideline value of 1 0 μg l for mc lr who 1998 therefore cyanobacteria and cyanobacterial organic matter com including both intracellular and extracellular organic matter are critical concerns in drinking water treatment chemical coagulation has been a basic process in cyanobacteria laden drinking water treatment due to its low price and high removal efficiency teixeira et al 2010 pan et al 2012 traditional coagulants such as ferric or aluminum salts have been extensively studied for their use in the removal of cyanobacteria chen et al 2013 chow et al 1998 ho et al 2012 peterson et al 1995 sun et al 2012 velzeboer et al 1995 however the residual al fe in the treated water sometimes exceeds the upper limit of water standards 0 2 mg l for al and 0 3 mg l for fe which would be a severe threat to human health as alternatives to metal salts biodegradable and human safe natural materials such as clays pan et al 2012 chitosan ahmad et al 2011 cationic starch vandamme et al 2010 and tannin wang et al 2013 have been proposed as promising coagulants for cyanobacteria removal however due to the negative surface charge high motility diverse morphology and low specific density of the cyanobacterial cells as well as the extracellular organic matter eom the traditional coagulation treatment can hardly achieve satisfactory removal takaara et al 2010 ma et al 2007 several pretreatment strategies have been attempted such as complicated pre modification of natural coagulants with aldehydes amines and cationic reagents for enhanced entrapment of cyanobacteria cells beltrán heredia et al 2010 or kmno4 preoxidation ma et al 2012 prechlorination chen et al 2009 lin et al 2016 uv irradiation alam et al 2001 and ozonation chen et al 2009 schneider and tobiason 2000 in al fe coagulation to reduce the content of eom however the oxidation of cyanobacteria may lead to cell lysis the subsequent massive release of intracellular organic matter iom might deteriorate the water quality peterson et al 1995 therefore the chemical stress introduced to the cell membranes during coagulation process is an issue of concern the effects of coagulants on cell integrity critically depended on the type and dose of coagulants as well as the coagulation conditions which were all key parameters to guarantee an efficient removal of intact cyanobacterial cells without causing additional release of intracellular toxins chow et al 1998 li et al 2015 sun et al 2012 2013 after coagulation the cyanobacteria cells are transferred into the accumulated flocs in which the cyanobacteria are prone to losing viability because of the cell damage li et al 2015 once toxic mcs were released into water they are hard to be removed by the subsequent clarification filtration treatment chow et al 1998 teixeira and rosa 2005 therefore controlling the release of mcs is important in the coagulation process otherwise we need effective ways to degrade the mcs that are released during the floc accumulation process a gelation approach was developed to prepare titanium based coagulants in our previous work wang et al 2016 the resultant titanium xerogel coagulant txc showed distinct advantages over titanium tetrachloride tc and polytitanium tetrachloride ptc in water wastewater treatment by overcoming the shortcomings of tc and ptc including the low effluent ph the narrow workable dose and solution ph wang et al 2016 furthermore the txc overshadowed the commercial polyferric sulfate pfs on several industrial wastewaters with larger floc size and higher removal capacity wang et al 2016 the txc was prepared with a sol gel process using acetylacetone acac as the hydrolysis inhibitor in recent years acac has been reported as a potent photo activator which could effectively degrade various organic pollutants zhang et al 2014a 2017 even being anchored in titanium xerogel acac also showed an interesting photo activity which led to a repeatable and reversible sorption of dyes to the xerogel zhang et al 2014b therefore it is reasonable to expect that txc could be bifunctional in the treatment of cyanobacteria laden water removing the cyanobacterial cells and simultaneously reducing the concentration of mcs to the best of our knowledge the application of ti salt coagulants in cyanobacteria laden water has not yet been studied the optimal coagulation condition and the effects on cyanobacterial cell integrity during ti salts coagulation are totally unknown in the present work the application potential of txc in cyanobacteria laden water treatment was systematically investigated in terms of cyanobacteria removal efficiency variation of cell viability the release and evolution of com especially mcs in the floc accumulation and storage process two commercial inorganic coagulants pfs and poly aluminum chloride pac which are widely used in most drinking water treatment plants in china were selected for comparison under controlled laboratory conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1

three dimension excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectra 3d eem spectra using a fluorescence spectrophotometer fluoromax 4 horiba co germany with an excitation range from 200 to 500 nm and an emission range from 250 to 550 nm the cell morphology was observed with an environmental scanning electron microscopy env sem quanta 250 fei co usa at a 10 kv accelerate voltage the main pretreatment process was as follows the sample solutions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min then the pellets were fixed with a 2 5 glutaldehyde solution at 4 c overnight and then were washed with a phosphate buffer solution 0 2 m ph 7 4 three times thereafter the samples were consecutively treated with 30 50 70 85 95 and 100 v v ethanol for 15 min the dehydrated cyanobacteria cells were then fully dried with a vacuum freeze dryer freezone labconco usa prior to env sem observation the dried cells were mounted on copper stubs with carbon conductive adhesive and sputter coated with gold palladium by an auto sputter coater agar co uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation of cyanobacterial cells chl a was one of the most commonly used biomarkers for quantifying the microalgal and cyanobacterial biomass izydorczyk et al 2009 the concentration of chl a was chosen as the evaluation index in the coagulation experiments fig 1 depicts the effects of initial solution ph and coagulant dose on the removal of cyanobacteria with txc pfs and pac as shown in fig 1a txc had the highest removal efficiency of approximately 99 as the initial solution ph was or below 7 0 because of its higher hydrolysis constants table s1 ti salt was hydrolyzed faster than al and fe salts buettner and valentine 2012 ciavatta et al 1985 einaga and komatsu 1981 duan and gregory 2003 the flocs generated from txc reached 1300 μm within 1 min followed by the flocs from pfs with a maximum size of 600 μm in 2 min and those from pac to 300 μm till the eighth min fig s2 as the solution ph exceeded 8 0 txc immediately generated a large amount of titanium hydroxide with the zeta potential dropped to 28 mv which hindered the effective contact with the negatively charged cyanobacterial cells the abundant eom covering the cyanobacterial surface made the coagulation dependent on the reactions between metal hydroxides and organic matter in which charge property played a leading role charge neutralization is prone to destabilizing cyanobacterial cells as the metal hydroxides and organic matter are oppositely charged gonzalez torres et al 2014 therefore the phiep of the metal hydrolysates is determinative to the workable ph range the phiep values of the three coagulants were in the order of pac 10 0 pfs 7 9 txc 4 5 fig s3 explaining the better performance of pfs and pac than txc in alkaline solutions despite of the wider workable ph range 5 0 10 0 the removal efficiency of pac below 90 was lower than that of txc due to the lower solubility of ti oh 4 than those of fe oh 3 and al oh 3 table s1 the residual metal concentration in the txc system was the lowest among the three coagulants under all conditions the residual ti concentration was negligible in the ph range of 5 0 10 0 while the residual al fe concentration was highly ph dependent even at a low dose 2 mg al l the residual al concentration at ph 5 0 and 6 0 fig 1a exceeded the standard for drinking water quality 0 2 mg l taking removal efficiency residual metal concentration and the normal ph of cyanobacteria laden water into consideration ph 7 0 was chosen for the following coagulation experiments at ph 7 0 txc and pfs showed similar workable dose ranges starting from 8 mg metal l whereas pac worked in the range of 1 5 6 0 mg al l fig 1b the zeta potential vs dose plots demonstrate the importance of charge neutralization in pac coagulation for cyanobacterial cells in the neutralization regime the coagulant needs to be added on a stoichiometric basis stumm and o melia 1968 which depends on the amount of dissolved cationic hydrolysis species in the solution the charge densities of pac pfs and txc were 76 12 and 22 mmol g respectively therefore a lower dose was required for pac to destabilize cyanobacterial cells as the dose of pac was over 10 0 mg l the zeta potential of the system was over 15 mv as a result the colloids were re stabilized by the superfluous positive charges leading to an abruptly deteriorated coagulation performance therefore optimized doses of 12 mg ti l 12 mg fe l and 2 mg al l respectively for the txc pfs and pac systems were used in the following experiments at the dose of 30 200 mg l txc removed 90 100 of cyanobacterial cells from taihu lake water fig s4 which had a chl a concentration of 244 μg l a doc of 9 5 mg l a ph of 7 3 and a conductivity of 497 μs cm 3 2 cell breakage following coagulation in the practical applications coagulated flocs might be deposited over days or weeks before further suitable treatments were conducted in this process cyanobacterial cells died off and released toxic mcs and other iom the alive cyanobacterial cells were oval in shape with a smooth surface fig 2 in the blank system without nutrient substances there was only a small fraction of cell lysis most of the cells remained intact after 6 days fig 2a in the coagulated systems the cells were fully coated by the hydrolysates of txc and pfs while parts of the cyanobacterial surface were bare in the pac system which reflect the discrepancy in their hydrolysis behaviors as discussed above txc was hydrolyzed much more rapidly than pac and pfs did once dosed into water txc underwent a rapid hydrolysis and generated large flocs which entrapped the cells in clusters fig 2b comparatively the precipitate shells on the cell surface were more uniform in the pfs system fig 2c pac was stable upon dilution and was more effective in charge neutralization van benschoten and edzwald 1990 it took more time than pfs and txc to generate a thorough precipitation the flakes on the cell surface in the pac system immediately after coagulation was mainly from the pre polymerized aluminum hydroxides with increased storage time the surface of cyanobacterial cells was completely encased by the aluminum precipitation fig 2d compared with the blank control coagulation led to more severe damage to the cells in flocs the observed effect of coagulation on cell integrity was consistent with previous reports sun et al 2013 the cell viability on the fourth stocking day was further assessed using the double fluorescence staining method fig s5 cells with an intact cell membrane were stained bright green by fda whereas cells with a damaged membrane were stained bright red with pi most cells were stained bright red indicating that the cell membrane was damaged the cell viability was the lowest in the pac flocs along with the death of cyanobacteria the cell membrane began to lyse leading to the release of iom the 3d eem spectra fig 3 visually presents the variation of com as a function of floc storage time the two bright fluorescence regions at emission wavelength of 315 nm could be assigned to protein like substance fl a and intermediate products of metabolism fl b mainly aromatic amino acids and other nitrogenous materials coble 1996 determann et al 1998 mcknight et al 2001 westerhoff et al 2001 the two peaks at longer emission wavelengths between 400 and 450 nm fl c and fl d might be associated with fulvic like matter from the bacterial decomposition of the dead cyanobacterial cells chen et al 2003 compared with the blank control the coagulation systems had weaker fl a and fl b but much stronger fl c and fl d with the increase of storage time the intensity of fl a and fl b in the blank control increased indicating that fl a and fl b were the primary com this is supported by the similar 3d eem spectrum of the ultrasonic extracted com from living cyanobacterial cells fig s6 to that of the 8th day blank sample fig 3a in coagulation com was effectively adsorbed by the metal hydrolysates resulting in reduced fl a and fl b fig 3c d accompanied with the more severe damage of cells in the coagulated systems more fulvic like matter was generated leading to the enhanced fl c and fl d the complexation between organic matter and metals may result in enhanced fluorescence cabaniss 1992 therefore the low fluorescence intensity in the pac system could be explained by the stronger adsorption capacity of al hydrolysates to com fig s7 and or the weaker complexation ability between al and organic matter compared with those of fe and ti mcs are the main components of noxious secondary metabolites produced during the growth and death of m aeruginosa which are chemically stable dawson 1998 the gradual release of toxic mcs would greatly influence the subsequent treatment and consequently the quality of drinking water in the blank control the concentration of mcs rapidly increased to 34 5 μg l within 4 days and then stabilized at 40 4 μg l fig 4 a the color of the cyanobacteria gradually changed from green to light green and then colorless demonstrating the death of the cells and the decomposition of chl a the mcs in the pac and pfs systems showed a similar trend to that observed in the blank control the relatively slower accumulation rate of mcs in the pac system was consistent with its slower floc formation fig s2 and fig 2 starting from the eighth day the mcs concentration in the pfs system slightly dropped which might be attributed to the biodegradation of mcs the more significant biodegradation in the pfs system was evidenced by the stronger intensity of fl c and fl d in the 3d eem fig 3 in the txc system the extracellular mcs reached the maximum level 30 2 μg l on the 6th day and rapidly decreased to 7 4 μg l on the sixteenth day as shown in fig 4b there was acac in the supernatant of txc treated cyanobacteria laden water because acac was used as a modifying agent in the preparation of txc the concentration of acac firstly increased with the extension of floc storage time to 2 days and was then gradually decreased fig 4b therefore the dramatic reduction of mcs in the txc system might be caused by the released acac which will be revisited later 3 3 toxicity after coagulation both mcs and soluble metal hydrolysates could increase the environmental and health risks lawton et al 1990 ross et al 2006 for example al and its hydroxyl compounds were confirmed more noxious to photobacteria than ti and fe george et al 1995 petala et al 2006 strigul et al 2009 therefore the toxicity of the supernatants in sixteen days was assessed with a strand of photobacterium as shown in fig s8 the released secondary metabolites caused a bioluminescence inhibition of 22 to the bacteria after 16 day cultivation in the blank control the addition of coagulants reduced the bioluminescence inhibition in the order of pfs txc pac which was co determined by the concentration of released secondary metabolites and the residual metals of photobacterial toxicity as shown in fig 1b there were much higher residual concentrations of al and fe than ti in the coagulation system which might constitute health risks 3 4 photodegradation of mc lr by acac considering the existence of acac in the supernatant it is highly possible that the mcs in the supernatant might undergo abiotic degradation to test this hypothesis experiments on photodegradation of mc lr by acac were conducted a mixture solution containing 10 μg l mc lr and 0 1 mm acac was exposed to sunlight for 10 days in the blank control without acac the concentration of mc lr was constant within the first 6 days and then slightly increased as the solution became light green due to the growth of the survived cyanobacteria fig 5 a the concentration of mc lr in the presence of acac were continuously reduced under the sunlight irradiation the same was for the concentration of acac fig 5b the solar irradiation experiment clearly verified that the released acac in txc coagulation could effectively degrade mcs to better verify the role of acac in the photodegradation of mc lr a 250 w xenon lamp its emission spectrum is presented in fig s9 was employed to simulate the sunlight because of the self photosensitization effect mc lr of an initial concentration of 250 μg l was degraded by 24 6 fig 5c within 60 min irradiation with the addition of acac the degradation of mc lr was significantly enhanced fig 5c and d under the given conditions the pseudo first order degradation rate constant k 1 of mc lr reached the maximum at 0 05 mm acac 0 0347 min 1 a further increase of the acac dose led to a slightly reduced k 1 because the excessive acac competed with mc lr for available photons that is to say acac acted as an inner filter to mc lr leading to a weakened self photosensitization of mc lr the inner filter effect when 12 mg ti l txc was dosed in coagulation the released concentration of acac was 0 07 mm which was sufficient for the photodegradation of mc lr 4 conclusions txc played a bifunctional role in the removal of cyanobacteria cells in terms of coagulation the txc advantaged over the conventional pfs and pac in several aspects the higher removal capacity for cyanobacterial cells the larger floc size and the lower residual metal concentration meanwhile the released acac from the hydrolysis of txc reduced the concentration of extracellular mcs due to the potent photo activity of acac under solar irradiation the effluent following txc coagulation had a low biotoxicity which could reduce the processing burden in follow up water treatment besides simulated water the effectiveness of the txc was also checked with a real natural water however since both the mcs concentration and the water matrices vary in a wide range a further investigation on the workable stoichiometric ratio between acac and mcs and the specific coagulation and irradiation conditions is warranted for the practical application of txc and consequently the uv acac process for eutrophic water acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china

19886,cyanobacteria blooming is a serious environmental issue throughout the world removal of cyanobacterial cells from surface water with controlled release of cyanobacterial organic matter com especially toxic microcystins mcs would potentially reduce the processing burden in follow up water treatment coagulation is a key technique in water treatment herein the potential application of a novel titanium xerogel coagulant txc was evaluated for the treatment of cyanobacteria laden water in terms of cyanobacteria removal efficiency variation of cell viability the release and evolution of com in the floc accumulation and storage process under acidic to neutral conditions txc showed a higher removal efficiency of approximately 99 for cyanobacteria and a lower residual ti concentration than the widely used commercial polyferric sulfate pfs and polyaluminum chloride pac another advantage of txc was the reduced mcs concentration caused by the released acetylacetone acac from the hydrolysis of txc under solar irradiation acac degraded the extracellular mcs from an initial concentration of 40 μg l to a residual concentration of 7 μg l during a 16 day floc storage process the low residual ti concentration 0 04 mg l and the efficient removal of com mcs following txc coagulation reduced the toxicity to photobacteria the results demonstrate that txc is a promising dual effect coagulant for treatment of cyanobacteria laden water graphical abstract image 1 keywords coagulation microcystis aeruginosa titanium xerogel coagulant secondary metabolites 1 introduction cyanobacteria blue green algae cyanophyceae are highly adaptable prokaryotes which are able to cause extensive and striking blooms especially in freshwater ponds or lakes briand et al 2002 they have become a growing concern for drinking water utilities because they can interfere with treatment in various ways primarily by plugging filters and by producing secondary metabolites and taste and odor causing substances graham et al 2010 carmichael 1992 microcystins mcs are a class of toxins produced by certain freshwater cyanobacteria such as microcystis primarily m aeruginosa anabaena oscillatoria and nostoc sangolkar et al 2006 mc lr is one of the most common mcs and is toxic to both humans and animals dawson 1998 the world health organization who has set a guideline value of 1 0 μg l for mc lr who 1998 therefore cyanobacteria and cyanobacterial organic matter com including both intracellular and extracellular organic matter are critical concerns in drinking water treatment chemical coagulation has been a basic process in cyanobacteria laden drinking water treatment due to its low price and high removal efficiency teixeira et al 2010 pan et al 2012 traditional coagulants such as ferric or aluminum salts have been extensively studied for their use in the removal of cyanobacteria chen et al 2013 chow et al 1998 ho et al 2012 peterson et al 1995 sun et al 2012 velzeboer et al 1995 however the residual al fe in the treated water sometimes exceeds the upper limit of water standards 0 2 mg l for al and 0 3 mg l for fe which would be a severe threat to human health as alternatives to metal salts biodegradable and human safe natural materials such as clays pan et al 2012 chitosan ahmad et al 2011 cationic starch vandamme et al 2010 and tannin wang et al 2013 have been proposed as promising coagulants for cyanobacteria removal however due to the negative surface charge high motility diverse morphology and low specific density of the cyanobacterial cells as well as the extracellular organic matter eom the traditional coagulation treatment can hardly achieve satisfactory removal takaara et al 2010 ma et al 2007 several pretreatment strategies have been attempted such as complicated pre modification of natural coagulants with aldehydes amines and cationic reagents for enhanced entrapment of cyanobacteria cells beltrán heredia et al 2010 or kmno4 preoxidation ma et al 2012 prechlorination chen et al 2009 lin et al 2016 uv irradiation alam et al 2001 and ozonation chen et al 2009 schneider and tobiason 2000 in al fe coagulation to reduce the content of eom however the oxidation of cyanobacteria may lead to cell lysis the subsequent massive release of intracellular organic matter iom might deteriorate the water quality peterson et al 1995 therefore the chemical stress introduced to the cell membranes during coagulation process is an issue of concern the effects of coagulants on cell integrity critically depended on the type and dose of coagulants as well as the coagulation conditions which were all key parameters to guarantee an efficient removal of intact cyanobacterial cells without causing additional release of intracellular toxins chow et al 1998 li et al 2015 sun et al 2012 2013 after coagulation the cyanobacteria cells are transferred into the accumulated flocs in which the cyanobacteria are prone to losing viability because of the cell damage li et al 2015 once toxic mcs were released into water they are hard to be removed by the subsequent clarification filtration treatment chow et al 1998 teixeira and rosa 2005 therefore controlling the release of mcs is important in the coagulation process otherwise we need effective ways to degrade the mcs that are released during the floc accumulation process a gelation approach was developed to prepare titanium based coagulants in our previous work wang et al 2016 the resultant titanium xerogel coagulant txc showed distinct advantages over titanium tetrachloride tc and polytitanium tetrachloride ptc in water wastewater treatment by overcoming the shortcomings of tc and ptc including the low effluent ph the narrow workable dose and solution ph wang et al 2016 furthermore the txc overshadowed the commercial polyferric sulfate pfs on several industrial wastewaters with larger floc size and higher removal capacity wang et al 2016 the txc was prepared with a sol gel process using acetylacetone acac as the hydrolysis inhibitor in recent years acac has been reported as a potent photo activator which could effectively degrade various organic pollutants zhang et al 2014a 2017 even being anchored in titanium xerogel acac also showed an interesting photo activity which led to a repeatable and reversible sorption of dyes to the xerogel zhang et al 2014b therefore it is reasonable to expect that txc could be bifunctional in the treatment of cyanobacteria laden water removing the cyanobacterial cells and simultaneously reducing the concentration of mcs to the best of our knowledge the application of ti salt coagulants in cyanobacteria laden water has not yet been studied the optimal coagulation condition and the effects on cyanobacterial cell integrity during ti salts coagulation are totally unknown in the present work the application potential of txc in cyanobacteria laden water treatment was systematically investigated in terms of cyanobacteria removal efficiency variation of cell viability the release and evolution of com especially mcs in the floc accumulation and storage process two commercial inorganic coagulants pfs and poly aluminum chloride pac which are widely used in most drinking water treatment plants in china were selected for comparison under controlled laboratory conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1

apparatus zr4 6 zhongrun water industry technology development co ltd china initially the cyanobacteria samples were rapidly mixed at 200 revolutions per minute rpm for 1 min followed with a slow stirring phase at 40 rpm for 15 min to promote the collision of particles and hence floc growth and finally a 20 min settling period the solution ph was adjusted to 5 10 with 0 1 m hcl or naoh

16 days flocs and supernatants were sampled every two days from initially 1 l of cyanobacteria laden solutions to measure the physicochemical parameters following coagulation 2 2 3 photoirradiation experiments photoirradiation experiments under simulated sunlight were conducted with a 250 w xenon xe lamp in a rotating disk photoreactor nanjing xujiang china wang et al 2014 sample solutions containing mc lr and acac were held in quartz tubes around the lamp the degradation of mc lr was also conducted under direct sunlight irradiation in early march 2016 at nanjing latitude 32 07 n longitude 118 57 e the centrifuged culture solution to removal cyanobacterial cell was diluted 10 times with a 0 9 nacl solution and was served as the background medium to prepare the mc lr solution with a final concentration of 10 μg l the initial solution ph was about 7 5 with no regulation during the irradiation experiments a parallel blank control was conducted without the addition of acac the sample solution was placed on the south window for 10 days the solution ph in the presence of acac was reduced to 6 5 after 10 days while increased to 8 0 in the blank control the concentrations of acac and mc lr in the sample solutions were measured after being filtrated with a 0 45 μm filter membrane 2 2 4 toxicity assay the standardized bioluminescence assay with v fischeri was carried out to assess the toxicity of the supernatants sampled after coagulation and during the floc storage period each of the samples was conducted in triplicate prior to toxicity assay the bacteria were reactivated in 1 ml of 2 5 nacl solution and mixed continuously at 20 c until the luminescence intensity was stable subsequently 2 ml of each sample in a 3 nacl solution was mixed with 10 μl bacterial suspensions the decrease in bioluminescence indicates a toxic effect and was measured by a model toxicity analyzer dxy 2 institute of soil science chinese academy sciences nanjing china after 10 min incubation positive controls consisting of a bacterial suspension in a 3 nacl solution were conducted along with the test samples representing the maximum v fischeri growth that could be reached the

size of the flocs a back colloid titration method with toluidine blue as indicator terayama 1952 was used to determine the surface charge density of the coagulants 1 hexadecylpyridinium chloride monohydrate hpc and potassium salt of poly 2 acrylamide 2 methylpropane sulfonic acid pampsk were chosen as standard polycationic and polyanionic electrolyte respectively an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa using beacon s microcystin plate kits beacon analytical system inc me usa was chosen to determine the total concentration of mcs in μg l because it cannot differentiate the types of mcs the concentration of mc lr in the photodegradation experiments was monitored with a waters alliance 1525 analytical high performance liquid chromatography connected to a 2489 pda detector waters co usa the column used was agilent eclipse plus c18 column 10 cm 4 6 mm i d 3 5 μm particle size and the mobile phase was a mixture of 0 05 v v trifluoroacetic acid tfa in acetonitrile solution

auto sputter coater agar co uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 coagulation of cyanobacterial cells chl a was one of the most commonly used biomarkers for quantifying the microalgal and cyanobacterial biomass izydorczyk et al 2009 the concentration of chl a was chosen as the evaluation index in the coagulation experiments fig 1 depicts the effects of initial solution ph and coagulant dose on the removal of cyanobacteria with txc pfs and pac as shown in fig 1a txc had the highest removal efficiency of approximately 99 as the initial solution ph was or below 7 0 because of its higher hydrolysis constants table s1 ti salt was hydrolyzed faster than al and fe salts buettner and valentine 2012 ciavatta et al 1985 einaga and komatsu 1981 duan and gregory 2003 the flocs generated from txc reached 1300 μm within 1 min followed by the flocs from pfs with a maximum size of 600 μm in 2 min and those from pac to 300 μm till the eighth min fig s2 as the solution ph exceeded 8 0 txc immediately generated a large amount of titanium hydroxide with the zeta potential dropped to 28 mv which hindered the effective contact with the negatively charged cyanobacterial cells the abundant eom covering the cyanobacterial surface made the coagulation dependent on the reactions between metal hydroxides and organic matter in which charge property played a leading role charge neutralization is prone to destabilizing cyanobacterial cells as the metal hydroxides and organic matter are oppositely charged gonzalez torres et al 2014 therefore the phiep of the metal hydrolysates is determinative to the workable ph range the phiep values of the three coagulants were in the order of pac 10 0 pfs 7 9 txc 4 5 fig s3 explaining the better performance of pfs and pac than txc in alkaline solutions despite of the wider workable ph range 5 0 10 0 the removal efficiency of pac below 90 was lower than that of txc due to the lower solubility of ti oh 4 than those of fe oh 3 and al oh 3 table s1 the residual metal concentration in the txc system was the lowest among the three coagulants under all conditions the residual ti concentration was negligible in the ph range of 5 0 10 0 while the residual al fe concentration was highly ph dependent even at a low dose 2 mg al l the residual al concentration at ph 5 0 and 6 0 fig 1a exceeded the standard for drinking water quality 0 2 mg l taking removal efficiency residual metal concentration and the normal ph of cyanobacteria laden water into consideration ph 7 0 was chosen for the following coagulation experiments at ph 7 0 txc and pfs showed similar workable dose ranges starting from 8 mg metal l whereas pac worked in the range of 1 5 6 0 mg al l fig 1b the zeta potential vs dose plots demonstrate the importance of charge neutralization in pac coagulation for cyanobacterial cells in the neutralization regime the coagulant needs to be added on a stoichiometric basis stumm and o melia 1968 which depends on the amount of dissolved cationic hydrolysis species in the solution the charge densities of pac pfs and txc were 76 12 and 22 mmol g respectively therefore a lower dose was required for pac to destabilize cyanobacterial cells as the dose of pac was over 10 0 mg l the zeta potential of the system was over 15 mv as a result the colloids were re stabilized by the superfluous positive charges leading to an abruptly deteriorated coagulation performance therefore optimized doses of 12 mg ti l 12 mg fe l and 2 mg al l respectively for the txc pfs and pac systems were used in the following experiments at the dose of 30 200 mg l txc removed 90 100 of cyanobacterial cells from taihu lake water fig s4 which had a chl a concentration of 244 μg l a doc of 9 5 mg l a ph of 7 3 and a conductivity of 497 μs cm 3 2 cell breakage following coagulation in the practical applications coagulated flocs might be deposited over days or weeks before further suitable treatments were conducted in this process cyanobacterial cells died off and released toxic mcs and other iom the alive cyanobacterial cells were oval in shape with a smooth surface fig 2 in the blank system without nutrient substances there was only a small fraction of cell lysis most of the cells remained intact after 6 days fig 2a in the coagulated systems the cells were fully coated by the hydrolysates of txc and pfs while parts of the cyanobacterial surface were bare in the pac system which reflect the discrepancy in their hydrolysis behaviors as discussed above txc was hydrolyzed much more rapidly than pac and pfs did once dosed into water txc underwent a rapid hydrolysis and generated large flocs which entrapped the cells in clusters fig 2b comparatively the precipitate shells on the cell surface were more uniform in the pfs system fig 2c pac was stable upon dilution and was more effective in charge neutralization van benschoten and edzwald 1990 it took more time than pfs and txc to generate a thorough precipitation the flakes on the cell surface in the pac system immediately after coagulation was mainly from the pre polymerized aluminum hydroxides with increased storage time the surface of cyanobacterial cells was completely encased by the aluminum precipitation fig 2d compared with the blank control coagulation led to more severe damage to the cells in flocs the observed effect of coagulation on cell integrity was consistent with previous reports sun et al 2013 the cell viability on the fourth stocking day was further assessed using the double fluorescence staining method fig s5 cells with an intact cell membrane were stained bright green by fda whereas cells with a damaged membrane were stained bright red with pi most cells were stained bright red indicating that the cell membrane was damaged the cell viability was the lowest in the pac flocs along with the death of cyanobacteria the cell membrane began to lyse leading to the release of iom the 3d eem spectra fig 3 visually presents the variation of com as a function of floc storage time the two bright fluorescence regions at emission wavelength of 315 nm could be assigned to protein like substance fl a and intermediate products of metabolism fl b mainly aromatic amino acids and other nitrogenous materials coble 1996 determann et al 1998 mcknight et al 2001 westerhoff et al 2001 the two peaks at longer emission wavelengths between 400 and 450 nm fl c and fl d might be associated with fulvic like matter from the bacterial decomposition of the dead cyanobacterial cells chen et al 2003 compared with the blank control the coagulation systems had weaker fl a and fl b but much stronger fl c and fl d with the increase of storage time the intensity of fl a and fl b in the blank control increased indicating that fl a and fl b were the primary com this is supported by the similar 3d eem spectrum of the ultrasonic extracted com from living cyanobacterial cells fig s6 to that of the 8th day blank sample fig 3a in coagulation com was effectively adsorbed by the metal hydrolysates resulting in reduced fl a and fl b fig 3c d accompanied with the more severe damage of cells in the coagulated systems more fulvic like matter was generated leading to the enhanced fl c and fl d the complexation between organic matter and metals may result in enhanced fluorescence cabaniss 1992 therefore the low fluorescence intensity in the pac system could be explained by the stronger adsorption capacity of al hydrolysates to com fig s7 and or the weaker complexation ability between al and organic matter compared with those of fe and ti mcs are the main components of noxious secondary metabolites produced during the growth and death of m aeruginosa which are chemically stable dawson 1998 the gradual release of toxic mcs would greatly influence the subsequent treatment and consequently the quality of drinking water in the blank control the concentration of mcs rapidly increased to 34 5 μg l within 4 days and then stabilized at 40 4 μg l fig 4 a the color of the cyanobacteria gradually changed from green to light green and then colorless demonstrating the death of the cells and the decomposition of chl a the mcs in the pac and pfs systems showed a similar trend to that observed in the blank control the relatively slower accumulation rate of mcs in the pac system was consistent with its slower floc formation fig s2 and fig 2 starting from the eighth day the mcs concentration in the pfs system slightly dropped which might be attributed to the biodegradation of mcs the more significant biodegradation in the pfs system was evidenced by the stronger intensity of fl c and fl d in the 3d eem fig 3 in the txc system the extracellular mcs reached the maximum level 30 2 μg l on the 6th day and rapidly decreased to 7 4 μg l on the sixteenth day as shown in fig 4b there was acac in the supernatant of txc treated cyanobacteria laden water because acac was used as a modifying agent in the preparation of txc the concentration of acac firstly increased with the extension of floc storage time to 2 days and was then gradually decreased fig 4b therefore the dramatic reduction of mcs in the txc system might be caused by the released acac which will be revisited later 3 3 toxicity after coagulation both mcs and soluble metal hydrolysates could increase the environmental and health risks lawton et al 1990 ross et al 2006 for example al and its hydroxyl compounds were confirmed more noxious to photobacteria than ti and fe george et al 1995 petala et al 2006 strigul et al 2009 therefore the toxicity of the supernatants in sixteen days was assessed with a strand of photobacterium as shown in fig s8 the released secondary metabolites caused a bioluminescence inhibition of 22 to the bacteria after 16 day cultivation in the blank control the addition of coagulants reduced the bioluminescence inhibition in the order of pfs txc pac which was co determined by the concentration of released secondary metabolites and the residual metals of photobacterial toxicity as shown in fig 1b there were much higher residual concentrations of al and fe than ti in the coagulation system which might constitute health risks 3 4 photodegradation of mc lr by acac considering the existence of acac in the supernatant it is highly possible that the mcs in the supernatant might undergo abiotic degradation to test this hypothesis experiments on photodegradation of mc lr by acac were conducted a mixture solution containing 10 μg l mc lr and 0 1 mm acac was exposed to sunlight for 10 days in the blank control without acac the concentration of mc lr was constant within the first 6 days and then slightly increased as the solution became light green due to the growth of the survived cyanobacteria fig 5 a the concentration of mc lr in the presence of acac were continuously reduced under the sunlight irradiation the same was for the concentration of acac fig 5b the solar irradiation experiment clearly verified that the released acac in txc coagulation could effectively degrade mcs to better verify the role of acac in the photodegradation of mc lr a 250 w xenon lamp its emission spectrum is presented in fig s9 was employed to simulate the sunlight because of the self photosensitization effect mc lr of an initial concentration of 250 μg l was degraded by 24 6 fig 5c within 60 min irradiation with the addition of acac the degradation of mc lr was significantly enhanced fig 5c and d under the given conditions the pseudo first order degradation rate constant k 1 of mc lr reached the maximum at 0 05 mm acac 0 0347 min 1 a further increase of the acac dose led to a slightly reduced k 1 because the excessive acac competed with mc lr for available photons that is to say acac acted as an inner filter to mc lr leading to a weakened self photosensitization of mc lr the inner filter effect when 12 mg ti l txc was dosed in coagulation the released concentration of acac was 0 07 mm which was sufficient for the photodegradation of mc lr 4 conclusions txc played a bifunctional role in the removal of cyanobacteria cells in terms of coagulation the txc advantaged over the conventional pfs and pac in several aspects the higher removal capacity for cyanobacterial cells the larger floc size and the lower residual metal concentration meanwhile the released acac from the hydrolysis of txc reduced the concentration of extracellular mcs due to the potent photo activity of acac under solar irradiation the effluent following txc coagulation had a low biotoxicity which could reduce the processing burden in follow up water treatment besides simulated water the effectiveness of the txc was also checked with a real natural water however since both the mcs concentration and the water matrices vary in a wide range a further investigation on the workable stoichiometric ratio between acac and mcs and the specific coagulation and irradiation conditions is warranted for the practical application of txc and consequently the uv acac process for eutrophic water acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china

19887,the combination of persulfates peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms and electrolysis using boron doped diamond bdd anode is a promising green advanced oxidation process in comparison with electrolysis alone electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anode considerably enhanced the degradation of carbamazepine cbz the experimental results indicate that the surface adsorbed hydroxyl radical ho played the dominant role the generally proposed nonradical oxidation mechanism ignored hydroxyl radical ho oxidation because low concentration of radical scavenger 10 m methanol or 5 m tertbutanol could not effectively scavenge the surface adsorbed ho the quasi steady state concentration of ho was estimated to be about 5 0 9 1 10 12 m for electrolysis with bdd anode and it was increased to 1 1 1 6 10 11 m and 3 2 5 0 10 11 m for addition of 5 mm pds and pms respectively the results of cyclic voltammetry cv and chronoamperometry as well as evolution of dissolved oxygen do reveal that the electrochemically activated persulfates molecule pds pms promoted the production of ho via water dissociation at bdd anode and enhanced the direct electron transfer det reaction which otherwise inhibited the oxygen evolution side reaction therefore higher current efficiency was achieved in electrochemical activation of persulfates process compared with electrolysis process additionally the transformation products of cbz were also investigated and their formation pathways were proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords surface adsorbed ho nonradical oxidation electrochemical activation of persulfates bdd anode 1 introduction recently hydroxyl radical ho and sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted extensive attention for degradation of persistent organic contaminants in waters and wastewaters oh et al 2016 oturan and aaron 2014 activation of inorganic peroxides including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and persulfates peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms by metal ions and photochemical radiation is the common method to produce ho or so4 han et al 2012 oturan and aaron 2014 yang et al 2010 development of efficient and environmentally friendly activation method is always in need electrochemical activation method is a promising green technology with electrons acting as the green reactant which has drawn increasing attention in recent years bu et al 2017 farhat et al 2015 sires et al 2014 boron doped diamond bdd electrodes are usually used for degradation of organic contaminants chaplin 2014 the substitute of carbon atoms by boron atoms in the diamond lattice enhances the conductivity of electrodes the commercially available bdd electrodes always consist of boron doped diamond thin film covered at p silicon bdd electrodes have extreme stability under anodic polarization and high overpotential for water dissociation chaplin 2014 perez et al 2012 the produced adsorbed ho from water dissociation can oxidize most persistent organic contaminants because of its high redox potential 2 7 v versus she perez et al 2012 polcaro et al 2009 the combination of electrolysis using bdd anode and pds has been developed in recent years the degradation of organic compounds was enhanced by addition of pds into electrolysis cell bu et al 2017 farhat et al 2015 nonradical oxidation mechanism was generally proposed for electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode bu et al suggested that pds reacted with ho at bdd anode surface to generate superoxide and singlet oxygen bu et al 2017 farhat et al stated that the nonradical oxidation generated from electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode was similar to that from activation of pds by carbon material farhat et al 2015 lee et al 2015 carbon element is the essential composition of bdd electrode boron doped diamond structure activation of pds with carbon materials including single walled carbon nanotube multi walled carbon nanotube reduced graphene oxide mesoporous carbon and graphitized nanodiamond has been reported by some researchers duan et al 2015a lee et al 2016 lee et al 2015 it was suggested that the interaction between pds and carbon surface functional groups played the important role for generation of nonradical oxidation however the interaction of bdd electrode surface with pds was always neglected investigation of the interaction of bdd electrode surface with pds is essential and meaningful in addition current studies did not clearly discern the role of nonradical oxidation and radical oxidation electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode is a complicated process in which adsorption electrolysis activation of pds oxidation of pollutants desorption and other processes are all present in the electrochemical reactor the involved electrochemical reactions include direct electron transfer det reaction 1 electrolysis with bdd anode to produce oxygen reaction 2 or ho reaction 3

reactions always happen at electrode surface rather than in bulk solution for example the produced ho is mainly adsorbed at electrode surface rather than dispersed in bulk solution chaplin 2014 the investigation methods e g radical scavenging used in homogeneous phase solution may be unsuitable for electrochemical process the above doubts about electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode need to be solved urgently the objectives of this study are i to evaluate the performance of electrochemical activation of pds using carbamazepine cbz as the model persistent organic compound ii to discern the reactive species generated in electrochemical activation of pds process by radical scavenging methanol and tert butanol and degradation of radical probes benzoic acid ba and atrazine atz iii to comparatively study the performance of electrochemical activation of pms with that of pds iv to estimate the relative contribution of involved reactive species according to kinetic data v to

triple salt pms carbamazepine cbz benzoic acid ba atrazine atz and tert butanol were purchased from sigma aldrich methanol of hplc grade was purchased from tedia and ficher other chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water produced from a milli q purification system the stock solution of pds and pms was prepared every week and placed in 4 c fridge 2 2 experimental setup the electrolysis setup was similar to a previously used device song et al 2017 as shown in scheme s1 a plate and frame electrolysis cell made of polymethyl methacrylate was used in electrolysis process the electrolysis cell was divided by a cation exchange membrane cem into two chambers with 90 ml net volume respectively the electrolysis cell was fixed by bolt made of titanium which can avoid the metal ions pollution plate bdd electrodes 3 μm coating thickness with 700 ppm boron doping covered at p silicon active dimensions of 40 mm 25 mm 3 mm purchased from neocoat switzerland were used as the working electrode stainless steel mesh active dimensions of 40 mm 25 mm was used as the counter electrode a solution containing 50 mm sodium perchlorate naclo4 was used as the electrolyte a dc power itech 6300 taiwan was used to supply a constant current output in electrolysis process a magnetic stirring apparatus was used to mix the anodic solution thoroughly all kinetic experiments were performed in batch mode in a water bath 25 c solution ph was not buffered to avoid the possible interference of buffer e g phosphate working electrode and counter electrode were placed into anodic chamber and cathodic chamber face to face with the distance of 4 cm respectively after organic contaminants and persulfates were added into the anodic chamber and thoroughly mixed by a magnetic stirrer electrochemical reactions were initiated by applying individual current at given time intervals samples were collected from anodic chamber into lc vials containing 100 μl methanol and excess ascorbic acid all experiments were performed at least twice and the average data with their standard deviations was shown 2 3 analytical methods a high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2695 equipped with a photodiode array detector pda waters 2998 was used to analyze organic contaminants a symmetry c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm particle size waters was used for separation the mobile phase consisted of methanol and water containing 0 1 acetic acid with the flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the concentration of pds was measured by a modified iodometric method liang et al 2008 the concentration of dissolved oxygen do was measured with a do meter ldo101 hach 2 4 electrochemical characterization cyclic voltammetry cv and chronoamperometry were conducted with an electrochemical station metrohm parstat302a switzerland a typical three electrode system was used in electrochemical characterization process ag agcl electrode 0 220 v versus she aida technology china coupled with a luggin haber capillary was used as the reference electrode 1 m naclo4 solution was used as the electrolyte cv was performed from 1 0 v to 2 5 v versus ag agcl at a scan rate of 5 mv s 1 chronoamperometry was conducted at a constant potential of 2 0 v versus ag agcl after a stable current for water oxidation was achieved 1 mm pds or pms was slowly added into the electrolyte detailed method provided in text s1 and the time dependent current response was monitored 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of cbz the degradation kinetics of cbz was investigated by individual pds and electrolysis with bdd anode as well as their combination as shown in fig 1 the degradation of cbz by pds alone was negligible electrolysis with bdd anode effectively degraded cbz due to the production of adsorbed ho via electrolysis of h2o reaction 3 chaplin 2014 as expected addition of 5 mm pds further enhanced the degradation of cbz compared with electrolysis alone cbz was completely degraded cbz t cbz 0 10 4 within about 35 min detailed calculation method provided in text s2 by the combination of pds and electrolysis using bdd anode the apparent pseudo fist order degradation rates of cbz derived from fig 1 were listed in table s1 as shown in table s1 addition of pds increased the degradation rate of cbz about 2 times relative to that of electrolysis alone the synergistic effect suggests that electrochemical activation of pds was achieved at bdd anode in parallel the decomposition of pds was examined in electrochemical activation of pds process as shown in fig s1 the decomposition of pds was accelerated when individual current passed through bdd electrode 3 2 identification of the involved reactive species 3 2 1 effect of addition of radical scavengers methanol was selected to scavenge both ho and so4 while tert butanol was used to scavenge ho the impact of various concentration of radical scavengers on the degradation of cbz was investigated as shown in fig s2 addition of 0 01 m methanol produced minor inhibitory effect on cbz degradation in electrolysis process further increasing the concentration of methanol produced greater inhibitory effect the degradation of cbz in the presence of 10 m methanol was close to that of pure methanol containing 4 water similarly addition of low concentration of tert butanol had minor inhibitory effect on cbz degradation increasing the concentration of tert butanol generated greater inhibitory effect on cbz degradation as high as 5 m tert butanol could effectively inhibit the degradation of cbz in electrolysis process the effect of addition of various concentration of methanol or tert butanol on cbz degradation in electrochemical activation of pds process was also investigated fig s4 similarly low concentration of methanol or tert butanol 0 1 m had minor inhibitory effect on cbz degradation 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol could effectively inhibit the degradation of cbz in electrochemical activation of pds process the above results indicate that low concentration of radical scavengers 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol could not effectively quench the radicals generated in electrochemical process both methanol and tert butanol are hydrophilic radical scavenger which can effectively quench the radicals in homogeneous solution in electrochemical process the produced reactive species are mostly adsorbed at electrode surface barazesh et al 2016 the hydrophobic organic contaminant e g cbz is easier to adsorb at electrode surface than hydrophilic methanol and tert butanol therefore the inhibitory effect of low concentration of methanol or tert butanol on cbz degradation was minor in electrochemical process the similar phenomenon was also observed by other researchers barazesh et al 2016 solomon and madix 1987 zhu et al 2017 for instance barazesh et al also suggested that saturated alcohol i e methanol and tert butanol was unable to effectively scavenge the surface adsorbed radicals at bdd anode surface barazesh et al 2016 based on the above discussion we can deduce that scavenging the surface adsorbed radicals generated in electrochemical process needs far higher concentration of radical scavenger than that in homogeneous reaction process in the following experiments the concentration of methanol and tert butanol was set as 10 m for methanol and 5 m for tert butanol respectively interestingly the combination of pds and electrolysis still generated synergistic effect on cbz degradation although 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol was present in anodic chamber fig 2 the degradation rate of cbz by electrochemical activation of pds in the presence of 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol was higher than that by electrolysis in the presence of 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol the synergistic effect was attributed to nonradical oxidation which is in accordance with previous studies bu et al 2017 farhat et al 2015 however the degradation rate of cbz in electrochemical activation of pds process 0 1135 min 1 was far higher than the sum of electrochemical activation of pds in the presence of 10 m methanol 0 0201 min 1 det nonradical oxidation and electrolysis with bdd anode 0 0578 min 1 det ho thus there must exists some reactive species that were not identified in electrochemical activation of pds process bu et al also investigated electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode and suggested the occurrence of nonradical oxidation based on the results of radical scavenging experiments 10 mm methanol or tert butanol bu et al 2017 however 10 mm methanol or tert butanol was unable to effectively quench the surface adsorbed reactive species which lead to generating the one sided conclusion in order to further discern the reactive species generated in electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode degradation of radical probe compounds was investigated 3 2 2 degradation of radical probes ba and atz ba and atz were selected as the radical probes to investigate the generated reactive species azenha et al 2003 khan et al 2014 manoj et al 2007a yang and hoffmann 2016 as shown in fig 3 electrolysis with bdd anode effectively degraded ba and atz due to the production of adsorbed ho addition of pds further enhanced the degradation ba and atz ba and atz were completely degraded within about 226 min and 67 min by electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode respectively in comparison with electrolysis the faster degradation of ba and atz in electrochemical activation of pds process indicates that more radicals were generated it has been reported that activation of pds may produce ho so4 ho2 o2 and 1o2 bu et al 2017 cheng et al 2017 duan et al 2016 luo et al 2015 however ho2 o2 and 1o2 have low reactivity with ba and atz therefore ho or so4 was most probably generated in electrochemical activation of pds process furthermore the effect of addition of radical scavengers on degradation of atz was also investigated to discern the role of ho and so4 fig s5 the apparent degradation rates derived from fig s5 were listed in table s3 as shown in fig s5 addition of 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol significantly inhibited the degradation of atz in electrolysis process the inhibitory effect of 10 m methanol on the degradation of atz was close to that of 5 m tert butanol verifying that only ho was generated in electrolysis process if both ho and so4 were produced in electrochemical activation of pds process the inhibitory effect of excess tert butanol will be lower than that of excess methanol to our surprise the inhibitory effect of 10 m methanol on degradation of atz was close to that of 5 m tert butanol in electrochemical activation of pds process respectively fig s5 table s3 additionally addition of 5 mm pds did not enhance the degradation of atz in the presence of 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol which suggests that nonradical oxidation has low reactivity with atz but high reactivity with cbz those results can be explained by that 1 only ho was produced 2 most of so4 was quickly transformed to ho however the quick transformation from so4 to ho was unlikely to happen in electrochemical activation of persulfates process the anodic chamber solution always keeps acidic condition due to the electrolysis of water which is unbeneficial to the transformation from so4 to ho guan et al 2011 in addition the reaction rate constant of so4 towards atz was about 2 6 109 m 1 s 1 khan et al 2014 manoj et al 2007b yang et al 2015 while the reaction rate constant of so4 with oh to generate ho was about 6 5 107 m 1 s 1 guan et al 2011 hayon et al 1972 if so4 was generated in electrochemical activation of pds process the contribution of so4 should be observed thus in addition to nonradical oxidation only ho was produced in electrochemical activation of pds process in addition the reactivity of ho with ba kho ba 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 is higher than that with atz kho atz 2 4 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 whereas the degradation rate of ba was significantly smaller than that of atz in bdd electrolysis process and electrochemical activation of pds process this was in accordance with the hydrophobicity of ba and atz the octanol water partition coefficient of atz 2 61 is larger than that of ba 1 87 nsl thus atz is easier to adsorb at electrode surface than ba thus to increase the opportunity of atz reacting with the surface adsorbed ho this result also verifies that the production of reactive species and degradation of organic compounds occur at electrode surface rather than in bulk solution 3 3 performance of electrochemical activation of pms at bdd anode in comparison with pds moreover the performance of electrochemical of pms at bdd anode for degradation of cbz was also evaluated as shown in fig s6 addition of pms significantly enhanced the degradation cbz compared with addition of pds the required time for complete degradation of cbz by electrochemical activation of pms about 13 min for cbz was far shorter than that by electrochemical activation of pds about 35 min for cbz under identical conditions the apparent degradation rates derived from fig s6 were shown in table s1 addition of pms produced higher degradation rate than that of addition of pds additionally the effect of addition of various concentration of radical scavengers fig s7 on cbz degradation was investigated in electrochemical activation of pms process similarly increasing the concentration of methanol or tert butanol generated greater inhibitory effect on cbz degradation 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol could effectively inhibit the degradation of cbz nonradical oxidation and ho oxidation were observed in electrochemical activation of pms process the degradation rate of cbz by electrochemical activation of pms in the presence of 10 m methanol 0 0292 min 1 or 5 m tert butanol 0 0235 min 1 was higher than that by electrochemical activation of pds in the presence of 10 m methanol 0 0201 min 1 or 5 m tert butanol 0 0174 min 1 fig s8 table s3 suggesting that addition of pms enhanced the nonradical oxidation simultaneously electrochemical activation of pms also enhanced the degradation of ba and atz with about double degradation rates relative to those of electrochemical activation of pds fig s9 table s1 demonstrating that more ho was generated in electrochemical activation of pms process 3 4 estimation of the relative contribution of involved reactive species and the concentration of ho the relative contribution of involved reactive species including det nonradical oxidation ho oxidation and persulfates oxidation alone was evaluated according to the kinetic data of cbz degradation as shown in table s4 and s5 nonradical oxidation just accounted for about 4 3 52 for pds and 3 90 for pms in electrochemical activation of persulfates process even less than the proportion of det 11 89 for pds and 4 31 for pms ho oxidation accounted for 82 21 and 90 67 in electrochemical activation of pds and pms process respectively thus ho oxidation rather than nonradical oxidation played the dominant role ho oxidation can be classified into two groups the first one is generated by bdd electrolysis alone ho electrolysis alone the other one is generated from the combination of bdd electrolysis and persulfates ho combination the proportion of ho combination 43 18 for pds and 51 64 for pms was always higher than that of ho electrolysis alone 39 03 furthermore the quasi steady state concentration of ho ho ss in electrolysis and electrochemical activation of persulfates processes was estimated according to the above kinetic data table s3 the degradation rates of organic compounds in the presence of 10 m methanol kmeoh were used to quantify the contribution of det oxidation and nonradical oxidation as well as persulfates oxidation alone the degradation of organic compounds can be expressed by reaction 5 5 where r represents the organic contaminants kho r represents the second order reaction rate constant of r with ho kr represents the apparent degradation rate of r rearranging and integrating result in 6 as shown in table 1 the concentration of ho in electrolysis process for degradation of ba and atz ranged from 5 03 10 12 m to 9 12 10 12 m the estimated values were close to each other which suggests the feasibility of the used method the concentration of ho in electrochemical activation of persulfates process was also estimated according to reactions 5 and 6 as shown in table 1 electrochemical activation of pds produced 1 06 1 60 10 11 m ho while electrochemical activation of pms produced 3 22 5 01 10 11 m ho the higher concentration of ho generated in electrochemical activation of pms process indicates that pms was easier to activate than pds the asymmetric structure of pms is beneficial to its activation to produce reactive species additionally the produced ho was mainly adsorbed at the electrode surface rather than dispersed in bulk solution the bound ho may reduce its recombination which is beneficial to increase the steady state concentration of ho 3 5 proposed mechanism based on above results the possible reaction mechanism was proposed as shown in scheme 1 several reactions contribute to the degradation of organic contaminants including i det reaction reaction 1 organic contaminants are directly oxidized at anode surface ii electrochemical activation of persulfates reaction 4 nonradical oxidation and ho oxidation are present in that process iii electrolysis of water electrolysis of water at bdd surface generates adsorbed ho reaction 3 iv electrolysis of sulfate addition of persulfates and the decomposition of persulfates inevitably introduce so4 2 electrochemical activation of so4 2 at bdd anode may contribute the degradation of organic contaminants 3 5 1 det reaction as shown in scheme 1 organic contaminants are directly oxidized at anode surface via direct electron transfer the degradation of organic contaminants by electrolysis with bdd anode in 10 m methanol solution can be attributed to det reaction in electrochemical activation of persulfates process addition of pds or pms produced minor enhancement on the det reaction the degradation rate of atz in electrochemical activation of persulfates process in the presence of excess methanol or tert butanol was higher than the sum of electrolysis in the presence of excess methanol or tert butanol and pds or pms alone in comparison with ho oxidation 82 21 for pds and 90 67 for pms the contribution of det reaction to organic contaminants degradation was always small 11 89 for pds and 4 31 for pms 3 5 2 electrochemical activation of persulfates bdd electrode is composed of boron doped carbon activation of pds or pms by carbon materials has been investigated by some researchers nonradical oxidation or radical oxidation was proposed for activation of persulfates by carbon materials cheng et al 2017 duan et al 2015b 2016 lee et al 2016 lee et al 2015 which suggests that the sp2 hybridized carbon c o is the main active site and sp3 hybridized carbon c h c h2 c oh is unable to activate persulfates the freshly prepared bdd electrode is terminated with hydrogen i e b c h c h and ch2 anodic polarization will oxidize those hydrogen functional groups to oxygen functional groups i e b c oh c oh and c o chaplin 2014 chaplin et al 2013 however activation of pds or pms by bdd electrode alone without applying current was not observed in this work thus the reactive species identified in this work originated from electrochemical reactions rather than heterogeneous activation of persulfates by carbon materials in electrochemical activation of persulfates process the anodic discharge may convert the adsorbed pds or pms molecule into a special transition state structure pds pms reaction 7 7 bdd pds pms bdd pds pms different from the stable pds or pms molecule pds pms is in an activated state that has high reaction activity pds pms can degrade organic contaminants which acts as the nonradical oxidation pathway reaction 8 8 r bdd pds pms products the similar transition state structure has been proposed in cuo pds system zhang et al 2014 cubi2o4 pds system oh et al 2015 nanocarbons pms system duan et al 2016 and ti pt anode pds system song et al 2017 in electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anode process only ho was generated from electrochemical activation of persulfates pds decomposition itself cannot generate ho thus ho can be only produced from water dissociation in nanocarbons pds system duan et al also suggested that ho originated from water dissociation duan et al 2015b additionally duan et al also stated that the activated pds molecule directly oxidized the adsorbed water to produce ho duan et al 2015b however this situation was unlikely to happen in electrochemical activation of persulfates process as shown in ti pt anode pds system the electrochemically activated pds pds molecule was also proposed as being responsible for nonradical oxidation song et al 2017 if the electrochemically activated pds pds could directly oxidize water to produce ho ho should be observed in ti pt anode pds system however only nonradical oxidation was observed in ti pt anode pds system song et al 2017 another reasonable explanation is that the electrochemically activated persulfates molecule pds pms enhances the production of ho via water dissociation at bdd anode because electrolysis with bdd anode itself can produce ho as explained in the next section 3 5 3 electrolysis of water water dissociation at bdd anode surface can produce adsorbed ho the results of radical scavenging experiments and degradation of radical probes have confirmed that ho oxidation was the main reaction pathway in electrolysis process and electrochemical activation of persulfates process the ho generated in electrolysis process and electrochemical activation of persulfates process all originates from water dissociation in comparison with electrolysis alone higher concentration of ho generated in electrochemical activation persulfates process indicates that the electrochemically activated persulfates molecule pds pms may enhance the production of ho via water dissociation at bdd anode in order to verify above assumption the cyclic voltammetry analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of addition of persulfates on water dissociation as shown in fig 4 a addition of pds or pms decreased the current response at the same potential inset of fig 4 simultaneously the significant anodic shift of the cv curve caused by addition of pms was observed the onset potential of water dissociation in different processes was shown in fig 4b addition of pds increased the onset potential from 1 94 v electrolysis with bdd anode to 1 98 v pds addition of pms produced higher onset potential from 1 94 v electrolysis with bdd anode to 2 09 v pms the decrease of current response and increase of onset potential suggest that addition of pds or pms inhibited the water dissociation in which addition of pms produced greater inhibitory effect than that of addition of pds this conclusion was further verified by chronoamperometry experiments as shown in fig s10 addition of pds or pms decreased the current response of chronoamperometry suggesting that water dissociation was inhibited after addition of pds or pms water dissociation at bdd anode surface can produce oxygen and ho both oxygen evolution side reaction and production of ho reaction contribute the current response of cv and chronoamperometry higher onset potential observed in electrochemical activation of persulfates process suggests that the overpotential for oxygen evolution was increased which was beneficial to generating ho yang and hoffmann 2016 electrochemical activation of persulfates may promote the production of ho and inhibit the oxygen evolution side reaction the inhibition of oxygen evolution side reaction exceeds the promotion of production of ho thus to decrease the current response this situation was indeed present in electrolysis process yang and hoffmann reported that the prepared blue black tio2 nanotube arrays bnta electrode produced far higher current response 10 folds than that of bdd electrode in cv experiments but the concentration of ho in two process was close to each other 6 6 10 14 m for bnta and 7 4 10 14 m for bdd yang and hoffmann 2016 if this is the case the evolution of dissolved oxygen do in electrochemical activation of persulfates process should be lower than that in electrolysis process therefore the do evolution was investigated in electrolysis process and electrochemical activation of persulfates process in order to facilitate the determination of do the temperature of water bath was adjusted to 4 c and the current density was changed to 10 a m 2 prior to electrolysis the electrolyte was aerated with pure nitrogen for 6 h to remove the do in the solution as shown in fig 5 the evolution of do in all processes followed pseudo first order kinetics the evolution rate of do was 0 50 mg l 1 min 1 0 43 mg l 1 min 1 and 0 32 mg l 1 min 1 for electrolysis with bdd anode electrochemical activation of pds and electrochemical activation of pms respectively as expected the oxygen evolution reaction was indeed inhibited in electrochemical activation of persulfates process which leads to the decrease of current response of cv and chronoamperometry in addition this result also explains the minor enhancement of det reaction section 3 4 as discussed above the inhibition of oxygen evolution side reaction exceeds the promotion of production of ho the redundant electrons were used to enhance the det reaction although the contribution of nonradical oxidation to cbz degradation was far smaller than that of ho nonradical oxidation still played the important role the electrochemically activated persulfates molecule pds pms acting as the intermediate reactive species in electrochemical activation of persulfates process inhibited the oxygen evolution side reaction and enhanced the generation of ho the quick transformation or decomposition of pds pms may be present in electrochemical activation of persulfates process to data the information about pds pms is still limited in situ characterization of pds pms can provide more information about nonradcial oxidation development of powerful characterization methods and instruments is in need 3 5 4 electrolysis of sulfate recent studies also reported the production of so4 by electrochemical activation of sulfate so4 2 at bdd anode farhat et al 2015 the decomposition of pds and pms will produce appreciable amount of so4 2 in addition the used pms salt khso5 0 5k2so4 0 5khso4 also contains so4 2 thus the effect of so4 2 addition on cbz degradation was investigated as shown in fig s11 addition of 5 mm so4 2 produced minor promotion effect on cbz degradation 0 0665 min 1 compared with that of electrolysis with bdd anode 0 0578 min 1 however the enhancement of addition of sulfate 0 0665 min 1 minus 0 0578 min 1 was obviously smaller than that of addition of pds 0 1135 min 1 minus 0 0578 min 1 and addition of pms 0 3129 min 1 minus 0 0578 min 1 under similar conditions that is the contribution of electrochemical activation of so4 2 at bdd anode was small in this study therefore the contribution of so4 was not observed in this study 3 6 estimation of the current efficiency the current efficiency of degradation of cbz was estimated according to the evolution of do reaction 9 9 current efficiency 1 4 fvd do idt 100 where f represents the faraday constant 96485 c mol 1 i represents current a v represents the electrolyte volume 60 ml d do dt represents the evolution rate of do the current efficiency of electrolysis with bdd anode was about 45 and it was increased to 53 and 66 for electrochemical activation of pds and electrochemical activation of pms respectively higher current efficiency implies the faster degradation of organic contaminants and lower energy consumption for electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anode which is beneficial to its practical application 3 7 transformation products of cbz in addition the transformation products of cbz were also investigated in electrolysis process and electrochemical activation of pds process by hplc qtof analytical method provided in text s3 the identified 16 transformation products with their proposed formulas accurate mass to charge ratio m z and ms ms fragments were provided in table s2 the chemical structures of the 16 transformation products and their transformation pathways were provided in scheme s2 in comparison with electrolysis three new products p283 p271 1 and p271 2 were generated in electrochemical activation of pds process p271 and p283 may be the specific byproducts of cbz oxidized by nonradical oxidation however p271 1 and p271 2 were also reported in fe activated persulfate process so4 rao et al 2014 and solar photolysis of free chlorine process ho yang et al 2016 p283 was also reported in so4 and ho based oxidation processes ahmed and chiron 2014 mcdowell et al 2005 thus compared with other so4 and ho based oxidation processes there was no new transformation products generated in electrochemical activation of persulfates process 4 conclusion this work investigated the performance involved reactive species and reaction mechanism of electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anode electrochemical activation of persulfates significantly enhanced the degradation of cbz in which electrochemical activation of pms produced higher degradation rate than that of pds the experimental results suggest that surface adsorbed ho was generated in electrochemical activation of persulfates process the electrochemically activated persulfates molecule enhanced the production of ho via water dissociation at bdd anode and inhibited the oxygen evolution side reaction resulting in generating higher concentration of ho 10 11 m than that of electrolysis with bdd anode about 10 12 m relatively the current efficiency was enhanced in electrochemical activation of persulfates process the enhanced effect on the degradation of organic pollutants and the increase of current efficiency suggest that electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anodes can serve as a facile and energy efficient advanced oxidation process for degradation of persistent organic contaminants in waters and wastewaters in addition it was demonstrated that the surface adsorbed ho rather than nonradical oxidation played the dominant role in electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anode thus electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anode may also suffer from the drawbacks of ho based advanced oxidation processes such as the inhibitory effect of natural organic matters noms

19887,the combination of persulfates peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms and electrolysis using boron doped diamond bdd anode is a promising green advanced oxidation process in comparison with electrolysis alone electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anode considerably enhanced the degradation of carbamazepine cbz the experimental results indicate that the surface adsorbed hydroxyl radical ho played the dominant role the generally proposed nonradical oxidation mechanism ignored hydroxyl radical ho oxidation because low concentration of radical scavenger 10 m methanol or 5 m tertbutanol could not effectively scavenge the surface adsorbed ho the quasi steady state concentration of ho was estimated to be about 5 0 9 1 10 12 m for electrolysis with bdd anode and it was increased to 1 1 1 6 10 11 m and 3 2 5 0 10 11 m for addition of 5 mm pds and pms respectively the results of cyclic voltammetry cv and chronoamperometry as well as evolution of dissolved oxygen do reveal that the electrochemically activated persulfates molecule pds pms promoted the production of ho via water dissociation at bdd anode and enhanced the direct electron transfer det reaction which otherwise inhibited the oxygen evolution side reaction therefore higher current efficiency was achieved in electrochemical activation of persulfates process compared with electrolysis process additionally the transformation products of cbz were also investigated and their formation pathways were proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords surface adsorbed ho nonradical oxidation electrochemical activation of persulfates bdd anode 1 introduction recently hydroxyl radical ho and sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted extensive attention for degradation of persistent organic contaminants in waters and wastewaters oh et al 2016 oturan and aaron 2014 activation of inorganic peroxides including hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and persulfates peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms by metal ions and photochemical radiation is the common method to produce ho or so4 han et al 2012 oturan and aaron 2014 yang et al 2010 development of efficient and environmentally friendly activation method is always in need electrochemical activation method is a promising green technology with electrons acting as the green reactant which has drawn increasing attention in recent years bu et al 2017 farhat et al 2015 sires et al 2014 boron doped diamond bdd electrodes are usually used for degradation of organic contaminants chaplin 2014 the substitute of carbon atoms by boron atoms in the diamond lattice enhances the conductivity of electrodes the commercially available bdd electrodes always consist of boron doped diamond thin film covered at p silicon bdd electrodes have extreme stability under anodic polarization and high overpotential for water dissociation chaplin 2014 perez et al 2012 the produced adsorbed ho from water dissociation can oxidize most persistent organic contaminants because of its high redox potential 2 7 v versus she perez et al 2012 polcaro et al 2009 the combination of electrolysis using bdd anode and pds has been developed in recent years the degradation of organic compounds was enhanced by addition of pds into electrolysis cell bu et al 2017 farhat et al 2015 nonradical oxidation mechanism was generally proposed for electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode bu et al suggested that pds reacted with ho at bdd anode surface to generate superoxide and singlet oxygen bu et al 2017 farhat et al stated that the nonradical oxidation generated from electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode was similar to that from activation of pds by carbon material farhat et al 2015 lee et al 2015 carbon element is the essential composition of bdd electrode boron doped diamond structure activation of pds with carbon materials including single walled carbon nanotube multi walled carbon nanotube reduced graphene oxide mesoporous carbon and graphitized nanodiamond has been reported by some researchers duan et al 2015a lee et al 2016 lee et al 2015 it was suggested that the interaction between pds and carbon surface functional groups played the important role for generation of nonradical oxidation however the interaction of bdd electrode surface with pds was always neglected investigation of the interaction of bdd electrode surface with pds is essential and meaningful in addition current studies did not clearly discern the role of nonradical oxidation and radical oxidation electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode is a complicated process in which adsorption electrolysis activation of pds oxidation of pollutants desorption and other processes are all present in the electrochemical reactor the involved electrochemical reactions include direct electron transfer det reaction 1 electrolysis with bdd anode to produce oxygen reaction 2 or ho reaction 3

reactions always happen at electrode surface rather than in bulk solution for example the produced ho is mainly adsorbed at electrode surface rather than dispersed in bulk solution chaplin 2014 the investigation methods e g radical scavenging used in homogeneous phase solution may be unsuitable for electrochemical process the above doubts about electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode need to be solved urgently the objectives of this study are i to evaluate the performance of electrochemical activation of pds using carbamazepine cbz as the model persistent organic compound ii to discern the reactive species generated in electrochemical activation of pds process by radical scavenging methanol and tert butanol and degradation of radical probes benzoic acid ba and atrazine atz iii to comparatively study the performance of electrochemical activation of pms with that of pds iv to estimate the relative contribution of involved reactive species according to kinetic data v to understand the mechanism of electrochemical activation of persulfates via electrochemical characterization 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents sodium peroxydisulfate pds potassium monopersulfate triple salt pms carbamazepine cbz benzoic acid ba atrazine atz and tert butanol were purchased from sigma aldrich methanol of hplc grade was purchased from tedia and ficher other chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china all solutions were prepared using ultrapure water produced from a milli q purification system the stock solution of pds and pms was prepared every week and placed in 4 c fridge 2 2 experimental setup the electrolysis setup was similar to a previously used device song et al 2017 as shown in scheme s1 a plate and frame electrolysis cell made of polymethyl methacrylate was used in electrolysis process the electrolysis cell was divided by a cation exchange membrane cem into two chambers with 90 ml net volume respectively the electrolysis cell was fixed by bolt made of titanium which can avoid the metal ions pollution plate bdd electrodes 3 μm coating thickness with 700 ppm boron doping covered at p silicon active dimensions of 40 mm 25 mm 3 mm purchased from neocoat switzerland were used as the working electrode stainless steel mesh active dimensions of 40 mm 25 mm was used as the counter electrode a solution containing 50 mm sodium perchlorate naclo4 was used as the electrolyte a dc power itech 6300 taiwan was used to supply a constant current output in electrolysis process a magnetic stirring apparatus was used to mix the anodic solution thoroughly all kinetic experiments were performed in batch mode in a water bath 25 c solution ph was not buffered to avoid the possible interference of buffer e g phosphate working electrode and counter electrode were placed into anodic chamber and cathodic chamber face to face with the distance of 4 cm respectively after organic contaminants and persulfates were added into the anodic chamber and thoroughly mixed by a magnetic stirrer electrochemical reactions were initiated by applying individual current at given time intervals samples were collected from anodic chamber into lc vials containing 100 μl methanol and excess ascorbic acid all experiments were performed at least twice and the average data with their standard deviations was shown 2 3 analytical methods a high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 2695 equipped with a photodiode array detector pda waters 2998 was used to analyze organic contaminants a symmetry c18 column 4 6 150 mm 5 μm particle size waters was used for separation the mobile phase consisted of methanol and water containing 0 1 acetic acid with the flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the concentration of pds was measured by a modified iodometric method liang et al 2008 the concentration of dissolved oxygen do was measured with a do meter ldo101 hach 2 4 electrochemical characterization cyclic voltammetry cv and chronoamperometry were conducted with an electrochemical station metrohm parstat302a switzerland a typical three electrode system was used in electrochemical characterization process ag agcl electrode 0 220 v versus she aida technology china coupled with a luggin haber capillary was used as the reference electrode 1 m naclo4 solution was used as the electrolyte cv was performed from 1 0 v to 2 5 v versus ag agcl at a scan rate of 5 mv s 1 chronoamperometry was conducted at a constant potential of 2 0 v versus ag agcl after a stable current for water oxidation was achieved 1 mm pds or pms was slowly added into the electrolyte detailed method provided in text s1 and the time dependent current response was monitored 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation kinetics of cbz the degradation kinetics of cbz was investigated by individual pds and electrolysis with bdd anode as well as their combination as shown in fig 1 the degradation of cbz by pds alone was negligible electrolysis with bdd anode effectively degraded cbz due to the production of adsorbed ho via electrolysis of h2o reaction 3 chaplin 2014 as expected addition of 5 mm pds further enhanced the degradation of cbz compared with electrolysis alone cbz was completely degraded cbz t cbz 0 10 4 within about 35 min detailed calculation method provided in text s2 by the combination of pds and electrolysis using bdd anode the apparent pseudo fist order degradation rates of cbz derived from fig 1 were listed in table s1 as shown in table s1 addition of pds increased the degradation rate of cbz about 2 times relative to that of electrolysis alone the synergistic effect suggests that electrochemical activation of pds was achieved at bdd anode in parallel the decomposition of pds was examined in electrochemical activation of pds process as shown in fig s1 the decomposition of pds was accelerated when individual current passed through bdd electrode 3 2 identification of the involved reactive species 3 2 1 effect of addition of radical scavengers methanol was selected to scavenge both ho and so4 while tert butanol was used to scavenge ho the impact of various concentration of radical scavengers on the degradation of cbz was investigated as shown in fig s2 addition of 0 01 m methanol produced minor inhibitory effect on cbz degradation in electrolysis process further increasing the concentration of methanol produced greater inhibitory effect the degradation of cbz in the presence of 10 m methanol was close to that of pure methanol containing 4 water similarly addition of low concentration of tert butanol had minor inhibitory effect on cbz degradation increasing the concentration of tert butanol generated greater inhibitory effect on cbz degradation as high as 5 m tert butanol could effectively inhibit the degradation of cbz in electrolysis process the effect of addition of various concentration of methanol or tert butanol on cbz degradation in electrochemical activation of pds process was also investigated fig s4 similarly low concentration of methanol or tert butanol 0 1 m had minor inhibitory effect on cbz degradation 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol could effectively inhibit the degradation of cbz in electrochemical activation of pds process the above results indicate that low concentration of radical scavengers 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol could not effectively quench the radicals generated in electrochemical process both methanol and tert butanol are hydrophilic radical scavenger which can effectively quench the radicals in homogeneous solution in electrochemical process the produced reactive species are mostly adsorbed at electrode surface barazesh et al 2016 the hydrophobic organic contaminant e g cbz is easier to adsorb at electrode surface than hydrophilic methanol and tert butanol therefore the inhibitory effect of low concentration of methanol or tert butanol on cbz degradation was minor in electrochemical process the similar phenomenon was also observed by other researchers barazesh et al 2016 solomon and madix 1987 zhu et al 2017 for instance barazesh et al also suggested that saturated alcohol i e methanol and tert butanol was unable to effectively scavenge the surface adsorbed radicals at bdd anode surface barazesh et al 2016 based on the above discussion we can deduce that scavenging the surface adsorbed radicals generated in electrochemical process needs far higher concentration of radical scavenger than that in homogeneous reaction process in the following experiments the concentration of methanol and tert butanol was set as 10 m for methanol and 5 m for tert butanol respectively interestingly the combination of pds and electrolysis still generated synergistic effect on cbz degradation although 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol was present in anodic chamber fig 2 the degradation rate of cbz by electrochemical activation of pds in the presence of 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol was higher than that by electrolysis in the presence of 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol the synergistic effect was attributed to nonradical oxidation which is in accordance with previous studies bu et al 2017 farhat et al 2015 however the degradation rate of cbz in electrochemical activation of pds process 0 1135 min 1 was far higher than the sum of electrochemical activation of pds in the presence of 10 m methanol 0 0201 min 1 det nonradical oxidation and electrolysis with bdd anode 0 0578 min 1 det ho thus there must exists some reactive species that were not identified in electrochemical activation of pds process bu et al also investigated electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode and suggested the occurrence of nonradical oxidation based on the results of radical scavenging experiments 10 mm methanol or tert butanol bu et al 2017 however 10 mm methanol or tert butanol was unable to effectively quench the surface adsorbed reactive species which lead to generating the one sided conclusion in order to further discern the reactive species generated in electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode degradation of radical probe compounds was investigated 3 2 2 degradation of radical probes ba and atz ba and atz were selected as the radical probes to investigate the generated reactive species azenha et al 2003 khan et al 2014 manoj et al 2007a yang and hoffmann 2016 as shown in fig 3 electrolysis with bdd anode effectively degraded ba and atz due to the production of adsorbed ho addition of pds further enhanced the degradation ba and atz ba and atz were completely degraded within about 226 min and 67 min by electrochemical activation of pds at bdd anode respectively in comparison with electrolysis the faster degradation of ba and atz in electrochemical activation of pds process indicates that more radicals were generated it has been reported that activation of pds may produce ho so4 ho2 o2 and 1o2 bu et al 2017 cheng et al 2017 duan et al 2016 luo et al 2015 however ho2 o2 and 1o2 have low reactivity with ba and atz therefore ho or so4 was most probably generated in electrochemical activation of pds process furthermore the effect of addition of radical scavengers on degradation of atz was also investigated to discern the role of ho and so4 fig s5 the apparent degradation rates derived from fig s5 were listed in table s3 as shown in fig s5 addition of 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol significantly inhibited the degradation of atz in electrolysis process the inhibitory effect of 10 m methanol on the degradation of atz was close to that of 5 m tert butanol verifying that only ho was generated in electrolysis process if both ho and so4 were produced in electrochemical activation of pds process the inhibitory effect of excess tert butanol will be lower than that of excess methanol to our surprise the inhibitory effect of 10 m methanol on degradation of atz was close to that of 5 m tert butanol in electrochemical activation of pds process respectively fig s5 table s3 additionally addition of 5 mm pds did not enhance the degradation of atz in the presence of 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol which suggests that nonradical oxidation has low reactivity with atz but high reactivity with cbz those results can be explained by that 1 only ho was produced 2 most of so4 was quickly transformed to ho however the quick transformation from so4 to ho was unlikely to happen in electrochemical activation of persulfates process the anodic chamber solution always keeps acidic condition due to the electrolysis of water which is unbeneficial to the transformation from so4 to ho guan et al 2011 in addition the reaction rate constant of so4 towards atz was about 2 6 109 m 1 s 1 khan et al 2014 manoj et al 2007b yang et al 2015 while the reaction rate constant of so4 with oh to generate ho was about 6 5 107 m 1 s 1 guan et al 2011 hayon et al 1972 if so4 was generated in electrochemical activation of pds process the contribution of so4 should be observed thus in addition to nonradical oxidation only ho was produced in electrochemical activation of pds process in addition the reactivity of ho with ba kho ba 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 is higher than that with atz kho atz 2 4 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 whereas the degradation rate of ba was significantly smaller than that of atz in bdd electrolysis process and electrochemical activation of pds process this was in accordance with the hydrophobicity of ba and atz the octanol water partition coefficient of atz 2 61 is larger than that of ba 1 87 nsl thus atz is easier to adsorb at electrode surface than ba thus to increase the opportunity of atz reacting with the surface adsorbed ho this result also verifies that the production of reactive species and degradation of organic compounds occur at electrode surface rather than in bulk solution 3 3 performance of electrochemical activation of pms at bdd anode in comparison with pds moreover the performance of electrochemical of pms at bdd anode for degradation of cbz was also evaluated as shown in fig s6 addition of pms significantly enhanced the degradation cbz compared with addition of pds the required time for complete degradation of cbz by electrochemical activation of pms about 13 min for cbz was far shorter than that by electrochemical activation of pds about 35 min for cbz under identical conditions the apparent degradation rates derived from fig s6 were shown in table s1 addition of pms produced higher degradation rate than that of addition of pds additionally the effect of addition of various concentration of radical scavengers fig s7 on cbz degradation was investigated in electrochemical activation of pms process similarly increasing the concentration of methanol or tert butanol generated greater inhibitory effect on cbz degradation 10 m methanol or 5 m tert butanol could effectively inhibit the degradation of cbz nonradical oxidation and ho oxidation were observed in electrochemical activation of pms process the degradation rate of cbz by electrochemical activation of pms in the presence of 10 m methanol 0 0292 min 1 or 5 m tert butanol 0 0235 min 1 was higher than that by electrochemical activation of pds in the presence of 10 m methanol 0 0201 min 1 or 5 m tert butanol 0 0174 min 1 fig s8 table s3 suggesting that addition of pms enhanced the nonradical oxidation simultaneously electrochemical activation of pms also enhanced the degradation of ba and atz with about double degradation rates relative to those of electrochemical activation of pds fig s9 table s1 demonstrating that more ho was generated in electrochemical activation of pms process 3 4 estimation of the relative contribution of involved reactive species and the concentration of ho the relative contribution of involved reactive species including det nonradical oxidation ho oxidation and persulfates oxidation alone was evaluated according to the kinetic data of cbz degradation as shown in table s4 and s5 nonradical oxidation just accounted for about 4 3 52 for pds and 3 90 for pms in electrochemical activation of persulfates process even less than the proportion of det 11 89 for pds and 4 31 for pms ho oxidation accounted for 82 21 and 90 67 in electrochemical activation of pds and pms process respectively thus ho oxidation rather than nonradical oxidation played the dominant role ho oxidation can be classified into two groups the first one is generated by bdd electrolysis alone ho electrolysis alone the other one is generated from the combination of bdd electrolysis and persulfates ho combination the proportion of ho combination 43 18 for pds and 51 64 for pms was always higher than that of ho electrolysis alone 39 03 furthermore the quasi steady state concentration of ho ho ss in electrolysis and electrochemical activation of persulfates processes was estimated according to the above kinetic data table s3 the degradation rates of organic compounds in the presence of 10 m methanol kmeoh were used to quantify the contribution of det oxidation and nonradical oxidation as well as persulfates oxidation alone the degradation of organic compounds can be expressed by reaction 5 5 where r represents the organic contaminants kho r represents the second order reaction rate constant of r with ho kr represents the apparent degradation rate of r rearranging and integrating result in 6 as shown in table 1 the concentration of ho in electrolysis process for degradation of ba and atz ranged from 5 03 10 12 m to 9 12 10 12 m the estimated values were close to each other which suggests the feasibility of the used method the concentration of ho in electrochemical activation of persulfates process was also estimated according to reactions 5 and 6 as shown in table 1 electrochemical activation of pds produced 1 06 1 60 10 11 m ho while electrochemical activation of pms produced 3 22 5 01 10 11 m ho the higher concentration of ho generated in electrochemical activation of pms process indicates that pms was easier to activate than pds the asymmetric structure of pms is beneficial to its activation to produce reactive species additionally the produced ho was mainly adsorbed at the electrode surface rather than dispersed in bulk solution the bound ho may reduce its recombination which is beneficial to increase the steady state concentration of ho 3 5 proposed mechanism based on above results the possible reaction mechanism was proposed as shown in scheme 1 several reactions contribute to the degradation of organic contaminants including i det reaction reaction 1 organic contaminants are directly oxidized at anode surface ii electrochemical activation of persulfates reaction 4 nonradical oxidation and ho oxidation are present in that process iii electrolysis of water electrolysis of water at bdd surface generates adsorbed ho reaction 3 iv electrolysis of sulfate addition of persulfates and the decomposition of persulfates inevitably introduce so4 2 electrochemical activation of so4 2 at bdd anode may contribute the degradation of organic contaminants 3 5 1 det reaction as shown in scheme 1 organic contaminants are directly oxidized at anode surface via direct electron transfer the degradation of organic contaminants by electrolysis with bdd anode in 10 m methanol solution can be attributed to det reaction in electrochemical activation of persulfates process addition of pds or pms produced minor enhancement on the det reaction the degradation rate of atz in electrochemical activation of persulfates process in the presence of excess methanol or tert butanol was higher than the sum of electrolysis in the presence of excess methanol or tert butanol and pds or pms alone in comparison with ho oxidation 82 21 for pds and 90 67 for pms the contribution of det reaction to organic contaminants degradation was always small 11 89 for pds and 4 31 for pms 3 5 2 electrochemical activation of persulfates bdd electrode is composed of boron doped carbon activation of pds or pms by carbon materials has been investigated by some researchers nonradical oxidation or radical oxidation was proposed for activation of persulfates by carbon materials cheng et al 2017 duan et al 2015b 2016 lee et al 2016 lee et al 2015 which suggests that the sp2 hybridized carbon c o is the main active site and sp3 hybridized carbon c h c h2 c oh is unable to activate persulfates the freshly prepared bdd electrode is terminated with hydrogen i e b c h c h and ch2 anodic polarization will oxidize those hydrogen functional groups to oxygen functional groups i e b c oh c oh and c o chaplin 2014 chaplin et al 2013 however activation of pds or pms by bdd electrode alone without applying current was not observed in this work thus the reactive species identified in this work originated from electrochemical reactions rather than heterogeneous activation of persulfates by carbon materials in electrochemical activation of persulfates process the anodic discharge may convert the adsorbed pds or pms molecule into a special transition state structure pds pms reaction 7 7 bdd pds pms bdd pds pms different from the stable pds or pms molecule pds pms is in an activated state that has high reaction activity pds pms can degrade organic contaminants which acts as the nonradical oxidation pathway reaction 8 8 r bdd pds pms products the similar transition state structure has been proposed in cuo pds system zhang et al 2014 cubi2o4 pds system oh et al 2015 nanocarbons pms system duan et al 2016 and ti pt anode pds system song et al 2017 in electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anode process only ho was generated from electrochemical activation of persulfates pds decomposition itself cannot generate ho thus ho can be only produced from water dissociation in nanocarbons pds system duan et al also suggested that ho originated from water dissociation duan et al 2015b additionally duan et al also stated that the activated pds molecule directly oxidized the adsorbed water to produce ho duan et al 2015b however this situation was unlikely to happen in electrochemical activation of persulfates process as shown in ti pt anode pds system the electrochemically activated pds pds molecule was also proposed as being responsible for nonradical oxidation song et al 2017 if the electrochemically activated pds pds could directly oxidize water to produce ho ho should be observed in ti pt anode pds system however only nonradical oxidation was observed in ti pt anode pds system song et al 2017 another reasonable explanation is that the electrochemically activated persulfates molecule pds pms enhances the production of ho via water dissociation at bdd anode because electrolysis with bdd anode itself can produce ho as explained in the next section 3 5 3 electrolysis of water water dissociation at bdd anode surface can produce adsorbed ho the results of radical scavenging experiments and degradation of radical probes have confirmed that ho oxidation was the main reaction pathway in electrolysis process and electrochemical activation of persulfates process the ho generated in electrolysis process and electrochemical activation of persulfates process all originates from water dissociation in comparison with electrolysis alone higher concentration of ho generated in electrochemical activation persulfates process indicates that the electrochemically activated persulfates molecule pds pms may enhance the production of ho via water dissociation at bdd anode in order to verify above assumption the cyclic voltammetry analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of addition of persulfates on water dissociation as shown in fig 4 a addition of pds or pms decreased the current response at the same potential inset of fig 4 simultaneously the significant anodic shift of the cv curve caused by addition of pms was observed the onset potential of water dissociation in different processes was shown in fig 4b addition of pds increased the onset potential from 1 94 v electrolysis with bdd anode to 1 98 v pds addition of pms produced higher onset potential from 1 94 v electrolysis with bdd anode to 2 09 v pms the decrease of current response and increase of onset potential suggest that addition of pds or pms inhibited the water dissociation in which addition of pms produced greater inhibitory effect than that of addition of pds this conclusion was further verified by chronoamperometry experiments as shown in fig s10 addition of pds or pms decreased the current response of chronoamperometry suggesting that water dissociation was inhibited after addition of pds or pms water dissociation at bdd anode surface can produce oxygen and ho both oxygen evolution side reaction and production of ho reaction contribute the current response of cv and chronoamperometry higher onset potential observed in electrochemical activation of persulfates process suggests that the overpotential for oxygen evolution was increased which was beneficial to generating ho yang and hoffmann 2016 electrochemical activation of persulfates may promote the production of ho and inhibit the oxygen evolution side reaction the inhibition of oxygen evolution side reaction exceeds the promotion of production of ho thus to decrease the current response this situation was indeed present in electrolysis process yang and hoffmann reported that the prepared blue black tio2 nanotube arrays bnta electrode produced far higher current response 10 folds than that of bdd electrode in cv experiments but the concentration of ho in two process was close to each other 6 6 10 14 m for bnta and 7 4 10 14 m for bdd yang and hoffmann 2016 if this is the case the evolution of dissolved oxygen do in electrochemical activation of persulfates process should be lower than that in electrolysis process therefore the do evolution was investigated in electrolysis process and electrochemical activation of persulfates process in order to facilitate the determination of do the temperature of water bath was adjusted to 4 c and the current density was changed to 10 a m 2 prior to electrolysis the electrolyte was aerated with pure nitrogen for 6 h to remove the do in the solution as shown in fig 5 the evolution of do in all processes followed pseudo first order kinetics the evolution rate of do was 0 50 mg l 1 min 1 0 43 mg l 1 min 1 and 0 32 mg l 1 min 1 for electrolysis with bdd anode electrochemical activation of pds and electrochemical activation of pms respectively as expected the oxygen evolution reaction was indeed inhibited in electrochemical activation of persulfates process which leads to the decrease of current response of cv and chronoamperometry in addition this result also explains the minor enhancement of det reaction section 3 4 as discussed above the inhibition of oxygen evolution side reaction exceeds the promotion of production of ho the redundant electrons were used to enhance the det reaction although the contribution of nonradical oxidation to cbz degradation was far smaller than that of ho nonradical oxidation still played the important role the electrochemically activated persulfates molecule pds pms acting as the intermediate reactive species in electrochemical activation of persulfates process inhibited the oxygen evolution side reaction and enhanced the generation of ho the quick transformation or decomposition of pds pms may be present in electrochemical activation of persulfates process to data the information about pds pms is still limited in situ characterization of pds pms can provide more information about nonradcial oxidation development of powerful characterization methods and instruments is in need 3 5 4 electrolysis of sulfate recent studies also reported the production of so4 by electrochemical activation of sulfate so4 2 at bdd anode farhat et al 2015 the decomposition of pds and pms will produce appreciable amount of so4 2 in addition the used pms salt khso5 0 5k2so4 0 5khso4 also contains so4 2 thus the effect of so4 2 addition on cbz degradation was investigated as shown in fig s11 addition of 5 mm so4 2 produced minor promotion effect on cbz degradation 0 0665 min 1 compared with that of electrolysis with bdd anode 0 0578 min 1 however the enhancement of addition of sulfate 0 0665 min 1 minus 0 0578 min 1 was obviously smaller than that of addition of pds 0 1135 min 1 minus 0 0578 min 1 and addition of pms 0 3129 min 1 minus 0 0578 min 1 under similar conditions that is the contribution of electrochemical activation of so4 2 at bdd anode was small in this study therefore the contribution of so4 was not observed in this study 3 6 estimation of the current efficiency the current efficiency of degradation of cbz was estimated according to the evolution of do reaction 9 9 current efficiency 1 4 fvd do idt 100 where f represents the faraday constant 96485 c mol 1 i represents current a v represents the electrolyte volume 60 ml d do dt represents the evolution rate of do the current efficiency of electrolysis with bdd anode was about 45 and it was increased to 53 and 66 for electrochemical activation of pds and electrochemical activation of pms respectively higher current efficiency implies the faster degradation of organic contaminants and lower energy consumption for electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anode which is beneficial to its practical application 3 7 transformation products of cbz in addition the transformation products of cbz were also investigated in electrolysis process and electrochemical activation of pds process by hplc qtof analytical method provided in text s3 the identified 16 transformation products with their proposed formulas accurate mass to charge ratio m z and ms ms fragments were provided in table s2 the chemical structures of the 16 transformation products and their transformation pathways were provided in scheme s2 in comparison with electrolysis three new products p283 p271 1 and p271 2 were generated in electrochemical activation of pds process p271 and p283 may be the specific byproducts of cbz oxidized by nonradical oxidation however p271 1 and p271 2 were also reported in fe activated persulfate process so4 rao et al 2014 and solar photolysis of free chlorine process ho yang et al 2016 p283 was also reported in so4 and ho based oxidation processes ahmed and chiron 2014 mcdowell et al 2005 thus compared with other so4 and ho based oxidation processes there was no new transformation products generated in electrochemical activation of persulfates process 4 conclusion this work investigated the performance involved reactive species and reaction mechanism of electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anode electrochemical activation of persulfates significantly enhanced the degradation of cbz in which electrochemical activation of pms produced higher degradation rate than that of pds the experimental results suggest that surface adsorbed ho was generated in electrochemical activation of persulfates process the electrochemically activated persulfates molecule enhanced the production of ho via water dissociation at bdd anode and inhibited the oxygen evolution side reaction resulting in generating higher concentration of ho 10 11 m than that of electrolysis with bdd anode about 10 12 m relatively the current efficiency was enhanced in electrochemical activation of persulfates process the enhanced effect on the degradation of organic pollutants and the increase of current efficiency suggest that electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anodes can serve as a facile and energy efficient advanced oxidation process for degradation of persistent organic contaminants in waters and wastewaters in addition it was demonstrated that the surface adsorbed ho rather than nonradical oxidation played the dominant role in electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anode thus electrochemical activation of persulfates at bdd anode may also suffer from the drawbacks of ho based advanced oxidation processes such as the inhibitory effect of natural organic matters noms

19888,the ability of anammox bacteria to utilize organic matter has drawn extensive attention however the metabolic discrepancies between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia need to be further explored here microbial transcript and metabolomic analysis were conducted for the samples harvested in the reactors and batch assays to investigate the phenotype discrepancies and intrinsic causes in autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia results showed that metabolically active community structures did not show significant difference between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia c n 0 3 changes in the metabolic state were the main cause for those discrepancies in virtue of the added acetate oxidized via the acetyl coa pathway by mixotrophic anammox bacteria at c n ratio of 0 3 anammox activity was obviously promoted compared to that in the autotrophic condition due to higher levels of nadh and nad as well as atp consumption mixotrophic anammox consortia were found to yield more biomass resulting from enhanced purine pyrimidine and putrescine synthetic pathways for regulating bacterial growth up regulated amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways participating in regulating more extracellular polysaccharides secreted by mixotrophic anammox consortia in adverse environment with higher cod concentration more extracellular proteins were produced by anammox consortia to protect themselves and amino acids also accumulated in the cell this study provides useful information to catch the optimal metabolism way of anammox consortia and accelerate anammox bacterial cultivation or reactor startup for wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox autotrophic mixotrophic cod tn ratio metabolic discrepancies 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox a novel wastewater treatment process has been regarded as a promising efficient and cost effective alternative to the conventional nitrification denitrification process van de graaf et al 1996 kartal et al 2010 anammox bacteria were once assumed to be completely chemoautotrophic oxidizing ammonium directly into nitrogen gas with nitrite serving as the terminal electron acceptor strous et al 1998 however previous studies have shown that a multi pathway metabolism exists güven et al 2005 discovered that anammox bacteria could use acetate and propionate as substrates anammox species candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus and candidatus brocadia fulgida henceforth referred to as b fulgida could outcompete other anammox bacteria in the presence of propionate and acetate respectively kartal et al 2007b 2008 the mixotrophic characteristic of anammox makes it possible to treat wastewater containing organics thus it is significant to analyze the discrepancies of anammox consortia behavior under autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions in the presence of organics phenotypic changes appear in anammox consortia first the activity of anammox bacteria is susceptible to be affected by the addition of organics leal et al 2016 the most suitable value of the c n ratio was different as reported due to the discrepancies in reactor nitrogen loading anammox species organic matter and others jenni et al 2014 once anammox activity was suppressed by high c n the red biomass was found to become brownish ni et al 2012 and heterotrophic microorganisms were promoted in the consortia tang et al 2010 it was also discovered that with appropriate cod addition the granulation of anammox consortia was enhanced further microbial succession between different anammox species was discovered with certain toc stresses li et al 2015 shu et al 2016 although these phenotypic discrepancies have been recently discovered the detailed mechanisms remain elusive organic compounds could be utilized by anammox bacteria via the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra pathway in which organic matter donates electrons to reduce nitrate and nitrite kartal et al 2007a the key gene nrfa encoding nitrate or nitrite reductase involved in this pathway was detected in anammox bacteria park et al 2017 indicating the potential capability of dnra in anammox bacteria furthermore the genes encoding amp dependent acetyl coa synthetase and adp dependent acetate coa ligase were also found in b fulgida kuenenia and ksu 1 indicating their ability to oxidize acetate gori et al 2011 thus it is possible that organic matter is oxidized via the acetyl coa pathway in anammox bacteria however the genome based evidence is still not adequate to clarify how discrepant phenotypes such as aggregation and ammonium nitrogen removal capacity between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia downstream of genes transcripts proteins and metabolites are able to provide direct information on cellular metabolism status tautenhahn et al 2012 metabolomics has emerged as a new focus and has been applied in research on bacteria fungi plants animals organ tissues and others nicholson and lindon 2008 tang et al 2016 among the experimental strategies of metabolomics untargeted metabolomics is able to acquire data from a diverse range of metabolites without providing specific chemical identification and structural information on the detected metabolites dunn et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that metabolomics was applied in a metabolism study of autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia which can be a significant complement to genome studies on anammox bacteria the purposes of this study were 1 to investigate the performance discrepancies between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox reactors 2 to evaluate the effects of different c n ratios on the anammox consortia and 3 to explore the discrepancy mechanism via metabolomics analysis and microbial community structure and transcript the exploration of metabolic discrepancies between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia could greatly help understanding the characteristics of anammox consortia metabolism and it is expected that the results presented may provide a basis for engineering applications of anammox technology 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor operation the study was carried out using two 5 l membrane bioreactors mbrs operated for two months including an autotrophic reactor ar and a mixotrophic reactor mr anammox consortia was taken from membrane bioreactor operated in our laboratory hou et al 2017 and inoculated into the two reactors with the same initial biomass of 0 023 g volatile suspended solids vss l both the ar and mr were fed with a synthetic medium solution van de graaf et al 1996 the medium solution of the mr also had sodium acetate added as an organic carbon source under a constant optimal c n ratio of 0 3 according to the batch assays during the whole operation the hydraulic residence time hrt of the two reactors was maintained at 36 h the temperature was set at 37 1 c by a water bath and ph was kept in the range of 7 5 8 3 and a strictly anaerobic condition was maintained samples of influent and effluent were collected every two days to determine the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n according to standard methods apha 1995 every week before determining eps contents three consortia samples were collected from the reactors and then mixed together dna samples

the end of batch assays for eps determination 16s rrna transcript sequencing and metabolomic analysis each test for same c n ratio was conducted in triplicate 2 3 eps extraction and chemical analysis first the anammox consortia sample was collected and homogenized with a glass homogenizer zhu et al 2015 then eps was extracted using a modified heat extract method li and yang 2007 proteins pns and polysaccharides pss were quantified by the bicinchoninic acid bca assay osnes et al 1993 and anthrone method loewus 1952 respectively dna concentrations of eps were measured with a nanodrop one spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa all measurements were conducted in triplicate 2 4 microbial community analysis the microbial community analysis was performed by 16s rdna and

by pcr using primers 515f 907r for bacteria and amx368f amx820r specific for anammox bacteria a ribopure rna purification kit ambion life technologies lithuania was applied to extract total rna of anammox consortia in batch assays after removing dna the extracted rna was subjected to synthesize complimentary dna cdna tiangen beijing china with bacterial 16s rrna transcripts then the primers

qrt pcr procedure and primers used were shown in text s1 and table s1 2 5 lc ms based metabolomic profiling and quantitation analysis metabolic products we extracted came from the whole consortia including the intracellular and extracellular the methods used to extract metabolic products have been described previously walker et al 2014 tang et al 2016 guo et al 2017 first 10 ml consortia suspension was centrifuged at 4 c 6000 g 3 min the pellet was then washed by pbs for three times and quenched in liquid nitrogen immediately then resuspended the pellet in 1 5 ml ultrapure water 4 c and sonicated it by a sonicator 3 s intervals between 3 s pulses 195 w 30 min subsequently added 6 ml methanol previously cooled at 80 c into the samples and stored them at 80 c for 2 h to precipitate the proteins then collected the supernatants after centrifugation 20 min 10 000 g and evaporated them under a gentle steam of nitrogen gas until dry the residues were collected for metabolite determination all tests were conducted in triplicate untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed by q exactive orbitrap thermo ca first loaded 1 μl supernatant on a normal phase chromatography column and eluted the sample to an orbitrap mass spectrometer with 50 acn containing 10 mm ammonium formate as the eluent the data in the mass range 70 1050 m z were acquired by data dependent ms ms acquisition the full scan and fragment spectra were collected at a resolution of 70 000 and 17 500 respectively the source parameters were as follows spray voltage 3000 v capillary temperature 320 c heater temperature 300 c sheath gas flow rate 35 and auxiliary gas flow rate 10 metabolite identification was based on a tracefinder search with a home built database containing 740 compounds in data analysis means and standard were calculated by microsoft excel 2013 pathway analysis was finished by metaboanalyst www metaboanalyst ca principal component analysis pca plot and heatmap were generated by r studio analysis of variance anova was conducted by software spss 20 0 to examine the differences between various samples and differences with an adjusted p 0 05 were considered to be statistically significant 3 results 3 1 reactor operation performance two reactors an ar and a mr were successfully operated for two months as shown in fig 1 a b the whole operational process could be divided into three phases based on the nitrogen removal performance the lag phase i day 0 10 the mixotrophy predominant period ii day 11 35 and the autotrophy predominant period iii day 36 60 in phase i the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n in the influent of two reactors were maintained at 100 mg l and the nitrogen removal efficiency nre fluctuated around 50 fig 1 c in phase ii the performance of the mr notably improved with the highest nitrogen removal rate nrr and ammonia nitrogen removal rate arr reached 122 43 mg n l d and 77 55 mg n l d respectively apparently higher than ar 99 71 mg n l d and 61 84 mg n l d at the same time in phase iii along with improvement in the nitrogen load the dosage of acetate increased under the constant c n ratio fig 1 d anammox activity was suppressed under the high concentration of organic matter thus resulting in high cod concentration in the effluent of the mr on the 60th day the nrr and arr of the mr decreased to 91 13 mg n l d and 46 88 mg n l d respectively while they increased to 146 63 mg n l d and 90 62 mg n l d in the ar stoichiometric ratio analysis showed that the no2 n nh4 n ratios in ar and mr were not significantly different however the average values of the no3 n nh4 n ratios in ar and mr were 0 43 0 08 and 0 14 0 05 respectively fig s1 suggesting that no3 n was consumed by the anammox consortia in the presence of acetate despite the nrr variation the biomass in the mr yielded faster than in the ar at the end of phase ii biomass in the ar and mr increased to 0 07 g vss l and 0 12 g vss l respectively at the end of phase iii the biomass reached 0 288 g vss l and 0 408 g vss l in ar and mr respectively suggesting a faster biomass yield in both reactors in phase iii than that in phase ii as well as more biomass yield in the mr than in the ar 3 2 discrepancies in eps production of anammox consortia in two reactors eps plays a key role in anammox consortia aggregation which significantly affects the nitrogen removal process dna concentrations of eps were between 0 09 and 0 57 mg gvss which were in an appropriate range for eps extraction and indicated that intracellular substances were not significantly released during eps extraction d abzac et al 2010 fig 2 a shows that pn contents of autotrophic anammox consortia and mixotrophic anammox consortia were in the range of 68 29 108 93 mg g vss and 68 00 124 83 mg g vss respectively pn was significantly higher in mixotrophic anammox consortia eps than in autotrophic consortia eps in phase iii p 0 05 by two tail t test thus the addition of acetate promoted pn secretion and more pn was produced by mixotrophic anammox consortia to adapt the medium conditions in phase iii as shown in fig 2 b ps contents were in the range of 25 79 41 32 mg g vss and 25 03 41 29 mg g vss in ar and mr respectively contrary to pn ps in eps from mixotrophic consortia was significantly higher than that from autotrophic consortia only in phase ii p 0 05 by two tail t test and no significant difference was found in phases i and iii more eps excretion was caused by cod addition fig s2 which is consistent with the increase in particle size of anammox consortia a significant correlation between eps contents and particle sizes of anammox consortia was found p 0 05 in accordance with previous reports li et al 2015 3 3 community shift during reactor operation to investigate community shift in different phases of two reactors high throughput sequencing of 16s rdna was conducted a sequencing depth of 57 470 2504 reads was achieved on average per sample and totally 37 otus 1 read abundance were obtained the results showed that bacteria in anammox consortia mainly belonged to planctomycetes proteobacteria chloroflexi deferribacteres and chlorobi pca analysis revealed that samples from the same operation phase clustered together but samples from the same reactor did not fig 3 a which indicated that adding sodium acetate at a c n ratio of 0 3 did not have a distinct effect on the whole microbial community structure as shown in fig 3 b the relative abundance of anammox bacteria increased both in ar and mr the anammox bacteria in the consortia consisted of candidatus jettenia henceforth referred to as ca jettenia and candidatus brocadia henceforth referred to as ca brocadia in the lag phase the relative abundance of ca brocadia in total anammox bacteria was 25 and 36 in the ar and mr respectively in the ar the value changed slightly in the next operation period 28 in phase ii and 35 in phase iii but in the mr there was an apparent increase 44 in phase ii and 81 in phase iii illustrating that ca brocadia was able to utilize sodium acetate mixotrophically making it more competitive than ca jettenia 3 4 effect of different c n ratios on anammox consortia in order to explore the inherent mechanism of the discrepant consortia performance by feeding with sodium acetate batch assays were performed under c n ratios of 0 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 fig s3 under c n ratios of 0 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 tn removal rates were 6 38 0 35 6 37 0 17 6 52 0 17 and 5 92 0 24 mg n l h and the nh4 n removal rates were 3 49 0 18 3 41 0 04 3 79 0 07 and 3 10 0 12 mg nh4 n l h respectively thus organics had little effect on anammox activity under a c n ratio of 0 1 and anammox consortia showed the highest activity when the c n ratio was 0 3 a c n ratio of 0 5 significantly inhibited anammox activity compared to that in the control group p 0 05 by two tail t test as for eps fig s4 pn content in each group was 58 15 4 41 81 91 3 27 69 87 0 92 and 84 82 1 67 mg g vss respectively in the three experimental groups pn contents were 40 86 19 55 and 45 86 respectively higher than that in the control group ps content in each of these group was 27 52 0 52 33 78 0 92 34 24 0 51 and 33 11 1 07 mg g vss namely 22 75 24 42 and 20 31 higher in the three experimental groups than that in the control respectively dna concentrations of eps in each group were 0 2701 0 0016 0 1837 0 0064 0 1416 0 0031 and 0 1507 0 0051 mg g vss statistical analysis showed that for both pn and ps there was a significant difference between each experimental group and the control group p 0 05 by two tail t test 3 5 active community structure under different c n ratios 16s rrna transcript sequencing analysis was applied to reveal the active community based on batch assays a sequencing depth of 36 132 4219 reads was achieved on average per sample and totally 35 otus 1 read abundance were obtained rarefaction curves fig s5 indicated that the sampling of bacterial richness was complete and all samples were compared at an equivalent sequencing depth community heatmap contained top 50 abundant genera in anammox consortia samples from batch assays was exhibited in fig s6 although the relative abundance of metabolically active communities varied with the change in c n ratio to some extent fig 4 a the result of pca analysis showed that low c n ratios did not have a significant effect on metabolically active communities over a short time fig 4 b the most dominant genus was ca jettenia the average relative abundance of which were 37 55 25 55 22 39 and 28 14 when c n ratios were 0 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 respectively the abundance of metabolically active ca brocadia was 2 63 2 73 4 20 and 10 64 respectively which increased continually with increased c n ratio the results corresponded well to the community succession of the two reactors implying that ca brocadia was more adaptable to the organotrophic conditions than ca jettenia as for denitrifiers their relative abundance was low 2 57 5 50 6 56 and 4 16 in average when c n ratios were 0 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 respectively and the difference among these treatments was not significant in order to further investigate effect of cod on anammox consortia transcript analysis of nitrogen transformation functional genes was carried out by qrt pcr the absolute and relative abundances of nitrogen transformation functional genes expression including hzsb hao hdh nirs nrfa and nosz are shown in fig 5 when the c n ratio was 0 3 the transcription of hzsb hao and hdh was significantly p 0 05 promoted the gene transcription of nirs and nosz was also promoted by cod addition when the c n ratio was 0 3 or 0 5 additionally gene transcription of nrfa could be promoted when the c n ratio was 0 3 or 0 5 indicating that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra pathway in anammox consortia might be activated with cod addition the change in nrfa expression was even more considerable than that of nosz in addition functions of cog were predicted based on 16s rrna sequencing to gain more information on bacterial metabolism fig s7 shows predicted cog functions of the 338f 806r region in the 16s rrna sequencing analysis of anammox consortia combined with 16s rrna cog function prediction to the metabolomics analysis energy production and conversion were correlated to bacterial activity and nitrogen removal capacity which could be related to nitrogen metabolism map00910 pathways in kegg cog predicted function of amino acid transport and metabolism could be combined with each amino acid metabolism pathway in kegg and extracellular pn synthesis carbohydrate transport and metabolism may be involved in amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathway map00520 and participated in extracellular ps synthesis besides nucleotide metabolism map00230 and map00240 might be correlated to cell growth however metabolism functions derived from cog prediction may differ from the actual situation thus the information obtained by cog function prediction by i sanger in this study was still limited even though it was found by cog function prediction that the functional abundance of extracellular structure was significantly higher in the c n 0 5 group than in the control group p 0 05 by two tail t test which was in line with pn and ps contents in those groups 3 6 metabolite profile in response to different c n ratios lc ms based metabolomic profiling and quantitation analysis were conducted with anammox consortia samples from the batch assays as it is difficult to obtain pure anammox bacteria kuenen 2008 we could not extract the metabolic products only from anammox bacteria the objective of our study was to detect the anammox consortia in all organisms in the system and metabolome technology has been successfully applied in studies of anammox consortia metabolic status guo et al 2017 in this study more than 440 metabolites were detected fig s8 first one way anova was applied to assess differences between each group the results showed that the content of more than 350 metabolites changed significantly due to the variation in c n ratio fig 6 a a scatter plot based on pca scores obtained from the metabolite concentrations showed a clear separation among the four groups with different c n ratios fig 6 b related metabolites and metabolism pathways are presented in fig 7 and two tail t test was applied to test the difference between contents of metabolites from control group and each experimental group additionally we evaluated the anammox bacteria metabolic pathway based on the bacterial genome and found that all metabolic products presented were secreted by anammox bacteria combined with the analysis of reactor performance and consortia behavior anammox bacteria produced these metabolic products there was a significant increase of metabolites involved in energy processes in the group with c n 0 3 such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides oxidized nad and reduced nadh suggesting that anammox consortia might have the most active metabolism state at this point in addition the values of the nadh nad ratio in the three mixotrophic groups were lower than that in the autotrophic group compared with the control group adenosine 5 triphosphate adp was significantly up regulated when c n ratios were 0 3 and 0 5 while adenosine 5 phosphate atp was down regulated in all three experimental groups significantly nucleotide like metabolites such as pyrimidines pyrs and purines purs playing important roles in the bacterial growth process exhibiting up regulated trend after adding acetate in addition a group of sugar metabolites was detected such as glucose glc galactose gal and n acetyl glucosamine glcnac these metabolites are involved in amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism and play a key role in ps synthesis boels et al 2001 several key metabolites such as glucose 1 phosphate glc 1p uridine 5 diphosphoglucose udp glc and uridine 5 diphosphogalactose udp gal were found significantly up regulated when c n ratios were 0 1 and 0 3 implying that ps synthetic pathways were more active in mixotrophic anammox consortia under certain organics containing condition a total of eighteen amino acids were detected namely alanine ala glycine gly valine val leucine leu isoleucine ile proline pro phenylalanine phe tyrosine tyr tryptophan trp serine ser threonine thr methionine met asparagine asn aspartic acid asp glutamic acid glu lysine lys arginine arg and histidine his leu ile pro tyr and his were considered the major components owing to their high contents the contents of all of detected amino acids except val lys and arg correlated significantly with the extracellular pn contents in eps in each group the pearson correlation coefficient and p value are listed in table s2 indicating these amino acids have a positive correlation with extracellular pn besides a t test was conducted between the contents of amino acids in the control group and each experimental group table s3 significant increase was found mainly in the groups of c n 0 1 and c n 0 5 p 0 05 or p 0 01 by two tail t test in other words there was an accumulation of amino acids in mixotrophic anammox consortia when nitrogen removal performance was lower among the amino acids arg and pro are closely related to polyamine metabolism according to metabolic pathway in fig 7 decrease of agmatine and ornithine as well as increase of putrescine contents illustrated the putrescine synthetic pathway was up regulated especially in the group with c n 0 3 p 0 05 by two tail t test 4 discussion 4 1 discrepant phenotypes between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia it has been widely reported that the anammox species ca brocadia fulgida can utilize acetate and ca brocadia outcompetes other anammox bacteria in the presence of acetate kartal et al 2008 in this study during long term reactor operation the relative abundance of ca brocadia increased and outcompeted other anammox bacteria in the mixotrophic reactor which was not observed in the autotrophic reactor in batch assays the abundance of metabolically active ca brocadia was significantly increased with a cod n ratio of 0 3 as the results of stoichiometric ratio analysis showed fig s1 values of δno3 n δnh4 n ratio in mixotrophic reactor were lower than that in the autotrophic reactor these evidences indicate that acetate oxidation occurred with nitrate reduction which may have been performed by anammox bacteria as previously reported kartal et al 2007a the abundance of denitrifers was increased during reactor operation after dosing of acetate and metabolically active denitrifiers were enhanced at a cod n of 0 3 in the batch test however the change was smaller than that of anammox bacteria and it was also proved by results of qrt pcr analysis the gene nosz participating in the transformation of n2o to n2 in denitrification was promoted by cod addition but changes of its expression quantity were much smaller than those of hzsb hao hdh and nrfa for anammox and dnra processes therefore acetate was mainly consumed by anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers also contributed to the consumption of acetate during long term reactor operation the nrr of the mr was higher than that of the ar in phase ii but it declined in phase iii this was mainly because the further increased nitrogen load of the mr on day 30 induced a further increase in influent cod concentration under a constant c n ratio of 0 3 the results of batch assays verified that 0 3 was the most suitable c n ratio for the nitrogen removal activity of anammox consortia which would promote anammox process performance and it may be related to the up regulation of functional nitrogen transformation functional gene expression hzsb hao hdh and nrfa and nrfa played a crucial role in nitrate reduction by anammox consortia in addition unsuitable organic compound conditions would have no significant effect c n 0 1 or an evident inhibitory effect c n 0 5 here we demonstrated that the cod concentration and the c n ratio are also crucial in determining anammox consortia performance in this experiment the most appropriate acetate dosage for mixotrophic anammox consortia was 60 mg l this value c n 0 3 is lower than that reported by previous studies cod n 1 4 jenni et al 2014 cod n 1 5 huang et al 2014 cod n 1 ni et al 2012 microbiological community and activity of anammox consortia in each study were different resulting in a different impact of organic matter on the consortia hence the appropriate acetate dosage varies along with the anammox consortia properties dosing organics would cause discrepancies in eps secretion between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia under the c n ratio of 0 3 mixotrophic anammox consortia secreted more extracellular ps li et al 2015 also found that there was an increased accumulation of ps with cod addition when anammox consortia were inhibited as the c n ratio reached 0 5 extracellular pn increased remarkably when the cod concentration reached a level too high for anammox consortia to be degraded nitrogen removal efficiency of the mr deteriorated and it has been reported that a protection mechanism may exist for excessive eps secretion under environmental shocks such as cod disturbance li et al 2015 these discrepancies may be related to changes in the community structure and or the bacterial metabolic state as the relative abundance of functional gene expression nirs and nosz in denitrifiers was rather low and the change in metabolically active denitrifiers was not significant following dosing of acetate acetate was mainly utilized by anammox bacteria although denitrifiers also contributed to acetate consumption changes in the metabolic state were the main cause of discrepancies between the autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia in this study as metabolite biosynthesis and accumulation are always convoluted for a single compound involved in multiple pathways hence only typical metabolites involved in this study were presented in fig 7 and emphatically discussed 4 2 metabolic outputs reveal the cause for the bacterial activity and growth discrepancies metabolomics has emerged as a powerful technology that is able to detect functional status and changes in microbial metabolite patterns marcobal et al 2013 different c n ratios were hypothesized to have an impact on the metabolism status of anammox consortia anammox bacteria presented higher activity in the mixotrophic state when the c n ratio was 0 3 but lower activity when the c n ratio was 0 5 nadh and nad are important electron carrier in the cellular electron transport chain the levels of nadh and nad have been reported to act as an indicator of bacterial cellular metabolic activity wos and pollard 2009 farabegoli et al 2003 used an nadh sensor to monitor a wastewater treatment system based on nadh fluorescent values and they found that nadh content corresponded well to sludge biomass and activity in this study the levels of both nadh and nad were significantly up regulated when the c n ratio was 0 3 relative to the control fig 7 thus there were a larger amount of electron carriers to participate in redox reactions indicating a rather active metabolism state in mixotrophic anammox consortia in the experimental group with c n 0 5 both nadh and nad were down regulated suggesting that bacterial metabolic activity was depressed to some extent lower values of the nadh nad ratio in the three mixotrophic groups indicated an efficient electron transport and turnover of nadh to nad in mixotrophic consortia atp is the general energy currency in living cells hammes et al 2010 a decreased atp adp ratio indicates more energy consumption leading to more active metabolism kilstrup et al 2005 in this study atp was found to be down regulated in the mixotrophic groups relative to the control while adp was up regulated in particular the atp adp ratio was the lowest when c n was 0 3 thus adding acetate promoted atp consumption by mixotrophic anammox consortia leading to higher bacterial activity russ et al 2012 analyzed the genome sequence of anammox bacterium kuenenia stuttgartiensis and found an acetyl coa synthetase amp forming and adp forming which could be functionally expressed to convert acetate to acetyl coa in vivo the reaction derived from kegg is as follows atp acetate coa adp amp phosphate acetyl coa in the three experimental groups with acetate added conversion of atp to adp and amp was found based on their relative contents thus according to the above reaction of acetate oxidization the phenomenon provided another evidence that acetate was utilized by anammox bacteria via the acetyl coa pathway according to the results of vss measurement and 16s rdna sequencing results for anammox consortia in the long term operated reactors mixotrophic anammox consortia grew faster than autotrophic ones it was found that some polyamine related substances changed significantly with acetate addition in this study especially when c n 0 3 they were involved in many important metabolic processes such as biofilm formation igarashi and kashiwagi 1999 protein synthesis friedman and oshima 1989 and dna synthesis and stabilization terui et al 2005 putrescine formed from ornithine or arginine acts as a precursor for the synthesis of polyamines auling et al 1991 schneider and wendisch 2011 and plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation and normal cell growth tabor and tabor 1985 the synthetic pathway of putrescine was up regulated with c n 0 3 participating in regulating bacterial growth what s more pyr and pur metabolism pathways exhibited up regulated trend after adding acetate pyr and pur are essential metabolites in the cell participating in many critical processes such as rna and dna synthesis and udp sugar formation garavito et al 2015 they also play an important role in the way organics promote anammox bacterial growth 4 3 discrepancies in eps secretion due to the metabolic conversion eps secretion of bacteria constitutes an important part of the discrepancies between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia pn and ps are the main components of eps but the secretion mechanism is different the results demonstrated that mixotrophic anammox consortia secreted more extracellular ps than autotrophic ones extracellular ps is produced from intracellular sugar nucleotides and consists of various sugars and glucose 1 phosphate glc 1p is a central metabolite in sugar nucleotide formation boels et al 2001 we found that glc 1p was significantly up regulated when c n ratios were 0 1 and 0 3 relative to that in the control in eps polymerization uridine 5 diphosphoglucose udp glc and uridine 5 diphosphogalactose udp gal are central metabolites kilstrup et al 2005 amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism were activated mainly due to up regulated glc 1p udp glc and udp gal when adding acetate directly resulting in more extracellular ps secretion favoring anammox consortia granulation and stability in eps of anammox consortia pn is more predominant than ps with a relatively higher content and it plays an important role in consortia aggregation and biofilm formation jia et al 2017 in addition exposed hydrophobic groups of amino acids express the hydrophobic property of anammox consortia hou et al 2015 in this study 16 kinds of amino acids significantly correlated to pn content in eps indicating that amino acid composition in extracellular pn is related to that in intracellular pn hydrophobic amino acids made up 70 of the total amino acid content suggesting its potential effect on anammox bacteria surface hydrophobicity and stability of granule structure a function frequently attributed to eps is their general protective effect in bacteria against adverse abiotic and biotic influences from the environment wingender et al 1999 the pn secretion in the experimental groups with c n 0 1 and c n 0 5 was relatively high and this may be due to the protective barrier function of eps thus anammox bacteria will produce more extracellular pn to protect themselves from unsuitable acetate concentrations in particular asp and glu metabolism as well as the arg and pro metabolism were reported as important up regulated pathways in bacteria during environmental stress responses joghee and jayaraman 2014 paul et al 2012 besides the synthesis of asp and glu is energetically economical in vivo stephanopoulos et al 1998 thus these amino acids tend to be synthesized more to cope with the environmental stress in anammox consortia under unsuitable organics containing condition 5 conclusions compared to the autotrophic anammox consortia feeding mixotrophic anammox consortia with a c n ratio of 0 3 cod concentration of 60 mg l resulted in higher nitrogen removal rate biomass yield and eps secretion the community shift was not the main cause for the discrepant phenotypes of these two consortia due to no significant difference was found between their community structures activity discrepancies were mainly related to changes in energy metabolism including contents of nadh and nad as well as atp consumption the pyr and pur metabolism pathway and the putrescine synthetic pathway were involved in regulating the growth of anammox consortia amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways were up regulated in mixotrophic anammox consortia resulting in more extracellular ps excretion in adverse environment with higher cod concentration more extracellular pn was secreted by anammox consortia to protect themselves and amino acids also accumulated in the cell the understanding of the discrepant metabolism between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia would be highly beneficial to reveal anammox bacterial function and further the potential application of related technologies regarding treatment of wastewater containing organic compounds acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the

19888,the ability of anammox bacteria to utilize organic matter has drawn extensive attention however the metabolic discrepancies between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia need to be further explored here microbial transcript and metabolomic analysis were conducted for the samples harvested in the reactors and batch assays to investigate the phenotype discrepancies and intrinsic causes in autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia results showed that metabolically active community structures did not show significant difference between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia c n 0 3 changes in the metabolic state were the main cause for those discrepancies in virtue of the added acetate oxidized via the acetyl coa pathway by mixotrophic anammox bacteria at c n ratio of 0 3 anammox activity was obviously promoted compared to that in the autotrophic condition due to higher levels of nadh and nad as well as atp consumption mixotrophic anammox consortia were found to yield more biomass resulting from enhanced purine pyrimidine and putrescine synthetic pathways for regulating bacterial growth up regulated amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways participating in regulating more extracellular polysaccharides secreted by mixotrophic anammox consortia in adverse environment with higher cod concentration more extracellular proteins were produced by anammox consortia to protect themselves and amino acids also accumulated in the cell this study provides useful information to catch the optimal metabolism way of anammox consortia and accelerate anammox bacterial cultivation or reactor startup for wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox autotrophic mixotrophic cod tn ratio metabolic discrepancies 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox a novel wastewater treatment process has been regarded as a promising efficient and cost effective alternative to the conventional nitrification denitrification process van de graaf et al 1996 kartal et al 2010 anammox bacteria were once assumed to be completely chemoautotrophic oxidizing ammonium directly into nitrogen gas with nitrite serving as the terminal electron acceptor strous et al 1998 however previous studies have shown that a multi pathway metabolism exists güven et al 2005 discovered that anammox bacteria could use acetate and propionate as substrates anammox species candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus and candidatus brocadia fulgida henceforth referred to as b fulgida could outcompete other anammox bacteria in the presence of propionate and acetate respectively kartal et al 2007b 2008 the mixotrophic characteristic of anammox makes it possible to treat wastewater containing organics thus it is significant to analyze the discrepancies of anammox consortia behavior under autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions in the presence of organics phenotypic changes appear in anammox consortia first the activity of anammox bacteria is susceptible to be affected by the addition of organics leal et al 2016 the most suitable value of the c n ratio was different as reported due to the discrepancies in reactor nitrogen loading anammox species organic matter and others jenni et al 2014 once anammox activity was suppressed by high c n the red biomass was found to become brownish ni et al 2012 and heterotrophic microorganisms were promoted in the consortia tang et al 2010 it was also discovered that with appropriate cod addition the granulation of anammox consortia was enhanced further microbial succession between different anammox species was discovered with certain toc stresses li et al 2015 shu et al 2016 although these phenotypic discrepancies have been recently discovered the detailed mechanisms remain elusive organic compounds could be utilized by anammox bacteria via the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra pathway in which organic matter donates electrons to reduce nitrate and nitrite kartal et al 2007a the key gene nrfa encoding nitrate or nitrite reductase involved in this pathway was detected in anammox bacteria park et al 2017 indicating the potential capability of dnra in anammox bacteria furthermore the genes encoding amp dependent acetyl coa synthetase and adp dependent acetate coa ligase were also found in b fulgida kuenenia and ksu 1 indicating their ability to oxidize acetate gori et al 2011 thus it is possible that organic matter is oxidized via the acetyl coa pathway in anammox bacteria however the genome based evidence is still not adequate to clarify how discrepant phenotypes such as aggregation and ammonium nitrogen removal capacity between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia downstream of genes transcripts proteins and metabolites are able to provide direct information on cellular metabolism status tautenhahn et al 2012 metabolomics has emerged as a new focus and has been applied in research on bacteria fungi plants animals organ tissues and others nicholson and lindon 2008 tang et al 2016 among the experimental strategies of metabolomics untargeted metabolomics is able to acquire data from a diverse range of metabolites without providing specific chemical identification and structural information on the detected metabolites dunn et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that metabolomics was applied in a metabolism study of autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia which can be a significant complement to genome studies on anammox bacteria the purposes of this study were 1 to investigate the performance discrepancies between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox reactors 2 to evaluate the effects of different c n ratios on the anammox consortia and 3 to explore the discrepancy mechanism via metabolomics analysis and microbial community structure and transcript the exploration of metabolic discrepancies between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia could greatly help understanding the characteristics of anammox consortia metabolism and it is expected that the results presented may provide a basis for engineering applications of anammox technology 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor operation the study was carried out using two 5 l membrane bioreactors mbrs operated for two months including an autotrophic reactor ar and a mixotrophic reactor mr anammox consortia was taken from membrane bioreactor operated in our laboratory hou et al 2017 and inoculated into the two reactors with the same initial biomass of 0 023 g volatile suspended solids vss l both the ar and mr were fed with a synthetic medium solution van de graaf et al 1996 the medium solution of the mr also had sodium acetate added as an organic carbon source under a constant optimal c n ratio of 0 3 according to the batch assays during the whole operation the hydraulic residence time hrt of the two reactors was maintained at 36 h the temperature was set at 37 1 c by a water bath and ph was kept in the range of 7 5 8 3 and a strictly anaerobic condition was maintained samples of influent and effluent were collected every two days to determine the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n according to standard methods apha 1995 every week before determining eps contents three consortia samples were collected from the reactors and then mixed together dna samples

measuring vss apha 1995 2 2 batch assays batch assays were performed in 100 ml serum bottles at first the consortia was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and the pellet was harvested and inoculated

polysaccharides pss were quantified by the bicinchoninic acid bca assay osnes et al 1993 and anthrone method loewus 1952 respectively dna concentrations of eps were measured with a nanodrop one spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa all measurements were conducted in triplicate 2 4 microbial community analysis the microbial community analysis was performed by 16s rdna and

qrt pcr procedure and primers used were shown in text s1 and table s1 2 5 lc ms based metabolomic profiling and quantitation analysis metabolic products we extracted came from the whole consortia including the intracellular and extracellular the methods used to extract metabolic products have been described previously walker et al 2014 tang et al 2016 guo et al 2017 first 10 ml consortia suspension was centrifuged at 4 c 6000 g 3 min the pellet was then washed by pbs for three times and quenched in liquid nitrogen immediately then resuspended the pellet in 1 5 ml ultrapure water 4 c and sonicated it by a sonicator 3 s intervals between 3 s pulses 195 w 30 min subsequently added 6 ml methanol previously cooled at 80 c into the samples and stored them at 80 c for 2 h to precipitate the proteins then collected the supernatants after centrifugation 20 min 10 000 g and evaporated them under a gentle steam of nitrogen gas until dry the residues were collected for metabolite determination all tests were conducted in triplicate untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed by q exactive orbitrap thermo ca first loaded 1 μl supernatant on a normal phase chromatography

by r studio analysis of variance anova was conducted by software spss 20 0 to examine the differences between various samples and differences with an adjusted p 0 05 were considered to be statistically significant 3 results 3 1 reactor operation performance two reactors an ar and a mr were successfully operated for two months as shown in fig 1 a b the whole operational process could be divided into three phases based on the nitrogen removal performance the lag phase i day 0 10 the mixotrophy predominant period ii day 11 35 and the autotrophy predominant period iii day 36 60 in phase i the concentrations of nh4 n and no2 n in the influent of two reactors were maintained at 100 mg l and the nitrogen removal efficiency nre fluctuated around 50 fig 1 c in phase ii the performance of the mr notably improved with the highest nitrogen removal rate nrr and ammonia nitrogen removal rate arr reached 122 43 mg n l d and 77 55 mg n l d respectively apparently higher than ar 99 71 mg n l d and 61 84 mg n l d at the same time in phase iii along with improvement in the nitrogen load the dosage of acetate increased under the constant c n ratio fig 1 d anammox activity was suppressed under the high concentration of organic matter thus resulting in high cod concentration in the effluent of the mr on the 60th day the nrr and arr of the mr decreased to 91 13 mg n l d and 46 88 mg n l d respectively while they increased to 146 63 mg n l d and 90 62 mg n l d in the ar stoichiometric ratio analysis showed that the no2 n nh4 n ratios in ar and mr were not significantly different however the average values of the no3 n nh4 n ratios in ar and mr were 0 43 0 08 and 0 14 0 05 respectively fig s1 suggesting that no3 n was consumed by the anammox consortia in the presence of acetate despite the nrr variation the biomass in the mr yielded faster than in the ar at the end of phase ii biomass in the ar and mr increased to 0 07 g vss l and 0 12 g vss l respectively at the end of phase iii the biomass reached 0 288 g vss l and 0 408 g vss l in ar and mr respectively suggesting a faster biomass yield in both reactors in phase iii than that in phase ii as well as more biomass yield in the mr than in the ar 3 2 discrepancies in eps production of anammox consortia in two reactors eps plays a key role in anammox consortia aggregation which significantly affects the nitrogen removal process dna concentrations of eps were between 0 09 and 0 57 mg gvss which were in an appropriate range for eps extraction and indicated that intracellular substances were not significantly released during eps extraction d abzac et al 2010 fig 2 a shows that pn contents of autotrophic anammox consortia and mixotrophic anammox consortia were in the range of 68 29 108 93 mg g vss and 68 00 124 83 mg g vss respectively pn was significantly higher in mixotrophic anammox consortia eps than in autotrophic consortia eps in phase iii p 0 05 by two tail t test thus the addition of acetate promoted pn secretion and more pn was produced by mixotrophic anammox consortia to adapt the medium conditions in phase iii as shown in fig 2 b ps contents were in the range of 25 79 41 32 mg g vss and 25 03 41 29 mg g vss in ar and mr respectively contrary to pn ps in eps from mixotrophic consortia was significantly higher than that from autotrophic consortia only in phase ii p 0 05 by two tail t test and no significant difference was found in phases i and iii more eps excretion was caused by cod addition fig s2 which is consistent with the increase in particle size of anammox consortia a significant correlation between eps contents and particle sizes of anammox consortia was found p 0 05 in accordance with previous reports li et al 2015 3 3 community shift during reactor operation to investigate community shift in different phases of two reactors high throughput sequencing of 16s rdna was conducted a sequencing depth of 57 470 2504 reads was achieved on average per sample and totally 37 otus 1 read abundance were obtained the results showed that bacteria in anammox consortia mainly belonged to planctomycetes proteobacteria chloroflexi deferribacteres and chlorobi pca analysis revealed that samples from the same operation phase clustered together but samples from the same reactor did not fig 3 a which indicated that adding sodium acetate at a c n ratio of 0 3 did not have a distinct effect on the whole microbial community structure as shown in fig 3 b the relative abundance of anammox bacteria increased both in ar and mr the anammox bacteria in the consortia consisted of candidatus jettenia henceforth referred to as ca jettenia and candidatus brocadia henceforth referred to as ca brocadia in the lag phase the relative abundance of ca brocadia in total anammox bacteria was 25 and 36 in the ar and mr respectively in the ar the value changed slightly in the next operation period 28 in phase ii and 35 in phase iii but in the mr there was an apparent increase 44 in phase ii and 81 in phase iii illustrating that ca brocadia was able to utilize sodium acetate mixotrophically making it more competitive than ca jettenia 3 4 effect of different c n ratios on anammox consortia in order to explore the inherent mechanism of the discrepant consortia performance by feeding with sodium acetate batch assays were performed under c n ratios of 0 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 fig s3 under c n ratios of 0 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 tn removal rates were 6 38 0 35 6 37 0 17 6 52 0 17 and 5 92 0 24 mg n l h and the nh4 n removal rates were 3 49 0 18 3 41 0 04 3 79 0 07 and 3 10 0 12 mg nh4 n l h respectively thus organics had little effect on anammox activity under a c n ratio of 0 1 and anammox consortia showed the highest activity when the c n ratio was 0 3 a c n ratio of 0 5 significantly inhibited anammox activity compared to that in the control group p 0 05 by two tail t test as for eps fig s4 pn content in each group was 58 15 4 41 81 91 3 27 69 87 0 92 and 84 82 1 67 mg g vss respectively in the three experimental groups pn contents were 40 86 19 55 and 45 86 respectively higher than that in the control group ps content in each of these group was 27 52 0 52 33 78 0 92 34 24 0 51 and 33 11 1 07 mg g vss namely 22 75 24 42 and 20 31 higher in the three experimental groups than that in the control respectively dna concentrations of eps in each group were 0 2701 0 0016 0 1837 0 0064 0 1416 0 0031 and 0 1507 0 0051 mg g vss statistical analysis showed that for both pn and ps there was a significant difference between each experimental group and the control group p 0 05 by two tail t test 3 5 active community structure under different c n ratios 16s rrna transcript sequencing analysis was applied to reveal the active community based on batch assays a sequencing depth of 36 132 4219 reads was achieved on average per sample and totally 35 otus 1 read abundance were obtained rarefaction curves fig s5 indicated that the sampling of bacterial richness was complete and all samples were compared at an equivalent sequencing depth community heatmap contained top 50 abundant genera in anammox consortia samples from batch assays was exhibited in fig s6 although the relative abundance of metabolically active communities varied with the change in c n ratio to some extent fig 4 a the result of pca analysis showed that low c n ratios did not have a significant effect on metabolically active communities over a short time fig 4 b the most dominant genus was ca jettenia the average relative abundance of which were 37 55 25 55 22 39 and 28 14 when c n ratios were 0 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 respectively the abundance of metabolically active ca brocadia was 2 63 2 73 4 20 and 10 64 respectively which increased continually with increased c n ratio the results corresponded well to the community succession of the two reactors implying that ca brocadia was more adaptable to the organotrophic conditions than ca jettenia as for denitrifiers their relative abundance was low 2 57 5 50 6 56 and 4 16 in average when c n ratios were 0 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 respectively and the difference among these treatments was not significant in order to further investigate effect of cod on anammox consortia transcript analysis of nitrogen transformation functional genes was carried out by qrt pcr the absolute and relative abundances of nitrogen transformation functional genes expression including hzsb hao hdh nirs nrfa and nosz are shown in fig 5 when the c n ratio was 0 3 the transcription of hzsb hao and hdh was significantly p 0 05 promoted the gene transcription of nirs and nosz was also promoted by cod addition when the c n ratio was 0 3 or 0 5 additionally gene transcription of nrfa could be promoted when the c n ratio was 0 3 or 0 5 indicating that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra pathway in anammox consortia might be activated with cod addition the change in nrfa expression was even more considerable than that of nosz in addition functions of cog were predicted based on 16s rrna sequencing to gain more information on bacterial metabolism fig s7 shows predicted cog functions of the 338f 806r region in the 16s rrna sequencing analysis of anammox consortia combined with 16s rrna cog function prediction to the metabolomics analysis energy production and conversion were correlated to bacterial activity and nitrogen removal capacity which could be related to nitrogen metabolism map00910 pathways in kegg cog predicted function of amino acid transport and metabolism could be combined with each amino acid metabolism pathway in kegg and extracellular pn synthesis carbohydrate transport and metabolism may be involved in amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathway map00520 and participated in extracellular ps synthesis besides nucleotide metabolism map00230 and map00240 might be correlated to cell growth however metabolism functions derived from cog prediction may differ from the actual situation thus the information obtained by cog function prediction by i sanger in this study was still limited even though it was found by cog function prediction that the functional abundance of extracellular structure was significantly higher in the c n 0 5 group than in the control group p 0 05 by two tail t test which was in line with pn and ps contents in those groups 3 6 metabolite profile in response to different c n ratios lc ms based metabolomic profiling and quantitation analysis were conducted with anammox consortia samples from the batch assays as it is difficult to obtain pure anammox bacteria kuenen 2008 we could not extract the metabolic products only from anammox bacteria the objective of our study was to detect the anammox consortia in all organisms in the system and metabolome technology has been successfully applied in studies of anammox consortia metabolic status guo et al 2017 in this study more than 440 metabolites were detected fig s8 first one way anova was applied to assess differences between each group the results showed that the content of more than 350 metabolites changed significantly due to the variation in c n ratio fig 6 a a scatter plot based on pca scores obtained from the metabolite concentrations showed a clear separation among the four groups with different c n ratios fig 6 b related metabolites and metabolism pathways are presented in fig 7 and two tail t test was applied to test the difference between contents of metabolites from control group and each experimental group additionally we evaluated the anammox bacteria metabolic pathway based on the bacterial genome and found that all metabolic products presented were secreted by anammox bacteria combined with the analysis of reactor performance and consortia behavior anammox bacteria produced these metabolic products there was a significant increase of metabolites involved in energy processes in the group with c n 0 3 such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides oxidized nad and reduced nadh suggesting that anammox consortia might have the most active metabolism state at this point in addition the values of the nadh nad ratio in the three mixotrophic groups were lower than that in the autotrophic group compared with the control group adenosine 5 triphosphate adp was significantly up regulated when c n ratios were 0 3 and 0 5 while adenosine 5 phosphate atp was down regulated in all three experimental groups significantly nucleotide like metabolites such as pyrimidines pyrs and purines purs playing important roles in the bacterial growth process exhibiting up regulated trend after adding acetate in addition a group of sugar metabolites was detected such as glucose glc galactose gal and n acetyl glucosamine glcnac these metabolites are involved in amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism and play a key role in ps synthesis boels et al 2001 several key metabolites such as glucose 1 phosphate glc 1p uridine 5 diphosphoglucose udp glc and uridine 5 diphosphogalactose udp gal were found significantly up regulated when c n ratios were 0 1 and 0 3 implying that ps synthetic pathways were more active in mixotrophic anammox consortia under certain organics containing condition a total of eighteen amino acids were detected namely alanine ala glycine gly valine val leucine leu isoleucine ile proline pro phenylalanine phe tyrosine tyr tryptophan trp serine ser threonine thr methionine met asparagine asn aspartic acid asp glutamic acid glu lysine lys arginine arg and histidine his leu ile pro tyr and his were considered the major components owing to their high contents the contents of all of detected amino acids except val lys and arg correlated significantly with the extracellular pn contents in eps in each group the pearson correlation coefficient and p value are listed in table s2 indicating these amino acids have a positive correlation with extracellular pn besides a t test was conducted between the contents of amino acids in the control group and each experimental group table s3 significant increase was found mainly in the groups of c n 0 1 and c n 0 5 p 0 05 or p 0 01 by two tail t test in other words there was an accumulation of amino acids in mixotrophic anammox consortia when nitrogen removal performance was lower among the amino acids arg and pro are closely related to polyamine metabolism according to metabolic pathway in fig 7 decrease of agmatine and ornithine as well as increase of putrescine contents illustrated the putrescine synthetic pathway was up regulated especially in the group with c n 0 3 p 0 05 by two tail t test 4 discussion 4 1 discrepant phenotypes between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia it has been widely reported that the anammox species ca brocadia fulgida can utilize acetate and ca brocadia outcompetes other anammox bacteria in the presence of acetate kartal et al 2008 in this study during long term reactor operation the relative abundance of ca brocadia increased and outcompeted other anammox bacteria in the mixotrophic reactor which was not observed in the autotrophic reactor in batch assays the abundance of metabolically active ca brocadia was significantly increased with a cod n ratio of 0 3 as the results of stoichiometric ratio analysis showed fig s1 values of δno3 n δnh4 n ratio in mixotrophic reactor were lower than that in the autotrophic reactor these evidences indicate that acetate oxidation occurred with nitrate reduction which may have been performed by anammox bacteria as previously reported kartal et al 2007a the abundance of denitrifers was increased during reactor operation after dosing of acetate and metabolically active denitrifiers were enhanced at a cod n of 0 3 in the batch test however the change was smaller than that of anammox bacteria and it was also proved by results of qrt pcr analysis the gene nosz participating in the transformation of n2o to n2 in denitrification was promoted by cod addition but changes of its expression quantity were much smaller than those of hzsb hao hdh and nrfa for anammox and dnra processes therefore acetate was mainly consumed by anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers also contributed to the consumption of acetate during long term reactor operation the nrr of the mr was higher than that of the ar in phase ii but it declined in phase iii this was mainly because the further increased nitrogen load of the mr on day 30 induced a further increase in influent cod concentration under a constant c n ratio of 0 3 the results of batch assays verified that 0 3 was the most suitable c n ratio for the nitrogen removal activity of anammox consortia which would promote anammox process performance and it may be related to the up regulation of functional nitrogen transformation functional gene expression hzsb hao hdh and nrfa and nrfa played a crucial role in nitrate reduction by anammox consortia in addition unsuitable organic compound conditions would have no significant effect c n 0 1 or an evident inhibitory effect c n 0 5 here we demonstrated that the cod concentration and the c n ratio are also crucial in determining anammox consortia performance in this experiment the most appropriate acetate dosage for mixotrophic anammox consortia was 60 mg l this value c n 0 3 is lower than that reported by previous studies cod n 1 4 jenni et al 2014 cod n 1 5 huang et al 2014 cod n 1 ni et al 2012 microbiological community and activity of anammox consortia in each study were different resulting in a different impact of organic matter on the consortia hence the appropriate acetate dosage varies along with the anammox consortia properties dosing organics would cause discrepancies in eps secretion between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia under the c n ratio of 0 3 mixotrophic anammox consortia secreted more extracellular ps li et al 2015 also found that there was an increased accumulation of ps with cod addition when anammox consortia were inhibited as the c n ratio reached 0 5 extracellular pn increased remarkably when the cod concentration reached a level too high for anammox consortia to be degraded nitrogen removal efficiency of the mr deteriorated and it has been reported that a protection mechanism may exist for excessive eps secretion under environmental shocks such as cod disturbance li et al 2015 these discrepancies may be related to changes in the community structure and or the bacterial metabolic state as the relative abundance of functional gene expression nirs and nosz in denitrifiers was rather low and the change in metabolically active denitrifiers was not significant following dosing of acetate acetate was mainly utilized by anammox bacteria although denitrifiers also contributed to acetate consumption changes in the metabolic state were the main cause of discrepancies between the autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia in this study as metabolite biosynthesis and accumulation are always convoluted for a single compound involved in multiple pathways hence only typical metabolites involved in this study were presented in fig 7 and emphatically discussed 4 2 metabolic outputs reveal the cause for the bacterial activity and growth discrepancies metabolomics has emerged as a powerful technology that is able to detect functional status and changes in microbial metabolite patterns marcobal et al 2013 different c n ratios were hypothesized to have an impact on the metabolism status of anammox consortia anammox bacteria presented higher activity in the mixotrophic state when the c n ratio was 0 3 but lower activity when the c n ratio was 0 5 nadh and nad are important electron carrier in the cellular electron transport chain the levels of nadh and nad have been reported to act as an indicator of bacterial cellular metabolic activity wos and pollard 2009 farabegoli et al 2003 used an nadh sensor to monitor a wastewater treatment system based on nadh fluorescent values and they found that nadh content corresponded well to sludge biomass and activity in this study the levels of both nadh and nad were significantly up regulated when the c n ratio was 0 3 relative to the control fig 7 thus there were a larger amount of electron carriers to participate in redox reactions indicating a rather active metabolism state in mixotrophic anammox consortia in the experimental group with c n 0 5 both nadh and nad were down regulated suggesting that bacterial metabolic activity was depressed to some extent lower values of the nadh nad ratio in the three mixotrophic groups indicated an efficient electron transport and turnover of nadh to nad in mixotrophic consortia atp is the general energy currency in living cells hammes et al 2010 a decreased atp adp ratio indicates more energy consumption leading to more active metabolism kilstrup et al 2005 in this study atp was found to be down regulated in the mixotrophic groups relative to the control while adp was up regulated in particular the atp adp ratio was the lowest when c n was 0 3 thus adding acetate promoted atp consumption by mixotrophic anammox consortia leading to higher bacterial activity russ et al 2012 analyzed the genome sequence of anammox bacterium kuenenia stuttgartiensis and found an acetyl coa synthetase amp forming and adp forming which could be functionally expressed to convert acetate to acetyl coa in vivo the reaction derived from kegg is as follows atp acetate coa adp amp phosphate acetyl coa in the three experimental groups with acetate added conversion of atp to adp and amp was found based on their relative contents thus according to the above reaction of acetate oxidization the phenomenon provided another evidence that acetate was utilized by anammox bacteria via the acetyl coa pathway according to the results of vss measurement and 16s rdna sequencing results for anammox consortia in the long term operated reactors mixotrophic anammox consortia grew faster than autotrophic ones it was found that some polyamine related substances changed significantly with acetate addition in this study especially when c n 0 3 they were involved in many important metabolic processes such as biofilm formation igarashi and kashiwagi 1999 protein synthesis friedman and oshima 1989 and dna synthesis and stabilization terui et al 2005 putrescine formed from ornithine or arginine acts as a precursor for the synthesis of polyamines auling et al 1991 schneider and wendisch 2011 and plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation and normal cell growth tabor and tabor 1985 the synthetic pathway of putrescine was up regulated with c n 0 3 participating in regulating bacterial growth what s more pyr and pur metabolism pathways exhibited up regulated trend after adding acetate pyr and pur are essential metabolites in the cell participating in many critical processes such as rna and dna synthesis and udp sugar formation garavito et al 2015 they also play an important role in the way organics promote anammox bacterial growth 4 3 discrepancies in eps secretion due to the metabolic conversion eps secretion of bacteria constitutes an important part of the discrepancies between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia pn and ps are the main components of eps but the secretion mechanism is different the results demonstrated that mixotrophic anammox consortia secreted more extracellular ps than autotrophic ones extracellular ps is produced from intracellular sugar nucleotides and consists of various sugars and glucose 1 phosphate glc 1p is a central metabolite in sugar nucleotide formation boels et al 2001 we found that glc 1p was significantly up regulated when c n ratios were 0 1 and 0 3 relative to that in the control in eps polymerization uridine 5 diphosphoglucose udp glc and uridine 5 diphosphogalactose udp gal are central metabolites kilstrup et al 2005 amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism were activated mainly due to up regulated glc 1p udp glc and udp gal when adding acetate directly resulting in more extracellular ps secretion favoring anammox consortia granulation and stability in eps of anammox consortia pn is more predominant than ps with a relatively higher content and it plays an important role in consortia aggregation and biofilm formation jia et al 2017 in addition exposed hydrophobic groups of amino acids express the hydrophobic property of anammox consortia hou et al 2015 in this study 16 kinds of amino acids significantly correlated to pn content in eps indicating that amino acid composition in extracellular pn is related to that in intracellular pn hydrophobic amino acids made up 70 of the total amino acid content suggesting its potential effect on anammox bacteria surface hydrophobicity and stability of granule structure a function frequently attributed to eps is their general protective effect in bacteria against adverse abiotic and biotic influences from the environment wingender et al 1999 the pn secretion in the experimental groups with c n 0 1 and c n 0 5 was relatively high and this may be due to the protective barrier function of eps thus anammox bacteria will produce more extracellular pn to protect themselves from unsuitable acetate concentrations in particular asp and glu metabolism as well as the arg and pro metabolism were reported as important up regulated pathways in bacteria during environmental stress responses joghee and jayaraman 2014 paul et al 2012 besides the synthesis of asp and glu is energetically economical in vivo stephanopoulos et al 1998 thus these amino acids tend to be synthesized more to cope with the environmental stress in anammox consortia under unsuitable organics containing condition 5 conclusions compared to the autotrophic anammox consortia feeding mixotrophic anammox consortia with a c n ratio of 0 3 cod concentration of 60 mg l resulted in higher nitrogen removal rate biomass yield and eps secretion the community shift was not the main cause for the discrepant phenotypes of these two consortia due to no significant difference was found between their community structures activity discrepancies were mainly related to changes in energy metabolism including contents of nadh and nad as well as atp consumption the pyr and pur metabolism pathway and the putrescine synthetic pathway were involved in regulating the growth of anammox consortia amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism pathways were up regulated in mixotrophic anammox consortia resulting in more extracellular ps excretion in adverse environment with higher cod concentration more extracellular pn was secreted by anammox consortia to protect themselves and amino acids also accumulated in the cell the understanding of the discrepant metabolism between autotrophic and mixotrophic anammox consortia would be highly beneficial to reveal anammox bacterial function and further the potential application of related technologies regarding treatment of wastewater containing organic compounds acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the

19889,stable isotope probing sip is a powerful tool to study microbial community structure and function in both nature and engineered environments coupling with advanced genomics and other techniques sip studies have generated substantial information to allow researchers to draw a clearer picture of what is occurring in complex microbial ecosystems this review provides an overview of the advances of sip based technologies over time summarizes the status of sip applications to contaminant biodegradation provides critical perspectives on ecological interactions within the community and important factors controllable and non controllable to be considered in sip experimental designs and data interpretation current trend and perspectives of adapting sip techniques for environmental applications are also discussed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stable isotope probing sip biodegradation co metabolism rdx data availability data will be made available on request introduction in natural and engineered environments microorganisms live together within communities where they interact with each other through competition mutualism amensalism commensalism predation and sometimes with no interaction microorganisms within the communities also respond to stressors and stimuli in their surrounding environment resulting in dynamic microbial community structure and functions which are assembled through two mechanisms deterministic i e natural selection or stochastic i e random dispersion cell growth cell death immigration and speciation pholchan et al 2013 faust and raes 2012 while information of 16s rrna genes rna genes and amino acid sequences have provided a better understanding of microbial community structures or functions or implicated ecological functions within engineering and natural systems hugerth and andersson 2017 venkataraman et al 2015 wang et al 2013 2009 the linkages between the structure and their function were challenging and difficult aitchison 1982 gloor et al 2017 until the applications of stable isotope probing sip techniques the concept of using stable isotopes to study microbial function can be dated back many decades ago in 1958 meselson and stahl reported the first study of using 15n labeled nitrogen to validate the hypothesis of the semi conservative dna replication rule meselson and stahl 1958 yet the application of stable isotopes to link microbial function to metabolically active microorganisms was realized much later in 2000 radajeweski and co workers reported the first study using 13c labeled methanol and or methane to identify the presence and diversity of methylotrophic populations in natural environments based on dna based sip colin murrell and radajewski 2000 morris et al 2002 radajewski et al 2000 through dna based sip researchers can track the flow of the isotopes in the labeled compound to the microbial cellular components such as dna in the metabolically active microbes within a complex community after separation of the labeled dnas from non labeled dnas through concentration gradient ultracentrifugation labeled dnas contributed from the metabolically active microbes are then sequenced and then used to identify the active microbes years later dna based sip with 13c labeled multi carbon substrates such as glucose phenol caffeine and naphthalene jeon et al 2003 padmanabhan et al 2003 yu and chu 2005 and with 15n labeled explosive roh et al 2009 were applied to identify active contaminant degraders in soil wastewater treatment and groundwater aquifer sediments recent applications of dna based sip to understand biodegradation of various priority and emerging contaminants are summarized and discussed in the section of sip applications with different isotopically labeled compounds below meanwhile researchers explored sip with different biomarkers such as rna proteins lipids and metabolites to probe unknown metabolic reactions unique microbial functions and to explore unknown interactions of active microbial populations at varying levels kruse et al 2013 manefield et al 2002 tsugawa et al 2019 von bergen et al 2013 based on the choice of biomarkers sip based techniques have been designated as dna sip radajewski et al 2000 rna sip fortunato and huber 2016 manefield et al 2002 fatty acid methyl esters fame sip lerch et al 2009 2007 or protein sip jehmlich et al 2008 the above sip based technologies also coupled with advanced multi omics such as metagenomics chen and murrell 2010 transcriptomics nuccio et al 2021 proteomics von bergen et al 2013 and metabolomics birkemeyer et al 2005 hassanpour and aristilde 2021 hou et al 2021 tsugawa et al 2019 wilhelm et al 2022 advancing our understanding of microbial structure and function in various environments sip with fluorescence in situ hybridization fish huang et al 2007 orphan et al 2001 2002 has been utilized but it is time consuming this drawback is overcome by chip sip mayali et al 2012 2019 which enables high throughput processing of labeled rrna gene sequences by using rna microarrays more recently sip has been coupled with multiple advanced techniques including meta omics raman microspectroscopy or nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims collectively referred to as single cell sip sc sip raman microspectroscopy can directly reveal the biochemical fingerprints of a single cell without labeling and nanosims can create nanoscale maps of element or isotope distribution of a sample thus when integrating these techniques to track isotopic signals in a single cell the sc sip becomes a powerful non destructive method in studying microbial ecology particularly for a better understanding of spatial variations of cellular metabolism phenotypic heterogeneity and cellular interactions such as syntrophy or cross feeding within a complex community berry et al 2015 chen and murrell 2010 lee et al 2021 wagner 2009 excellent reviews on sc sip techniques are currently available elsewhere alcolombri et al 2022 hatzenpichler et al 2020 to quantify the variations of the growth of functional microbes in a complex community a quantitative sip called qsip was developed by integrating 18o h2o and a 13c labeled substrate and quantitative pcr qpcr and metagenomics based on 16s rrna genes hungate et al 2015 particularly qsip has been demonstrated to be powerful in quantifying taxon specific substrate assimilation rate or flux variations by glucose utilizing microorganisms in soil samples hungate et al 2015 subsequently qsip has been applied to study various research topics including legacy carbon turnover in soil soil bacteria involved in assimilation of fertilizer nitrogen and soil carbon litter decomposition in freshwater and pah degradation coskun et al 2018 dong et al 2022 hayer et al 2016 hungate et al 2015 sieradzki et al 2021 fig 1 briefly illustrates timeline of the advances of sip based technologies with different biomarkers and advanced technologies a comparison of selected key sip based technologies is briefly summarized in table 1 excellent reviews on those key sip based technologies and their applications to public health and host microbe interactions are available berry and loy 2018 berry et al 2013 bruntz et al 2017 the advantage and disadvantage over the choice of different labeled biomarkers such as plfa phospholipid derived fatty acid rna dna in sip microbial ecology studies has been discussed in previous reviews manefield et al 2004 neufeld et al 2007 however many ecological aspects and technical issues that commonly complicate sip application and data interpretation are rarely discussed to this end this review discusses various ecological aspects and technical issues of sip with a focus on biodegradation and bioremediation of environmental contaminants mostly factors such as variation of catabolic mechanisms and key technical aspects that are frequently overlooked and consideration in interpreting data obtained from sip based studies for contaminant degradation processes are also reviewed current trends and perspective of adapting sip techniques for studying co metabolic biodegradation of environmental contaminants and their environmental applications are also identified and discussed growth linked mechanisms are the key in labeling metabolites and cellular components of metabolically active microbes when a labeled substrate is degraded inside metabolically active microorganisms relying on the growth linked mechanisms of the microbes the flow of isotopically labeled atoms in the substrate is first converted to labeled metabolites which are further degraded or incorporated into a wide range of internal cellular components in the metabolically active microorganisms with some secreted extracellularly fig 2 each of the labeled metabolites and cellular components such as dna and rna fatty acids and lipids in cell membranes intracellular and extracellular proteins and secreted materials such as soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps can be tracked individually or combined to investigate previously unknown microbial taxonomy and functions jehmlich et al 2016 kruse et al 2013 wang et al 2015 xiao et al 2022 biomarker dna has been the simplest means to identify microbial taxa that linked to the metabolic active microbes while characterization of the biomarker rna provides direct link of microbes that are specifically active to certain trophic environments dumont et al 2013 fortunato and huber 2016 radajewski et al 2000 profiling of labeled proteins particularly enzymes involved in biodegradation of contaminants allows identification of amino acid sequences of the units that directly responsible for the microbial functions jehmlich et al 2008 characterization of the assimilated fame could fingerprint active microbial community compositions evershed et al 2006 and the assimilated smp or eps could be used as substrates to evaluate the utilization of metabolic products by other bacteria wang et al 2015 xiao et al 2022 tracking the flux of the labeled metabolites have provided valuable insights of a specific metabolic network in biological systems such as plants and the new insights have been used to guide design in metabolic engineering biotechnology and microbiology birkemeyer et al 2005 fan et al 2012 tsugawa et al 2019 recently by tracking labeled metabolites i e sip metabolomics derived from 13c glucose that was spiked into oxic or anoxic soil 13c enrichment dynamics of metabolites under different redox conditions were revealed hassanpour and aristilde 2021 by tracking 13c from nine isotopically labeled carbon sources into the water soluble soil metabolite pool over 48 days researcher observed that the type of carbon source amended into the soils caused the production of different metabolites and that the fate of the carbon in the metabolites in soils were not controlled by time but due to their differences enhancing our understanding of soil carbon cycling wilhelm et al 2022 however unlike common carbon source compounds studies using certain extracellular products such as smp and eps as biomarkers are challenging and such applications have not been reported to our best knowledge while a vast amount of information pertaining to biological activity can be inferred from the labeled cellular components such as rna proteins lipids mapping such information back to the taxonomy of the associated microbes in the community remain very challenging and often impossible accordingly evaluating dna with assimilated stable isotopes i e dna sip remains as the simplest and most straight forward approach to identify active microbial community in complex environmental matrices the following sections describe the advances of dna based sip to environmental science and engineering sip studies with different isotopically labeled compounds i e 13c 15n 2h 18o 33 34s allow for interrogating various microbial meditated processes in the environment i 13c dna sip studies have been expanded from using c1 to multi carbon substrates 13c labeled substrates are the most frequently used in sip studies as carbon is an energy and or carbon source required for microbial growth since the pioneer microbial ecology work of using 13c labeled methanol and methane to identify active methylotrophic populations in soil morris et al 2002 radajewski et al 2000 the 13c dna sip technique has been quickly adapted to study biodegradation and bioremediation of many environment contaminants including 13c labeled multi carbon aliphatics and aromatics suh as ethane propane n hexadecane polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene methyl tert butyl ether bisphenol a triclosan pesticides estrogen synthetic lignin organic solvents and stabilizers bao et al 2022 cupples 2016 dang and cupples 2021 farhan ul

zhang et al 2021a recently 13c labeled acetate or carbonate has been used to better understand the identities of microbes involved in denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox bellini et

distinct e2 assimilating bacterial species compared to its non labeled counterpart 12c e2 zhang et al 2021a yet sip studies are typically limited by the high cost of labeled contaminants and the availability of labeled contaminants with desired labeling locations and numbers ii 15n dna sip studies identify microbes using nitrogen containing pollutants as nitrogen source nitrogen stable isotope 15n is the next most frequently used stable isotope in dna sip to study biodegradation of nitrogen containing pollutants such as hexahydro 1 3 5 trinitro 1 3 5 triazine rdx a nitroamide explosive ariyarathna et al 2019 cho et al 2016 2015 roh et al 2009 polyhexamethylene biguanide phmb a nitrogenous disinfectant and antibiotic o malley et al 2007 and atrazine a herbicide shaffer et al 2010 these studies identified microbes capable of using the contaminants as their sole nitrogen source an interesting approach was to use 15n nh4h2po4 as a sole nitrogen source to label active hydrocarbon degrading degraders in microcosms since active hydrocarbon degraders also required 15n as nitrogen source when utilizing hydrocarbon for growth bell et al 2011 by using 15n dna sip in partial nitrification anammox processes autotrophic denitrification via anammox pathway was found dominant in ammonia rich wastewater and symbiotic relationships among anammox bacteria anaerolineae proteobacteria and planctomycetacia during the nitrogen conversion were revealed li et al 2019 iii 2h h2o or 18o h2o dna sip studies assess active microbial population within a microbial community based on water availability unlike carbon and nitrogen that are linked to specific metabolic processes all microorganisms ubiquitously require and utilize water for growth thus the stable isotope of hydrogen i e 2h deuterium or oxygen i e 18o within h2o can be applied to assess all active microbes this concept has inspired researchers to apply 18o h2o dna sip to identify toluene degraders woods et al 2011 and to assess rapid responding microbial populations followed of soil rewetting after significant drought aanderud and lennon 2011 a recent 18o h2o dna sip study reported that moisture contents in soils shaped active microbial composition through potential increase of osmotic regulatory and transport pertaining genes with the implementation of metagenomics dai et al 2021 furthermore using deuterated water i e d2o 2h h2o along with raman microspectroscopy berry et al 2015 i e sc sip and metaproteomics had identify and differentiate active groundwater microbes that were capable of degrading veratric acid or methylamine taubert et al 2018 iv 33 34s labeled sip studies were mainly for proteomic studies while sulfur is an essential nutrient the requirement for sulfur is much lower compared to that for carbon or nitrogen during microbial assimilation processes as no sulfur is present in nucleotides applications of isotopically labeled sulfur i e 33 34s in dna sip or rna sip are not possible yet 34s has been used to evaluate proteomic shifts in pseudomonas fluorescens during naphthalene oxidation suggesting that naphthalene might exert oxidative stress responses during the degradation herbst et al 2013 sip studies with dual or multiple isotopically labeled compounds decipher guild structures with unique degradation abilities in the microbiome few recent studies have applied dna sip with a compound containing single or multiple isotopes with different labeling profiles based on labeling positions and types of stable isotopes within a compound in contaminant biodegradation fig 3 ggood examples are dna sip studies on biodegradation of rdx a widely used cyclic nitramine based munition since world war ii rdx is toxic and commonly detected in groundwater and soil near munition manufacturing facilities hand grenade ranges antitank rocket ranges bombing ranges artillery ranges munitions testing sites explosives washout lagoons demolition areas and open burn open detonation sites rdx contains six nitrogen atoms with three in its c n ring and other three in the nitro functional groups attached on the ring to decipher the guild of microbes capable of using nitrogen or carbon from rdx 15n nitro ring fully labeled rdx or 13c labeled rdx were applied in dna sip studies using rdx contaminated aquifer materials cho et al 2016 2015 different guild of microbes capable of utilizing the nitrogen from the ring and the nitro groups or both for growth were identified and previously unknown guild of microbes capable of using rdx as carbon sources were observed by comparing the guild of microbes it was possible to decipher degraders with the ability to use rdx as both carbon and nitrogen sources resulting in new knowledge for developing effective rdx bioremediation in the future cho et al 2015 application of co labeling i e using a combination of 13c and 15n isotopes in a single compound like glyphosate fig 3 has led to identification guilds of microbes capable of assimilating glyphosate as carbon and or nitrogen source and their relative contributions to the degradation of the respective labeled nutrients through metabolite analysis wang et al 2016 this approach has led to discoveries of speciation of non extractable glyphosate metabolites and its degradation capability as both carbon and nitrogen source within environmental systems in a very recent sc sip study based on nanosims 33s sulfate was applied along with 13c acetate and 15n ammonium to enable identification of spatial distribution of certain groups of microbes mainly to gamma and deltaproteobacteria in biofilm due to assimilation of differernt isotopes i e 33s 13c 15n dawson et al 2016 also as described previously coupling 18o h2o with 13c labeled compounds and qpcr a quantitative sip qsip was powerful in assessing different stable isotope assimilation rates of taxa specific groups in soil microcosms hungate et al 2015 technical considerations in sip based studies the abundance and diversity of individual microorganisms within a community are subjected to evolve and change over time which is in part due to the various microbial interactions and interactions with their surrounding environment five different microbial interactions competition commensalism syntrophy predation amensalism and no interaction occur constantly in natural environment on the top of these interactions the geochemical properties available nutrients and or other physical constituents in their surrounding environment can also serve as stimuli and stressors that further modulate the structure and function of the microbial community thus these aspects ecological interactions and the overall responses to environmental stresses and stimuli need to be carefully considered during sip experimental design and data interpretation since non targeted microbes might be labeled due to different incubation periods quantities of the labeled substrate applied and characteristics of the target microbes whiteley et al 2006 i factors affecting data interpretation of sip based studies several factors including cross feeding mooshammer et al 2021 g c content cadisch et al 2005 cupples et al 2007 lueders et al 2004 and degree of isotope enrichment neufeld et al 2007 can result in bias in sip data and interpretation while several sip based protocols are available there are no standardized sip experimental designs to tackle various scientific questions in biodegradation of a wide range of environmental contaminants as environmental contaminants are typically multi carbon compounds with various degradation potential under different experimental and or environmental conditions it is also important to consider the number location and type of isotopes in the labeled compounds to be used in a sip biodegradation study and scientific questions to be answered studies using single or multiple 13c in a multi carbon substrate have brought new insights into microbial community and function in various environments that were previously poorly understood yet unlike 13c one carbon substrates such as methane or methanol using single or multiple 13c in a multi carbon substrate can further complicate the interpretation of sip experimental data often leading to different conclusions due to difference in the labeled positions this is because microbes degrade compounds via specific degradation pathways such that the differences in the bioavailability of certain positions of the labeled atoms within the compound would lead to identify different microbial populations for example certain dioxygenases attack c 1 and c 2 positions and others attack c 2 and c 3 positions of phenanthrene chemerys et al 2014 peng et al 2008 thus using phenanthrene labeled at c1 and c2 generated different microbial community derived from using phenanthrene labeled at c2 and c3 positions findings of a sip study using 13c3 4 e2 zhang et al 2021a were supported by a previous study reporting that e2 degradation was preferred over the c 3 and c 4 positions chen et al 2017 as the structure of contaminants being investigated becomes more complex over years how and where and types of stable isotopes were labeled in such compounds from probing based experiments would be important stable isotope positions would highly relate to tracking the fate of stable isotopes in specific biodegradation pathways and ultimately help deduce their efficacy in similar analogue degradation research addition of multi substrates with varying labeled substrates enables researchers to track the assimilation of distinct carbon sources based on varying bioavailability and identify the diverse and complicated dynamics of soil microbial communities including the assimilation degradation and as well as their microbial niches barnett et al 2021 verastegui et al 2014 ii cross feeding scenarios in sip based studies cross feeding conventionally defined as labeling non target microbes is a limitation commonly raised in sip studies dumont et al 2011 mooshammer et al 2021 wang et al 2020b such undesired labeling events could be minimized but might not be able to be completely avoided both degradation metabolites and multiple cellular components can be labeled during the degradation of a labeled substrate these labeled metabolites and cellular components become the secondary labeling sources that can be utilized and subsequently integrated into the cellular components of non target microbes as incubation time increased this phenomenon can be insignificant or pronounced depending on the characteristics of target microbes in the sip experimental design the characteristics of the target microbes through interactions with non target microbes can potentially affect the types and extent of non target microbes were potentially being labeled over the course of sip experiments leading to observation of different microbial community structures considering the following two scenarios as shown in fig 5 scenario 1 target microbes shown as red microbes secrete little or no labeled products during the growth of labeled substate scenario 2 target microbes shown as blue microbes secrete significant amount of labeled extracellular products during the growth under scenario 1 non target microbes are less likely to be labeled during the short term incubation however long term incubation will lead to labeling non target microbes due to possibility of the uptake from debris of dead target microbes under scenario 2 if the target microbes secrete significant amounts of labeled metabolites and or extracellular products labeling non target microbes is very likely even though a short term incubation is used microbial interactions particularly commensalism syntrophy and cooperation can intensify the extent of labeling non target microbes leading to different microbial community structures that comprise of both target and non target microbes yet the amount of the initial stable isotope potentially passed to other microbes remains an interesting but unanswered scientific question as the process might be highly depending on the extracellular labeled products exchange between target and non target microbes over time iii efforts for minimizing cross feeding in sip based studies a recent sc sip with sims could potentially minimize cross feeding effects wilhelm et al 2018 interestingly the cross feeding effects have been used to understand bacterial predation hungate et al 2021 to minimize cross feeding interference in sip experiments a recent study used a continuously flow through model that allows medium with isotopic nutrients to pass through a membrane retaining bacterial cells which take away secondary metabolites that can be utilized by non target microbes mooshammer et al 2021 however this approach has two limitations firstly the cost of isotopes such as 13c in nahco3 may be prohibitive for other isotopically labeled compounds or contaminants of interest second the response of microbes living on the membrane may be different from those forming flocs and growing in activated sludge despite these limitations they do offer a possible way to minimize the effect of cross feeding in sip experiments for biodegradation of contaminants in the environment the focus of cross feeding can be potentially shifted to understanding the whole active microbial community that could achieve complete biomineralization of the targeted contaminants iv degree of isotope enrichment dosage and incubation time the degree of isotope enrichment can also cause bias in sip data either underestimate due to sensitive issue or overestimate due to cross feeding or excess production of extracellular labeled compounds such as smp and eps supplying sufficient dosage of labeled substrate to ensure detectable labeled metabolites and cellular components is another consideration when implementing sip studies while high and frequent dosages of labeled compounds might improve the sensitivity of labeled metabolites and cellular components it can also lead to a high degree of labeling non target microbes yet a sufficient dosage is necessary to result in efficient labeling for fractionation used in follow up analysis unlike the factors discussed above incubation time is a controllable parameter in sip experimental designs for example insufficient labeling may be due to a short incubation time or possible cross feeding in the microbial communities due to long incubation time a few researchers have already provided some general approaches to ensure sufficient labeling and the appropriate sampling time points yet it remains challenging and impractical to establish a standardized protocol for sip studies due to the high variations of contaminant types environmental metrices and characteristics of the target microorganisms in the degradation experiments that were performed uhlik et al 2013a whiteley et al 2006 prior research has considered using a short incubation time to minimize non target labeling that could occur through microbial interactions whiteley et al 2006 for multi carbon substrates degradation studies time course experiments along with metabolite analysis are necessary to guide the ideal sampling time when most of the labeled substrates were potentially integrated into the dna of active degraders however the most ideal state for sampling is also highly depending on the objective of the intended studies either to identify the primary degraders responsible for the initial step of contaminant degradation or to determine guild of microbes capable of assimilating the isotopes at a specific position of the substrate or to understand the overall microbial community required for complete biomineralization of a contaminant with a complex structure future research priorities and trend i is sip suitable for studying co metabolic biodegradation of contaminants the sip based technology is a method built on the assimilation of isotopically labeled nutrients into various labeled biomarkers such as dna rna proteins and lipids accordingly previous sip based studies have been exclusively applied to study biodegradation of contaminants that can be metabolized by microorganisms through assimilation growth linked mechanisms however many environmental contaminants cannot be degraded via growth linked mechanisms but only via non growth linked mechanisms also known as co metabolism in co metabolic reactions microorganisms use enzymes that are produced to degrade their primary substrates i e growth substrates to degrade contaminants i e co metabolic substrates however degradation of co metabolic substrates generates no growth benefits such as energy source or as carbon nitrogen or sulfur source to microbes fig 4 the phenomenon was first reported in the early 1950s the definitive studies reported that a methane oxidizing bacterium pseudomonas methanica now known as methylomonas methanica was able to oxidize ethane but not able to utilize it as its sole carbon and energy source leadbetter and foster 1958 1959 1960 in 1985 wilson and wilson reported co metabolic biodegradation of trichloroethylene tce by methane monooxygenase expressing methane oxidizing bacteria in soil wilson and wilson 1985 since then many oxygenase expressing microorganisms have been known to co metabolically degrade many other chlorinated compounds semprini 1997 wang and chu 2017 and emerging contaminants hand et al 2015 tran et al 2013 including fluorotelomer alcohols and fluorotelomer based compounds kim et al 2012 lewis et al 2016 yang et al 2022 unlike growth linked degradation mechanisms of contaminants co metabolic degradation of contaminants can be achieved at extremely low concentration of emerging contaminants such as in ppb parts per billion or even ppt parts per trillion levels while researchers have applied dna sip to target on assimilatory reactions in the degradative microbes using primary substrate applications of sip to identify microbes capable of performing co metabolic i e non growth linked degradation on those interested contaminants has not been realized until recently shao et al 2019 in this recent dna sip study with 13ch4 as primary growth substrate shao and co researchers reported previously unknown active acidophilic methanotrophs in acidic groundwater ph 5 5 microcosms capable of cometabolizing trichloroethene tce and vinyl chloride but not cis dichloroethenecis cdce as neutralophilic methanotrophs have been known to express methane monooxygenase mmo soluble and or particulate mmo to oxidize methane and the expressed mmo are also responsible for co metabolic biotransformation of various chlorinated solvents hwangbo et al 2023 oldenhuis et al 1989 it was interesting to detect novel and diverse particulate mmo and soluble mmo in the acidophilic methanotrophs shao et al 2019 under this premise it comes of great importance in identifying and characterizing microbes and specific enzymes that co metabolically degrade emerging contaminants in complex microbial communities this first application of dna sip in co metabolic biodegradation of chlorinated solvents not only successfully demonstrated the power of sip but also suggested the importance to push forward the application of sip for studying co metabolic biodegradation of contaminants only few bacteria species are recently known to co metabolically degrade fluorotelomer based pfas such as pseudomonas oleovorans pseudomonas butanovora and mycobacterium vaccae job5 kim et al 2014 rhodococcus jostii rha1 yang et al 2022 gordonia nb4 1y shaw et al 2019 and dietzia aurantiaca j3 méndez et al 2022 while the mentioned approach is in its early stage similar approach can be applied along with other advanced techniques i e multi omics qsip sc sip etc to identify active microorganisms that are responsible for co metabolic degradation of other contaminants within mixed microbial communities ii integration of sip with advanced techniques sip based studies have adapted multi omics such as metagenomics chen and murrell 2010 transcriptomics nuccio et al 2021 proteomics von bergen et al 2013 and metabolomics birkemeyer et al 2005 hassanpour and aristilde 2021 hou et al 2021 tsugawa et al 2019 wilhelm et al 2022 to better understand microbial structure and function in the context of various environments while tracking potential key role players through sip however only few types of labeled contaminants have been used in biodegradation studies that couples sip and multi omics bradford et al 2018 hou et al 2021 uhlik et al 2013b vasileiadis et al 2022 future research using qsip and sc sip with various types of labeled contaminants is needed to assist assessment of in situ degradation kinetics that are particularly useful for formulating effective treatment and management strategies for biodegradation or bioremediation of contaminants at sites furthermore recent development of high throughput sip ht sip operational pipelines nuccio et al 2022 and simulation of metagenomic sip datasets barnett and buckley 2020 could be helpful in minimizing errors and labor from conventional sip based studies meanwhile the processed large data sets are significantly helpful in identifying and isolating distinct active contaminant degraders from complex microbial communities leading to a better understanding on the key players in degradation processes while recent applications of sip techniques to study contaminant biodegradation are increasing sip based studies are still limited by the commercially available labeled substrates and or by the high price of custom made label substrates this challenge was partially addressed by a study using magnetic nanoparticles mnp to assist isolation of active phenol degraders and compared to those identified through dna sip application of 13c labeleld phenol zhang et al 2015 subsequent applications of mnp with sip and cell sorting techniques have been reported to identify active acetonitrile degraders sun et al 2021 and phenanthrene degraders li et al 2018 2022 yet as magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles have been shown toxicity to microbes manke et al 2013 this aspect needs to be thoroughly investigated to determine whether mnp can truly capture the targeted metabolically active microbes under various environmental conditions despite these limitations the use of mnp itself for isolation of active degraders has advantages of being non destructive and not requiring labeled substrates which might not be readily available iii translation of sip findings for environmental remediation of contaminants results of sip studies have provided fundamental knowledge on the identities of metabolic active microbes and their roles in degrading environmental contaminants one immediate translation of sip findings is to identify unique species or signature microbial community structures as biomarkers which can be used to monitor the progress and success of active bioremediation processes or to assess the potential of natural attenuation also sip findings can lead to the identification of unique and effective contaminant degraders and degradative enzymes that are present at sites for example previous sip studies using 13c phenanthrene or 13c pyrene have identified and characterized novel polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dioxygenases from the labeled metagenomic bacterial dna from contaminated soils chemerys et al 2014 li et al 2017 singleton et al 2012 the sip findings can also guide the design of biostimulation and bioaugmentation efforts or assist on the enrichment and isolation of degraders that can be used to study degradation pathways and identification of degradative enzymes conclusions over the past few decades sip based technologies integrated along with multi omics and spectroscopy techniques allowed researchers to gain a better understanding of the identity and roles of microorganisms in numerous microbial mediated processes within natural and engineered environments mnp assisted sip could potentially offer an alternative to address the challenges of the availability of labeled compounds yet applications of mnp assisted sip might not be readily applicable in studying microorganisms that are sensitive to the toxicity of nanoparticles while results of sip based studies may over or under estimate the diversity of target microbial populations sip studies coupled with new techniques has been continuously developed over the past decades to provide a better picture of the complexity of the microbial ecosystem during the contaminant biodegradation yet many challenges still exist due to the complexity of microbial systems co metabolism mechanisms and availability of isotopically labeled compounds future direction should still focus on elucidating microbial identities gene functions and the complicated microorganism chemical compound interactions furthermore future research efforts need to be placed on how to capitalize the knowledge derived from sip studies to facilitate bioremediation applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments this work was partially supported by strategic environmental research and development program serdp

19889,stable isotope probing sip is a powerful tool to study microbial community structure and function in both nature and engineered environments coupling with advanced genomics and other techniques sip studies have generated substantial information to allow researchers to draw a clearer picture of what is occurring in complex microbial ecosystems this review provides an overview of the advances of sip based technologies over time summarizes the status of sip applications to contaminant biodegradation provides critical perspectives on ecological interactions within the community and important factors controllable and non controllable to be considered in sip experimental designs and data interpretation current trend and perspectives of adapting sip techniques for environmental applications are also discussed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stable isotope probing sip biodegradation co metabolism rdx data availability data will be made available on request introduction in natural and engineered environments microorganisms live together within communities where they interact with each other through competition mutualism amensalism commensalism predation and sometimes with no interaction microorganisms within the communities also respond to stressors and stimuli in their surrounding environment resulting in dynamic microbial community structure and functions which are assembled through two mechanisms deterministic i e natural selection or stochastic i e random dispersion cell growth cell death immigration and speciation pholchan et al 2013 faust and raes 2012 while information of 16s rrna genes rna genes and amino acid sequences have provided a better understanding of microbial community structures or functions or implicated ecological functions within engineering and natural systems hugerth and andersson 2017 venkataraman et al 2015 wang et al 2013 2009 the linkages between the structure and their function were challenging and difficult aitchison 1982 gloor et al 2017 until the applications of stable isotope probing sip techniques the concept of using stable isotopes to study microbial function can be dated back many decades ago in 1958 meselson and stahl reported the first study of using 15n labeled nitrogen to validate the hypothesis of the semi conservative dna replication rule meselson and stahl 1958 yet the application of stable isotopes to link microbial function to metabolically active microorganisms was realized much later in 2000 radajeweski and co workers reported the first study using 13c labeled methanol and or methane to identify the presence and diversity of methylotrophic populations in natural environments based on dna based sip colin murrell and radajewski 2000 morris et al 2002 radajewski et al 2000 through dna based sip researchers can track the flow of the isotopes in the labeled compound to the microbial cellular components such as dna in the metabolically active microbes within a complex community after separation of the labeled dnas from non labeled dnas through concentration gradient ultracentrifugation labeled dnas contributed from the metabolically active microbes are then sequenced and then used to identify the active microbes years later dna based sip with 13c labeled multi carbon substrates such as glucose phenol caffeine and naphthalene jeon et al 2003 padmanabhan et al 2003 yu and chu 2005 and with 15n labeled explosive roh et al 2009 were applied to identify active contaminant degraders in soil wastewater treatment and groundwater aquifer sediments recent applications of dna based sip to understand biodegradation of various priority and emerging contaminants are summarized and discussed in the section of sip applications with different isotopically labeled compounds below meanwhile researchers explored sip with different biomarkers such as rna proteins lipids and metabolites to probe unknown metabolic reactions unique microbial functions and to explore unknown interactions of active microbial populations at varying levels kruse et al 2013 manefield et al 2002 tsugawa et al 2019 von bergen et al 2013 based on the choice of biomarkers sip based techniques have been designated as dna sip radajewski et al 2000 rna sip fortunato and huber 2016 manefield et al 2002 fatty acid methyl esters fame sip lerch et al 2009 2007 or protein sip jehmlich et al 2008 the above sip based technologies also coupled with advanced multi omics such as metagenomics chen and murrell 2010 transcriptomics nuccio et al 2021 proteomics von bergen et al 2013 and metabolomics birkemeyer et al 2005 hassanpour and aristilde 2021 hou et al 2021 tsugawa et al 2019 wilhelm et al 2022 advancing our understanding of microbial structure and function in various environments sip with fluorescence in situ hybridization fish huang et al 2007 orphan et al 2001 2002 has been utilized but it is time consuming this drawback is overcome by chip sip mayali et al 2012 2019 which enables high throughput processing of labeled rrna gene sequences by using rna microarrays more recently sip has been coupled with multiple advanced techniques including meta omics raman microspectroscopy or nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry nanosims collectively referred to as single cell sip sc sip raman microspectroscopy can directly reveal the biochemical fingerprints of a single cell without labeling and nanosims can create nanoscale maps of element or isotope distribution of a sample thus when integrating these techniques to track isotopic signals in a single cell the sc sip becomes a powerful non destructive method in studying microbial ecology particularly for a better understanding of spatial variations of cellular metabolism phenotypic heterogeneity and cellular interactions such as syntrophy or cross feeding within a complex community berry et al 2015 chen and murrell 2010 lee et al 2021 wagner 2009 excellent reviews on sc sip techniques are currently available elsewhere alcolombri et al 2022 hatzenpichler et al 2020 to quantify the variations of the growth of functional microbes in a complex community a quantitative sip called qsip was developed by integrating 18o h2o and a 13c labeled substrate and quantitative pcr qpcr and metagenomics based on 16s rrna genes hungate et al 2015 particularly qsip has been demonstrated to be powerful in quantifying taxon specific substrate assimilation rate or flux variations by glucose utilizing microorganisms in soil samples hungate et al 2015 subsequently qsip has been applied to study various research topics including legacy carbon turnover in soil soil bacteria involved in assimilation of fertilizer nitrogen and soil carbon litter decomposition in freshwater and pah degradation coskun et al 2018 dong et al 2022 hayer et al 2016 hungate et al 2015 sieradzki et al 2021 fig 1 briefly illustrates timeline of the advances of sip based technologies with different biomarkers and advanced technologies a comparison of selected key sip based technologies is briefly summarized in table 1 excellent reviews on those key sip based technologies and their applications to public health and host microbe interactions are available berry and loy 2018 berry et al 2013 bruntz et al 2017 the advantage and disadvantage over the choice of different labeled biomarkers such as plfa phospholipid derived fatty acid rna dna in sip microbial ecology studies has been discussed in previous reviews manefield et al 2004 neufeld et al 2007 however many ecological aspects and technical issues that commonly complicate sip application and data interpretation are rarely discussed to this end this review discusses various ecological aspects and technical issues of sip with a focus on biodegradation and bioremediation of environmental contaminants mostly factors such as variation of catabolic mechanisms and key technical aspects that are frequently overlooked and consideration in interpreting data obtained from sip based studies for contaminant degradation processes are also reviewed current trends and perspective of adapting sip techniques for studying co metabolic biodegradation of environmental contaminants and their environmental applications are also identified and discussed growth linked mechanisms are the key in labeling metabolites and cellular components of metabolically active microbes when a labeled substrate is degraded inside metabolically active microorganisms relying on the growth linked mechanisms of the microbes the flow of isotopically labeled atoms in the substrate is first converted to labeled metabolites which are further degraded or incorporated into a wide range of internal cellular components in the metabolically active microorganisms with some secreted extracellularly fig 2 each of the labeled metabolites and cellular components such as dna and rna fatty acids and lipids in cell membranes intracellular and extracellular proteins and secreted materials such as soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps can be tracked individually or combined to investigate previously unknown microbial taxonomy and functions jehmlich et al 2016 kruse et al 2013 wang et al 2015 xiao et al 2022 biomarker dna has been the simplest means to identify microbial taxa that linked to the metabolic active microbes while characterization of the biomarker rna provides direct link of microbes that are specifically active to certain trophic environments dumont et al 2013 fortunato and huber 2016 radajewski et al 2000 profiling of labeled proteins particularly enzymes involved in biodegradation of contaminants allows identification of amino acid sequences of the units that directly responsible for the microbial functions jehmlich et al 2008 characterization of the assimilated fame could fingerprint active microbial community compositions evershed et al 2006 and the assimilated smp or eps could be used as substrates to evaluate the utilization of metabolic products by other bacteria wang et al 2015 xiao et al 2022 tracking the flux of the labeled metabolites have provided valuable insights of a specific metabolic network in biological systems such as plants and the new insights have been used to guide design in metabolic engineering biotechnology and microbiology birkemeyer et al 2005 fan et al 2012 tsugawa et al 2019 recently by tracking labeled metabolites i e sip metabolomics derived from 13c glucose that was spiked into oxic or anoxic soil 13c enrichment dynamics of metabolites under different redox conditions were revealed hassanpour and aristilde 2021 by tracking 13c from nine isotopically labeled carbon sources into the water soluble soil metabolite pool over 48 days researcher observed that the type of carbon source amended into the soils caused the production of different metabolites and that the fate of the carbon in the metabolites in soils were not controlled by time but due to their differences enhancing our understanding of soil carbon cycling wilhelm et al 2022 however unlike common carbon source compounds studies using certain extracellular products such as smp and eps as biomarkers are challenging and such applications have not been reported to our best knowledge while a vast amount of information pertaining to biological activity can be inferred from the labeled cellular components such as rna proteins lipids mapping such information back to the taxonomy of the associated microbes in the community remain very challenging and often impossible accordingly evaluating dna with assimilated stable isotopes i e dna sip remains as the simplest and most straight forward approach to identify active microbial community in complex environmental matrices the following sections describe the advances of dna based sip to environmental science and engineering sip studies with different isotopically labeled compounds i e 13c 15n 2h 18o 33 34s allow for interrogating various microbial meditated processes in the environment i 13c dna sip studies have been expanded from using c1 to multi carbon substrates 13c labeled substrates are the most frequently used in sip studies as carbon is an energy and or carbon source required for microbial growth since the pioneer microbial ecology work of using 13c labeled methanol and methane to identify active methylotrophic populations in soil morris et al 2002 radajewski et al 2000 the 13c dna sip technique has been quickly adapted to study biodegradation and bioremediation of many environment contaminants including 13c labeled multi carbon aliphatics and aromatics suh as ethane propane n hexadecane polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene methyl tert butyl ether bisphenol a triclosan pesticides estrogen synthetic lignin organic solvents and stabilizers bao et al 2022 cupples 2016 dang and cupples 2021 farhan ul haque et al 2022 hu et al 2021 jiang et al 2018 kasanke et al 2019 lee et al 2014 levy booth et al 2022 liu et al 2019 sathyamoorthy et al 2018 sun et al 2022 thomas et al 2019 wilhelm et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a recently 13c labeled acetate or carbonate has been used to better understand the identities of microbes involved in denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox bellini et al 2017 xing et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b or enhanced biological phosphorus removal processes guo et al 2018 wang et al 2020a using partially labeled 17β estradiol 13c3 4 e2 have shown to identify distinct e2 assimilating bacterial species compared to its non labeled counterpart 12c e2 zhang et al 2021a yet sip studies are typically limited by the high cost of labeled contaminants and the availability of labeled contaminants with desired labeling locations and numbers ii 15n dna sip studies identify microbes using nitrogen containing pollutants as nitrogen source nitrogen stable isotope 15n is the next most frequently used stable isotope in dna sip to study biodegradation of nitrogen containing pollutants such as hexahydro 1 3 5 trinitro 1 3 5 triazine rdx a nitroamide explosive ariyarathna et al 2019 cho et al 2016 2015 roh et al 2009 polyhexamethylene biguanide phmb a nitrogenous disinfectant and antibiotic o malley et al 2007 and atrazine a herbicide shaffer et al 2010 these studies identified microbes capable of using the contaminants as their sole nitrogen source an interesting approach was to use 15n nh4h2po4 as a sole nitrogen source to label active hydrocarbon degrading degraders in microcosms since active hydrocarbon degraders also required 15n as nitrogen source when utilizing hydrocarbon for growth bell et al 2011 by using 15n dna sip in partial nitrification anammox processes autotrophic denitrification via anammox pathway was found dominant in ammonia rich wastewater and symbiotic relationships among anammox bacteria anaerolineae proteobacteria and planctomycetacia during the nitrogen conversion were revealed li et al 2019 iii 2h h2o or 18o h2o dna sip studies assess active microbial population within a microbial community based on water availability unlike carbon and nitrogen that are linked to specific metabolic processes all microorganisms ubiquitously require and utilize water for growth thus the stable isotope of hydrogen i e 2h deuterium or oxygen i e 18o within h2o can be applied to assess all active microbes this concept has inspired researchers to apply 18o h2o dna sip to identify toluene degraders woods et al 2011 and to assess rapid responding microbial populations followed of soil rewetting after significant drought aanderud and lennon 2011 a recent 18o h2o dna sip study reported that moisture contents in soils shaped active microbial composition through potential increase of osmotic regulatory and transport pertaining genes with the implementation of metagenomics dai et al 2021 furthermore using deuterated water i e d2o 2h h2o along with raman microspectroscopy berry et al 2015 i e sc sip and metaproteomics had identify and differentiate active groundwater microbes that were capable of degrading veratric acid or methylamine taubert et al 2018 iv 33 34s labeled sip studies were mainly for proteomic studies while sulfur is an essential nutrient the requirement for sulfur is much lower compared to that for carbon or nitrogen during microbial assimilation processes as no sulfur is present in nucleotides applications of isotopically labeled sulfur i e 33 34s in dna sip or rna sip are not possible yet 34s has been used to evaluate proteomic shifts in pseudomonas fluorescens during naphthalene oxidation suggesting that naphthalene might exert oxidative stress responses during the degradation herbst et al 2013 sip studies with dual or multiple isotopically labeled compounds decipher guild structures with unique degradation abilities in the microbiome few recent studies have applied dna sip with a compound containing single or multiple isotopes with different labeling profiles based on labeling positions and types of stable isotopes within a compound in contaminant biodegradation fig 3 ggood examples are dna sip studies on biodegradation of rdx a widely used cyclic nitramine based munition since world war ii rdx is toxic and commonly detected in groundwater and soil near munition manufacturing facilities hand grenade ranges antitank rocket ranges bombing ranges artillery ranges munitions testing sites explosives washout lagoons demolition areas and open burn open detonation sites rdx contains six nitrogen atoms with three in its c n ring and other three in the nitro functional groups attached on the ring to decipher the guild of microbes capable of using nitrogen or carbon from rdx 15n nitro ring fully labeled rdx or 13c labeled rdx were applied in dna sip studies using rdx contaminated aquifer materials cho et al 2016 2015 different guild of microbes capable of utilizing the nitrogen from the ring and the nitro groups or both for growth were identified and previously unknown guild of microbes capable of using rdx as carbon sources were observed by comparing the guild of microbes it was possible to decipher degraders with the ability to use rdx as both carbon and nitrogen sources resulting in new knowledge for developing effective rdx bioremediation in the future cho et al 2015 application of co labeling i e using a combination of 13c and 15n isotopes in a single compound like glyphosate fig 3 has led to identification guilds of microbes capable of assimilating glyphosate as carbon and or nitrogen source and their relative contributions to the degradation of the respective labeled nutrients through metabolite analysis wang et al 2016 this approach has led to discoveries of speciation of non extractable glyphosate metabolites and its degradation capability as both carbon and nitrogen source within environmental systems in a very recent sc sip study based on nanosims 33s sulfate was applied along with 13c acetate and 15n ammonium to enable identification of spatial distribution of certain groups of microbes mainly to gamma and deltaproteobacteria in biofilm due to assimilation of differernt isotopes i e 33s 13c 15n dawson et al 2016 also as described previously coupling 18o h2o with 13c labeled compounds and qpcr a quantitative sip qsip was powerful in assessing different stable isotope assimilation rates of taxa specific groups in soil microcosms hungate et al 2015 technical considerations in sip based studies the abundance and diversity of individual microorganisms within a community are subjected to evolve and change over time which is in part due to the various microbial interactions and interactions with their surrounding environment five different microbial interactions competition commensalism syntrophy predation amensalism and no interaction occur constantly in natural environment on the top of these interactions the geochemical properties available nutrients and or other physical constituents in their surrounding environment can also serve as stimuli and stressors that further modulate the structure and function of the microbial community thus these aspects ecological interactions and the overall responses to environmental stresses and stimuli need to be carefully considered during sip experimental design and data interpretation since non targeted microbes might be labeled due to different incubation periods quantities of the labeled substrate applied and characteristics of the target microbes whiteley et al 2006 i factors affecting data interpretation of sip based studies several factors including cross feeding mooshammer et al 2021 g c content cadisch et al 2005 cupples et al 2007 lueders et al 2004 and degree of isotope enrichment neufeld et al 2007 can result in bias in sip data and interpretation while several sip based protocols are available there are no standardized sip experimental designs to tackle various scientific questions in biodegradation of a wide range of environmental contaminants as environmental contaminants are typically multi carbon compounds with various degradation potential under different experimental and or environmental conditions it is also important to consider the number location and type of isotopes in the labeled compounds to be used in a sip biodegradation study and scientific questions to be answered studies using single or multiple 13c in a multi carbon substrate have brought new insights into microbial community and function in various environments that were previously poorly understood yet unlike 13c one carbon substrates such as methane or methanol using single or multiple 13c in a multi carbon substrate can further complicate the interpretation of sip experimental data often leading to different conclusions due to difference in the labeled positions this is because microbes degrade compounds via specific degradation pathways such that the differences in the bioavailability of certain positions of the labeled atoms within the compound would lead to identify different microbial populations for example certain dioxygenases attack c 1 and c 2 positions and others attack c 2 and c 3 positions of phenanthrene chemerys et al 2014 peng et al 2008 thus using phenanthrene labeled at c1 and c2 generated different microbial community derived from using phenanthrene labeled at c2 and c3 positions findings of a sip study using 13c3 4 e2 zhang et al 2021a were supported by a previous study reporting that e2 degradation was preferred over the c 3 and c 4 positions chen et al 2017 as the structure of contaminants being investigated becomes more complex over years how and where and types of stable isotopes were labeled in such compounds from probing based experiments would be important stable isotope positions would highly relate to tracking the fate of stable isotopes in specific biodegradation pathways and ultimately help deduce their efficacy in similar analogue degradation research addition of multi substrates with varying labeled substrates enables researchers to track the assimilation of distinct carbon sources based on varying bioavailability and identify the diverse and complicated dynamics of soil microbial communities including the assimilation degradation and as well as their microbial niches barnett et al 2021 verastegui et al 2014 ii cross feeding scenarios in sip based studies cross feeding conventionally defined as labeling non target microbes is a limitation commonly raised in sip studies dumont et al 2011 mooshammer et al 2021 wang et al 2020b such undesired labeling events could be minimized but might not be able to be completely avoided both degradation metabolites and multiple cellular components can be labeled during the degradation of a labeled substrate these labeled metabolites and cellular components become the secondary labeling sources that can be utilized and subsequently integrated into the cellular components of non target microbes as incubation time increased this phenomenon can be insignificant or pronounced depending on the characteristics of target microbes in the sip experimental design the characteristics of the target microbes through interactions with non target microbes can potentially affect the types and extent of non target microbes were potentially being labeled over the course of sip experiments leading to observation of different microbial community structures considering the following two scenarios as shown in fig 5 scenario 1 target microbes shown as red microbes secrete little or no labeled products during the growth of labeled substate scenario 2 target microbes shown as blue microbes secrete significant amount of labeled extracellular products during the growth under scenario 1 non target microbes are less likely to be labeled during the short term incubation however long term incubation will lead to labeling non target microbes due to possibility of the uptake from debris of dead target microbes under scenario 2 if the target microbes secrete significant amounts of labeled metabolites and or extracellular products labeling non target microbes is very likely even though a short term incubation is used microbial interactions particularly commensalism syntrophy and cooperation can intensify the extent of labeling non target microbes leading to different microbial community structures that comprise of both target and non target microbes yet the amount of the initial stable isotope potentially passed to other microbes remains an interesting but unanswered scientific question as the process might be highly depending on the extracellular labeled products exchange between target and non target microbes over time iii efforts for minimizing cross feeding in sip based studies a recent sc sip with sims could potentially minimize cross feeding effects wilhelm et al 2018 interestingly the cross feeding effects have been used to understand bacterial predation hungate et al 2021 to minimize cross feeding interference in sip experiments a recent study used a continuously flow through model that allows medium with isotopic nutrients to pass through a membrane retaining bacterial cells which take away secondary metabolites that can be utilized by non target microbes mooshammer et al 2021 however this approach has two limitations firstly the cost of isotopes such as 13c in nahco3 may be prohibitive for other isotopically labeled compounds or contaminants of interest second the response of microbes living on the membrane may be different from those forming flocs and growing in activated sludge despite these limitations they do offer a possible way to minimize the effect of cross feeding in sip experiments for biodegradation of contaminants in the environment the focus of cross feeding can be potentially shifted to understanding the whole active microbial community that could achieve complete biomineralization of the targeted contaminants iv degree of isotope enrichment dosage and incubation time the degree of isotope enrichment can also cause bias in sip data either underestimate due to sensitive issue or overestimate due to cross feeding or excess production of extracellular labeled compounds such as smp and eps supplying sufficient dosage of labeled substrate to ensure detectable labeled metabolites and cellular components is another consideration when implementing sip studies while high and frequent dosages of labeled compounds might improve the sensitivity of labeled metabolites and cellular components it can also lead to a high degree of labeling non target microbes yet a sufficient dosage is necessary to result in efficient labeling for fractionation used in follow up analysis unlike the factors discussed above incubation time is a controllable parameter in sip experimental designs for example insufficient labeling may be due to a short incubation time or possible cross feeding in the microbial communities due to long incubation time a few researchers have already provided some general approaches to ensure sufficient labeling and the appropriate sampling time points yet it remains challenging and impractical to establish a standardized protocol for sip studies due to the high variations of contaminant types environmental metrices and characteristics of the target microorganisms in the degradation experiments that were performed uhlik et al 2013a whiteley et al 2006 prior research has considered using a short incubation time to minimize non target labeling that could occur through microbial interactions whiteley et al 2006 for multi carbon substrates degradation studies time course experiments along with metabolite analysis are necessary to guide the ideal sampling time when most of the labeled substrates were potentially integrated into the dna of active degraders however the most ideal state for sampling is also highly depending on the objective of the intended studies either to identify the primary degraders responsible for the initial step of contaminant degradation or to determine guild of microbes capable of assimilating the isotopes at a specific position of the substrate or to understand the overall microbial community required for complete biomineralization of a contaminant with a complex structure future research priorities and trend i is sip suitable for studying co metabolic biodegradation of contaminants the sip based technology is a method built on the assimilation of isotopically labeled nutrients into various labeled biomarkers such as dna rna proteins and lipids accordingly previous sip based studies have been exclusively applied to study biodegradation of contaminants that can be metabolized by microorganisms through assimilation growth linked mechanisms however many environmental contaminants cannot be degraded via growth linked mechanisms but only via non growth linked mechanisms also known as co metabolism in co metabolic reactions microorganisms use enzymes that are produced to degrade their primary substrates i e growth substrates to degrade contaminants i e co metabolic substrates however degradation of co metabolic substrates generates no growth benefits such as energy source or as carbon nitrogen or sulfur source to microbes fig 4 the phenomenon was first reported in the early 1950s the definitive studies reported that a methane oxidizing bacterium pseudomonas methanica now known as methylomonas methanica was able to oxidize ethane but not able to utilize it as its sole carbon and energy source leadbetter and foster 1958 1959 1960 in 1985 wilson and wilson reported co metabolic biodegradation of trichloroethylene tce by methane monooxygenase expressing methane oxidizing bacteria in soil wilson and wilson 1985 since then many oxygenase expressing microorganisms have been known to co metabolically degrade many other chlorinated compounds semprini 1997 wang and chu 2017 and emerging contaminants hand et al 2015 tran et al 2013 including fluorotelomer alcohols and fluorotelomer based compounds kim et al 2012 lewis et al 2016 yang et al 2022 unlike growth linked degradation mechanisms of contaminants co metabolic degradation of contaminants can be achieved at extremely low concentration of emerging contaminants such as in ppb parts per billion or even ppt parts per trillion levels while researchers have applied dna sip to target on assimilatory reactions in the degradative microbes using primary substrate applications of sip to identify microbes capable of performing co metabolic i e non growth linked degradation on those interested contaminants has not been realized until recently shao et al 2019 in this recent dna sip study with 13ch4 as primary growth substrate shao and co researchers reported previously unknown active acidophilic methanotrophs in acidic groundwater ph 5 5 microcosms capable of cometabolizing trichloroethene tce and vinyl chloride but not cis dichloroethenecis cdce as neutralophilic methanotrophs have been known to express methane monooxygenase mmo soluble and or particulate mmo to oxidize methane and the expressed mmo are also responsible for co metabolic biotransformation of various chlorinated solvents hwangbo et al 2023 oldenhuis et al 1989 it was interesting to detect novel and diverse particulate mmo and soluble mmo in the acidophilic methanotrophs shao et al 2019 under this premise it comes of great importance in identifying and characterizing microbes and specific enzymes that co metabolically degrade emerging contaminants in complex microbial communities this first application of dna sip in co metabolic biodegradation of chlorinated solvents not only successfully demonstrated the power of sip but also suggested the importance to push forward the application of sip for studying co metabolic biodegradation of contaminants only few bacteria species are recently known to co metabolically degrade fluorotelomer based pfas such as pseudomonas oleovorans pseudomonas butanovora and mycobacterium vaccae job5 kim et al 2014 rhodococcus jostii rha1 yang et al 2022 gordonia nb4 1y shaw et al 2019 and dietzia aurantiaca j3 méndez et al 2022 while the mentioned approach is in its early stage similar approach can be applied along with other advanced techniques i e multi omics qsip sc sip etc to identify active microorganisms that are responsible for co metabolic degradation of other contaminants within mixed microbial communities ii integration of sip with advanced techniques sip based studies have adapted multi omics such as metagenomics chen and murrell 2010 transcriptomics nuccio et al 2021 proteomics von bergen et al 2013 and metabolomics birkemeyer et al 2005 hassanpour and aristilde 2021 hou et al 2021 tsugawa et al 2019 wilhelm et al 2022 to better understand microbial structure and function in the context of various environments while tracking potential key role players through sip however only few types of labeled contaminants have been used in biodegradation studies that couples sip and multi omics bradford et al 2018 hou et al 2021 uhlik et al 2013b vasileiadis et al 2022 future research using qsip and sc sip with various types of labeled contaminants is needed to assist assessment of in situ degradation kinetics that are particularly useful for formulating effective treatment and management strategies for biodegradation or bioremediation of contaminants at sites furthermore recent development of high throughput sip ht sip operational pipelines nuccio et al 2022 and simulation of metagenomic sip datasets barnett and buckley 2020 could be helpful in minimizing errors and labor from conventional sip based studies meanwhile the processed large data sets are significantly helpful in identifying and isolating distinct active contaminant degraders from complex microbial communities leading to a better understanding on the key players in degradation processes while recent applications of sip techniques to study contaminant biodegradation are increasing sip based studies are still limited by the commercially available labeled substrates and or by the high price of custom made label substrates this challenge was partially addressed by a study using magnetic nanoparticles mnp to assist isolation of active phenol degraders and compared to those identified through dna sip application of 13c labeleld phenol zhang et al 2015 subsequent applications of mnp with sip and cell sorting techniques have been reported to identify active acetonitrile degraders sun et al 2021 and phenanthrene degraders li et al 2018 2022 yet as magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles have been shown toxicity to microbes manke et al 2013 this aspect needs to be thoroughly investigated to determine whether mnp can truly capture the targeted metabolically active microbes under various environmental conditions despite these limitations the use of mnp itself for isolation of active degraders has advantages of being non destructive and not requiring labeled substrates which might not be readily available iii translation of sip findings for environmental remediation of contaminants results of sip studies have provided fundamental knowledge on the identities of metabolic active microbes and their roles in degrading environmental contaminants one immediate translation of sip findings is to identify unique species or signature microbial community structures as biomarkers which can be used to monitor the progress and success of active bioremediation processes or to assess the potential of natural attenuation also sip findings can lead to the identification of unique and effective contaminant degraders and degradative enzymes that are present at sites for example previous sip studies using 13c phenanthrene or 13c pyrene have identified and characterized novel polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dioxygenases from the labeled metagenomic bacterial dna from contaminated soils chemerys et al 2014 li et al 2017 singleton et al 2012 the sip findings can also guide the design of biostimulation and bioaugmentation efforts or assist on the enrichment and isolation of degraders that can be used to study degradation pathways and identification of degradative enzymes conclusions over the past few decades sip based technologies integrated along with multi omics and spectroscopy techniques allowed researchers to gain a better understanding of the identity and roles of microorganisms in numerous microbial mediated processes within natural and engineered environments mnp assisted sip could potentially offer an alternative to address the challenges of the availability of labeled compounds yet applications of mnp assisted sip might not be readily applicable in studying microorganisms that are sensitive to the toxicity of nanoparticles while results of sip based studies may over or under estimate the diversity of target microbial populations sip studies coupled with new techniques has been continuously developed over the past decades to provide a better picture of the complexity of the microbial ecosystem during the contaminant biodegradation yet many challenges still exist due to the complexity of microbial systems co metabolism mechanisms and availability of isotopically labeled compounds future direction should still focus on elucidating microbial identities gene functions and the complicated microorganism chemical compound interactions furthermore future research efforts need to be placed on how to capitalize the knowledge derived from sip studies to facilitate bioremediation applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
