4700,like other sedimentary plains the po plain in northern italy has largely subsided due to natural processes and human activities displacements of the earth surface of hydrological origin are caused by groundwater changes which in turn are expected to be related to rainfall changes in the bologna metropolitan area located in the southeastern border of po plain the 2010 politic decision of dismissing civil water supply from the groundwater withdrawal has provided us the opportunity to test a methodology for the retrieval of an anthropic effect in two different data sets vertical displacements measured by continuous gnss sites and piezometric water table fluctuations the data sets have been analyzed by means of the principal component analysis pca and compared to rainfall time series from the po plain rain gauges several piezometers undergo a clear increase in the water level following the withdrawal decrease differently the anthropic induced surface displacements are significantly smaller than the ones induced by rainfall accordingly without a multivariate analysis such an effect on vertical displacements would have remained hidden in the raw time series only looking at the spatial distribution of the principal components we have highlighted that anthropic effects are local and present even in gnss data entailing for the 2010 case a decrease of about 4 mm y of vertical velocity in some sites closest the withdrawal wells moreover the multivariate analysis allowed us to assess that on time scales larger than months the rainfall related hydrological response of vertical displacement depends on the geological setting in the apennines chain a water level increase causes subsidence in agreement with the predictions of elastic models whereas in the po plain it causes uplift suggesting a dominant poro elastic response in agreement with the guess that the subsidence of the po plain is related to soil compaction our results suggest that in cases of the aquifers over exploitation a pca analyses and the combined use of different observables such as gnss piezometers time series rainfall data geological setting allow getting a correct identification of the anthropic and natural signals keywords poro elasticity multi technique monitoring anthropogenic effects water table seasonal signals 1 introduction the land subsidence phenomena in the po river sedimentary basin po plain northern italy fig 1 is widely documented e g bitelli et al 2000 baldi et al 2009 2011 cenni et al 2013 stramondo et al 2007 reaching rates of 70 100 mm y in its southeastern part fig 1 cenni et al 2013 the main natural causes of subsidence in this area are compaction of alluvial soil e g teatini et al 2011 and tectonic movements e g carminati and di donato 1999 soil compaction can explain high subsidence rates near the po river delta some mm y teatini et al 2011 while the tectonic induced subsidence rates in the po plain originated from the north apennines thrust belt activity may hardly overcome 1 2 mm y carminati and di donato 1999 as locally the subsidence rates of the po plain are much higher with respect to both estimated tectonic effects and soil compactions the anthropogenic activities have an important role in particular the extraction of groundwaters in non rechargeable confined or semi confined deep aquifers can lead to high subsidence rates carminati and martinelli 2002 teatini et al 2006 especially in young compressible deposits chaussard et al 2013 a significant increase of subsidence probability can be caused by groundwater over exploitation due to poor management e g nayyeri et al 2020 pacheco et al 2006 minderhoud et al 2018 and it plays important role in geohazards e g teatini et al 2012 khan et al 2013 this effect is well known and monitored in many other areas of the world as for example in the eastern portion of the mexico city where the over exploitation of aquifers leads subsidence rates up to 37 cm y due to the compaction of clay rich lacustrine sediments osmanoglu et al 2011 as in this area the aquifers recharge is very low osmanoglu et al 2011 do not exclude the hypothesis that the aquifer may disappear in the vialonga urban area lisbon portugal a decline of the ground water levels 65 m in 27 years accompanied with ground subsidence were the primary effects of the over exploitation of groundwater resources heleno et al 2011 other examples of over exploitation of aquifers leading to remarkable subsidence rate changes are in las vegas hoffmann et al 2001 in the western indonesia chaussard et al 2013 and in iran mahmoudpour et al 2016 rajabi and ghorbani 2016 edalat et al 2020 moreover the effects of climate change scenario increase the variability of the precipitation rate and consequently affect the recharge of aquifers and withdrawal regimes cervi et al 2017 petronici et al 2019 starting from different datasets and geological areas the literature is consistent in arguing that in many cases the land subsidence can be avoided by constraining the water withdrawal from aquifers and implementing correct water policies e g calderhead et al 2012 numerical models of the aquifer systems also confirm this hypothesis e g hung et al 2012 rajabi 2018 nevertheless the study of land subsidence is not trivial as it depends on very local hydro geological parameters as the type of soil the geometry of the aquifer the depth of the bedrock as evidenced by the fact that the exploitation of the aquifer does not always involve an increase of the subsidence risk nayyeri et al 2020 vice versa subsidence is not always due to the exploitation of water resources for this reason the combined study of different observables e g rainfall groundwater levels and soil deformations and the connections between them provide an advantageous point of view for the study of subsidence this paper attempts to investigate the dependence on groundwater changes of the subsidence phenomena in the bologna city area southern border of po plain fig 1 most researchers e g baldi et al 2009 2011 teatini et al 2006 2011 have emphasised that the subsidence phenomenon in the sedimentary basin of the po plain is a complex combination of natural and human contributions after the second world war the fast expansion of bologna and surroundings together with industrial and agricultural development dramatically increased the groundwater withdrawal in this area inducing strong subsidence rate changes after the fifties from about 2 3 mm y up to 60 mm y according to stramondo et al 2007 in order to avoid the over exploitation of water resources in accord to the water framework european directive 2000 60 ec and reduce the subsidence rate that could have jeopardized the stability of buildings and the operativity of electric gas water and sewer lines in 2010 the reno setta shunt fig 2 a was activated there the latter allowed a greater supply of drinking water from surface water resources so that the withdrawals from deep and confined aquifers wells for withdrawal in fig 2a were significantly reduced regione emilia romagna and arpae 2018 of more than 106 m3 y fig 2 despite the activation of the reno setta shunt the water for civil use is still the main component in the total budget of water withdrawal 72 fig 2b starting from the available datasets of piezometers water level and gnss vertical displacement time series we want to characterize the principal seasonal and non periodic signals contained in each dataset hence the focus of the present work is i identify similar signals in different data sets and their spatial distribution ii characterize how rainfall changes locally affect water level changes and vertical displacements and iii discriminate the natural or anthropic origin of the different signals in each data sets 1 1 geologic settings the po plain fig 3 is the result of the sedimentation processes with alternate layers of sand and clay with both alpine and apennines origin controlled by geodynamic and climatological factors ori 1993 vittori and ventura 1995 the overall regressive trend from pliocene open marine facies to quaternary marginal marine and alluvial deposits has characterized the sedimentary evolution of the basin amorosi et al 1996 the coarse sediments i e gravel are deposited only near the apennine and alpine chain in alluvial fan areas at the mouth of the intramontane valleys ori 1993 amorosi et al 1996 while the presence of medium sand and finer sediments silt and clay increases progressively toward the basin center along depth the sedimentological structures are organized as multilayer sequences of coarse fine sediments regione emilia romagna and eni agip 1998 that identify more regressive transgressive cycles regrouped in alluvial cycles a and b and marine cycle c each cycle fig 3c can be divided into other minor cycles of the a b and c systems i e a1 a2 b1 etc where the finer sediment is at the bottom transgressive processes and gradually coarser sediment is at the top regressive processes the hydrogeological complex of alluvial fans represents the main recharging area of the deeper and confined aquifers of the alluvial plain the reno lavino rivers alluvial fan located at west of bologna city is more than 600 m thick and consists of multilayered fine coarse sediments where large and productive aquifer systems in the coarse sediments are separated by fine sediments aquitards the bottom of the alluvial aquifer in cycle a is about 250 m deep and in cycle b is about 400 m deep sections 1 and 2 of fig 3 all aquifers are interested by wells for withdrawals due to civil industrial and agricultural water uses in fig 2 the portions of phreatic and upper confined aquifers of the reno lavino rivers alluvial fan are shown the phreatic portion recharge area of the alluvial fan is located at the valley mouth of the rivers and is characterized by amalgamated gravel bodies which form a monolayer unconfined aquifer about 100 m thick the hydrogeological recharge is due to direct input by the rainfall and by the reno and lavino rivers the hydrogeological flux is directed from south west to north east towards the confined alluvial fan and po plain 2 data and method in order to monitor the water levels of aquifers close to the bologna city area fig 1b the regional agency for environmental protection arpa emilia romagna performed periodical measurement of depth to water in several cased wells piezometers the locations of the piezometers are shown in fig 1b 4 piezometers provide hourly water level measurement while in the remaining 25 locations unevenly throughout the network manual measurements have been carried out with recurrence times of few months about 3 months from the middle of 2003 to the middle of 2014 the observation time interval we study is centered around 2010 when the reno setta shunt was activated and it allows us to get from manual piezometers the largest number of continuous temporal series the pipe bottom depth of manual piezometers ranges from 30 m to about 450 m below the surface table s1 supporting information at depth the po plain is characterized by an alternation of confined and semi confined aquifers e g nespoli et al 2017 with different aquifer units shown in fig 3 the bottom depth of the piezometers is variable and some piezometers have open screens in multiple units the 90 of the piezometers communicates with confined aquifers table s1 we will see that regardless of their depth the water levels of all piezometers slightly increase during the observed period and in some piezometers a sharp increase occurs starting around 2010 the ground motions can be monitored by different techniques such as classic topographic ones and remote sensing methodologies like synthetic aperture radar sar and global navigation satellite system gnss in particular the continuous gnss stations cgnss can provide important information about the time evolution of the land surface elevation therefore they represent a useful tool to monitor and study the land subsidence we have considered all cgnss sites distributed in the po plain and surrounding areas fig 1a operating over the period january 1 2009 december 31 2018 the station management procedures are not homogeneous because they belong to different networks developed for different aims some of these have been developed for technical purposes real time positioning others for geological and geophysical studies crustal deformation monitoring in this study we included only the sites with an observation time longer than 9 years and with a ratio between the number of collected data and the number of observation days efficiency greater than 0 65 in our analysis we have also considered rainfall data to estimate the climatic and meteorological signals in the study area rainfall records from january 1 2009 december 31 2018 were downloaded from the arpae sim data sharing service https simc arpae it dext3r we have collected the daily rainfall time series of 62 sites located on the po plain and in the northern sector of the apennine chain fig 1 we have considered only the sites with efficiency in the observed time span greater than 80 and with gaps in the temporal series lower than 1 month 2 1 the rainfall data elaboration the daily rainfall time series acquired from the 62 stations located on the po plain and northern sector of the apennine chain fig 1 have been analyzed to highlight the main seasonal signals we have considered meaningful a signal with a period greater than 1 month and lower than half of the observation time span firstly we have computed the cumulated daily rainfall time series successively the linear trend has been estimated by a least square method and removed from the series then the stacked residual time series fig 4 has been analyzed using the lomb 1976 scargle 1982 method finding three meaningful seasonal signals in the study area one annual signal and two multiannual signals with periods of 2 8 y and 4 8 y respectively fig 4 inside the bologna metropolitan area the rain gauge located in the village of anzola dell emilia hereafter anzola fig 1b recorded daily rainfall observations within the whole time span therefore we will use the data of anzola to make a comparison with the piezometric data instead to study the effects of rainfall on cgnss stations that have a much larger spatial distribution we use the stacked residual time series it is worth to notice that within the observation time span of gnss time series the anzola time series does not significantly differ from the stacked residual time series fig 4 2 2 the piezometer data elaboration we performed a resampling fig s1 supporting information of raw piezometric data fig 5 computing a linear interpolation of each time series on discrete times with a regular step of 3 months which approximately corresponds to the sampling period of manual piezometers in the following analysis we removed the time series of automatic piezometers as they do not cover the entire time interval here studied we studied the detrended and demeaned piezometric temporal series by means of a principal component analysis pca jolliffe 1986 gewers et al 2018 savage and langbein 2008 this method performs a spatiotemporal separation of the piezometric data into a set of linearly uncorrelated principal components pcs which can be interpreted as signals due to the different sources generating the observed water level variations according to this method the first principal component pc1 has the largest possible variance so it explains much of the observation and the subsequent components are ordered with decreasing variance values in case of p time series with n epochs the data matrix x n p can be reconstructed by linearly summing up the contributions from all the components x i s i c i where the i th component contributes with the coefficient ci 1 p to the specific spatial distribution and with the score si n 1 to the temporal evolution the first two components explain together about 75 of the total variance pc1 64 pc2 10 and are shown in fig 6 it is worth to notice that in order to give to the reader an easier interpretation of the temporal evolution of the pcs we represent them in fig 6c with a reversed ordinate axis in this way a lowering of the curve represents a lowering of the water level i e an increasing of the depth to water and vice versa the temporal evolution of the first principal component s pc1 fig 6c is roughly characterized by a decreasing trend that lasts up to about 2010 1 knee point afterwards the s pc1 suddenly reverses its trend and starts to increase the knee point of s pc1 in fig 6c was found computing the time which minimizes the root mean square rms of two linear fits calculated at the left and at the right of a potential knee point respectively the spatial pattern of the first principal component c pc1 fig 6c is almost positive on the overall studied area this means that in almost all the piezometers the water level component associated to the pc1 increases starting from 2010 even if its magnitude is not uniform in fact the c pc1 is greater in the piezometers located in the western area of the city of bologna and it reaches its maximum near the wells used for withdrawal of water fig 6d the temporal evolution of the pc2 fig 6c seems to be related to a periodical multiannual signal with a period of about 5 years even if its spatial response fig 6e is much more heterogeneous than c pc1 2 3 the pca on water levels 2 3 1 pc1 the temporal behavior of pc1 fig 6 is strongly related to the water withdrawal changes that occurred in 2010 fig 2 s pc1 is sufficient to explain the 64 of the water level fluctuations this means that the anthropic withdrawal of water is the primary reason affecting water level fluctuations of aquifers in the study area the knee point we found on the s pc1 confirms that a water level increase started suddenly during 2010 and lasted until the end of the studied period this is also clear in many of the original data series of piezometers fig 5 where it is possible to visually identify a rapid increase in the water level starting from 2010 due to the removal of the linear trend of the data from the observation of s pc1 alone we would not be able to distinguish if the increase of the water level rate is permanent as it is assumed in the present work from the case of a transient decrease followed by a transient increase bulge shaped temporal evolution fig s2 the only way to discriminate which of the two cases occurred is the observation of the original raw data that is fundamental it is worth to notice that c pc1 fig 6d has the largest values close to three westward withdrawal wells fig 2a which after the 2010 reno setta shunt were much less exploited than before regione emilia romagna and arpae 2018 2 3 2 pc2 the normalized temporal behavior of pc2 that explains 10 of the variance is plotted together with the cumulated detrended and normalized evolution of rainfall recorded by the rain gauge located near the village of anzola fig 1b the two time series fig 7 have a moderate cross correlation with pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 62 and vanishing time lag accordingly the pc2 is likely due to rainfall which acts on the water levels measured by the piezometers the retrieved vanishing lag is likely an undetectable finite lag i e a delay smaller than the sampling rate of the data 3 4 months apparently no particular pattern can be found in the spatial response of pc2 fig 6e the amplitude of which seems to be unrelated to the distance from the mountains possible recharge area e g regione emilia romagna and eni agip 1998 marcaccio and martinelli 2012 or from the main water bodies nevertheless the magnitude of c pc2 is greater in agricultural or farming zones fig 7c and at the piezometers with a small depth fig 7e this is in accordance with the fact that deep confined aquifers are less affected by rainfall with respect to the shallowest unconfined aquifer as already found by nespoli et al 2017 instead all industrial piezometers have a very small response to pc2 the same thing is not true for pc1 since its spatial response does not significantly depend on use nor on depth fig 7b and d 2 4 the gnss data elaboration the daily gnss phase observations of the 57 sites acquired with a 30 s sampling rate were analyzed using the gamit software herring et al 2018a and adopting a distributed procedure cenni et al 2012 2013 to obtain continuous time series in all the stations to this aim we have firstly applied tight constraints to the precise ephemerides and earth orientation parameters eop provided by the international gnss service igs and loose constraints 100 m at the locations of all sites the atmospheric propagation delay has been modeled using the global mapping function boehm et al 2006 and the model fes2004 lyard et al 2006 was adopted for the ocean loading the igs absolute antenna phase centre models for satellites and ground station antennas have been also adopted in the data processing the daily solutions of clusters have been combined using the globk software herring et al 2018b each solution has been included in the itrf14 reference frame using the igs coordinates and the velocities of the 14 sites shown in the inset of fig 1 altamimi et al 2016 the eurasian plate motion modeled as suggested by altamimi et al 2016 has been removed from the horizontal velocities of all sites at the end of the procedure we have obtained the daily time series of the north east and vertical components the time evolution of the series y k t i can be modelled following the relation 1 y k t i y 0 k v k t i j 1 n d kj h t i t j n 1 m b 1 k n c o s 2 π t i p k n b 2 k n s i n 2 π t i p k n k t i where k represents the component k 1 2 3 for the north east and vertical component y0k and vk are the initial position and velocity trend respectively the discontinuities due to instrumental changes and seismic events occurred near the sites are modeled with the dkj terms εk ti represents a time dependent noise and b1kn and b2kn are the amplitudes of the periodic signals with period pkn we have supposed that the trend is constant in the entire time span analyzed during a preliminary phase only the initial position velocity discontinuities and noise have been estimated by a weighted least squares method imposing b1kn and b2kn equal to 0 a model has been computed by means of the parameters estimated and it was removed from the real time series to obtain residual time series the residual time series have been successively analyzed with a nonlinear least squares technique to estimate spectra following the lomb 1976 scargle 1982 approach the spectrum of each component has been analyzed to estimate the period pkn of the five statistically meaningful principal signals in the interval between one month and half of the observation time span successively the m m 5 periods pkn have been assumed in eq 1 to estimate by a weighted least square method the b1kn and b2kn parameters and more precise values of the initial position velocity and discontinuities the obtained velocity field for the vertical component vertical kinematic pattern is shown in fig s3 estimated velocities values constant on the entire time span are reported in table s2 with related uncertainties hackl et al 2011 the principal features of this velocity field will be described later the time series obtained by removing outliers and estimated discontinuities have been analyzed by a pca method e g jolliffe 1986 gewers et al 2018 savage and langbein 2008 to this aim for each gnss site the gaps in the non detrended time series have been filled following eq 1 using the estimated parameters combined with a white noise model the latter is characterized by an amplitude equal to the weighted root mean square value of the observed temporal series for the vertical component a velocity value of each principal component has been estimated using the model described in the following equation 2 f t i a v t i c 1 c o s 2 π t i p c 2 s i n 2 π t i p where a and v are the initial position and velocity c1 and c2 are the amplitude of sine and cosine functions of the principal seasonal signal in the time series the period p of which has been estimated by the lomb scargle method lomb 1976 scargle 1982 and ε represents the noise these parameters are reported in table 1 with uncertainties evaluated supposing a colored noise in the principal component time series hackl et al 2011 2 4 1 the pca on gnss observations analogously to the pca performed on piezometric data we indicate the temporal and spatial distributions of the principal components of gnss data as s gpcs and c gpcs respectively the first 5 principal components fig 8 describe the 80 of the variance in order to tentatively assess a possible origin of the seasonal signals observed in the gnss time series we compared the spectrum of the stacked temporal series of rain gauges fig 4 with the one of s gpcs s 1 2 5 fig 9 an annual cycle with a mean amplitude of about 1 mm table 1 is the principal seasonal signal of the s gpcs and can be likely related to meteorological phenomena annual periodic signals can be attributed to the variations of the regional mass loading atmospheric oceanic and hydrological loading e g argus et al 2014 li et al 2017 liu et al 2017 van dam et al 2007 the correlation between each s gpcs and the cumulated rainfall is quite low except for s gpc3 pearson s coefficient 0 6 table 2 fig 9 also suggests that s gpc2 s gpc3 and s gpc4 as well as the rainfall time series contain a multi seasonal signal antolini et al 2016 detected a multi year signals in the temporal distribution of rainfall in the eastern sector of the po plain furthermore recent studies e g adusumilli et al 2019 nespoli et al 2018 serpelloni et al 2018 silverii et al 2016 found multiyear deformation in gnss time series accordingly the peak at about 5 years in the spectra of fig 9 likely characterizes a climatic multi seasonal signal that the relatively short time series considered is not able to define completely 2 4 2 gpc1 the first principal component of the gnss time series gpc1 accounts for about the 67 of the variance the spatial c gpc1 and temporal s gpc1 pattern of the first component are shown in fig 8b c gpc1 resembles the vertical kinematic pattern fig s3 showing that the land subsidence mostly occurred in relatively limited areas which are characterized by vertical velocities lower than 6 mm y table 1 a few sites mainly located on the eastern sector of the po plain are characterized by a subsidence velocity greater than 2 3 mm y the other principal components have a very small velocity table 1 with respect to the one of gpc1 so we can argue that the linear dependence on time of the gnss signal of vertical displacement is almost completely described by gpc1 2 4 3 gpc2 and gpc3 the second and third principal components can be considered as a common mode of the network as more than 50 of the cgnss stations have a response 25 fig 8c and d it is worth to notice that at the gnss locations characterized by subsidence rates greater than 3 4 mm y c gpc2 is very low or even vanishing fig 8b to be compared with fig 8c this could suggest that the first and second components are not completely separated as confirmed by the correlation about 0 8 table 2 between s gpc2 and the residual values of the s gpc1 signal obtained by removing the linear trend s gpc1r however we will see that this result does not significantly affect the present analysis there is a noticeable agreement between the spectra of residual cumulative rainfall s gpc2 and s gpc3 in terms of peak periods fig 9 even if the annual signal and the other peaks periods 2 y 2 8 y and 5 0 y have been detected with different power in the three spectra in the s gpc2 spectrum the multi seasonal signal is the largest one while in the s gpc3 the annual cycle prevails over the multi seasonal signal hence both gpc2 and gpc3 components likely represent the response of the ground soil to the rainfall but they are mainly related to the long period and short period rainfall variations respectively to represent the total response to rainfall variations fig 10 shows the results obtained adding gpc3 to gpc2 in each cgnss station we determine if the gpc2 gpc3 effect is in phase blue circles in fig 10a or in opposition of phase red circles with the stacked temporal series of rainfall this is evaluated on the basis of the rms computed between the rainfall time series and the time dependent response of each station to gpc2 gpc3 or gpc2 gpc3 table s2 if the rms of gpc2 gpc3 is lower than rms of gpc2 gpc3 the cgnss station is assumed in phase with rainfall e g blgn station fig 10b otherwise it is assumed in opposition of phase with rainfall e g mo02 station in fig 10b the rain induced displacements are in phase with rainfall in mostly of the stations located in the po plain while they are in opposition of phase in stations located on the apennines chain this means that an increase of meteoric recharge or equivalently an increase of the water level leads to uplift in the po plain and subsidence in the apennines chain and vice versa for completeness the results obtained applying this method to the sum gpc1r gpc2 gpc3 fig s4 do not alter this finding the rain induced uplift occurring in the po plain can be likely due to the poro elastic deformation of the soil an increase of the water table leads to an expansion of the porous permeable aquifers of the po plain and therefore it involves uplift as yet envisaged in other aquifer systems e g wisely and schmidt 2010 king et al 2007 an estimation of the poro elastic effect on vertical displacement at the surface u z p with z pointing downward can be computed directly from water table fluctuations as wang 2000 wisely and schmidt 2010 3 u z p s b δ h w where s is the specific storage b is the thickness of the aquifer unit subjected to poro elastic deformation and δ h w is the variation of water table in the assumption of incompressible solid grains and pores the specific storage of the aquifer can be expressed in terms of the porosity ϕ the density of water ρw and the vertical incompressibility of the aquifer kv and water kf as 4 s ρ w g 1 k v ϕ k f with k v k 4 μ 3 where g is the gravity and k and μ are the drained incompressibility and the shear modulus of the rocks of the aquifer respectively following nespoli et al 2016 we consider a low shear modulus for the shallowest layers of the po plain μ 0 40 gpa a porosity ϕ 0 2 and b 130 m as a thickness of shallow aquifers assuming g 9 81 m s2 k 0 61 gpa for a drained poisson s number ν 0 25 kf 2 20 gpa ρw 1000 kg m3 for a water table increase of 5 m which represents about the peak to peak seasonal variations of the water table measured by the piezometers figs 5 and 6 we estimate an uplift u z p 6 mm in agreement with the magnitude of the annual amplitude of surface displacements of gpc2 gpc3 fig 10b contrariwise to the cgnss stations located in the po plain the stations located on the apennines chain are in opposition of phase with the rain this means that far from the po plain aquifers the poro elastic effects are not the primary mechanism affecting the ground deformation fig 10 several authors found an anti correlation between the uplift and the water table fluctuations e g silverii et al 2016 amos et al 2014 in these cases the purely elastic effect due to the hydrological loading which produces a displacement of opposite sign with respect to the poro elastic effect prevails following tsai 2011 we can estimate the purely elastic vertical displacement u z e at the surface of an elastic half space due to a periodic hydrostatic load variation in space along x as 5 u z e 1 ν ϕ p 0 ke s i n k x 1 2 ν where p 0 ρ w g δ h w is the amplitude of pore pressure variations e 9kμ 3k μ is the young modulus of the half space and k is the wave number k 2π λ with λ wavelength considering average values over depth of the elastic parameters representing the study region e 75 gpa and ν 0 25 nespoli et al 2017 and a wavelength of the same magnitude of the study area dimension λ 200 km for δ h w 5 m according to 5 the maximum elastic displacement is u z e 3 mm 2 4 4 gpc4 and gpc5 the spatial response of the gpc4 fig 8e is greater than 70 in absolute value in only three sites ctmg parm and btac fig 8a and table s2 and it is characterized by the largest annual signal table 1 with an amplitude larger than 3 mm due to its very heterogeneous spatial distribution c gpc4 this component cannot be considered as a common mode it likely describes a local phenomenon such as for example anthropic water withdrawal furthermore differently from gpc2 and gpc3 the temporal evolution of gpc4 is not correlated with rainfall table 2 the minimum values of the annual signals fall in the winter season first part of the year so we suggest that the most likely origin of this signal may stem from the massive local anthropic groundwater withdrawal in fact the three cgnss stations which have the largest response are located near or inside the industrial areas of parma parm in fig 8a and bologna ctmg that are the most populated cities of the emilia romagna region and in the agricultural area close to the bonavigo village btac however as we do not have pumping data of these areas we cannot quantitatively study this component and further investigation is left to future developments according to the spatial response of the gpc5 fig 8f only two cgnss stations bolg and blgn in fig 1b located in the bologna city area have a response greater than 60 both stations are very close to the wells used for the withdrawal of water in the city of bologna figs 2a and 6a the temporal evolution of gpc5 is not characterized by a linear trend neither a significant seasonal signal table 1 but it has a knee point indicating a velocity change in the second half of 2010 hence this component is likely due to the variation of water withdrawal that took place during 2010 the velocities before and after the knee point has been computed using the two different time spans 1 2009 2010 5 and 2010 5 2019 2 2009 2011 and 2011 2019 table 1 we estimated a sharp variation from 4 1 mm y during 2009 2011 to 0 1 mm y during 2011 2019 3 discussion in the present work we analyzed three different datasets i time series of rain gauges placed in the southeastern border of the po plain northern italy ii water table fluctuations measured by the net of piezometers in the metropolitan city area of bologna iii vertical ground displacements measured by the cgnss stations during the period 2003 2019 both water table fluctuations and surface displacements are influenced by the same natural e g rainfall and anthropogenic e g water withdrawal hydrological signals but each of them responded in a peculiar way it is worth to notice that two mainshocks with mw 6 1 and 6 0 occurred in the po plain in may 2012 about 40 km north of bologna nevertheless both the afterslip and poro elastic effects of the two shocks were estimated to be negligible one year after the earthquake especially in the far field nespoli et al 2018 in order to separate the main hydrological effects we performed a principal component analysis on each dataset from the pca on piezometers fig 6 we found that the strongest signal pc1 64 of variance explained is due to the anthropic induced change of water withdrawal occurred in the 2010 in the bologna area this signal is well clear in the temporal evolution of pc1 fig 6c which reflects an abrupt increase of the water level starting in 2010 furthermore from the spatial response of pc1 fig 6d we can assess that even if the major increase about 15 m fig 6 of the water level occurred in the area surrounding the three westward withdrawal wells figs 2 and 6 where the withdrawal reduction was maximum after 2010 a water level increase up to 9 m occurred at least as far as 20 km from bologna this is because the aquifers of the po plain constituted by multi layered sequences e g marcaccio and martinelli 2012 are strongly confined vertically but not horizontally nespoli et al 2016 due to the high lateral communication of the aquifer units the anthropogenic effects can have a wide spatial response the second principal component pc2 of piezometric temporal series is correlated with rainfall r 0 62 as confirmed by the visual superposition of the normalized curves of cumulated detrended rainfall and s pc2 fig 7a both the fact that s pc2 and rainfall correlate with zero time lag at least with a piezometric sampling rate of 3 4 months and that the rainfall response is greater in shallow piezometers fig 7e indicate that the main effects of precipitation are due to the fast input of water from the top of the shallowest aquifers accordingly from the pc2 we can assess that in the study area the hydrologic response of the soil to rainfall is rapid with characteristic times lower than 3 4 months but also very variable in space this result is in accordance with findings for the vancouver island of fannin et al 2000 who concluded that piezometers located 20 m apart exhibited markedly different groundwater response even if the rainfall is quite uniform in the studied area fig 3 it may lead a heterogeneous spatial response of piezometers as depending on very local parameters e g soil types evapo transpiration urbanization piezometer usage etc therefore our results indicate that the use of the pca is fundamental in order to extract this signal that would not have been spotted through a visual observation of the data fig 5 we can attempt an interpretation of the different spatial response of piezometers to rainfall based on the different use of wells fig 7c since apparently industrial piezometers have a lower response than piezometers for agricultural farms use this could be related to the fact that during the summer period the rainfall is lower accordingly the withdrawal of ground water for agricultural use in summer is greater with respect to the winter period so the response of the water level to the rainfall could be amplified conversely as the industry needs a constant supply of water regardless of the precipitations the same effect could be less visible several methods have been developed to detect anomalous signals in geophysical displacement time series such as the principal component analysis e g savage and langbein 2008 dong et al 2006 clustering e g savage and simpson 2013 the relative strength index e g crowell et al 2016 or moving windows baldi et al 2008 we performed a principal component analysis also on the cgnss data gpca using the time series of vertical displacements we chose to analyze non detrended time series in order to i introduce the least possible a priori constraints in the gpca analysis ii check that the gpca analysis correctly recognizes the subsidence kinematic pattern in the study area fig 8b it is worth to notice that the gpca on vertical displacements allowed us to estimate the effects of both the variation of the water withdrawal occurred in 2010 and the rainfall the same source signals are recovered from piezometric data but in the case of cgnss data the variance explained by the anthropogenic component gpc5 is much lower 1 5 than the one explained by the precipitation related components gpc2 and gpc3 the component explaining the greatest variance 67 gpc1 is the one related to the subsidence and shows that the four cgnss sites located in the bologna city and surrounding areas bolo bolg blgn and ctmg fig 1b are characterized by low velocities mostly comparable to estimated uncertainties of about 1 mm y the gpc1 indicates a significative reduction of the land subsidence rates in the po plain over the whole studied period january 1 2009 december 31 2018 with respect to the up to 10 mm y estimates made by other authors in previous periods e g baldi et al 2009 bonsignore 2008 cenni et al 2013 devoti et al 2017 stramondo et al 2007 furthermore as evidenced by gpc5 we found that an additional variation from 4 1 to 0 1 mm y of the vertical velocity also occurred inside the observation time span appearing as a knee point in the cgnss time series we found that the displacements of gpc2 gpc3 see e g yan et al 2019 for an independent component analysis are in phase with rainfall in most of the cgnss stations located in the po plain while they are in phase opposition in stations placed on the apennines fig 10 this response is likely due to the different kind of soil in the po plain and in the apennines chain fig 3 in the latter the surface vertical displacement due to the rainfall is almost purely elastic accordingly a sudden change of water loading results into an instantaneous lowering of the soil as envisaged also in southern apennines silverii et al 2016 and in other zones of the world e g amos et al 2014 fu and freymueller 2012 yan et al 2019 the shallow soil of the po plain instead is mostly characterized by an alternation of sand gravels silts and clay especially in the alluvial fan areas fig 2 near the apennine chain e g nespoli et al 2015 marcaccio and martinelli 2012 clay deposits can easily behave like expansive soils undergoing large volume changes when increasing the water content e g estabragh et al 2013 accounting for the elastic parameters of the crust of the studied region and assuming a poro elastic expansion of the aquifers of the po plain we estimated that the poro elastic displacements can be significantly higher than the elastic ones u z p 6 mm u z e 3 mm moreover it is worth to notice that as u z p linearly depends on the aquifer thickness b its value can be locally greater or smaller with respect to our assumption of its average value for the po plain b 130 m the gpc5 fig 8f is strongly localized in the bologna city area very close to the wells used for water withdrawal fig 2 and its temporal evolution is characterized by a knee point indicating a velocity change in 2010 the abrupt change of vertical velocity is likely due to the variation of the civil use of the groundwater reservoirs occurred in the middle of 2010 this result is in good agreement with the piezometric water level changes estimated by pc1 fig 6 and suggests that our methodology was successful in detecting and quantifying the 2010 anthropic contribution to both water level variations and subsidence rates 4 conclusions in this paper we test a methodology for the retrieval of an anthropic effect in two different data sets vertical displacements measured by continuous gnss sites and piezometric water table fluctuations the data sets have been analyzed by means of the principal component analysis pca and compared to rainfall time series from the po plain rain gauges the limitations due to the different sampling rate in our case one day for gnss and about three months for piezometric data and discontinuous observation time span in the available datasets as well as the spatial heterogeneity of related networks fig 1 represent a problem challenge in subsidence studies where the goal is to avoid unverified assumptions about the spatial and temporal variation of the analyzed phenomena we showed that the analysis of pca results represents a well assessed possible solution to such problems despite the different kind of available data rainfall piezometric level and gnss time series our approach enabled us to study the complex interaction between the underlying processes we found that this interaction is not trivial as it consists in a combination of natural and anthropic phenomena that can act on different time and spatial scales even within the same dataset the suggested approach consists in a two step procedure a retrieval of the main statistically important signals by means of pca application to the observed time series of each dataset b the comparison of principal modes and their spectrum in order to detect similar signals in different datasets this approach gave us the possibility to detect the multiannual on a time scale of at least five years fig 9 regional signal due to rainfall in both piezometric and gnss vertical time series in the bologna metropolitan area fig 1b we were also able to separate the 2010 withdrawal change effects on the vertical displacements and piezometric levels from the other signals these effects are localized within a radius of about 20 km from the withdrawal wells fig 2a while the analysis of piezometric data shows a clear increase in the water level following the withdrawal decrease the anthropic induced surface displacements are significantly smaller about few mm than the ones locally induced by rainfall about 10 mm accordingly without a multivariate analysis such effect on vertical displacements would have remained hidden in the raw time series it is worth to notice that after 2010 the subsidence rate in the bologna city area is decreased of about 4 mm y this represents an important contribution to reducing the long term subsidence effects e g it prevents a soil lowering of 40 mm after 10 years then we can assess that the preventive measures adopted in the bologna area with the aim of reducing the soil subsidence and the depletion of water resources for drinking agricultural and industrial use have been successfull the suggested approach allowed us to interpret the interaction between groundwater changes induced by rainfall on time scale larger than months with vertical displacements at the earth surface in terms of the peculiar geological context we have observed a different response of cgnss vertical movements at the rainfall stress as depending on the location of the sites sedimentary plain or hill mountain this result implies that when the geological context of the study area is not homogeneous to correctly model the rainfall contribution to the vertical movement of the surface it is necessary to consider different prevailing effects elastic in the case of mountains and poro elastic in the case of the sedimentary plain here we have estimated that the poro elastic effect is about twice the elastic one the results obtained in the present work suggest that the combined observation of gnss and piezometers time series rainfall data geological setting and the use of pca are very important in order to get a complete understanding of the anthropic and natural signals in cases of aquifer over exploitation the study of such interaction can provide precious hints to assess the best practices for the governance of groundwater

4700,like other sedimentary plains the po plain in northern italy has largely subsided due to natural processes and human activities displacements of the earth surface of hydrological origin are caused by groundwater changes which in turn are expected to be related to rainfall changes in the bologna metropolitan area located in the southeastern border of po plain the 2010 politic decision of dismissing civil water supply from the groundwater withdrawal has provided us the opportunity to test a methodology for the retrieval of an anthropic effect in two different data sets vertical displacements measured by continuous gnss sites and piezometric water table fluctuations the data sets have been analyzed by means of the principal component analysis pca and compared to rainfall time series from the po plain rain gauges several piezometers undergo a clear increase in the water level following the withdrawal decrease differently the anthropic induced surface displacements are significantly smaller than the ones induced by rainfall accordingly without a multivariate analysis such an effect on vertical displacements would have remained hidden in the raw time series only looking at the spatial distribution of the principal components we have highlighted that anthropic effects are local and present even in gnss data entailing for the 2010 case a decrease of about 4 mm y of vertical velocity in some sites closest the withdrawal wells moreover the multivariate analysis allowed us to assess that on time scales larger than months the rainfall related hydrological response of vertical displacement depends on the geological setting in the apennines chain a water level increase causes subsidence in agreement with the predictions of elastic models whereas in the po plain it causes uplift suggesting a dominant poro elastic response in agreement with the guess that the subsidence of the po plain is related to soil compaction our results suggest that in cases of the aquifers over exploitation a pca analyses and the combined use of different observables such as gnss piezometers time series rainfall data geological setting allow getting a correct identification of the anthropic and natural signals keywords poro elasticity multi technique monitoring anthropogenic effects water table seasonal signals 1 introduction the land subsidence phenomena in the po river sedimentary basin po plain northern italy fig 1 is widely documented e g bitelli et al 2000 baldi et al 2009 2011 cenni et al 2013 stramondo et al 2007 reaching rates of 70 100 mm y in its southeastern part fig 1 cenni et al 2013 the main natural causes of subsidence in this area are compaction of alluvial soil e g teatini et al 2011 and tectonic movements e g carminati and di donato 1999 soil compaction can explain high subsidence rates near the po river delta some mm y teatini et al 2011 while the tectonic induced subsidence rates in the po plain originated from the north apennines thrust belt activity may hardly overcome 1 2 mm y carminati and di donato 1999 as locally the subsidence rates of the po plain are much higher with respect to both estimated tectonic effects and soil compactions the anthropogenic activities have an important role in particular the extraction of groundwaters in non rechargeable confined or semi confined deep aquifers can lead to high subsidence rates carminati and martinelli 2002 teatini et al 2006 especially in young compressible deposits chaussard et al 2013 a significant increase of subsidence probability can be caused by groundwater over exploitation due to poor management e g nayyeri et al 2020 pacheco et al 2006 minderhoud et al 2018 and it plays important role in geohazards e g teatini et al 2012 khan et al 2013 this effect is well known and monitored in many other areas of the world as for example in the eastern portion of the mexico city where the over exploitation of aquifers leads subsidence rates up to 37 cm y due to the compaction of clay rich lacustrine sediments osmanoglu et al 2011 as in this area the aquifers recharge is very low osmanoglu et al 2011 do not exclude the hypothesis that the aquifer may disappear in the vialonga urban area lisbon portugal a decline of the ground water levels 65 m in 27 years accompanied with ground subsidence were the primary effects of the over exploitation of groundwater resources heleno et al 2011 other examples of over exploitation of aquifers leading to remarkable subsidence rate changes are in las vegas hoffmann et al 2001 in the western indonesia chaussard et al 2013 and in iran mahmoudpour et al 2016 rajabi and ghorbani 2016 edalat et al 2020 moreover the effects of climate change scenario increase the variability of the precipitation rate and consequently affect the recharge of aquifers and withdrawal regimes cervi et al 2017 petronici et al 2019 starting from different datasets and geological areas the literature is consistent in arguing that in many cases the land subsidence can be avoided by constraining the water withdrawal from aquifers and implementing correct water policies e g calderhead et al 2012 numerical models of the aquifer systems also confirm this hypothesis e g hung et al 2012 rajabi 2018 nevertheless the study of land subsidence is not trivial as it depends on very local hydro geological parameters as the type of soil the geometry of the aquifer the depth of the bedrock as evidenced by the fact that the exploitation of the aquifer does not always involve an increase of the subsidence risk nayyeri et al 2020 vice versa subsidence is not always due to the exploitation of water resources for this reason the combined study of different observables e g rainfall groundwater levels and soil deformations and the connections between them provide an advantageous point of view for the study of subsidence this paper attempts to investigate the dependence on groundwater changes of the subsidence phenomena in the bologna city area southern border of po plain fig 1 most researchers e g baldi et al 2009 2011 teatini et al 2006 2011 have emphasised that the subsidence phenomenon in the sedimentary basin of the po plain is a complex combination of natural and human contributions after the second world war the fast expansion of bologna and surroundings together with industrial and agricultural development dramatically increased the groundwater withdrawal in this area inducing strong subsidence rate changes after the fifties from about 2 3 mm y up to 60 mm y according to stramondo et al 2007 in order to avoid the over exploitation of water resources in accord to the water framework european directive 2000 60 ec and reduce the subsidence rate that could have jeopardized the stability of buildings and the operativity of electric gas water and sewer lines in 2010 the reno setta shunt fig 2 a was activated there the latter allowed a greater supply of drinking water from surface water resources so that the withdrawals from deep and confined aquifers wells for withdrawal in fig 2a were significantly reduced regione emilia romagna and arpae 2018 of more than 106 m3 y fig 2 despite the activation of the reno setta shunt the water for civil use is still the main component in the total budget of water withdrawal 72 fig 2b starting from the available datasets of piezometers water level and gnss vertical displacement time series we want to characterize the principal seasonal and non periodic signals contained in each dataset hence the focus of the present work is i identify similar signals in different data sets and their spatial distribution ii characterize how rainfall changes locally affect water level changes and vertical displacements and iii discriminate the natural or anthropic origin of the different signals in each data sets 1 1 geologic settings the po plain fig 3 is the result of the sedimentation processes with alternate layers of sand and clay with both alpine and apennines origin controlled by geodynamic and climatological factors ori 1993 vittori and ventura 1995 the overall regressive trend from pliocene open marine facies to quaternary marginal marine and alluvial deposits has characterized the sedimentary evolution of the basin amorosi et al 1996 the coarse sediments i e gravel are deposited only near the apennine and alpine chain in alluvial fan areas at the mouth of the intramontane valleys ori 1993 amorosi et al 1996 while the presence of medium sand and finer sediments silt and clay increases progressively toward the basin center along depth the sedimentological structures are organized as multilayer sequences of coarse fine sediments regione emilia romagna and eni agip 1998 that identify more regressive transgressive cycles regrouped in alluvial cycles a and b and marine cycle c each cycle fig 3c can be divided into other minor cycles of the a b and c systems i e a1 a2 b1 etc where the finer sediment is at the bottom transgressive processes and gradually coarser sediment is at the top regressive processes the hydrogeological complex of alluvial fans represents the main recharging area of the deeper and confined aquifers of the alluvial plain the reno lavino rivers alluvial fan located at west of bologna city is more than 600 m thick and consists of multilayered fine coarse sediments where large and productive aquifer systems in the coarse sediments are separated by fine sediments aquitards the bottom of the alluvial aquifer in cycle a is about 250 m deep and in cycle b is about 400 m deep sections 1 and 2 of fig 3 all aquifers are interested by wells for withdrawals due to civil industrial and agricultural water uses in fig 2 the portions of phreatic and upper confined aquifers of the reno lavino rivers alluvial fan are shown the phreatic portion recharge area of the alluvial fan is located at the valley mouth of the rivers and is characterized by amalgamated gravel bodies which form a monolayer unconfined aquifer about 100 m thick the hydrogeological recharge is due to direct input by the rainfall and by the reno and lavino rivers the hydrogeological flux is directed from south west to north east towards the confined alluvial fan and po plain 2 data and method in order to monitor the water levels of aquifers close to the bologna city area fig 1b the regional agency for environmental protection arpa emilia romagna performed periodical measurement of depth to water in several cased wells piezometers the locations of the piezometers are shown in fig 1b 4 piezometers provide hourly water level measurement while in the remaining 25 locations unevenly throughout the network manual measurements have been carried out with recurrence times of few months about 3 months from the middle of 2003 to the middle of 2014 the observation time interval we study is centered around 2010 when the reno setta shunt was activated and it allows us to get from manual piezometers the largest number of continuous temporal series the pipe bottom depth of manual piezometers ranges from 30 m to about 450 m below the surface table s1 supporting information at depth the po plain is characterized by an alternation of confined and semi confined aquifers e g nespoli et al 2017 with different aquifer units shown in fig 3 the bottom depth of the piezometers is variable and some piezometers have open screens in multiple units the 90 of the piezometers communicates with confined aquifers table s1 we will see that regardless of their depth the water levels of all piezometers slightly increase during the observed period and in some piezometers a sharp increase occurs starting around 2010 the ground motions can be monitored by different techniques such as classic topographic ones and remote sensing methodologies like synthetic aperture radar sar and global navigation satellite system gnss in particular the continuous gnss stations cgnss can provide important information about the time evolution of the land surface elevation therefore they represent a useful tool to monitor and study the land subsidence we have considered all cgnss sites distributed in the po plain and surrounding areas fig 1a operating over the period january 1 2009 december 31 2018 the station management procedures are not homogeneous because they belong to different networks developed for different aims some of these have been developed for technical purposes real time positioning others for geological and geophysical studies crustal deformation monitoring in this study we included only the sites with an observation time longer than 9 years and with a ratio between the number of collected data and the number of observation days efficiency greater than 0 65 in our analysis we have also considered rainfall data to estimate the climatic and meteorological signals in the study area rainfall records from january 1 2009 december 31 2018 were downloaded from the arpae sim data sharing service https simc arpae it dext3r we have collected the daily rainfall time series of 62 sites located on the po plain and in the northern sector of the apennine chain fig 1 we have considered only the sites with efficiency in the observed time span greater than 80 and with gaps in the temporal series lower than 1 month 2 1 the rainfall data elaboration the daily rainfall time series acquired from the 62 stations located on the po plain and northern sector of the apennine chain fig 1 have been analyzed to highlight the main seasonal signals we have considered meaningful a signal with a period greater than 1 month and lower than half of the observation time span firstly we have computed the cumulated daily rainfall time series successively the linear trend has been estimated by a least square method and removed from the series then the stacked residual time series fig 4 has been analyzed using the lomb 1976 scargle 1982 method finding three meaningful seasonal signals in the study area one annual signal and two multiannual signals with periods of 2 8 y and 4 8 y respectively fig 4 inside the bologna metropolitan area the rain gauge located in the village of anzola dell emilia hereafter anzola fig 1b recorded daily rainfall observations within the whole time span therefore we will use the data of anzola to make a comparison with the piezometric data instead to study the effects of rainfall on cgnss stations that have a much larger spatial distribution we use the stacked residual time series it is worth to notice that within the observation time span of gnss time series the anzola time series does not significantly differ from the stacked residual time series fig 4 2 2 the piezometer data elaboration we performed a resampling fig s1 supporting information of raw piezometric data fig 5 computing a linear interpolation of each time series on discrete times with a regular step of 3 months which approximately corresponds to the sampling period of manual piezometers in the following analysis we removed the time series of automatic piezometers as they do not cover the entire time interval here studied we studied the detrended and demeaned piezometric temporal series by means of a principal component analysis pca jolliffe 1986 gewers et al 2018 savage and langbein 2008 this method performs a spatiotemporal separation of the piezometric data into a set of linearly uncorrelated principal components pcs which can be interpreted as signals due to the different sources generating the observed water level variations according to this method the first principal component pc1 has the largest possible variance so it explains much of the observation and the subsequent components are ordered with decreasing variance values in case of p time series with n epochs the data matrix x n p can be reconstructed by linearly summing up the contributions from all the components x i s i c i where the i th component contributes with the coefficient ci 1 p to the specific spatial distribution and with the score si n 1 to the temporal evolution the first two components explain together about 75 of the total variance pc1 64 pc2 10 and are shown in fig 6 it is worth to notice that in order to give to the reader an easier interpretation of the temporal evolution of the pcs we represent them in fig 6c with a reversed ordinate axis in this way a lowering of the curve represents a lowering of the water level i e an increasing of the depth to water and vice versa the temporal evolution of the first principal component s pc1 fig 6c is roughly characterized by a decreasing trend that lasts up to about 2010 1 knee point afterwards the s pc1 suddenly reverses its trend and starts to increase the knee point of s pc1 in fig 6c was found computing the time which minimizes the root mean square rms of two linear fits calculated at the left and at the right of a potential knee point respectively the spatial pattern of the first principal component c pc1 fig 6c is almost positive on the overall studied area this means that in almost all the piezometers the water level component associated to the pc1 increases starting from 2010 even if its magnitude is not uniform in fact the c pc1 is greater in the piezometers located in the western area of the city of bologna and it reaches its maximum near the wells used for withdrawal of water fig 6d the temporal evolution of the pc2 fig 6c seems to be related to a periodical multiannual signal with a period of about 5 years even if its spatial response fig 6e is much more heterogeneous than c pc1 2 3 the pca on water levels 2 3 1 pc1 the temporal behavior of pc1 fig 6 is strongly related to the water withdrawal changes that occurred in 2010 fig 2 s pc1 is sufficient to explain the 64 of the water level fluctuations this means that the anthropic withdrawal of water is the primary reason affecting water level fluctuations of aquifers in the study area the knee point we found on the s pc1 confirms that a water level increase started suddenly during 2010 and lasted until the end of the studied period this is also clear in many of the original data series of piezometers fig 5 where it is possible to visually identify a rapid increase in the water level starting from 2010 due to the removal of the linear trend of the data from the observation of s pc1 alone we would not be able to distinguish if the increase of the water level rate is permanent as it is assumed in the present work from the case of a transient decrease followed by a transient increase bulge shaped temporal evolution fig s2 the only way to discriminate which of the two cases occurred is the observation of the original raw data that is fundamental it is worth to notice that c pc1 fig 6d has the largest values close to three westward withdrawal wells fig 2a which after the 2010 reno setta shunt were much less exploited than before regione emilia romagna and arpae 2018 2 3 2 pc2 the normalized temporal behavior of pc2 that explains 10 of the variance is plotted together with the cumulated detrended and normalized evolution of rainfall recorded by the rain gauge located near the village of anzola fig 1b the two time series fig 7 have a moderate cross correlation with pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 62 and vanishing time lag accordingly the pc2 is likely due to rainfall which acts on the water levels measured by the piezometers the retrieved vanishing lag is likely an undetectable finite lag i e a delay smaller than the sampling rate of the data 3 4 months apparently no particular pattern can be found in the spatial response of pc2 fig 6e the amplitude of which seems to be unrelated to the distance from the mountains possible recharge area e g regione emilia romagna and eni agip 1998 marcaccio and martinelli 2012 or from the main water bodies nevertheless the magnitude of c pc2 is greater in agricultural or farming zones fig 7c and at the piezometers with a small depth fig 7e this is in accordance with the fact that deep confined aquifers are less affected by rainfall with respect to the shallowest unconfined aquifer as already found by nespoli et al 2017 instead all industrial piezometers have a very small response to pc2 the same thing is not true for pc1 since its spatial response does not significantly depend on use nor on depth fig 7b and d 2 4 the gnss data elaboration the daily gnss phase observations of the 57 sites acquired with a 30 s sampling rate were analyzed using the gamit software herring et al 2018a and adopting a distributed procedure cenni et al 2012 2013 to obtain continuous time series in all the stations to this aim we have firstly applied tight constraints to the precise ephemerides and earth orientation parameters eop provided by the international gnss service igs and loose constraints 100 m at the locations of all sites the atmospheric propagation delay has been modeled using the global mapping function boehm et al 2006 and the model fes2004 lyard et al 2006 was adopted for the ocean loading the igs absolute antenna phase centre models for satellites and ground station antennas have been also adopted in the data processing the daily solutions of clusters have been combined using the globk software herring et al 2018b each solution has been included in the itrf14 reference frame using the igs coordinates and the velocities of the 14 sites shown in the inset of fig 1 altamimi et al 2016 the eurasian plate motion modeled as suggested by altamimi et al 2016 has been removed from the horizontal velocities of all sites at the end of the procedure we have obtained the daily time series of the north east and vertical components the time evolution of the series y k t i can be modelled following the relation 1 y k t i y 0 k v k t i j 1 n d kj h t i t j n 1 m b 1 k n c o s 2 π t i p k n b 2 k n s i n 2 π t i p k n k t i where k represents the component k 1 2 3 for the north east and vertical component y0k and vk are the initial position and velocity trend respectively the discontinuities due to instrumental changes and seismic events occurred near the sites are modeled with the dkj terms εk ti represents a time dependent noise and b1kn and b2kn are the amplitudes of the periodic signals with period pkn we have supposed that the trend is constant in the entire time span analyzed during a preliminary phase only the initial position velocity discontinuities and noise have been estimated by a weighted least squares method imposing b1kn and b2kn equal to 0 a model has been computed by means of the parameters estimated and it was removed from the real time series to obtain residual time series the residual time series have been successively analyzed with a nonlinear least squares technique to estimate spectra following the lomb 1976 scargle 1982 approach the spectrum of each component has been analyzed to estimate the period pkn of the five statistically meaningful principal signals in the interval between one month and half of the observation time span successively the m m 5 periods pkn have been assumed in eq 1 to estimate by a weighted least square method the b1kn and b2kn parameters and more precise values of the initial position velocity and discontinuities the obtained velocity field for the vertical component vertical kinematic pattern is shown in fig s3 estimated velocities values constant on the entire time span are reported in table s2 with related uncertainties hackl et al 2011 the principal features of this velocity field will be described later the time series obtained by removing outliers and estimated discontinuities have been analyzed by a pca method e g jolliffe 1986 gewers et al 2018 savage and langbein 2008 to this aim for each gnss site the gaps in the non detrended time series have been filled following eq 1 using the estimated parameters combined with a white noise model the latter is characterized by an amplitude equal to the weighted root mean square value of the observed temporal series for the vertical component a velocity value of each principal component has been estimated using the model described in the following equation 2 f t i a v t i c 1 c o s 2 π t i p c 2 s i n 2 π t i p where a and v are the initial position and velocity c1 and c2 are the amplitude of sine and cosine functions of the principal seasonal signal in the time series the period p of which has been estimated by the lomb scargle method lomb 1976 scargle 1982 and ε represents the noise these parameters are reported in table 1 with uncertainties evaluated supposing a colored noise in the principal component time series hackl et al 2011 2 4 1 the pca on gnss observations analogously to the pca performed on piezometric data we indicate the temporal and spatial distributions of the principal components of gnss data as s gpcs and c gpcs respectively the first 5 principal components fig 8 describe the 80 of the variance in order to tentatively assess a possible origin of the seasonal signals observed in the gnss time series we compared the spectrum of the stacked temporal series of rain gauges fig 4 with the one of s gpcs s 1 2 5 fig 9 an annual cycle with a mean amplitude of about 1 mm table 1 is the principal seasonal signal of the s gpcs and can be likely related to meteorological phenomena annual periodic signals can be attributed to the variations of the regional mass loading atmospheric oceanic and hydrological loading e g argus et al 2014 li et al 2017 liu et al 2017 van dam et al 2007 the correlation between each s gpcs and the cumulated rainfall is quite low except for s gpc3 pearson s coefficient 0 6 table 2 fig 9 also suggests that s gpc2 s gpc3 and s gpc4 as well as the rainfall time series contain a multi seasonal signal antolini et al 2016 detected a multi year signals in the temporal distribution of rainfall in the eastern sector of the po plain furthermore recent studies e g adusumilli et al 2019 nespoli et al 2018 serpelloni et al 2018 silverii et al 2016 found multiyear deformation in gnss time series accordingly the peak at about 5 years in the spectra of fig 9 likely characterizes a climatic multi seasonal signal that the relatively short time series considered is not able to define completely 2 4 2 gpc1 the first principal component of the gnss time series gpc1 accounts for about the 67 of the variance the spatial c gpc1 and temporal s gpc1 pattern of the first component are shown in fig 8b c gpc1 resembles the vertical kinematic pattern fig s3 showing that the land subsidence mostly occurred in relatively limited areas which are characterized by vertical velocities lower than 6 mm y table 1 a few sites mainly located on the eastern sector of the po plain are characterized by a subsidence velocity greater than 2 3 mm y the other principal components have a very small velocity table 1 with respect to the one of gpc1 so we can argue that the linear dependence on time of the gnss signal of vertical displacement is almost completely described by gpc1 2 4 3 gpc2 and gpc3 the second and third principal components can be considered as a common mode of the network as more than 50 of the cgnss stations have a response 25 fig 8c and d it is worth to notice that at the gnss locations characterized by subsidence rates greater than 3 4 mm y c gpc2 is very low or even vanishing fig 8b to be compared with fig 8c this could suggest that the first and second components are not completely separated as confirmed by the correlation about 0 8 table 2 between s gpc2 and the residual values of the s gpc1 signal obtained by removing the linear trend s gpc1r however we will see that this result does not significantly affect the present analysis there is a noticeable agreement between the spectra of residual cumulative rainfall s gpc2 and s gpc3 in terms of peak periods fig 9 even if the annual signal and the other peaks periods 2 y 2 8 y and 5 0 y have been detected with different power in the three spectra in the s gpc2 spectrum the multi seasonal signal is the largest one while in the s gpc3 the annual cycle prevails over the multi seasonal signal hence both gpc2 and gpc3 components likely represent the response of the ground soil to the rainfall but they are mainly related to the long period and short period rainfall variations respectively to represent the total response to rainfall variations fig 10 shows the results obtained adding gpc3 to gpc2 in each cgnss station we determine if the gpc2 gpc3 effect is in phase blue circles in fig 10a or in opposition of phase red circles with the stacked temporal series of rainfall this is evaluated on the basis of the rms computed between the rainfall time series and the time dependent response of each station to gpc2 gpc3 or gpc2 gpc3 table s2 if the rms of gpc2 gpc3 is lower than rms of gpc2 gpc3 the cgnss station is assumed in phase with rainfall e g blgn station fig 10b otherwise it is assumed in opposition of phase with rainfall e g mo02 station in fig 10b the rain induced displacements are in phase with rainfall in mostly of the stations located in the po plain while they are in opposition of phase in stations located on the apennines chain this means that an increase of meteoric recharge or equivalently an increase of the water level leads to uplift in the po plain and subsidence in the apennines chain and vice versa for completeness the results obtained applying this method to the sum gpc1r gpc2 gpc3 fig s4 do not alter this finding the rain induced uplift occurring in the po plain can be likely due to the poro elastic deformation of the soil an increase of the water table leads to an expansion of the porous permeable aquifers of the po plain and therefore it involves uplift as yet envisaged in other aquifer systems e g wisely and schmidt 2010 king et al 2007 an estimation of the poro elastic effect on vertical displacement at the surface u z p with z pointing downward can be computed directly from water table fluctuations as wang 2000 wisely and schmidt 2010 3 u z p s b δ h w where s is the specific storage b is the thickness of the aquifer unit subjected to poro elastic deformation and δ h w is the variation of water table in the assumption of incompressible solid grains and pores the specific storage of the aquifer can be expressed in terms of the porosity ϕ the density of water ρw and the vertical incompressibility of the aquifer kv and water kf as 4 s ρ w g 1 k v ϕ k f with k v k 4 μ 3 where g is the gravity and k and μ are the drained incompressibility and the shear modulus of the rocks of the aquifer respectively following nespoli et al 2016 we consider a low shear modulus for the shallowest layers of the po plain μ 0 40 gpa a porosity ϕ 0 2 and b 130 m as a thickness of shallow aquifers assuming g 9 81 m s2 k 0 61 gpa for a drained poisson s number ν 0 25 kf 2 20 gpa ρw 1000 kg m3 for a water table increase of 5 m which represents about the peak to peak seasonal variations of the water table measured by the piezometers figs 5 and 6 we estimate an uplift u z p 6 mm in agreement with the magnitude of the annual amplitude of surface displacements of gpc2 gpc3 fig 10b contrariwise to the cgnss stations located in the po plain the stations located on the apennines chain are in opposition of phase with the rain this means that far from the po plain aquifers the poro elastic effects are not the primary mechanism affecting the ground deformation fig 10 several authors found an anti correlation between the uplift and the water table fluctuations e g silverii et al 2016 amos et al 2014 in these cases the purely elastic effect due to the hydrological loading which produces a displacement of opposite sign with respect to the poro elastic effect prevails following tsai 2011 we can estimate the purely elastic vertical displacement u z e at the surface of an elastic half space due to a periodic hydrostatic load variation in space along x as 5 u z e 1 ν ϕ p 0 ke s i n k x 1 2 ν where p 0 ρ w g δ h w is the amplitude of pore pressure variations e 9kμ 3k μ is the young modulus of the half space and k is the wave number k 2π λ with λ wavelength considering average values over depth of the elastic parameters representing the study region e 75 gpa and ν 0 25 nespoli et al 2017 and a wavelength of the same magnitude of the study area dimension λ 200 km for δ h w 5 m according to 5 the maximum elastic displacement is u z e 3 mm 2 4 4 gpc4 and gpc5 the spatial response of the gpc4 fig 8e is greater than 70 in absolute value in only three sites ctmg parm and btac fig 8a and table s2 and it is characterized by the largest annual signal table 1 with an amplitude larger than 3 mm due to its very heterogeneous spatial distribution c gpc4 this component cannot be considered as a common mode it likely describes a local phenomenon such as for example anthropic water withdrawal furthermore differently from gpc2 and gpc3 the temporal evolution of gpc4 is not correlated with rainfall table 2 the minimum values of the annual signals fall in the winter season first part of the year so we suggest that the most likely origin of this signal may stem from the massive local anthropic groundwater withdrawal in fact the three cgnss stations which have the largest response are located near or inside the industrial areas of parma parm in fig 8a and bologna ctmg that are the most populated cities of the emilia romagna region and in the agricultural area close to the bonavigo village btac however as we do not have pumping data of these areas we cannot quantitatively study this component and further investigation is left to future developments according to the spatial response of the gpc5 fig 8f only two cgnss stations bolg and blgn in fig 1b located in the bologna city area have a response greater than 60 both stations are very close to the wells used for the withdrawal of water in the city of bologna figs 2a and 6a the temporal evolution of gpc5 is not characterized by a linear trend neither a significant seasonal signal table 1 but it has a knee point indicating a velocity change in the second half of 2010 hence this component is likely due to the variation of water withdrawal that took place during 2010 the velocities before and after the knee point has been computed using the two different time spans 1 2009 2010 5 and 2010 5 2019 2 2009 2011 and 2011 2019 table 1 we estimated a sharp variation from 4 1 mm y during 2009 2011 to 0 1 mm y during 2011 2019 3 discussion in the present work we analyzed three different datasets i time series of rain gauges placed in the southeastern border of the po plain northern italy ii water table fluctuations measured by the net of piezometers in the metropolitan city area of bologna iii vertical ground displacements measured by the cgnss stations during the period 2003 2019 both water table fluctuations and surface displacements are influenced by the same natural e g rainfall and anthropogenic e g water withdrawal hydrological signals but each of them responded in a peculiar way it is worth to notice that two mainshocks with mw 6 1 and 6 0 occurred in the po plain in may 2012 about 40 km north of bologna nevertheless both the afterslip and poro elastic effects of the two shocks were estimated to be negligible one year after the earthquake especially in the far field nespoli et al 2018 in order to separate the main hydrological effects we performed a principal component analysis on each dataset from the pca on piezometers fig 6 we found that the strongest signal pc1 64 of variance explained is due to the anthropic induced change of water withdrawal occurred in the 2010 in the bologna area this signal is well clear in the temporal evolution of pc1 fig 6c which reflects an abrupt increase of the water level starting in 2010 furthermore from the spatial response of pc1 fig 6d we can assess that even if the major increase about 15 m fig 6 of the water level occurred in the area surrounding the three westward withdrawal wells figs 2 and 6 where the withdrawal reduction was maximum after 2010 a water level increase up to 9 m occurred at least as far as 20 km from bologna this is because the aquifers of the po plain constituted by multi layered sequences e g marcaccio and martinelli 2012 are strongly confined vertically but not horizontally nespoli et al 2016 due to the high lateral communication of the aquifer units the anthropogenic effects can have a wide spatial response the second principal component pc2 of piezometric temporal series is correlated with rainfall r 0 62 as confirmed by the visual superposition of the normalized curves of cumulated detrended rainfall and s pc2 fig 7a both the fact that s pc2 and rainfall correlate with zero time lag at least with a piezometric sampling rate of 3 4 months and that the rainfall response is greater in shallow piezometers fig 7e indicate that the main effects of precipitation are due to the fast input of water from the top of the shallowest aquifers accordingly from the pc2 we can assess that in the study area the hydrologic response of the soil to rainfall is rapid with characteristic times lower than 3 4 months but also very variable in space this result is in accordance with findings for the vancouver island of fannin et al 2000 who concluded that piezometers located 20 m apart exhibited markedly different groundwater response even if the rainfall is quite uniform in the studied area fig 3 it may lead a heterogeneous spatial response of piezometers as depending on very local parameters e g soil types evapo transpiration urbanization piezometer usage etc therefore our results indicate that the use of the pca is fundamental in order to extract this signal that would not have been spotted through a visual observation of the data fig 5 we can attempt an interpretation of the different spatial response of piezometers to rainfall based on the different use of wells fig 7c since apparently industrial piezometers have a lower response than piezometers for agricultural farms use this could be related to the fact that during the summer period the rainfall is lower accordingly the withdrawal of ground water for agricultural use in summer is greater with respect to the winter period so the response of the water level to the rainfall could be amplified conversely as the industry needs a constant supply of water regardless of the precipitations the same effect could be less visible several methods have been developed to detect anomalous signals in geophysical displacement time series such as the principal component analysis e g savage and langbein 2008 dong et al 2006 clustering e g savage and simpson 2013 the relative strength index e g crowell et al 2016 or moving windows baldi et al 2008 we performed a principal component analysis also on the cgnss data gpca using the time series of vertical displacements we chose to analyze non detrended time series in order to i introduce the least possible a priori constraints in the gpca analysis ii check that the gpca analysis correctly recognizes the subsidence kinematic pattern in the study area fig 8b it is worth to notice that the gpca on vertical displacements allowed us to estimate the effects of both the variation of the water withdrawal occurred in 2010 and the rainfall the same source signals are recovered from piezometric data but in the case of cgnss data the variance explained by the anthropogenic component gpc5 is much lower 1 5 than the one explained by the precipitation related components gpc2 and gpc3 the component explaining the greatest variance 67 gpc1 is the one related to the subsidence and shows that the four cgnss sites located in the bologna city and surrounding areas bolo bolg blgn and ctmg fig 1b are characterized by low velocities mostly comparable to estimated uncertainties of about 1 mm y the gpc1 indicates a significative reduction of the land subsidence rates in the po plain over the whole studied period january 1 2009 december 31 2018 with respect to the up to 10 mm y estimates made by other authors in previous periods e g baldi et al 2009 bonsignore 2008 cenni et al 2013 devoti et al 2017 stramondo et al 2007 furthermore as evidenced by gpc5 we found that an additional variation from 4 1 to 0 1 mm y of the vertical velocity also occurred inside the observation time span appearing as a knee point in the cgnss time series we found that the displacements of gpc2 gpc3 see e g yan et al 2019 for an independent component analysis are in phase with rainfall in most of the cgnss stations located in the po plain while they are in phase opposition in stations placed on the apennines fig 10 this response is likely due to the different kind of soil in the po plain and in the apennines chain fig 3 in the latter the surface vertical displacement due to the rainfall is almost purely elastic accordingly a sudden change of water loading results into an instantaneous lowering of the soil as envisaged also in southern apennines silverii et al 2016 and in other zones of the world e g amos et al 2014 fu and freymueller 2012 yan et al 2019 the shallow soil of the po plain instead is mostly characterized by an alternation of sand gravels silts and clay especially in the alluvial fan areas fig 2 near the apennine chain e g nespoli et al 2015 marcaccio and martinelli 2012 clay deposits can easily behave like expansive soils undergoing large volume changes when increasing the water content e g estabragh et al 2013 accounting for the elastic parameters of the crust of the studied region and assuming a poro elastic expansion of the aquifers of the po plain we estimated that the poro elastic displacements can be significantly higher than the elastic ones u z p 6 mm u z e 3 mm moreover it is worth to notice that as u z p linearly depends on the aquifer thickness b its value can be locally greater or smaller with respect to our assumption of its average value for the po plain b 130 m the gpc5 fig 8f is strongly localized in the bologna city area very close to the wells used for water withdrawal fig 2 and its temporal evolution is characterized by a knee point indicating a velocity change in 2010 the abrupt change of vertical velocity is likely due to the variation of the civil use of the groundwater reservoirs occurred in the middle of 2010 this result is in good agreement with the piezometric water level changes estimated by pc1 fig 6 and suggests that our methodology was successful in detecting and quantifying the 2010 anthropic contribution to both water level variations and subsidence rates 4 conclusions in this paper we test a methodology for the retrieval of an anthropic effect in two different data sets vertical displacements measured by continuous gnss sites and piezometric water table fluctuations the data sets have been analyzed by means of the principal component analysis pca and compared to rainfall time series from the po plain rain gauges the limitations due to the different sampling rate in our case one day for gnss and about three months for piezometric data and discontinuous observation time span in the available datasets as well as the spatial heterogeneity of related networks fig 1 represent a problem challenge in subsidence studies where the goal is to avoid unverified assumptions about the spatial and temporal variation of the analyzed phenomena we showed that the analysis of pca results represents a well assessed possible solution to such problems despite the different kind of available data rainfall piezometric level and gnss time series our approach enabled us to study the complex interaction between the underlying processes we found that this interaction is not trivial as it consists in a combination of natural and anthropic phenomena that can act on different time and spatial scales even within the same dataset the suggested approach consists in a two step procedure a retrieval of the main statistically important signals by means of pca application to the observed time series of each dataset b the comparison of principal modes and their spectrum in order to detect similar signals in different datasets this approach gave us the possibility to detect the multiannual on a time scale of at least five years fig 9 regional signal due to rainfall in both piezometric and gnss vertical time series in the bologna metropolitan area fig 1b we were also able to separate the 2010 withdrawal change effects on the vertical displacements and piezometric levels from the other signals these effects are localized within a radius of about 20 km from the withdrawal wells fig 2a while the analysis of piezometric data shows a clear increase in the water level following the withdrawal decrease the anthropic induced surface displacements are significantly smaller about few mm than the ones locally induced by rainfall about 10 mm accordingly without a multivariate analysis such effect on vertical displacements would have remained hidden in the raw time series it is worth to notice that after 2010 the subsidence rate in the bologna city area is decreased of about 4 mm y this represents an important contribution to reducing the long term subsidence effects e g it prevents a soil lowering of 40 mm after 10 years then we can assess that the preventive measures adopted in the bologna area with the aim of reducing the soil subsidence and the depletion of water resources for drinking agricultural and industrial use have been successfull the suggested approach allowed us to interpret the interaction between groundwater changes induced by rainfall on time scale larger than months with vertical displacements at the earth surface in terms of the peculiar geological context we have observed a different response of cgnss vertical movements at the rainfall stress as depending on the location of the sites sedimentary plain or hill mountain this result implies that when the geological context of the study area is not homogeneous to correctly model the rainfall contribution to the vertical movement of the surface it is necessary to consider different prevailing effects elastic in the case of mountains and poro elastic in the case of the sedimentary plain here we have estimated that the poro elastic effect is about twice the elastic one the results obtained in the present work suggest that the combined observation of gnss and piezometers time series rainfall data geological setting and the use of pca are very important in order to get a complete understanding of the anthropic and natural signals in cases of aquifer over exploitation the study of such interaction can provide precious hints to assess the best practices for the governance of groundwater

4701,the study of unsaturated behavior of soils pivots around the relationship between soil suction and the amount of water content present in the soil mass which is termed as soil water retention curve swrc the drying swrc is generally determined by neglecting the volume change behavior of the soil for low plastic soils such a procedure is bound by an inherent assumption that the soil exhibit zero or negligible volume change and can lead to approximations in important swrc parameters including saturated volumetric water content residual water content and fitting parameters which are essential for the estimation of unsaturated hydraulic characteristics of the soil this study deals with the determination of swrc parameters for a range of soils starting from non plastic to high plastic soils with and without considering volume change characteristics for this purpose the swrc of six different natural soils were experimentally measured using a miniature tensiometer t5 and a dew point potentiometer wp4c while the vsc of the used soils were measured using the balloon method efforts were made to critically understand the influence of no volume change assumption on the swrc parameters unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function and flow of water through 1d soil column the experimental results indicated that the no volume change assumption underpredicted the water retention curves of low plastic soils and this error in swrc increases with the soil plasticity the measured vsc of the used soils further revealed that there could be a range of saturated volumetric water content vwc depending on the initial state of the soil sample which also influences the sensitivity of the swrc parameters therefore the present study proposed a new methodology to determine unambiguous swrc in terms of vwc suction for a particular soil type combining both the measured vsc data and swrc data based on the obtained results it was recommended that the details of vsc must be incorporated along with the measured swrc data for soils having plasticity and clay content higher than 15 and 11 respectively keywords soil water retention curve tensiometer dew point potentiometer volumetric shrinkage curve balloon method 1 introduction understanding the basic principles of unsaturated soil mechanics is extremely important for finding solutions to the wide range of geoenvironmental problems associated with the unsaturated slope instability rainfall infiltration kim et al 2004 yang et al 2006 gavin and xue 2008 lee et al 2011 waste containment facilities or nuclear waste disposal miller et al 2000 durmusoglu et al 2006 ng et al 2016 rahardjo et al 2016 pavement engineering projects yang et al 2008 cary and zapata 2014 turco et al 2017 and solute transport through the vadose zone mohamed et al 2000 malaya and sreedeep 2012 any study related to unsaturated soil mechanics necessitates the soil water retention curve swrc as the primary input which is a constitutive relationship between soil suction or negative pore water pressure and soil moisture content presented in terms of either gravimetric or volumetric or degree of saturation the swrc parameters are very important for the estimation of unsaturated soil properties such as shear strength fredlund et al 1996 zhai et al 2019 2020a 2020b and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity van genuchten 1980 mbonimpa et al 2006 ghanbarian et al 2015 haghverdi et al 2018 therefore proper understanding and determination of the swrc parameters are most important zhai and rahardjo 2012 one of the major issues while determining the swrc parameters is that the soil is often considered as rigid mass i e ignoring the volume change during drying wetting especially for low to medium plastic soils the measurement of void ratio e of the soil sample during drying process is required to incorporate the influence of volume change on the swrc such an information can be obtained from the volumetric shrinkage curve vsc which is a graphical representation of volume of the sample or void ratio and the corresponding water content gravimetric or volumetric during different stages of drying bensallam et al 2012 wijaya et al 2015 a typical representation of vsc was presented in fig 1 which consists of four distinguished phases including structural shrinkage normal shrinkage residual shrinkage and zero shrinkage from the wet side to dry side in the structural shrinkage and residual shrinkage the reduction of sample volume is less than the amount of water loss the water loss in the structural shrinkage phase is governed by the extraction of free water localized in the inter aggregate pores whereas the water extraction occurs from the intra aggregate pores in the residual shrinkage phase bensallam et al 2012 the intersection point between normal shrinkage and residual shrinkage is known as air entry point aep because the desaturation of soil sample starts after this point cornelis et al 2006 the soil volume remains almost constant in the zero shrinkage phase and the water content at which soil volume becomes constant is known as the shrinkage limit a precise and simultaneous measurement of soil bulk volume over the whole range of water content is very important for an accurate determination of vsc past studies péron et al 2007 tripathy et al 2014 gapak et al 2017 have highlighted different laboratory methods to measure soil volume using liquid displacement methods following the archimedes law with the effective utilization of surface coating materials such as adhesive resin glue and wax krosley et al 2003 de almeida et al 2009 astm d7263 09 2018 the disadvantage of this method is that the coating materials do not make proper contact with the soil clod for most of the occasions which may result in water penetration or the presence of air bubbles inside the coating layer there are different direct measurement methods available for measuring the soil volume using vernier calipers or using displacement transducers berndt and coughlan 1976 braudeau et al 1999 birle et al 2008 peron et al 2009 and by digital image analysis julina and thyagaraj 2018 li et al 2019 amenuvor et al 2020 however comparative studies have shown that the balloon method as proposed by tariq and durnford 1993 is one of the most accurate methods for the measurement of both soil volume and water content using a single sample cornelis et al 2006 there are not many studies present in the literature that have effectively used the balloon method to incorporate the effect of volume change during drying on the swrc of low plastic natural soils the concept of swrc was first developed for soil physics and agriculture related discipline to quantify the amount of water storage in the soil at different suction in those cases a simple volumetric water content vwc versus suction plot with an assumption that there is no considerable volume change in soil with increasing suction can serve the purpose solone et al 2012 fredlund and houston 2013 the application of swrc is quite different in subsurface environmental problems involving the fluid flow and solute transport through the vadose zone and hence the assumption of no volume change during drying in low plastic soil may not be valid for many of the cases where a considerable amount of volume change occurs but conveniently neglected there are a lot of studies present in the literature that discussed the importance of considering volume change for high plastic clay and expansive soils which undergo significant volume change during the drying or wetting stage for developing swrc pham and fredlund 2008 qi and michel 2011 fredlund and houston 2013 tripathy et al 2014 wijaya et al 2015 lu and dong 2017 zhai et al 2020c these studies clearly indicated that ignoring the volume change of soil during drying leads to an inappropriate determination of swrc for soils with high plasticity however it is also very true that even low plastic soils can undergo a considerable amount of volume change which may have a significant effect on swrc and its parameters it was noted from the previous studies that the sensitivity of volume change on swrc parameters and unsaturated soil properties had not been properly quantified for low plastic soils moreover there has to be a proper guideline for low plastic soils to determine unambiguous swrc by taking the volume change consideration that can be used for an accurate estimation of unsaturated soil properties the objective of this study is to investigate the importance of vsc for swrc determination in low to medium plastic soils efforts were made to evaluate the range of plasticity and clay content beyond which the consideration of vsc data becomes mandatory for the swrc determination for this purpose six different soils with a wide range of plasticity starting from non plastic to high plastic soils were collected the swrc of the selected soils were experimentally measured using a miniature tensiometer for the initial portion of drying and a dew point potentiometer wp4c for the higher suction range while the vsc of the selected soils were measured using the balloon method the measured vsc was used to quantify the error in the determination of swrc and its parameters due to the no volume change assumption for low plastic soils the importance of vsc on the estimated unsaturated soil properties was further illustrated by simulating one dimensional flow of water through a 1 m soil column using hydrus 1d based on the observed results an attempt was made to evolve a guideline on using vsc for an accurate determination of swrc 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials a total six numbers of locally available natural soils were collected from different regions of north east india brahmaputra river bank and hill slopes inside iit guwahati campus with the soil plasticity varying from non plastic to high plastic this wide variation in the soil plasticity and particle size was selected to evolve the guideline on the utilization of vsc data based on soil plasticity and clay content the

further classified as per the unified soil classification system uscs guideline reported in astm d2487 2011 and presented in fig 2 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 determination of swrc measurement of drying swrc requires continuous drying data of soil suction and corresponding water content from a fully saturated state to a nearly dry state a miniature tensiometer t5 ums gmbh 2001 was used to measure the soil suction in the lower suction range suction 80 kpa whereas a dew point potentiometer model wp4c meter group inc usa was used to measure the soil suction up to 100 mpa saha and sekharan 2021 tensiometer is the simplest and accurate suction measuring instrument that can directly measure the matric suction ψm of soil samples nam et al 2009 the t5 tensiometer consists of a ceramic cup an acrylic shaft filled with deionized water and a pressure sensor electronic transducer at the top during the suction measurement water present in the shaft gets in equilibrium with the water present in the soil through the ceramic interface the changes in water pressure in the tensiometer shaft are electronically captured and converted to pressure good contact between the ceramic disk and soil is extremely important to maintain the saturation link between the soil pore water and the instrument this ensures the negative pressure or suction in the soil is identical to the pressure developed in the tensiometer shaft on the other hand the dew point potentiometer works on the principle of chilled mirror hygrometer technique to determine the relative humidity of the sample fredlund and rahardjo 1993 sreedeep and singh 2011 it is one of the most accurate devices available for suction measurement in dry end of the swrc jensen et al 2015 hardie and almajmaie 2019 the device consists of a sealed chamber with a cooling fan a mirror a photoelectric cell and an infrared thermometer the soil samples need to be poured in a plastic or stainless steel container with a diameter of 40 cm which is placed in the tray and subsequently moved into the temperature controlled chamber where the sample gets in equilibrium with the chamber environment the photoelectric cell detects the first sign of condensation on the mirror and the temperature at which the moisture appears at the mirror is noted as dew point the vapor pressure above the soil specimen in the chamber and the saturated vapor pressure at the same temperature are computed using the dew point temperature and the sample temperature the total suction ψ of the sample is calculated by kelvin s equation as presented in eq 1 fredlund and rahardjo 1993 1 ψ r t v wo ω v l n u v u v 0 where r is the universal molar gas constant t is the absolute temperature k v wo is the specific volume of water ω v is the molecular mass of water u v 0 is the saturation pressure of water vapor kpa and u v is the partial pressure of pore water vapor kpa it can be noted that the tensiometer measures ψm whereas the wp4c measures the total suction of soil which is a combination of ψm and osmotic suction ψo therefore it is important to ensure that there is no measurable ψo component during the wp4c measurement for a meaningful coalescence of the t5 and wp4c measured data past studies have shown that ψo of soil is mainly attributed to the presence of dissolved salt in the soil pore solution krahn and fredlund 1972 miller and nelson 2006 tripathy et al 2016 therefore the repeated soil washing with deionized water procedure as reported in the literature sreedeep and singh 2011 abhijit and sreedeep 2015 saha et al 2020 was followed to ensure that the electrical conductivity ec of soil is sufficiently low ec 1 ms cm and there is no measurable ψo component in the soil sample hence the measured swrc using t5 and wp4c can be combined prior to the suction measurement air dried soil samples passing through 2 mm sieve were thoroughly mixed with a sufficiently high amount of deionized water to attain a water content close to the liquid limit to ensure complete saturation suction close to zero the sample was then sealed in a disposable plastic bag and kept in a humidity controlled chamber for three days to ensure the uniform distribution of moisture within the sample thereafter the wet soil sample was placed into a pvc column of diameter 20 cm and height 25 cm along with a miniature tensiometer t5 and moisture sensor 5tm placed horizontally in the mid depth of the sample fig 3 it was ensured that the tip of both the instruments remains at the same horizontal level to avoid any spatial variation in the suction moisture content measurement the t5 tensiometer and 5tm sensor were connected to the dl6 datalogger and em50 datalogger respectively to record the suction and moisture content at certain time intervals 12 h the whole test setup was subjected to ambient drying conditions avg temp 25 c avg relative humidity 75 for continuous monitoring of swrc up to a ψ value of 80 kpa for the wp4c measurement the soil sample with the same initial water content as used for t5 measurement was filled in the wp4c sample cup using a spatula and placed in the block chamber of wp4c for suction measurement the weight of the sample was measured using a high precision balance having an accuracy of 0 0001 g after each suction measurement the sample cup was left in the ambient condition avg temp 25 c avg relative humidity 75 for further drying until the next measurement was taken the whole process was repeated until the soil sample reaches its residual state where the decrease in the sample weight becomes negligible at the end of the test the oven dry weight of the sample was measured and gravimetric water content w corresponding to measured suction values were calculated 2 2 2 volumetric shrinkage curve vsc measurement the balloon method developed by tariq and durnford 1993 was used in the present study to measure the vsc for the used soils the balloon method setup as shown in fig 4 a was fabricated in house to experimentally measure the vsc the initial sample preparation and initial compaction state of soil were kept similar to that of suction measurement an amount of 60 to 80 g of air dried soil passing through 2 mm sieve was mixed with deionized water to achieve the water content equal to the t5 and wp4c samples the sample was placed in a rubber balloon with continuous tapping to remove the air void present in the sample a rubber cork with inlet and outlet pipes connected to an aquarium air pump was attached at the neck of the balloon ref fig 4b at very low pressure with a flow rate of 50 100 l min dry air was allowed to pass over the sample through the inlet pipe for sample drying and the moist air exit through the outlet pipe during the drying stage both the inlet and outlet valves were kept open this process of water extraction by flowing dry air into the soil sample resulted in a slow drying close to air dry condition and ensured the prevention of crack in the sample at regular intervals of time the weight and the volume of the sample was measured the volume of the sample was measured by the liquid displacement method following archimedes principle fig 4 b the weight of the displaced water was measured using an electronic balance prior to the volume measurement a suction pump was used closing the inlet and outlet valve to suck out the air present in the balloon to minimize the error which may occur due to the volume of air for the measurement of weight the sample was detached from the inlet and outlet pipes and the weight of the sample was measured in an electronic balance it generally takes about two to three weeks for the complete drying of the sample depending on the soil plasticity the oven dried weights of the used samples were taken to calculate the gravimetric water content at every stage of drying the void ratios of the used samples corresponding to the measured water contents were calculated from the measured volume of soil and oven dry weight of the samples using eq 2 2 e v v v s v v s v s v w d g γ w w d g γ w g γ w v w d w d here e is the void ratio v v is the volume of voids v s is the volume of solid where v s w d g γ w γ w are the unit weight of water w d is the oven dry weight of the sample v is the volume of soil sample and g is the specific gravity of the soil now the volumetric water content vwc of the sample can be calculated using the following relationship 3 θ w γ d γ w where θ represents the vwc γ d is the dry density of soil and can be obtained from eq 4 4 γ d w d v the degree of saturation s of the sample can be calculated from 5 s wg e three identical soil samples were prepared for each of the used soil to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of the measured vsc data 2 2 3 estimation of unsaturated soil properties the measured swrc was fitted to the equation eq 6 proposed by van genuchten 1980 to obtain the swrc fitting parameters the fitted swrc parameters are an essential input for modeling the flow of water through unsaturated soils 6 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 a vg ψ n vg m vg here θ ψ is the vwc at any suction ψ a vg is the parameter related to the air entry value of soil n vg is the parameter related to the rate of water extraction from soil m vg is the parameter related to the residual water content of the soil θ s is the saturated vwc and θ r is the residual vwc the parameter m vg was calculated using the below relationship proposed by mualem 1976 7 m vg 1 1 n vg the present study used a well established computer code retc version 6 02 van genuchten et al 1991 to obtain the above swrc parameters using a nonlinear least square optimization technique retc was also used to obtain the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function ku based on the measured swrc and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the used soils using the following hydraulic conductivity model eq 8 as proposed by mualem 1976 8 k u k sat θ l θ 0 1 ψ x d x 1 0 1 ψ x d x here k sat is saturated hydraulic conductivity l is pore connectivity parameter approximately equal to 0 5 mualem 1976 and θ the dimensionless vwc which can be obtained from eq 9 9 θ ψ θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 2 2 4 water flow modeling the present study used hydrus 1d version 4 04 simunek et al 2005 to stimulate one dimensional 1d water flow through a 1 m soil column to predict the moisture and suction profile variation with time and cumulative infiltration at the bottom or basal percolation after certain time interval the stimulation was performed to understand the influence of the error in swrc measurement with no volume change assumption on the flow characteristics of the low plastic soils the computer based program hydrus 1d was used for numerically solving the richards equation richards 1931 as presented by eq 10 for transient flow in unsaturated soils 10 θ h t z k h h z k h z here k h is the hydraulic conductivity at any pressure head h z is the vertical distance t is the time as it can be observed there are two dependable variables including pressure head and water content present in the equation therefore appropriate initial and boundary conditions are required for numerically solving the richards equation in the present study a simple boundary condition of constant pressure head at the top surface and free drainage at the bottom was used to predict the cumulative infiltration after a certain time duration 3 results and discussion 3 1 measurement of swrc the measured ψ θ variation up to a ψ value 80 kpa for the used soils using the t5 tensiometer and 5tm sensor were presented in fig 5 a it was observed that the slope of the measured swrc in the desaturation portion reduces with the increase in the soil plasticity and clay percentage it is well established fact that the amount of water retained by the soil matrix in the lower suction regime ψ 100 kpa is predominantly governed by the capillary pore water retention mechanism lu and likos 2004 hence the adsorbed water in this regime is a function of soil particle and pore size properties the measured swrc using t5 also indicates an improvement in the water retention capacity of soil with increasing plasticity and clay percentage of the soil it may be noted that the 5tm sensor takes care the volume change behavior during drying while measuring the vwc of the soil samples hence the additional information of vsc is not required for the initial portion of the swrc the suction ψ corresponding to different gravimetric water content w as obtained with the dew point potentiometer wp4c were presented in fig 5 b starting from a ψ value of 0 1 mpa to a low degree of saturation close to oven dried state ψ value close to 100 mpa it can be seen that the measured suction values of the used samples at initial conditions were higher than 200 kpa this gives an indication that the relative humidity rh method may not be accurate in the near saturated state moreover it was reported that the rh of soil sample remains close to unity up to ψ value 1 mpa fredlund and rahardjo 1993 leong et al 2003 shah et al 2006 bulut and leong 2008 sreedeep and singh 2011 jayanth et al 2012 therefore the measured suction values higher than 1 mpa was considered in the present study for the establishment of swrc with wp4c instrument it may be noted that the present form of swrc representation as obtained from the wp4c measurement designated as swrcw does not require any volume measurement therefore the effect of volume change on swrc cannot be well understood from this plot to illustrate the effect volume change during drying the vwc suction variation designated as swrcθ needs to be incorporated this swrcθ is one of the most common forms of swrc representation and is used as an input parameter to estimate the unsaturated soil properties therefore the reliability of the estimated unsaturated soil properties largely depends on the preciseness of swrcθ 3 2 measurement of vsc the measured vsc of the used soil as obtained from the balloon method were presented in fig 6 with three independent trials to ascertain the repeatability and reproducibility of the measured data the figure clearly indicates that the experimental results are highly repeatable as the variation in the measured data points with three trials is marginal this observation is in good agreement with cornelis et al 2006 which reported an improved accuracy of the balloon method over the other direct volume measurement method as the volume of soil is measured by the application of archimedes law in the former one the use of the water displacement method for volume measurement is more accurate rather than measuring the length and diameter of the sample using calipers or displacement transducer another important advantage of the balloon method over the other volume measurement methods is that it is easy to use non destructive and provides reproducible results with a single sample it was further observed that the change in the void ratio was minimal only about 15 for non plastic soil s1 soils with varying plasticity showed volume change behavior with progressive drying due to the increasing percentage of finer particles and the amount of volume change increases as the soil plasticity increases reduction in a void ratio ranging from 38 to 60 the structural shrinkage phase was found to be absent in all the used samples as this phase is present in well aggregated soils and soils having biological tubular pores such as worm and root channels cornelis et al 2006 this phase can also be absent where the samples were dried from a water content higher than the liquid limit i e slurried samples in the normal shrinkage phase the slope of the vsc followed the 100 saturation line indicating the decrease in the water content is equal to the decrease in the geometric volume of the sample moreover it was observed that the residual shrinkage phase is not very prominent for non plastic soil and soils having plasticity 15 s1 to s3 for these soils the zero shrinkage phase starts right after the normal shrinkage phase i e negligible volume change after aep the calculated θ was further plotted as a function of the degree of saturation s of the samples to find the saturated vwc θs of the soil sample the variation of s with θ as obtained from the vsc experiment for the used soils were presented in fig 7 it can be observed that the soil remains saturated for a range of θ during drying as the geometric volume of the soil also reduces with the reduction in water content this indicates that there can be a range of θs value depending on the initial state of the soil sample which may create ambiguity during swrc determination for a particular type of soil hence the θs value for a particular soil type should be obtained from the s θ plot as the point where s sharply decreases from 1 i e 100 saturation line 3 3 effect of volume change on swrc to incorporate the influence of volume change the swrc θ of the used soils were obtained by two different methodologies in the first approach swrc θ was obtained with an assumption that the soil sample is sufficiently stiff and its dry density is constant during the whole drying stage hence the initial compaction state ei and wi was used to convert the measured swrc w as measured with wp4c into swrc θ in the second approach the details of vsc was used to obtain the dry density γ d at different water content for the determination of swrc θ the vwc θ at each measured suction value was calculated using eq 3 where the value of γ d was obtained from the measured e value corresponding to the measured w values of swrc w for better clarification the detailed description of the new methodology adopted for swrc determination considering the vsc approach 2 was shown in fig 8 as shown in the figure the s θ variation was first plotted to determine the point of desaturation which represents θs ideally by the definition of swrc this point can also be considered as the aep θaev as this point describes the water content after which air enters into the soil matrix the data points above θs were not considered and the remaining data θ ψ variation was used to represent swrc so that the uniqueness of can be maintained this approach alleviates the possibilities of different initial vwc depending on users and results in a unique characteristic curve for a particular soil type on the other hand the whole dataset θ ψ variation was used to represent the swrc in the former method where vsc is not considered approach 1 the results obtained from both approaches were presented and compared in fig 9 it can be observed that the obtained swrcs from the two approaches were completely matching with one another in the case of non plastic soils however the swrcs started to deviate from each other for plastic soils and the deviation was increasing with the increase in soil plasticity and clay content the swrc obtained using vsc shifted towards the right as compared to swrc with no volume change consideration for plastic soils this implies that the actual water retention capacity of the soil is higher but the no volume change assumption underestimates the retention capacity the figure also indicates a very negligible difference between the obtained swrcs with and without considering vsc for soils having plasticity below 15 corresponding clay percentage 11 therefore incorporation of vsc data becomes mandatory for the determination of swrc for soils with plasticity higher than 15 3 4 parameterization of swrc the measured swrc data were further used to determine van genuchten 1980 swrc equation parameters eq 6 using the well established retc software the vg equation was fitted to the swrc dataset obtained with the same two approaches as discussed in the earlier section in the first approach the first data point was taken as θs because the volume of the soil is taken as constant and the whole swrc dataset was used for the parameterization in the second approach the θs value as obtained from θ s variation from the measured vsc was given as an input parameter and the swrc data θs were considered the fitted swrc of the used soils using both approaches were compared with the measured swrc in fig 9 the obtained fitting parameters vg parameters with both approaches were also summarized in table 2 for a better comparison the vg parameters θs avg and nvg as obtained from fitting the measured data by both the approaches were compared in fig 10 the figure clearly showed that the vg parameter related to aev avg and θs value was largely influenced with the no volume change assumption the error in this parameter could result in an error in aev and corresponding unsaturated soil behavior it was further observed that neglecting the soil volume change during drying underpredicted the aev of soil as the geometric volume of soil reduces with drying the soil pores remain saturated up to a higher suction value leading to a higher aev however the influence of vsc on the parameter related to the rate of extraction of water nvg was not very much prominent hence it can be said the sensitivity of θs value and avg parameter is much more concerned if vsc is ignored 3 5 estimation of unsaturated soil properties it is quite clear from the previous section that the no volume change assumption has a significant influence on the swrc parameters even for low plastic soils however the impact of such error in swrc parameters on the unsaturated soil properties is barely investigated in past studies it is necessary to understand the influence of such variation in swrc parameters on the unsaturated flow characteristics of the used soils therefore the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions uhcf of the used soils were estimated from the obtained swrc parameters with both the approaches to demonstrate the effect of vsc the obtained uhcfs with two different approaches considering vsc and without vsc were presented in fig 11 which showed a negligible difference between the obtained uhcfs for non plastic soils however the no volume change assumption during drying resulted in a reduction in the estimated unsaturated hydraulic conductivity value than the actual one this difference is primarily attributed to the error in the determination of θs avg with the no volume change consideration approach 1 it was observed that the difference in the conductivity value could be in the order of 102 104 times depending on the plasticity of the soil the error in uhcf estimation can further influence the infiltration of water through unsaturated soil layers in various geoenvironmental applications such as landfill covers rainfall induced slope stability the impact of such error in uhcf was evaluated by stimulating water infiltration in the 1 m soil column for a certain time interval it may be noted that the infiltration of water in the soil column is a wetting process however the drying swrc parameters were used in the present study for water flow modeling as the measurement of wetting swrc is quite complex moreover the aim of the stimulation is only to appraise the sensitivity of the swrc parameter variation due to the no volume change assumption on water flow modeling therefore the predicted moisture and suction profiles as well as the cumulated infiltration may not be an actual representation of the field conditions the predicted moisture and suction profiles in the 1 m soil column 1d using the two different approaches considering vsc and without vsc were presented in figs 12 and 13 respectively these figures also showed a difference in the predicted moisture and suction profiles for the used soils except for the non plastic soil s1 the water infiltration rate as predicted considering vsc approach 2 is faster than the other one approach 1 as the time required for the wetting front to reach the bottom of the soil column is less in the former one this is attributed to the underestimation of uhcf with the no volume change assumption as obtained in the earlier section the cumulative infiltration after a certain duration i e 250 hrs were predicted using hydrus 1d with the two approaches and presented in fig 14 the figure gives a clear cut indication that the difference between the cumulative infiltration predicted with both approaches is negligible up to soil plasticity of 15 the same plasticity range was also obtained from the difference of the measured swrc data with and without vsc ref fig 9 therefore based on these above results it is very conclusive that the incorporation of the vsc data is mandatory for soils having plasticity and clay content higher than 15 and 11 respectively for an accurate determination of swrc and unsaturated soil properties 4 conclusion the present study deals with the importance of volumetric shrinkage curve vsc for the determination of drying soil water retention curve swrc for low plastic natural soils the drying swrc of six different natural soils starting from non plastic to high plastic were obtained using a miniature tensiometer t5 for suction value 80 kpa and a dew point potentiometer wp4c from the liquid limit to oven dried state the balloon method was carried out to establish the relationship between void ratio and water content i e vsc for the whole drying period this obtained vsc was used to determine the volumetric water content vwc suction swrc swrcθ which is the most important form of representation used for estimation of flow characteristics through the unsaturated soils the parametric model available for the swrc i e van genuchten model was fitted to the measured swrc considering vsc and without vsc for the used soils the obtained vg parameters were further used for the estimation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function and water flow modeling through a 1d soil column to appraise the importance of vsc for low plastic natural soils the following conclusions were drawn from the study i the no volume change assumption has a significant effect on the swrc of low plastic soils the swrc obtained without considering vsc under predicts the water retention curves of the used soils and the error increases with the soil plasticity hence this assumption is not valid for all low plastic soils ii the experimentally measured vsc showed that there could be a range of saturated vwc depending on the initial condition of the soil sample which has a direct influence on the uniqueness of swrc for a particular soil type therefore accurate saturated vwc must be obtained from the measured vsc of soil for an unambiguous swrc determination iii the non consideration of vsc has shown an incorrect saturated vwc which was further reflected by a significant amount of changes in swrc parameters vg fitting parameters needless to mention that this difference in vg parameters can cause inappropriate prediction of unsaturated soil property iv a considerable amount of effect is seen in avg parameter which is related to the air entry value aev of the used soils except non plastic soil if vsc is ignored v the predicted unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function uhcf without considering vsc showed an error in the order of 102 to 104 times than the actual value depending on the plasticity of the soil vi based on the measured swrcθ and other unsaturated flow characteristics it was very conclusive that the uniqueness of swrc is not significantly influenced by vsc for soils having plasticity and clay content below 15 and 11 respectively therefore incorporation of vsc data becomes mandatory for soils having plasticity and clay content higher than 15 and 11 respectively credit authorship

4701,the study of unsaturated behavior of soils pivots around the relationship between soil suction and the amount of water content present in the soil mass which is termed as soil water retention curve swrc the drying swrc is generally determined by neglecting the volume change behavior of the soil for low plastic soils such a procedure is bound by an inherent assumption that the soil exhibit zero or negligible volume change and can lead to approximations in important swrc parameters including saturated volumetric water content residual water content and fitting parameters which are essential for the estimation of unsaturated hydraulic characteristics of the soil this study deals with the determination of swrc parameters for a range of soils starting from non plastic to high plastic soils with and without considering volume change characteristics for this purpose the swrc of six different natural soils were experimentally measured using a miniature tensiometer t5 and a dew point potentiometer wp4c while the vsc of the used soils were measured using the balloon method efforts were made to critically understand the influence of no volume change assumption on the swrc parameters unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function and flow of water through 1d soil column the experimental results indicated that the no volume change assumption underpredicted the water retention curves of low plastic soils and this error in swrc increases with the soil plasticity the measured vsc of the used soils further revealed that there could be a range of saturated volumetric water content vwc depending on the initial state of the soil sample which also influences the sensitivity of the swrc parameters therefore the present study proposed a new methodology to determine unambiguous swrc in terms of vwc suction for a particular soil type combining both the measured vsc data and swrc data based on the obtained results it was recommended that the details of vsc must be incorporated along with the measured swrc data for soils having plasticity and clay content higher than 15 and 11 respectively keywords soil water retention curve tensiometer dew point potentiometer volumetric shrinkage curve balloon method 1 introduction understanding the basic principles of unsaturated soil mechanics is extremely important for finding solutions to the wide range of geoenvironmental problems associated with the unsaturated slope instability rainfall infiltration kim et al 2004 yang et al 2006 gavin and xue 2008 lee et al 2011 waste containment facilities or nuclear waste disposal miller et al 2000 durmusoglu et al 2006 ng et al 2016 rahardjo et al 2016 pavement engineering projects yang et al 2008 cary and zapata 2014 turco et al 2017 and solute transport through the vadose zone mohamed et al 2000 malaya and sreedeep 2012 any study related to unsaturated soil mechanics necessitates the soil water retention curve swrc as the primary input which is a constitutive relationship between soil suction or negative pore water pressure and soil moisture content presented in terms of either gravimetric or volumetric or degree of saturation the swrc parameters are very important for the estimation of unsaturated soil properties such as shear strength fredlund et al 1996 zhai et al 2019 2020a 2020b and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity van genuchten 1980 mbonimpa et al 2006 ghanbarian et al 2015 haghverdi et al 2018 therefore proper understanding and determination of the swrc parameters are most important zhai and rahardjo 2012 one of the major issues while determining the swrc parameters is that the soil is often considered as rigid mass i e ignoring the volume change during drying wetting especially for low to medium plastic soils the measurement of void ratio e of the soil sample during drying process is required to incorporate the influence of volume change on the swrc such an information can be obtained from the volumetric shrinkage curve vsc which is a graphical representation of volume of the sample or void ratio and the corresponding water content gravimetric or volumetric during different stages of drying bensallam et al 2012 wijaya et al 2015 a typical representation of vsc was presented in fig 1 which consists of four distinguished phases including structural shrinkage normal shrinkage residual shrinkage and zero shrinkage from the wet side to dry side in the structural shrinkage and residual shrinkage the reduction of sample volume is less than the amount of water loss the water loss in the structural shrinkage phase is governed by the extraction of free water localized in the inter aggregate pores whereas the water extraction occurs from the intra aggregate pores in the residual shrinkage phase bensallam et al 2012 the intersection point between normal shrinkage and residual shrinkage is known as air entry point aep because the desaturation of soil sample starts after this point cornelis et al 2006 the soil volume remains almost constant in the zero shrinkage phase and the water content at which soil volume becomes constant is known as the shrinkage limit a precise and simultaneous measurement of soil bulk volume over the whole range of water content is very important for an accurate determination of vsc past studies péron et al 2007 tripathy et al 2014 gapak et al 2017 have highlighted different laboratory methods to measure soil volume using liquid displacement methods following the archimedes law with the effective utilization of surface coating materials such as adhesive resin glue and wax krosley et al 2003 de almeida et al 2009 astm d7263 09 2018 the disadvantage of this method is that the coating materials do not make proper contact with the soil clod for most of the occasions which may result in water penetration or the presence of air bubbles inside the coating layer there are different direct measurement methods available for measuring the soil volume using vernier calipers or using displacement transducers berndt and coughlan 1976 braudeau et al 1999 birle et al 2008 peron et al 2009 and by digital image analysis julina and thyagaraj 2018 li et al 2019 amenuvor et al 2020 however comparative studies have shown that the balloon method as proposed by tariq and durnford 1993 is one of the most accurate methods for the measurement of both soil volume and water content using a single sample cornelis et al 2006 there are not many studies present in the literature that have effectively used the balloon method to incorporate the effect of volume change during drying on the swrc of low plastic natural soils the concept of swrc was first developed for soil physics and agriculture related discipline to quantify the amount of water storage in the soil at different suction in those cases a simple volumetric water content vwc versus suction plot with an assumption that there is no considerable volume change in soil with increasing suction can serve the purpose solone et al 2012 fredlund and houston 2013 the application of swrc is quite different in subsurface environmental problems involving the fluid flow and solute transport through the vadose zone and hence the assumption of no volume change during drying in low plastic soil may not be valid for many of the cases where a considerable amount of volume change occurs but conveniently neglected there are a lot of studies present in the literature that discussed the importance of considering volume change for high plastic clay and expansive soils which undergo significant volume change during the drying or wetting stage for developing swrc pham and fredlund 2008 qi and michel 2011 fredlund and houston 2013 tripathy et al 2014 wijaya et al 2015 lu and dong 2017 zhai et al 2020c these studies clearly indicated that ignoring the volume change of soil during drying leads to an inappropriate determination of swrc for soils with high plasticity however it is also very true that even low plastic soils can undergo a considerable amount of volume change which may have a significant effect on swrc and its parameters it was noted from the previous studies that the sensitivity of volume change on swrc parameters and unsaturated soil properties had not been properly quantified for low plastic soils moreover there has to be a proper guideline for low plastic soils to determine unambiguous swrc by taking the volume change consideration that can be used for an accurate estimation of unsaturated soil properties the objective of this study is to investigate the importance of vsc for swrc determination in low to medium plastic soils efforts were made to evaluate the range of plasticity and clay content beyond which the consideration of vsc data becomes mandatory for the swrc determination for this purpose six different soils with a wide range of plasticity starting from non plastic to high plastic soils were collected the swrc of the selected soils were experimentally measured using a miniature tensiometer for the initial portion of drying and a dew point potentiometer wp4c for the higher suction range while the vsc of the selected soils were measured using the balloon method the measured vsc was used to quantify the error in the determination of swrc and its parameters due to the no volume change assumption for low plastic soils the importance of vsc on the estimated unsaturated soil properties was further illustrated by simulating one dimensional flow of water through a 1 m soil column using hydrus 1d based on the observed results an attempt was made to evolve a guideline on using vsc for an accurate determination of swrc 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials a total six numbers of locally available natural soils were collected from different regions of north east india brahmaputra river bank and hill slopes inside iit guwahati campus with the soil plasticity varying from non plastic to high plastic this wide variation in the soil plasticity and particle size was selected to evolve the guideline on the utilization of vsc data based on soil plasticity and clay content the

further classified as per the unified soil classification system uscs guideline reported in astm d2487 2011 and presented in fig 2 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 determination of swrc measurement of drying swrc requires continuous drying data of soil suction and corresponding water content from a fully saturated state to a nearly dry state a miniature tensiometer t5 ums gmbh 2001 was used to measure the soil suction in the lower suction range suction 80 kpa whereas a dew point potentiometer model wp4c meter group inc usa was used to measure the soil suction up to 100 mpa saha and sekharan 2021 tensiometer is the simplest and accurate suction measuring instrument that can directly measure the matric suction ψm of soil samples nam et al 2009 the t5 tensiometer consists of a ceramic cup an acrylic shaft filled with deionized water and a pressure sensor electronic transducer at the top during the suction measurement water present in the shaft gets in equilibrium with the water present in the soil through the ceramic interface the changes in water pressure in the tensiometer shaft are electronically captured and converted to pressure good contact between the ceramic disk and soil is extremely important to maintain the saturation link between the soil pore water and the instrument this ensures the negative pressure or suction in the soil is identical to the pressure developed in the tensiometer shaft on the other hand the dew point potentiometer works on the principle of chilled mirror hygrometer technique to determine the relative humidity of the sample fredlund and rahardjo 1993 sreedeep and singh 2011 it is one of the most accurate devices available for suction measurement in dry end of the swrc jensen et al 2015 hardie and almajmaie 2019 the device consists of a sealed chamber with a cooling fan a mirror a photoelectric cell and an infrared thermometer the soil samples need to be poured in a plastic or stainless steel container with a diameter of 40 cm which is placed in the tray and subsequently moved into the temperature controlled chamber where the sample gets in equilibrium with the chamber environment the photoelectric cell detects the first sign of condensation on the mirror and the temperature at which the moisture appears at the mirror is noted as dew point the vapor pressure above the soil specimen in the chamber and the saturated vapor pressure at the same temperature are computed using the dew point temperature and the sample temperature the total suction ψ of the sample is calculated by kelvin s equation as presented in eq 1

water u v 0 is the saturation pressure of water vapor kpa and u v is the partial pressure of pore water vapor kpa it can be noted that the tensiometer measures ψm whereas the wp4c measures the total suction of soil which is a combination of ψm and osmotic suction ψo therefore it is important to ensure that there is no measurable ψo component during the wp4c measurement for a meaningful coalescence of the t5 and wp4c measured data past studies have shown that ψo of soil is mainly attributed to the presence of dissolved salt in the soil pore solution krahn and fredlund 1972 miller and nelson 2006 tripathy et al 2016 therefore the repeated soil washing with deionized water procedure as reported in the literature sreedeep and singh 2011 abhijit and sreedeep 2015 saha et al 2020 was followed to ensure that the electrical conductivity ec of soil is sufficiently low ec 1 ms cm and there is no measurable ψo component in the soil sample hence the measured swrc using t5 and wp4c can be combined prior to the suction measurement air dried soil samples passing through 2 mm sieve were thoroughly mixed with a sufficiently high amount of deionized water to attain a water content close to the liquid limit to ensure complete saturation suction close to zero the sample was then sealed in a disposable plastic bag and kept in a humidity controlled chamber for three days to ensure the uniform distribution of moisture within the sample thereafter the wet soil sample was placed into a pvc column of diameter 20 cm and height 25 cm along with a miniature tensiometer t5 and moisture sensor 5tm placed horizontally in the mid depth of the sample fig 3 it was ensured that the tip of both the instruments remains at the same horizontal level to avoid any spatial variation in the suction moisture content measurement the t5 tensiometer and 5tm sensor were connected to the dl6 datalogger and em50 datalogger respectively to record the suction and moisture content at certain time intervals 12 h the whole test setup was subjected to ambient drying conditions avg temp 25 c avg relative humidity 75 for continuous monitoring of swrc up to a ψ value of 80 kpa for the wp4c measurement the soil sample with the same initial water content as used for t5 measurement was filled in the wp4c sample cup using a spatula and placed in the block chamber of wp4c for suction measurement the weight of the sample was measured using a high precision balance having an accuracy of 0 0001 g after each suction measurement the sample cup was left in the ambient condition avg temp 25 c avg relative humidity 75 for further drying until the next measurement was taken the whole process was repeated until the soil sample reaches its residual state where the decrease in the sample weight becomes negligible at the end of the test the oven dry weight of the sample was measured and gravimetric water content w corresponding to measured suction values were calculated 2 2 2 volumetric shrinkage curve vsc measurement the balloon method developed by tariq and durnford 1993 was used in the present study to measure the vsc for the used soils the balloon method setup as shown in fig 4 a was fabricated in house to experimentally measure the vsc the initial sample preparation and initial compaction state of soil were kept similar to that of suction measurement an amount of 60 to 80 g of air dried soil passing through 2 mm sieve was mixed with deionized water to achieve the water content equal to the t5 and wp4c samples the sample was placed in a rubber balloon with continuous tapping to remove the air void present in the sample a rubber cork with inlet and outlet pipes connected to an aquarium air pump was attached at the neck of the balloon ref fig 4b at very low pressure with a flow rate of 50 100 l min dry air was allowed to pass over the sample through the inlet pipe for sample drying and the moist air exit through the outlet pipe during the drying stage both the inlet and outlet valves were kept open this process of water extraction by flowing dry air into the soil sample resulted in a slow drying close to air dry condition and ensured the prevention of crack in the sample at regular intervals of time the weight and the volume of the sample was measured the volume of the sample was measured by the liquid displacement method following archimedes principle fig 4 b the weight of the displaced water was measured using an electronic balance prior to the volume measurement a suction pump was used closing the inlet and outlet valve to suck out the air present in the balloon to minimize the error which may occur due to the volume of air for the measurement of weight the sample was detached from the inlet and outlet pipes and the weight of the sample was measured in an electronic balance it generally takes about two to three weeks for the complete drying of the sample depending on the soil plasticity the oven dried weights of the used samples were taken to calculate the gravimetric water content at every stage of drying the void ratios of the used samples corresponding to the measured water contents were calculated from the measured volume of soil and oven dry weight of the samples using eq 2 2 e v v v s v v s v s v w d g γ w w d g γ w g γ w v w d w d here e is the void ratio v v is the volume of voids v s is the volume of solid where v s w d g γ w γ w are the unit weight of water w d is the oven dry weight of the sample v is the volume of soil sample and g is the specific gravity of the soil now the volumetric water content vwc of the sample can be calculated using the following relationship 3 θ w γ d γ w where θ represents the vwc γ d is the dry density of soil and can be obtained from eq 4 4 γ d w d v the degree of saturation s of the sample can be calculated from 5 s wg e three identical soil samples were prepared for each of the used soil to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of the measured vsc data 2 2 3 estimation of unsaturated soil properties the measured swrc was fitted to the equation eq 6 proposed by van genuchten 1980 to obtain the swrc fitting parameters the fitted swrc parameters are an essential input for modeling the flow of water through unsaturated soils 6 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 a vg ψ n vg m vg here θ ψ is the vwc at any suction ψ a vg is the parameter related to the air entry value of soil n vg is the parameter related to the rate of water extraction from soil m vg is the parameter related to the residual water content of the soil θ s is the saturated vwc and θ r is the residual vwc the parameter m vg was calculated using the below relationship proposed by mualem 1976 7 m vg 1 1 n vg the present study used a well established computer code retc version 6 02 van genuchten et al 1991 to obtain the above swrc parameters using a nonlinear least square optimization technique retc was also used to obtain the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function ku based on the measured swrc and saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of the used soils using the following hydraulic conductivity model eq 8 as proposed by mualem 1976 8 k u k sat θ l θ 0 1 ψ x d x 1 0 1 ψ x d x here k sat is saturated hydraulic conductivity l is pore connectivity parameter approximately equal to 0 5 mualem 1976 and θ the dimensionless vwc which can be obtained from eq 9 9 θ ψ θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 2 2 4 water flow modeling the present study used hydrus 1d version 4 04 simunek et al 2005 to stimulate one dimensional 1d water flow through a 1 m soil column to predict the moisture and suction profile variation with time and cumulative infiltration at the bottom or basal percolation after certain time interval the stimulation was performed to understand the influence of the error in swrc measurement with no volume change assumption on the flow characteristics of the low plastic soils the computer based program hydrus 1d was used for numerically solving the richards equation richards 1931 as presented by eq 10 for transient flow in unsaturated soils 10 θ h t z k h h z k h z here k h is the hydraulic conductivity at any pressure head h z is the vertical distance t is the time as it can be observed there are two dependable variables including pressure head and water content present in the equation therefore appropriate initial and boundary conditions are required for numerically solving the richards equation in the present study a simple boundary condition of constant pressure head at the top surface and free drainage at the bottom was used to predict the cumulative infiltration after a certain time duration 3 results and discussion 3 1 measurement of swrc the measured ψ θ variation up to a ψ value 80 kpa for the used soils using the t5 tensiometer and 5tm sensor were presented in fig 5 a it was observed that the slope of the measured swrc in the desaturation portion reduces with the increase in the soil plasticity and clay percentage it is well established fact that the amount of water retained by the soil matrix in the lower suction regime ψ 100 kpa is predominantly governed by the capillary pore water retention mechanism lu and likos 2004 hence the adsorbed water in this regime is a function of soil particle and pore size properties the measured swrc using t5 also indicates an improvement in the water retention capacity of soil with increasing plasticity and clay percentage of the soil it may be noted that the 5tm sensor takes care the volume change behavior during drying while measuring the vwc of the soil samples hence the additional information of vsc is not required for the initial portion of the swrc the suction ψ corresponding to different gravimetric water content w as obtained with the dew point potentiometer wp4c were presented in fig 5 b starting from a ψ value of 0 1 mpa to a low degree of saturation close to oven dried state ψ value close to 100 mpa it can be seen that the measured suction values of the used samples at initial conditions were higher than 200 kpa this gives an indication that the relative humidity rh method may not be accurate in the near saturated state moreover it was reported that the rh of soil sample remains close to unity up to ψ value 1 mpa fredlund and rahardjo 1993 leong et al 2003 shah et al 2006 bulut and leong 2008 sreedeep and singh 2011 jayanth et al 2012 therefore the measured suction values higher than 1 mpa was considered in the present study for the establishment of swrc with wp4c instrument it may be noted that the present form of swrc representation as obtained from the wp4c measurement designated as swrcw does not require any volume measurement therefore the effect of volume change on swrc cannot be well understood from this plot to illustrate the effect volume change during drying the vwc suction variation designated as swrcθ needs to be incorporated this swrcθ is one of the most common forms of swrc representation and is used as an input parameter to estimate the unsaturated soil properties therefore the reliability of the estimated unsaturated soil properties largely depends on the preciseness of swrcθ 3 2 measurement of vsc the measured vsc of the used soil as obtained from the balloon method were presented in fig 6 with three independent trials to ascertain the repeatability and reproducibility of the measured data the figure clearly indicates that the experimental results are highly repeatable as the variation in the measured data points with three trials is marginal this observation is in good agreement with cornelis et al 2006 which reported an improved accuracy of the balloon method over the other direct volume measurement method as the volume of soil is measured by the application of archimedes law in the former one the use of the water displacement method for volume measurement is more accurate rather than measuring the length and diameter of the sample using calipers or displacement transducer another important advantage of the balloon method over the other volume measurement methods is that it is easy to use non destructive and provides reproducible results with a single sample it was further observed that the change in the void ratio was minimal only about 15 for non plastic soil s1 soils with varying plasticity showed volume change behavior with progressive drying due to the increasing percentage of finer particles and the amount of volume change increases as the soil plasticity increases reduction in a void ratio ranging from 38 to 60 the structural shrinkage phase was found to be absent in all the used samples as this phase is present in well aggregated soils and soils having biological tubular pores such as worm and root channels cornelis et al 2006 this phase can also be absent where the samples were dried from a water content higher than the liquid limit i e slurried samples in the normal shrinkage phase the slope of the vsc followed the 100 saturation line indicating the decrease in the water content is equal to the decrease in the geometric volume of the sample moreover it was observed that the residual shrinkage phase is not very prominent for non plastic soil and soils having plasticity 15 s1 to s3 for these soils the zero shrinkage phase starts right after the normal shrinkage phase i e negligible volume change after aep the calculated θ was further plotted as a function of the degree of saturation s of the samples to find the saturated vwc θs of the soil sample the variation of s with θ as obtained from the vsc experiment for the used soils were presented in fig 7 it can be observed that the soil remains saturated for a range of θ during drying as the geometric volume of the soil also reduces with the reduction in water content this indicates that there can be a range of θs value depending on the initial state of the soil sample which may create ambiguity during swrc determination for a particular type of soil hence the θs value for a particular soil type should be obtained from the s θ plot as the point where s sharply decreases from 1 i e 100 saturation line 3 3 effect of volume change on swrc to incorporate the influence of volume change the swrc θ of the used soils were obtained by two different methodologies in the first approach swrc θ was obtained with an assumption that the soil sample is sufficiently stiff and its dry density is constant during the whole drying stage hence the initial compaction state ei and wi was used to convert the measured swrc w as measured with wp4c into swrc θ in the second approach the details of vsc was used to obtain the dry density γ d at different water content for the determination of swrc θ the vwc θ at each measured suction value was calculated using eq 3 where the value of γ d was obtained from the measured e value corresponding to the measured w values of swrc w for better clarification the detailed description of the new methodology adopted for swrc determination considering the vsc approach 2 was shown in fig 8 as shown in the figure the s θ variation was first plotted to determine the point of desaturation which represents θs ideally by the definition of swrc this point can also be considered as the aep θaev as this point describes the water content after which air enters into the soil matrix the data points above θs were not considered and the remaining data θ ψ variation was used to represent swrc so that the uniqueness of can be maintained this approach alleviates the possibilities of different initial vwc depending on users and results in a unique characteristic curve for a particular soil type on the other hand the whole dataset θ ψ variation was used to represent the swrc in the former method where vsc is not considered approach 1 the results obtained from both approaches were presented and compared in fig 9 it can be observed that the obtained swrcs from the two approaches were completely matching with one another in the case of non plastic soils however the swrcs started to deviate from each other for plastic soils and the deviation was increasing with the increase in soil plasticity and clay content the swrc obtained using vsc shifted towards the right as compared to swrc with no volume change consideration for plastic soils this implies that the actual water retention capacity of the soil is higher but the no volume change assumption underestimates the retention capacity the figure also indicates a very negligible difference between the obtained swrcs with and without considering vsc for soils having plasticity below 15 corresponding clay percentage 11 therefore incorporation of vsc data becomes mandatory for the determination of swrc for soils with plasticity higher than 15 3 4 parameterization of swrc the measured swrc data were further used to determine van genuchten 1980 swrc equation parameters eq 6 using the well established retc software the vg equation was fitted to the swrc dataset obtained with the same two approaches as discussed in the earlier section in the first approach the first data point was taken as θs because the volume of the soil is taken as constant and the whole swrc dataset was used for the parameterization in the second approach the θs value as obtained from θ s variation from the measured vsc was given as an input parameter and the swrc data θs were considered the fitted swrc of the used soils using both approaches were compared with the measured swrc in fig 9 the obtained fitting parameters vg parameters with both approaches were also summarized in table 2 for a better comparison the vg parameters θs avg and nvg as obtained from fitting the measured data by both the approaches were compared in fig 10 the figure clearly showed that the vg parameter related to aev avg and θs value was largely influenced with the no volume change assumption the error in this parameter could result in an error in aev and corresponding unsaturated soil behavior it was further observed that neglecting the soil volume change during drying underpredicted the aev of soil as the geometric volume of soil reduces with drying the soil pores remain saturated up to a higher suction value leading to a higher aev however the influence of vsc on the parameter related to the rate of extraction of water nvg was not very much prominent hence it can be said the sensitivity of θs value and avg parameter is much more concerned if vsc is ignored 3 5 estimation of unsaturated soil properties it is quite clear from the previous section that the no volume change assumption has a significant influence on the swrc parameters even for low plastic soils however the impact of such error in swrc parameters on the unsaturated soil properties is barely investigated in past studies it is necessary to understand the influence of such variation in swrc parameters on the unsaturated flow characteristics of the used soils therefore the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions uhcf of the used soils were estimated from the obtained swrc parameters with both the approaches to demonstrate the effect of vsc the obtained uhcfs with two different approaches considering vsc and without vsc were presented in fig 11 which showed a negligible difference between the obtained uhcfs for non plastic soils however the no volume change assumption during drying resulted in a reduction in the estimated unsaturated hydraulic conductivity value than the actual one this difference is primarily attributed to the error in the determination of θs avg with the no volume change consideration approach 1 it was observed that the difference in the conductivity value could be in the order of 102 104 times depending on the plasticity of the soil the error in uhcf estimation can further influence the infiltration of water through unsaturated soil layers in various geoenvironmental applications such as landfill covers rainfall induced slope stability the impact of such error in uhcf was evaluated by stimulating water infiltration in the 1 m soil column for a certain time interval it may be noted that the infiltration of water in the soil column is a wetting process however the drying swrc parameters were used in the present study for water flow modeling as the measurement of wetting swrc is quite complex moreover the aim of the stimulation is only to appraise the sensitivity of the swrc parameter variation due to the no volume change assumption on water flow modeling therefore the predicted moisture and suction profiles as well as the cumulated infiltration may not be an actual representation of the field conditions the predicted moisture and suction profiles in the 1 m soil column 1d using the two different approaches considering vsc and without vsc were presented in figs 12 and 13 respectively these figures also showed a difference in the predicted moisture and suction profiles for the used soils except for the non plastic soil s1 the water infiltration rate as predicted considering vsc approach 2 is faster than the other one approach 1 as the time required for the wetting front to reach the bottom of the soil column is less in the former one this is attributed to the underestimation of uhcf with the no volume change assumption as obtained in the earlier section the cumulative infiltration after a certain duration i e 250 hrs were predicted using hydrus 1d with the two approaches and presented in fig 14 the figure gives a clear cut indication that the difference between the cumulative infiltration predicted with both approaches is negligible up to soil plasticity of 15 the same plasticity range was also obtained from the difference of the measured swrc data with and without vsc ref fig 9 therefore based on these above results it is very conclusive that the incorporation of the vsc data is mandatory for soils having plasticity and clay content higher than 15 and 11 respectively for an accurate determination of swrc and unsaturated soil properties 4 conclusion the present study deals with the importance of volumetric shrinkage curve vsc for the determination of drying soil water retention curve swrc for low plastic natural soils the drying swrc of six different natural soils starting from non plastic to high plastic were obtained using a miniature tensiometer t5 for suction value 80 kpa and a dew point potentiometer wp4c from the liquid limit to oven dried state the balloon method was carried out to establish the relationship between void ratio and water content i e vsc for the whole drying period this obtained vsc was used to determine the volumetric water content vwc suction swrc swrcθ which is the most important form of representation used for estimation of flow characteristics through the unsaturated soils the parametric model available for the swrc i e van genuchten model was fitted to the measured swrc considering vsc and without vsc for the used soils the obtained vg parameters were further used for the estimation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function and water flow modeling through a 1d soil column to appraise the importance of vsc for low plastic natural soils the following conclusions were drawn from the study i the no volume change assumption has a significant effect on the swrc of low plastic soils the swrc obtained without considering vsc under predicts the water retention curves of the used soils and the error increases with the soil plasticity hence this assumption is not valid for all low plastic soils ii the experimentally measured vsc showed that there could be a range of saturated vwc depending on the initial condition of the soil sample which has a direct influence on the uniqueness of swrc for a particular soil type therefore accurate saturated vwc must be obtained from the measured vsc of soil for an unambiguous swrc determination iii the non consideration of vsc has shown an incorrect saturated vwc which was further reflected by a significant amount of changes in swrc parameters vg fitting parameters needless to mention that this difference in vg parameters can cause inappropriate prediction of unsaturated soil property iv a considerable amount of effect is seen in avg parameter which is related to the air entry value aev of the used soils except non plastic soil if vsc is ignored v the predicted unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function uhcf without considering vsc showed an error in the order of 102 to 104 times than the actual value depending on the plasticity of the soil vi based on the measured swrcθ and other unsaturated flow characteristics it was very conclusive that the uniqueness of swrc is not significantly influenced by vsc for soils having plasticity and clay content below 15 and 11 respectively therefore incorporation of vsc data becomes mandatory for soils having plasticity and clay content higher than 15 and 11 respectively credit authorship

4702,there is an increasing need for reliable information on the origin of fine grained sediment transported by river systems but critically at temporal scales that reflect the timing and pattern of sediment mobilization and delivery in response to effective precipitation events temporal variability is likely to be more pronounced in steep mountainous catchments accordingly the main objective of this study was to investigate the temporal variability of sediment sources during and between flood events in a mountainous catchment in iran using a geochemical fingerprinting approach and bayesian un mixing model potential sediment sources were classified as either tributary sub basin spatial end members or individual source types represented by surface soils and channel banks a total of 34 geochemical elements elemental ratios and weathering indices were measured as potential tracers on a total of 155 samples including 40 target samples collected across the hydrographs of four flood events at the overall catchment outlet virtual mixture tests used to compare the computed source estimates with known source mixtures revealed better fits in the case of spatial rather than source type apportionment the bayesian un mixing model results revealed pronounced intra storm variations in the relative contributions from both the spatial sources and source types but with quaternary surface soils and channel banks being dominant at different stages of the hydrographs for all the suspended sediment samples collected throughout the three small to medium size events the babazid middle upstream sub catchment was the major 84 99 sediment source while for the largest sampled event suspended sediment samples predominantly 98 originated from the kalkoshan the most southern sub catchment by investigating both spatial sources and source types temporal variations in the dominant sources were revealed quaternary geology and channel banks were identified as the main sediment sources by combining instantaneous suspended sediment loads through the sampled flood events across all floods and using the corresponding source proportions derived from the mixsir un mixing model channel banks and channel bank and surface soils generated 2911 kg and 34 171 kg of suspended sediment respectively whilst the use of spatial source end members is practical in medium size drainage basins integration with estimates of sediment source type contributions is more informative to managers in selecting relevant sediment mitigation methods the intra storm results underscore the need to manage sediment loss from both surface soils and channel banks keywords suspended sediment provenance spatio temporal variations composite fingerprinting weathering indices geological unit un mixing model 1 introduction the temporal dynamics of suspended sediment transport reflect complex interactions between various sediment mobilization and delivery processes and pathways within catchments carter et al 2003 collins and walling 2004 kemper et al 2019 walling et al 1999 suspended sediment can originate from various sources and the relative contribution of each source is governed by process interactions haddadchi et al 2013 against the background of this process complexity within catchment sediment cascades the need for reliable information on the origin of suspended sediment carried by river systems has been increasingly recognized in the international literature collins et al 2017b walling et al 1993 here such information is required to understand the nature and relative importance of key sediment sources in order to support the design and implementation of targeted sediment control strategies collins et al 2017a laceby et al 2017 malhotra et al 2018 nosrati et al 2018a walling 2005 despite the growing recognition of the importance of reliable information on sediment sources however it is challenging to assemble such data collins et al 2017b collins and walling 2004 gellis and gorman sanisaca 2018 a specific challenge is that sediment response data are needed at appropriate spatial and temporal scales for reflecting the timing and patterns of sediment transport in response to effective precipitation events driving mobilization and delivery from multiple sources merritt et al 2003 previous studies have documented patterns of sediment response including export at annual seasonal monthly and event scales kemper et al 2019 here the dynamics of suspended sediment response during storm events is an important topic of research for understanding and predicting the export of not only suspended sediment but also sediment associated nutrients and contaminants this is especially because a significant proportion of the annual sediment yield is exported in short periods of time in conjunction with a limited number of storm events esteves et al 2019 in other words relatively few storms generate a substantial part of the annual flow and these are critical moments for activating landscape sediment sources fovet et al 2018 information on sediment sources can be assembled either indirectly using conventional measurement and monitoring procedures for erosion and slope to channel connectivity or directly using the sediment source fingerprinting approach collins and walling 2004 catchment sediment sources are in essence spatial attributes that are often related to geology rowntree et al 2017 in sediment source fingerprinting studies the geology is usually used as a basic classification variable for potential spatial sources either alone or in combination with a land use based classification scheme collins et al 2017b different types of rocks through weathering and soil formation processes have a profound effect on the geochemical properties of soils and eroded sediments haddadchi et al 2013 consequently geochemical tracers are the most widely used fingerprints to document catchment sediment sources bahadori et al 2019 biddulph et al 2017 kraushaar et al 2015 nosrati et al 2018b less attention has however been paid to understanding event scale temporal variations in sediment properties and sources although the need to consider intra storm variations in both was highlighted in early work walling and kane 1982 although some early fingerprinting investigations examined such responses carter et al 2003 collins et al 1998 walling et al 1979 walling and woodward 1992 the past twenty years has seen a much stronger focus on using time integrating sediment samplers ankers et al 2003 fukuyama et al 2010 huisman et al 2013 phillips et al 2000 walling et al 2006 or the coring of historical sediment profiles in lakes ponds reservoirs and estuaries gibbs 2008 haiyan 2015 to generate temporally lumped source estimates here the collection of temporally lumped samples has been a direct response to avoid the intensive sampling campaigns needed to document storm event source patterns and to manage sample numbers and associated analytical costs in dynamic landscapes however temporal lumping reduces the capacity to elucidate the true variability in sediment source contributions in the context of the above background the main objective of this study was to investigate the temporal variability of sediment sources during and between flood events in a mountainous study catchment in iran using the fingerprinting approach and a bayesian un mixing model the study investigated both tributary sub basin spatial sediment sources and sediment source types characterized as geological unit surface soils and channel banks in combination this work was designed to increase the spatial resolution of the sediment source estimates providing intra storm as opposed to more temporally lumped information 2 methods 2 1 study site characteristics the kamish catchment located in western iran 47 24 e to 47 42 e longitude and 34 9 n to 34 20 n latitude covers an area of 308 km2 fig 1 it is a mountainous catchment with elevations ranging from 1300 to 2600 m and an average catchment slope of 11 the river channel slope is 1 8 the study region has a population of 78 350 with the majority located in its major urban center harsin city and villages which are mostly located along the kamish river the long term 30 years mean annual precipitation data collected at the nearest climate station indicates an average total of ca 370 mm yr 1 with most precipitation falling between november and march precipitation in the upper parts of the catchment is mostly snow geological formations range in age from the mesozoic to quaternary period and exhibit contrasting petrological characteristics three geological groups which were used as potential spatial sediment sources comprise quaternary terraces with an areal coverage of 46 cherts and lutties 21 and limestone and conglomerate 33 fig 1 the interbedded radiolarian cherts and luties range in age between the cretaceous and jurassic periods the fossiliferous limestone marl and conglomerate are from the miocene pliocene and lower cretaceous periods quaternary terraces comprise both young and old deposits including screes land cover comprises rangelands 70 cultivated land including orchards dry land farming and cropped fields 22 and residential areas 8 the study catchment comprises three main tributaries the parive sub catchment 1 babazid sub catchment 2 and kalkoshan sub catchment 3 the parive river drains the northern parts of the study catchment whereas the kalkoshan river drains the southern areas the babazid river is the longest tributary and drains the middle portions of the study catchment fig 1 runoff and erosion have important off site impacts in the study catchment with for example muddy floods affecting crop fields and horticulture land fig 2 as a result a considerable part of the agricultural land in the riparian zone has been affected by storm event sediment transport and merged into the active floodplain of the kamish river resulting in major socioeconomic problems over recent years the kamish dam located 4 5 km to the south of harsin city with a water storage capacity of 16 6 million m2 and an average annual input flow of 20 5 million m2 is currently under construction accelerated erosion and sediment mobilisation in the upstream catchment is resulting in significant volumes of sediment being trapped behind the new dam accordingly determining the provenance of the sediment has been earmarked as being very important for reducing the sediment deposition which threatens to reduce the operational lifespan of the reservoir and thereby the socio economic fortunes of the study area average daily flows for the period 1985 to 2017 are presented in fig 3 mean discharge during the measurement period was 0 98 m3 s 1 the highest recorded flood event was in march 1985 50 m3 s 1 2 2 estimating suspended sediment loads to estimate the suspended sediment yield of the kamish river catchment suspended sediment concentrations were sampled during different size flood events at the hydrological monitoring station at the overall outlet in total 196 suspended sediment samples were collected using depth integrated sediment samplers gray and landers 2014 over a 32 year measurement period 1985 to 2017 and the corresponding data were retrieved from the archives of the water resources research organization iran measured suspended sediment concentrations ranged between 1 6 mg l 1 to 2205 mg l 1 lowess locally weighted scatterplot smoothing regression was used to estimate the relationship between discharge and suspended sediment concentrations cleveland 1979 different values were tested for the smoothing factor fraction of the total number of data points that are used in each local fit and the value of 0 6 was found to provide the best predictions of suspended sediment concentration y data from the flow data x data yielding an r2 value of 0 93 and a corresponding normalized root mean squared error of 5 fig 4 presents the best fit rating curve between flow and suspended sediment load suspended sediment loads over the entire period of flow record were determined by combining this sediment rating with the long term discharge data 2 3 source and sediment sampling for applying the fingerprinting approach surface soils surface upper 0 5 cm layer soil samples n 50

collected to increase the representativeness of the individual composite samples the 50 source samples fig 1 were split between the three geological sources in the following manner quaternary terraces n 29 cherts and luties n 10 and limestone and conglomerates n 11 surface soil samples were collected for the source type component of the fingerprinting exercise channel banks channel bank samples were collected from 23 locations exhibiting erosion along the river network by scraping the entire vertical surface of actively eroding bank faces into sample bags channel bank samples were collected for the source type component of the fingerprinting exercise each sample comprised a composite of 5 sub samples collected within a 10 m long reach interval 2 m at each sampling site sediment drape deposits sediment drape samples were collected from the outlets of the three upstream major tributaries and used as sub basin spatial source end members in the fingerprinting exercise in total 42 sediment drape samples were collected comprising 18 samples along a 1 1 km reach at the outlet of the babazid tributary 10 samples from a 800 m reach at the outlet of the parive tributary and 14 samples from a 550 m reach at the outlet of the kalkoshan tributary fig 1 each channel bed drape sediment sample was a combination of 5 sub samples each of these sub samples was taken at an interval of 2 m along the selected reach all samples were collected using a non metallic shovel to prevent sample contamination suspended sediment discrete suspended sediment samples were collected from the overall outlet of the study catchment fig 1 during four flood events in 2018 with contrasting discharge peaks 1st january 20th january 17th february and 5th november five suspended sediment samples s1 1 to s1 5 samples were collected during the rising limb one sample on the hydrograph peak s1 6 and four samples on the flood recession limb s1 7 to s1 10 samples of the first event fig 5 this flood generated a maximum discharge of 0 7 m3 s 1 in the second sampled event qmax 1 04 m3 s 1 four samples s2 1 to s2 4 were collected on the rising limb s2 1 to s2 4 three samples on the peak s2 5 to s2 7 and three samples s2 8 to s2 10 during the flood recession fig 5 in a larger event sampled on 17th february 2018 with maximum discharge of 1 94 m3 s 1 five samples were collected before the discharge peak s3 1 to s3 5 and four samples after the peak s3 7 to s3 10 with samples s3 6 collected during the flow peak fig 5 in the largest sampled event on november 5th 2018 qmax 8 7 m3 s 1 seven samples s4 1 to s4 7 were collected during the rising limb five s4 8 immediately after the flow peak and two s4 9 and s4 10 during the event recession fig 5 to collect sufficient sediment mass for geochemical tracer analysis a large volume of water ranging between 50 and 200 l was collected manually during each sampled flood hydrograph in total 40 suspended sediment samples were collected comprising 10 samples for each runoff event the samples from the overall outlet were used in the exploration of both the tributary sub basin and individual source type surface soils versus channel banks contributions 2 4 sample processing and laboratory analyses for tracers all sediment samples were slowly air dried and manually disaggregated using a mortar and pestle the samples were subsequently dry sieved using a 63 μm mesh prior to geochemical analyses the sieve mesh size was selected based on the dominant size fraction in the sediment samples in order to ensure that the source and sediment samples were more directly comparable using the geochemical tracers palazón and navas 2017 pulley et al 2015 tiecher et al 2018 geochemical analyses were performed on all 155 sediment and source samples rare earth trace and major geochemical elements ag al as ba be ca cd ce co cr cu fe k la li mg mn mo na ni p pb s sb sc sr th ti u v y yb zn zr were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms to prepare the samples 0 25 g of each sample 63 µm was digested with hydrofluoric acid hf and aqua regia hcl hno3 3 1 at 220 c for 4 h in a hot box in addition to measuring the concentrations of 34 individual geochemical elements seven elemental ratios al ti cu pb fe mn fe p k na pb ni al k na ca mg were calculated for the samples to permit the inclusion of different chemical weathering indices see comprehensive review by raigani et al 2019 as additional potential tracers table 1 the weathering indices were computed based on the molecular proportion of the elements in question accordingly the concentrations of elements in ppm were converted into elemental oxides based on each element compound ratio motha et al 2003 olley and caitcheon 2000 chemical weathering in river catchments plays an important role in geochemical cycles guo et al 2018 li and yang 2010 ohta and arai 2007 shao et al 2012 as a result the particulate material transferred by rivers contains valuable information on land weathering erosion and climate change on this basis many previous studies have explored the intensity of chemical weathering recorded in river sediments based on different geochemical proxies goldberg and humayun 2010 guo et al 2018 ohta and arai 2007 wang et al 2018 such work rests on the implicit assumption that the mineralogical and geochemical composition of river sediments is determined by the complex interplay of factors including the geological origin erosion and weathering processes guo et al 2018 weathering indices therefore indicate the intensity of chemical weathering processes using the degree of elemental mobility caused by the depletion of mobile relative to immobile elements during recycling price and velbel 2003 because weathering indices reflect complex interactions between the climate regime lithology soil development tectonism topography vegetation cover and anthropogenic activity gibbs 1970 li and yang 2010 shao et al 2012 their inclusion as potential sediment source tracers is potentially a means to improve physically grounded source discrimination raigani et al 2019 2 5 statistical tests to select composite fingerprints the selection of reliable tracers conserved during transfer from key sources to receptors including river channels is an essential step in sediment source fingerprinting nosrati et al 2018b on this basis a standard bracket or range test foster and lees 2000 was initially used to identify non conservative tracers on this basis the tracer concentrations in the tributary target drape and suspended sediment samples collected from the main stem outlet were compared with the corresponding concentrations associated with the source end members tracers wherein the target sediment sample concentrations from the downstream outlet fell outside the values for the upstream source end members were excluded from further tests here investigation of spatial sources involved comparing the tributary bed drape samples as end members with the suspended sediment samples from the overall outlet whereas the source type assessment involved comparing the soil surface and channel bank samples with the overall outlet suspended sediment samples in addition to the standard range test the traces were also screened using a stricter test here the mean geochemical concentrations of the downstream target sediment samples were compared with those of the upstream end members wilkinson et al 2013 in order to further strengthen the assessment of tracer conservatism bi plots of the tracers selected within the final statistically verified final composite fingerprints were also used to compare source end member and downstream target sediment samples collins et al 2017b in this case the geochemical concentrations of the source end members and the downstream target sediment samples will plot in the same space or along the same line if the tracers are conservative in general combining these three tests provides a more robust evaluation of tracer conservatism collins et al 2017b statistical analysis was used to identify the final composite fingerprints for 1 discriminating the potential tributary sub basin spatial sediment sources fig 1 and 2 discriminating the geological surface soil channel bank sources a two step approach was applied in the first step the kruskal wallis h test kw h was used to assess the discriminatory efficiency of individual tracers in step two those tracers exhibiting statistically significant differences between the potential sources in question using kw h were entered into discriminant function analysis dfa to finalise the composite signature in addition to the scatterplot of the first and second discriminant functions for pairs of canonical tracers a wide range of statistics were used for the classification and validation of the dfa models these statistics included the wilks lambdas partial lambdas f to remove the p levels the tolerance values and a full canonical analysis and eigenvalues for all functions and their corresponding p levels the standard classification functions of samples for each source were also computed to assess mahalanobis distances 2 6 source apportionment using modified mixsir the mixture sampling importance resampling mixsir bayesian model nosrati et al 2014 was used to estimate source proportions this model estimates the relative source contributions fi using probability distributions of their proportional inputs to downstream sediment samples using the bayes rule it is assumed that the posterior probability distribution for all fi is proportional to the prior probability distributions p fq multiplied by the likelihood of the data given fq l data fq and then dividing by their sum 1 p f q data l d a t a f q p f q l d a t a f q p f q mean and variance parameters for each sediment source i and the final composite fingerprint j are used to estimate corresponding probability distributions tracer distributions for downstream target sediment samples are determined by solving for the proposed means μ j and standard deviations σ j based on the randomly drawn fi values comprising a vector fq 2 μ j i 1 n f i m j sourc e i 3 σ j i 1 n f i 2 s j sourc e i 2 where m j sourc e i in eq 2 is the mean and s j sourc e i 2 in eq 3 is the variance of the jth sediment tracer and the ith sediment source based on the μ j and σ j of the composite fingerprint the likelihood of the data given the proposed target sediment mixture is estimated using 4 l x μ j σ j k 1 n j 1 n 1 σ j 2 π exp x kj μ j 2 2 σ j 2 where x kj represents the jth tracer property of the kth downstream sediment sample 106 repeat samples were drawn from the posterior distribution of the downstream target sediment mixtures using the sampling importance resampling sir algorithm moore and semmens 2008 this provided a means of establishing a threshold acceptance value for the re sampling of the probability distributions

source proportions using the final statistically verified composite signatures were evaluated using virtual sediment mixtures of known source contributions haddadchi et al 2014 more specifically the modelled predictions were evaluated using 16 and 45 sets of virtual sediment mixtures for the tributary sub basin spatial sediment sources and the geological unit channel bank sources respectively to generate virtual mixtures known source proportions see details of the source proportions used in the virtual mixtures in tables 4 and 5 were multiplied by the values of the tracers selected as constituent properties in the composite signatures and the resultant concentrations used as input to the un mixing model the predicted source proportions were then compared with the known proportions to assess the accuracy of the un mixing model predictions the outcomes of the virtual mixtures tests were assessed using the root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae viz 5 rmse i 1 n y known i y predicted i y known i y predicted i 2 n 6 m a e i 1 n y k n o w n i y p r e d i c t e d i n where yknown is the known percentage source contribution in the virtual mixture ypredicted is the

potential sediment sources using tributary sub catchments as sediment sources all tracers were conservative whereas using combined geological and channel bank sources al na and sc were non conservative and excluded from further tests table 2 using the kruskal wallis h test 25 tracers were statistically significant for discriminating between tributary sub basin spatial sources whereas using surface soils and channel banks as sediment sources 21 tracers were significant table 2 using the discriminant function analysis 10 tracers p al ti al sr k ba na ni th fe were selected in the

scatter plots showing the source group discrimination visually are presented in fig 6 for the tracers selected in the final composite signatures the biplots of tracer pairings are presented in figs 7 and 8 these comparisons suggested no major tracer transformation during sediment mobilisation and delivery through the study catchment 3 2 testing the accuracy of mixsir using virtual mixtures comparisons of the predicted and known relative contributions from the tributary sub basin spatial sources parive sub catchment 1 babazid sub catchment 2 and kalkoshan sub catchment 3 using the virtual sediment mixtures showed that the rmse ranged between 0 7 and 16 5 and the mae between 0 6 and 15 2 table 4 the overall average rmse and mae for the modelled spatial source predictions using the virtual mixtures were 5 73 and 5 17 respectively comparisons of the predicted and known relative contributions from the geological surface soil and channel bank source types using virtual sediment mixtures showed that the rmse ranged between 4 3 and 58 7 and the mae between 3 5 and 48 6 table 5 the overall average rmse and mae for the modelled source type predictions using the virtual mixtures were 26 24 and 22 78 respectively 3 3 intra storm temporal dynamics of the relative contributions from the spatial sources and source types the left hand plots in fig 9 present the intra storm variations in the relative contributions from the tributary sub catchment spatial sediment sources for all 30 of the suspended sediment samples collected throughout the three small to medium size events january 1st 2018 january 20th 2018 17th february 2018 fig 9 the babazid middle upstream sub catchment fig 1 was the major sediment source with contributions ranging between 84 and 99 during the largest sampled event november 5th 2018 suspended sediment samples largely 98 originated from the kalkoshan sub catchment which covers the southern parts of the study basin fig 1 the proportional contributions from the three groups of geological surface soil samples and channel banks i e source types to the suspended sediment samples collected during the four floods revealed temporal variations in the inputs from the sediment source types right hand plots in figure during the event sampled on january 1st 2018 hillslope surface soils overlying quaternary geology were the main contributor of the suspended sediment samples during the rising limb of the storm hydrograph during the peak discharge and the recession limb of the event channel banks were the major sediment source type channel bank inputs could be expected to be higher at peak discharge in tandem with maximum flows and hydraulic drag on channel margins but also high during recession limbs due to hydraulic draw down however during the rising limbs of the events on january 20th s2 1 to s2 4 samples and february 17th s3 1 to s3 4 samples 2018 eroding channel banks were the highest 92 contributor to the suspended sediment samples whereas during the discharge peaks and event recession limbs quaternary surface soils were the major 89 sediment source right hand plots fig 9 channel banks dominated contributions to the suspended sediment samples however at the timing of the last samples collected during both of these events right hand plots fig 9 again most likely reflecting hydraulic drawdown in the largest event on november 5th 2018 quaternary geology surface soils were the main suspended sediment source throughout the storm hydrograph with contributions ranging between 88 s4 4 sample and 93 s4 2 sediment sample this is likely to reflect the mobilization and delivery of topsoil inputs from across the study catchment swamping losses from the eroding channel margins 3 4 magnitude of the instantaneous suspended sediment loads delivered from the sediment sources by combining the estimated suspended sediment loads with the source apportionment predictions from mixsir it was possible to estimate the magnitude of the instantaneous sediment loss from the different sources and to sum these instantaneous estimates for each storm figs 10 and 11 during the event on january 1st 2018 fig 10 a total of 1285 kg of suspended sediment originated from the middle sub catchment babazid fig 1 the instantaneous sediment loads from this tributary ranged between 85 kg s 1 and 181 kg s 1 at the different sampling times within this flood event during the flood event on february 17th 2018 fig 10 the total load at the sample collection times from the babazid sub catchment was 11 703 kg with an instantaneous range of 519 kg s 1 to 2013 kg s 1 for the november 5th 2018 flood event the total load generated from the southern sub catchment kalkoshan fig 1 at the sample collection times was estimated at 130 809 kg with a corresponding maximum instantaneous sub event load of 24 521 kg s 1 during the peak of flow during the event on january 1st 2018 the instantaneous sediment load generated from eroding channel banks ranged from 4 kg s 1 at the time sample s1 3 was collected to 163 kg s 1 at the sampling time coinciding with the discharge peak fig 10 by combining the flood event total instantaneous suspended sediment loads at the sample collection times with the predicted source proportions for those samples eroding channel banks generated 863 kg of suspended sediment and surface soils 493 kg of suspended sediment during the storm event on january 20th 2018 the instantaneous sediment loads delivered to the river channel from the quaternary surface soils ranged between 4 kg s 1 for the last collected sample at the end of event to 287 kg s 1 during the discharge peak fig 11 the corresponding instantaneous suspended sediment load from the channel banks ranged between 6 kg s 1 to 215 kg s 1 10 and 13 h after the start of flood respectively fig 11 over the duration of this event geological surface soils in combination delivered 1089 kg of sediment and channel banks 1013 kg of sediment to the river channel at the sample collection times fig 11 for the flood event on february 17th 2018 fig 11 the highest instantaneous sediment load 1822 kg s 1 was delivered from the quaternary surface soils source 32 h after the start of the flood i e at the collection time for sample 3 8 in total channel banks delivered 5592 kg of the total sampled suspended sediment load for this flood event while surface soils generated 6733 kg 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the results for source apportionment estimation based on spatial sources and individual source types geological and corresponding geochemical variations across space in catchments generate uncertainties for more conventional sediment source fingerprinting approaches focusing on linking surface soil and channel bank samples with target sediment samples especially in the context of resource limited source material sampling strategies collins et al 1998 2017b hardy et al 2010 vale et al 2016 in response sampling target sediment from tributary confluences has been adopted as one means of reducing errors and of elucidating spatial sources in larger catchments collins et al 1998 vale et al 2016 wilkinson et al 2013 tributary based sampling provides a spatially averaged signature for the upstream sub catchment and thereby reduces uncertainties in end member data input to un mixing models vale et al 2016 in addition the more limited transportation distances between tributary confluence sampling points and the overall catchment outlet compared with the slope to channel distances associated with investigations of sediment source types most likely limits the non conservative behavior of sediment tracers and the corresponding impacts on fingerprint uncertainty vale et al 2016 in our case herein the results in tables 4 and 5 clearly demonstrate how the model evaluation results using the virtual mixtures were far better for the spatial sourcing in comparison with the tracing of source types the rmse results for the modelled spatial source predictions using the virtual mixtures showed that 14 of the 16 values were 10 whilst in the case of mae 15 of the 16 values were 10 these error levels were judged to be highly acceptable for the predictions of source type contributions from geological surface soil and channel bank sources using the virtual sediment mixtures both the rmse and mae results showed that only 3 of 31 values were 10 in order to evaluate the predicted sediment source apportionment using additional artificial mixtures of sediment samples the individual samples collected throughout each single event were grouped using a pooling module in mixsir and the source contributions estimated here the mixsir model was run two times based on the pooled mixtures generated using all 10 intra storm suspended sediment samples collected for each flood event i for the tributary sub catchment spatial sediment sources and ii for the geological surface soil channel bank sources the predicted source contributions using the grouped sediment sample for each flood event were compared with the proportion of the total sampled event load predicted to originate from each source based on summing up the source estimates for the individual instantaneous intra storm sediment samples table 6 the proportions of the total sampled load for example for event 1 originating from the geological surface soils channel bank sources were calculated as the percentage contribution from each source pie chart fig 11 to the total sampled sediment load of event 1 1356 3 kg for the channel bank source the calculation was 863 1 1356 3 100 63 6 whereas for the quaternary source it was 411 7 1356 3 100 30 4 the comparison suggested that the predicted contributions of the tributary sub catchment spatial sources to the virtually grouped sediment sample from each individual flood event were highly similar to the proportions of the total sampled loads estimated by mixsir but without pooling the instra storm samples more specifically the babazid sub catchment was the main contributor in the first three flood events and the kalkoshan sub catchment was the major source in the last event using both the individual intra storm and grouped pooled sediment samples in mixsir contrarily the predicted source apportionment results for the geological and channel bank source types differed substantially between individual intra storm and grouped pooled sediment samples for the first three flood events these contrasting results reflect the fact that the tributary sub catchment contributions to each sub event instantaneous suspended sediment sample did not vary across the storm hydrograph whereas the source type contributions from geological surface soil and channel bank source samples did vary substantially across the hydrographs of the first three events in the case of the last event on november 5th 2018 where quaternary was the major source for all intra storm sediment samples the predicted source proportions using the grouped sediment sample was similar 4 2 implications of the temporal dynamics of suspended sediment sources during successive flood events the results for both tributary sub catchment spatial sources and the surface soil and channel bank source types revealed intra storm variations in the responsive mountainous study catchment in general the source contribution results suggested that in the smaller sampled flow events sediment sources in the study area can change intermittently between eroding channel banks and surface soils quaternary geology but with an increase in the size of the flood event surface soils from the quaternary geology were clearly depicted as the major sediment source this geological unit is the most expansive 46 in the study area and it therefore seems logical that its contribution would dominate in the largest flood event sampled since more of the catchment could be expected to release sediment to the channel system at such times cf collins et al 1998 the spatial sourcing results however appear potentially counter intuitive in that the spatially more expansive babazid sub catchment could be expected to contribute more during the largest flood event when runoff and sediment would most likely be reaching the channel network from more upstream areas but the source tracing predicted a dominant contribution from the kalkoshan sub catchment here the source tracing results could be indicative of the deposition of sediment originating from the kalkoshan sub catchment in the lower reaches of the main channel system and its subsequent remobilisation during ensuing flood events alternatively the results could reflect spatial rainfall patterns during the different events integrating the contribution results for the tributary sub catchments based on sediment drape samples as end members and geological surface soil and channel bank sources source types can provide a better insight into the spatial distribution of the sediment sources and help pin point priority locations in the kamish study catchment in this regard fig 12 maps three scenarios for the provenance of the suspended sediment load transported during the four sampled storm events in the kamish study catchment scenario 1 occurred when the quaternary geological unit was the major source in the assessment of surface soil versus channel bank sources and among the three upstream sub catchment spatial sources the central unit i e the babazid sub catchment made the highest contribution integrating these two sets of results suggests that quaternary areas covering the upstream portions of the middle sub catchment were the major source of sampled suspended sediment this response scenario occurred for suspended sediment delivered before the discharge peak during the event on 1st january 2018 during the discharge peak for the 20th january event and late on during the event on the 17th february 2018 scenario 2 is indicative of a response when channel banks and the middle upstream tributary sub catchment were the major sources here integration of the information on spatial sources and source types suggests that the channel banks of the middle upstream river network contributed majorly to the suspended sediment transported during the recession of flow of the event on the 1st january 2018 and to the loads delivered before the discharge peaks for the flood events on the 20th january and 17th february 2018 scenario 3 occurs when the quaternary geological unit and the southern most tributary sub catchment i e the kalkoshan sub catchment dominated sediment source contributions to the sampled suspended sediment a high contribution from quaternary surface soils covering the southern parts of the kamish study catchment was predicted for the sediment sampled throughout the november flood event for the past twenty years sediment source tracing studies have increasingly deployed simple time integrating suspended sediment samplers originally reported by phillips et al 2000 to address logistical challenges for sampling in both space and time the trade off here is that some important information on the higher resolution capacity for different sources to release sediment that is mobilized to and through river channels is inevitably lost temporally lumped or time integrated samples do provide important information on the typical source contributions per unit time of deployment but there is a risk of bias in the information generated and that bias towards the most important sources will increase as the sampling time increases this risk is likely to be elevated in the case of source type contributions encompassing surface soils and channels banks given the complex interplay of factors controlling sediment mobilisation and delivery from these portions of a river catchment through time intra storm sampling provides a basis for examining the relative magnitude of sediment delivery from different sources across timescales this is important especially in responsive catchments since key driving forces for sediment mobilization and delivery such as effective precipitation mass movement or matric suction can change through time including at within event timescales lawler 2005 lawler et al 1999 simon et al 2000 this means that sediment responses manifested in the form of elevated sediment loads during storm periods can be driven by complex process interactions and combinations black 1997 lawler 1994 it therefore remains important to collect some data at within event timescales church 1996 4 3 process inference from the intra storm results and implications for sediment management sediment source fingerprinting data provide a means of making some process inference with regards to key mechanisms and factors driving sediment loss the event sampled on 1st january 2018 was characterized by a high sediment contribution from eroding channel banks near the peak in storm runoff figs 9 and 10 bank erosion associated with peak flow is most likely to reflect excess boundary shear stresses driving direct fluvial entrainment of bank source material duan et al 2001 jain and kothyari 2009 julian and torres 2006 lawler 2008 in contrast the contributions from eroding channel banks were higher during the falling stages of the flood events sampled on 20th january 2018 and 17th february 2018 figs 9 and 10 falling stage bank erosion has been noted by previous studies with potential mechanisms including a rise in pore water pressures a reduction in lateral hydrostatic confining pressures or hydraulic drawdown darby and thorne 1996 lawler and leeks 1992 midgley et al 2012 simon et al 2000 here one option for improving river bank protection would be planting protective vegetation fig 13 a d this acts mechanically via root enforcement and associated positive impacts on flow resistance and bank material strength paterson 1994 pollen 2007 tal and paola 2010 thorne 1990 but bank vegetation also delivers hydrologic impacts including a reduction in soil moisture content and pore water pressures in conjunction with rainfall interception and the direct protection of the bank face from the tractive force of channel flows black 1997 hupp and osterkamp 1996 krzeminska et al 2019 micheli et al 2004 the flow during the event sampled on 5th november 2018 was between 4 and 12 times higher than the flows during the other sampled events and the major sediment sources on this occasion were found to be the surface soils from the quaternary geology and the kalkoshan tributary sub catchment water erosion of soils is a complex process with controlling factors including climate soil type vegetation and land management toy et al 2002 here the interplay of such factors reflects the environmental setting in question govers 1987 souchere et al 1998 surface inter rill or sheet erosion of soils following raindrop impact and shallow overland flows is an important process driving hillslope erosion and is often a major source of fine grained sediment cumulatively such erosion is very effective because it can cover large areas of hillslopes due to the presence for example of soil crusts souchere et al 1998 which can concentrate overland flow and result in rill or even gully erosion toy et al 2002 valcárcel et al 2003 human activities including land use change from rangeland to arable cropping under dry land rain fed farming fig 13e f removal of crop residues by burning over cultivation and over grazing in the study area have all accelerated hillslope soil erosion ploughing and tillage on the local steep slopes and the resulting destruction of any protective canopy cover also enhances soil erodibility and increases the risk of both sheet and rill erosion govers 1991 jin et al 2007 toy et al 2002 valcárcel et al 2003 the babazid tributary sub catchment which was identified by the fingerprinting exercise as the main spatial source of fine grained sediment in three of the four sampled events comprises larger areas of dry land farming on the quaternary deposits compared to the other two tributary sub catchment spatial sources the conventional ploughing direction for local dry land farming is up and down slope and this is also an important factor takken et al 2001 especially on steep slopes for increasing the velocity of surface runoff and the rates of soil particle detachment in consequence soil tillage management quine and zhang 2004 by ceasing land use change from rangeland to dry land cultivation or at least changing conventional tillage practices to contour ploughing should be considered as soil erosion mitigation measures in the babazid tributary sub catchment in addition leaving crop stubbles in the soil after harvesting and planting cover crops to increase resistance to erosion are also relevant control measures worthy of consideration 5 conclusion a combination of intra storm suspended sediment sampling and sediment load estimation was used to examine temporal variability in both the proportions and instantaneous magnitude of sediment delivered from both tributary sub catchment spatial sources and source types to the outlet sampling site in combination the information on spatial sources and source types provides valuable data for planning sediment control strategies in the kamish river catchment knowing that the channel banks and quaternary surface soil areas covering upstream parts of the middle tributary spatial source babazid sub catchment and the quaternary area in the southern tributary sub catchment kalkoshan sub catchment are the dominant sources provides some basis for the targeting of sediment control measures the temporal variability of sediment sources during and between different flood events in flashy mountainous catchments needs to be considered carefully in designing restoration and mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of cumulative sediment source pollution future research needs to extend intra storm sampling programmes despite the sampling efforts they demand to maximise

4702,there is an increasing need for reliable information on the origin of fine grained sediment transported by river systems but critically at temporal scales that reflect the timing and pattern of sediment mobilization and delivery in response to effective precipitation events temporal variability is likely to be more pronounced in steep mountainous catchments accordingly the main objective of this study was to investigate the temporal variability of sediment sources during and between flood events in a mountainous catchment in iran using a geochemical fingerprinting approach and bayesian un mixing model potential sediment sources were classified as either tributary sub basin spatial end members or individual source types represented by surface soils and channel banks a total of 34 geochemical elements elemental ratios and weathering indices were measured as potential tracers on a total of 155 samples including 40 target samples collected across the hydrographs of four flood events at the overall catchment outlet virtual mixture tests used to compare the computed source estimates with known source mixtures revealed better fits in the case of spatial rather than source type apportionment the bayesian un mixing model results revealed pronounced intra storm variations in the relative contributions from both the spatial sources and source types but with quaternary surface soils and channel banks being dominant at different stages of the hydrographs for all the suspended sediment samples collected throughout the three small to medium size events the babazid middle upstream sub catchment was the major 84 99 sediment source while for the largest sampled event suspended sediment samples predominantly 98 originated from the kalkoshan the most southern sub catchment by investigating both spatial sources and source types temporal variations in the dominant sources were revealed quaternary geology and channel banks were identified as the main sediment sources by combining instantaneous suspended sediment loads through the sampled flood events across all floods and using the corresponding source proportions derived from the mixsir un mixing model channel banks and channel bank and surface soils generated 2911 kg and 34 171 kg of suspended sediment respectively whilst the use of spatial source end members is practical in medium size drainage basins integration with estimates of sediment source type contributions is more informative to managers in selecting relevant sediment mitigation methods the intra storm results underscore the need to

process interactions haddadchi et al 2013 against the background of this process complexity within catchment sediment cascades the need for reliable information on the origin of suspended sediment carried by river systems has been increasingly recognized in the international literature collins et al 2017b walling et al 1993 here such information is required to understand the nature and relative importance of key sediment sources in order to support the design and implementation of targeted sediment control strategies collins et al 2017a laceby et al 2017 malhotra et al 2018 nosrati et al 2018a walling 2005 despite the growing recognition of the importance of reliable information on sediment sources however it is challenging to assemble such data collins et al 2017b collins and walling 2004 gellis and gorman sanisaca 2018 a specific challenge is that sediment response data are needed at appropriate spatial and temporal scales for reflecting the timing and patterns of sediment transport in response to effective precipitation events driving mobilization and delivery from multiple sources merritt et al 2003 previous studies have documented patterns of sediment response including export at annual seasonal monthly and event scales kemper et al 2019 here the dynamics of suspended sediment response during storm events is an important topic of research for understanding and predicting the export of not only suspended sediment but also sediment associated nutrients and contaminants this is especially because a significant proportion of the annual sediment yield is exported in short periods of time in conjunction with a limited number of storm events esteves et al 2019 in other words relatively few storms generate a substantial part of the annual flow and these are critical moments for activating landscape sediment sources fovet et al 2018 information on sediment sources can be assembled either indirectly using conventional measurement and monitoring procedures for erosion and slope to channel connectivity or directly using the sediment source fingerprinting approach collins and walling 2004 catchment sediment sources are in essence spatial attributes that are often related to geology rowntree et al 2017 in sediment source fingerprinting studies the geology is usually used as a basic classification variable for potential spatial sources either alone or in combination with a land use based classification scheme collins et al 2017b different types of rocks through weathering and soil formation processes have a profound effect on the geochemical properties of soils and eroded sediments haddadchi et al 2013 consequently geochemical tracers are the most widely used fingerprints to document catchment sediment sources bahadori et al 2019 biddulph et al 2017 kraushaar et al 2015 nosrati et al 2018b less attention has however been paid to understanding event scale temporal variations in sediment properties and sources although the need to consider intra storm variations in both was highlighted in early work walling and kane 1982 although some early fingerprinting investigations examined such responses carter et al 2003 collins et al 1998 walling et al 1979 walling and woodward 1992 the past twenty years has seen a much stronger focus on using time integrating sediment samplers ankers et al 2003 fukuyama et al 2010 huisman et al 2013 phillips et al 2000 walling et al 2006 or the coring of historical sediment profiles in lakes ponds reservoirs and estuaries gibbs 2008 haiyan 2015 to generate temporally lumped source estimates here the collection of temporally lumped samples has been a direct response to avoid the intensive sampling campaigns needed to document storm event source patterns and to manage sample numbers and associated analytical costs in dynamic landscapes however temporal lumping reduces the capacity to elucidate the true variability in sediment source contributions in the context of the above background the main objective of this study was to investigate the temporal variability of sediment sources during and between flood events in a mountainous study catchment in iran using the fingerprinting approach and a bayesian un mixing model the study investigated both tributary sub basin spatial sediment sources and sediment source types characterized as geological unit surface soils and channel banks in combination this work was designed to increase the spatial resolution of the sediment source estimates providing intra storm as opposed to more temporally lumped information 2 methods 2 1 study site characteristics the kamish catchment located in western iran 47 24 e to 47 42 e longitude and 34 9 n to 34 20 n latitude covers an area of 308 km2 fig 1 it is a mountainous catchment with elevations ranging from 1300 to 2600 m and an average catchment slope of 11 the river channel slope is 1 8 the study region has a population of 78 350 with the majority located in its major urban center harsin city and villages which are mostly located along the kamish river the long term 30 years mean annual precipitation data collected at the nearest climate station indicates an average total of ca 370 mm yr 1 with most precipitation falling between november and march precipitation in the upper parts of the catchment is mostly snow geological formations range in age from the mesozoic to quaternary period and exhibit contrasting petrological characteristics three geological groups which were used as potential spatial sediment sources comprise quaternary terraces with an areal coverage of 46 cherts and lutties 21 and limestone and conglomerate 33 fig 1 the interbedded radiolarian cherts and luties range in age between the cretaceous and jurassic periods the fossiliferous limestone marl and conglomerate are from the miocene pliocene and lower cretaceous periods quaternary terraces comprise both young and old deposits including screes land cover comprises rangelands 70 cultivated land including orchards dry land farming and cropped fields 22 and residential areas 8 the study catchment comprises three main tributaries the parive sub catchment 1 babazid sub catchment 2 and kalkoshan sub catchment 3 the parive river drains the northern parts of the study catchment whereas the kalkoshan river drains the southern areas the babazid river is the longest tributary and drains the middle portions of the study catchment fig 1 runoff and erosion have important off site impacts in the study catchment with for example muddy floods affecting crop fields and horticulture land fig 2 as a result a considerable part of the agricultural land in the riparian zone has been affected by storm event sediment transport and merged into the active floodplain of the kamish river resulting in major socioeconomic problems over recent years the kamish dam located 4 5 km to the south of harsin city with a water storage capacity of 16 6 million m2 and an average annual input flow of 20 5 million m2 is currently under construction accelerated erosion and sediment mobilisation in the upstream catchment is resulting in significant volumes of sediment being trapped behind the new dam accordingly determining the provenance of the sediment has been earmarked as being very important for reducing the sediment deposition which threatens to reduce the operational lifespan of the reservoir and thereby the socio economic fortunes of the study area average daily flows for the period 1985 to 2017 are presented in fig 3 mean discharge during the measurement period was 0 98 m3 s 1 the highest recorded flood event was in march 1985 50 m3 s 1 2 2 estimating suspended sediment loads to estimate the suspended sediment yield of the kamish river catchment suspended sediment concentrations were sampled during different size flood events at the hydrological monitoring station at the overall outlet in total 196 suspended sediment samples were collected using depth integrated sediment samplers gray and landers 2014 over a 32 year measurement period 1985 to 2017 and the corresponding data were retrieved from the archives of the water resources research organization iran measured suspended sediment concentrations ranged between 1 6 mg l 1 to 2205 mg l 1 lowess locally weighted scatterplot smoothing regression was used to estimate the relationship between discharge and suspended sediment concentrations cleveland 1979 different values were tested for the smoothing factor fraction of the total number of data points that are used in each local fit and the value of 0 6 was found to provide the best predictions of suspended sediment concentration y data from the flow data x data yielding an r2 value of 0 93 and a corresponding normalized root mean squared error of 5 fig 4 presents the best fit rating curve between flow and suspended sediment load suspended sediment loads over the entire period of flow record were determined by combining this sediment rating with the long term discharge data 2 3 source and sediment sampling for applying the fingerprinting approach surface soils surface upper 0 5 cm layer soil samples n 50 from the potential geological sources were collected using a plastic trowel the composite samples retrieved at each site comprised 10 100 g subsamples collected over a 100 m2 area sub samples were collected to increase the representativeness of the individual composite samples the 50 source samples fig 1 were split between the three geological sources in the following manner quaternary terraces n 29 cherts and luties n 10 and limestone and conglomerates n 11 surface soil samples were collected for the source type component of the fingerprinting exercise channel banks channel bank samples were collected from 23 locations exhibiting erosion along the river network by scraping the entire vertical surface of actively eroding bank faces into sample bags channel bank samples were collected for the source type component of the fingerprinting exercise each sample comprised a composite of 5 sub samples collected within a 10 m long reach interval 2 m at each sampling site sediment drape deposits sediment drape samples were collected from the outlets of the three upstream major tributaries and used as sub basin spatial source end members in the fingerprinting exercise in total 42 sediment drape samples were collected comprising 18 samples along a 1 1 km reach at the outlet of the babazid tributary 10 samples from a 800 m reach at the outlet of the parive tributary and 14 samples from a 550 m reach at the outlet of the kalkoshan tributary fig 1 each channel bed drape sediment sample was a combination of 5 sub samples each of these sub samples was taken at an interval of 2 m along the selected reach all samples were collected using a non metallic shovel to prevent sample contamination suspended sediment discrete suspended sediment samples were collected from the overall outlet of the study catchment fig 1 during four flood events in 2018 with contrasting discharge peaks 1st january 20th january 17th february and 5th november five suspended sediment samples s1 1 to s1 5 samples were collected during the rising limb one sample on the hydrograph peak s1 6 and four samples on the flood recession limb s1 7 to s1 10 samples of the first event fig 5 this flood generated a maximum discharge of 0 7 m3 s 1 in the second sampled event qmax 1 04 m3 s 1 four samples s2 1 to s2 4 were collected on the rising limb s2 1 to s2 4 three samples on the peak s2 5 to s2 7 and three samples s2 8 to s2 10 during the flood recession fig 5 in a larger event sampled on 17th february 2018 with maximum discharge of 1 94 m3 s 1 five samples were collected before the discharge peak s3 1 to s3 5 and four samples after the peak s3 7 to s3 10 with samples s3 6 collected during the flow peak fig 5 in the largest sampled event on november 5th 2018 qmax 8 7 m3 s 1 seven samples s4 1 to s4 7 were collected during the rising limb five s4 8 immediately after the flow peak and two s4 9 and s4 10 during the event recession fig 5 to collect sufficient sediment mass for geochemical tracer analysis a large volume of water ranging between 50 and 200 l was collected manually during each sampled flood hydrograph in total 40 suspended sediment samples were collected comprising 10 samples for each runoff event the samples from the overall outlet were used in the exploration of both the tributary sub basin and individual source type surface soils versus channel banks contributions 2 4 sample processing and laboratory analyses for tracers all sediment samples were slowly air dried and manually disaggregated using a mortar and pestle the samples were subsequently dry sieved using a 63 μm mesh prior to geochemical analyses the sieve mesh size was selected based on the dominant size fraction in the sediment samples in order to ensure that the source and sediment samples were more directly comparable using the geochemical tracers palazón and navas 2017 pulley et al 2015 tiecher et al 2018 geochemical analyses were performed on all 155 sediment and source samples rare earth trace and major geochemical elements ag al as ba be ca cd ce co cr cu fe k la li mg mn mo na ni p pb s sb sc sr th ti u v y yb zn zr were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms to prepare the samples 0 25 g of each sample 63 µm was digested with hydrofluoric acid hf and aqua regia hcl hno3 3 1 at 220 c for 4 h in a hot box in addition to measuring the concentrations of 34 individual geochemical elements seven elemental ratios al ti cu pb fe mn fe p k na pb ni al k na ca mg were calculated for the samples to permit the inclusion of different chemical weathering indices see comprehensive review by raigani et al 2019 as additional potential tracers table 1 the weathering indices were computed based on the molecular proportion of the elements in question accordingly the concentrations of elements in ppm were converted into elemental oxides based on each element compound ratio motha et al 2003 olley and caitcheon 2000 chemical weathering in river catchments plays an important role in geochemical cycles guo et al 2018 li and yang 2010 ohta and arai 2007 shao et al 2012 as a result the particulate material transferred by rivers contains valuable information on land weathering erosion and climate change on this basis many previous studies have explored the intensity of chemical weathering recorded in river sediments based on different geochemical proxies goldberg and humayun 2010 guo et al 2018 ohta and arai 2007 wang et al 2018 such work rests on the implicit assumption that the mineralogical and geochemical composition of river sediments is determined by the complex interplay of factors including the geological origin erosion and weathering processes guo et al 2018 weathering indices therefore indicate the intensity of chemical weathering processes using the degree of elemental mobility caused by the depletion of mobile relative to immobile elements during recycling price and velbel 2003 because weathering indices reflect complex interactions between the climate regime lithology soil development tectonism topography vegetation cover and anthropogenic activity gibbs 1970 li and yang 2010 shao et al 2012 their inclusion as potential sediment source tracers is potentially a means to improve physically grounded source discrimination raigani et al 2019 2 5 statistical tests to select composite fingerprints the selection of reliable tracers conserved during transfer from key sources to receptors including river channels is an essential step in sediment source fingerprinting nosrati et al 2018b on this basis a standard bracket or range test foster and lees 2000 was initially used to identify non conservative tracers on this basis the tracer concentrations in the tributary target drape and suspended sediment samples collected from the main stem outlet were compared with the corresponding concentrations associated with the source end members tracers wherein the target sediment sample concentrations from the downstream outlet fell outside the values for the upstream source end members were excluded from further tests here investigation of spatial sources involved comparing the tributary bed drape samples as end members with the suspended sediment samples from the overall outlet whereas the source type assessment involved comparing the soil surface and channel bank samples with the overall outlet suspended sediment samples in addition to the standard range test the traces were also screened using a stricter test here the mean geochemical concentrations of the downstream target sediment samples were compared with those of the upstream end members wilkinson et al 2013 in order to further strengthen the assessment of tracer conservatism bi plots of the tracers selected within the final statistically verified final composite fingerprints were also used to compare source end member and downstream target sediment samples collins et al 2017b in this case the geochemical concentrations of the source end members and the downstream target sediment samples will plot in the same space or along the same line if the tracers are conservative in general combining these three tests provides a more robust evaluation of tracer conservatism collins et al 2017b statistical analysis was used to identify the final composite fingerprints for 1 discriminating the potential tributary sub basin spatial sediment sources fig 1 and 2 discriminating the geological surface soil channel bank sources a two step approach was applied in the first step the kruskal wallis h test kw h was used to assess the discriminatory efficiency of individual tracers in step two those tracers exhibiting statistically significant differences between the potential sources in question using kw h were entered into discriminant function analysis dfa to finalise the composite signature in addition to the scatterplot of the first and second discriminant functions for pairs of canonical tracers a wide range of statistics were used for the classification and validation of the dfa models these statistics included the wilks lambdas partial lambdas f to remove the p levels the tolerance values and a full canonical analysis and eigenvalues for all functions and their corresponding p levels the standard classification functions of samples for each source were also computed to assess mahalanobis distances 2 6 source apportionment using modified mixsir the mixture sampling importance resampling mixsir bayesian model nosrati et al 2014 was used to estimate source proportions this model estimates the relative source contributions fi using probability distributions of their proportional inputs to downstream sediment samples using the bayes rule it is assumed that the posterior probability distribution for all fi is proportional to the prior probability distributions p fq multiplied by the likelihood of the data given fq l data fq and then dividing by their sum 1 p f q data l d a t a f q p f q l d a t a f q p f q mean and variance parameters for each sediment source i and the final composite fingerprint j are used to estimate corresponding probability distributions tracer distributions for downstream target sediment samples are determined by solving for the proposed means μ j and standard deviations σ j based on the randomly drawn fi values comprising a vector fq 2 μ j i 1 n f i m j sourc e i 3 σ j i 1 n f i 2 s j sourc e i 2 where m j sourc e i in eq 2 is the mean and s j sourc e i 2 in eq 3 is the variance of the jth sediment tracer and the ith sediment source based on the μ j and σ j of the composite fingerprint the likelihood of the data given the proposed target sediment mixture is estimated using 4 l x μ j σ j k 1 n j 1 n 1 σ j 2 π exp x kj μ j 2 2 σ j 2 where x kj represents the jth tracer property of the kth downstream sediment sample 106 repeat samples were drawn from the posterior distribution of the downstream target sediment mixtures using the sampling importance resampling sir algorithm moore and semmens 2008 this provided a means of establishing a threshold acceptance value for the re sampling of the probability distributions

source proportions using the final statistically verified composite signatures were evaluated using virtual sediment mixtures of known source contributions haddadchi et al 2014 more specifically the modelled predictions were evaluated using 16 and 45 sets of virtual sediment mixtures for the tributary sub basin spatial sediment sources and the geological unit channel bank sources respectively to generate virtual mixtures known source proportions see details of the source proportions used in the virtual mixtures in tables 4 and 5 were multiplied by the values of the tracers selected as constituent properties in the composite signatures and the resultant concentrations used as input to the un mixing model the predicted source proportions were then compared with the known proportions to assess the accuracy of the un mixing model predictions the outcomes of the virtual mixtures tests were assessed using the root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae viz 5 rmse i 1 n y known i y predicted i y known i y predicted i 2 n 6 m a e i 1 n y k n o w n i y p r e d i c t e d i n where yknown is the known percentage source contribution in the virtual mixture ypredicted is the percentage source contribution estimated by the bayesian un model and n represents the number of sediment sources in question 3 results 3 1 composite fingerprints selected for discriminating the potential sediment sources using tributary sub catchments as sediment sources all tracers were conservative whereas using combined geological and channel bank sources al na and sc were non conservative and excluded from further tests table 2 using the kruskal wallis h test 25 tracers were statistically significant for discriminating between tributary sub basin spatial sources whereas using surface soils and channel banks as sediment sources 21 tracers were significant table 2 using the discriminant function analysis 10 tracers p al ti al sr k ba na ni th fe were selected in the

scatter plots showing the source group discrimination visually are presented in fig 6 for the tracers selected in the final composite signatures the biplots of tracer pairings are presented in figs 7 and 8 these comparisons suggested no major tracer transformation during sediment mobilisation and delivery through the study catchment 3 2 testing the accuracy of mixsir using virtual mixtures comparisons of the predicted and known relative contributions from the tributary sub basin spatial sources parive sub catchment 1 babazid sub catchment 2 and kalkoshan sub catchment 3 using the virtual sediment mixtures showed that the rmse ranged between 0 7 and 16 5 and the mae between 0 6 and 15 2 table 4 the overall average rmse and mae for the modelled spatial source predictions using the virtual mixtures were 5 73 and 5 17 respectively comparisons of the predicted and known relative contributions from the geological surface soil and channel bank source types using virtual sediment mixtures showed that the rmse ranged between 4 3 and 58 7 and the mae between 3 5 and 48 6 table 5 the overall average rmse and mae for the modelled source type predictions using the virtual mixtures were 26 24 and 22 78 respectively 3 3 intra storm temporal dynamics of the relative contributions from the spatial sources and source types the left hand plots in fig 9 present the intra storm variations in the relative contributions from the tributary sub catchment spatial sediment sources for all 30 of the suspended sediment samples collected throughout the three small to medium size events january 1st 2018 january 20th 2018 17th february 2018 fig 9 the babazid middle upstream sub catchment fig 1 was the major sediment source with contributions ranging between 84 and 99 during the largest sampled event november 5th 2018 suspended sediment samples largely 98 originated from the kalkoshan sub catchment which covers the southern parts of the study basin fig 1 the proportional contributions from the three groups of geological surface soil samples and channel banks i e source types to the suspended sediment samples collected during the four floods revealed temporal variations in the inputs from the sediment source types right hand plots in figure during the event sampled on january 1st 2018 hillslope surface soils overlying quaternary geology were the main contributor of the suspended sediment samples during the rising limb of the storm hydrograph during the peak discharge and the recession limb of the event channel banks were the major sediment source type channel bank inputs could be expected to be higher at peak discharge in tandem with maximum flows and hydraulic drag on channel margins but also high during recession limbs due to hydraulic draw down however during the rising limbs of the events on january 20th s2 1 to s2 4 samples and february 17th s3 1 to s3 4 samples 2018 eroding channel banks were the highest 92 contributor to the suspended sediment samples whereas during the discharge peaks and event recession limbs quaternary surface soils were the major 89 sediment source right hand plots fig 9 channel banks dominated contributions to the suspended sediment samples however at the timing of the last samples collected during both of these events right hand plots fig 9 again most likely reflecting hydraulic drawdown in the largest event on november 5th 2018 quaternary geology surface soils were the main suspended sediment source throughout the storm hydrograph with contributions ranging between 88 s4 4 sample and 93 s4 2 sediment sample this is likely to reflect the mobilization and delivery of topsoil inputs from across the study catchment swamping losses from the eroding channel margins 3 4 magnitude of the instantaneous suspended sediment loads delivered from the sediment sources by combining the estimated suspended sediment loads with the source apportionment predictions from mixsir it was possible to estimate the magnitude of the instantaneous sediment loss from the different sources and to sum these instantaneous estimates for each storm figs 10 and 11 during the event on january 1st 2018 fig 10 a total of 1285 kg of suspended sediment originated from the middle sub catchment babazid fig 1 the instantaneous sediment loads from this tributary ranged between 85 kg s 1 and 181 kg s 1 at the different sampling times within this flood event during the flood event on february 17th 2018 fig 10 the total load at the sample collection times from the babazid sub catchment was 11 703 kg with an instantaneous range of 519 kg s 1 to 2013 kg s 1 for the november 5th 2018 flood event the total load generated from the southern sub catchment kalkoshan fig 1 at the sample collection times was estimated at 130 809 kg with a corresponding maximum instantaneous sub event load of 24 521 kg s 1 during the peak of flow during the event on january 1st 2018 the instantaneous sediment load generated from eroding channel banks ranged from 4 kg s 1 at the time sample s1 3 was collected to 163 kg s 1 at the sampling time coinciding with the discharge peak fig 10 by combining the flood event total instantaneous suspended sediment loads at the sample collection times with the predicted source proportions for those samples eroding channel banks generated 863 kg of suspended sediment and surface soils 493 kg of suspended sediment during the storm event on january 20th 2018 the instantaneous sediment loads delivered to the river channel from the quaternary surface soils ranged between 4 kg s 1 for the last collected sample at the end of event to 287 kg s 1 during the discharge peak fig 11 the corresponding instantaneous suspended sediment load from the channel banks ranged between 6 kg s 1 to 215 kg s 1 10 and 13 h after the start of flood respectively fig 11 over the duration of this event geological surface soils in combination delivered 1089 kg of sediment and channel banks 1013 kg of sediment to the river channel at the sample collection times fig 11 for the flood event on february 17th 2018 fig 11 the highest instantaneous sediment load 1822 kg s 1 was delivered from the quaternary surface soils source 32 h after the start of the flood i e at the collection time for sample 3 8 in total channel banks delivered 5592 kg of the total sampled suspended sediment load for this flood event while surface soils generated 6733 kg 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of the results for source apportionment estimation based on spatial sources and individual source types geological and corresponding geochemical variations across space in catchments generate uncertainties for more conventional sediment source fingerprinting approaches focusing on linking surface soil and channel bank samples with target sediment samples especially in the context of resource limited source material sampling strategies collins et al 1998 2017b hardy et al 2010 vale et al 2016 in response sampling target sediment from tributary confluences has been adopted as one means of reducing errors and of elucidating spatial sources in larger catchments collins et al 1998 vale et al 2016 wilkinson et al 2013 tributary based sampling provides a spatially averaged signature for the upstream sub catchment and thereby reduces uncertainties in end member data input to un mixing models vale et al 2016 in addition the more limited transportation distances between tributary confluence sampling points and the overall catchment outlet compared with the slope to channel distances associated with investigations of sediment source types most likely limits the non conservative behavior of sediment tracers and the corresponding impacts on fingerprint uncertainty vale et al 2016 in our case herein the results in tables 4 and 5 clearly demonstrate how the model evaluation results using the virtual mixtures were far better for the spatial sourcing in comparison with the tracing of source types the rmse results for the modelled spatial source predictions using the virtual mixtures showed that 14 of the 16 values were 10 whilst in the case of mae 15 of the 16 values were 10 these error levels were judged to be highly acceptable for the predictions of source type contributions from geological surface soil and channel bank sources using the virtual sediment mixtures both the rmse and mae results showed that only 3 of 31 values were 10 in order to evaluate the predicted sediment source apportionment using additional artificial mixtures of sediment samples the individual samples collected throughout each single event were grouped using a pooling module in mixsir and the source contributions estimated here the mixsir model was run two times based on the pooled mixtures generated using all 10 intra storm suspended sediment samples collected for each flood event i for the tributary sub catchment spatial sediment sources and ii for the geological surface soil channel bank sources the predicted source contributions using the grouped sediment sample for each flood event were compared with the proportion of the total sampled event load predicted to originate from each source based on summing up the source estimates for the individual instantaneous intra storm sediment samples table 6 the proportions of the total sampled load for example for event 1 originating from the geological surface soils channel bank sources were calculated as the percentage contribution from each source pie chart fig 11 to the total sampled sediment load of event 1 1356 3 kg for the channel bank source the calculation was 863 1 1356 3 100 63 6 whereas for the quaternary source it was 411 7 1356 3 100 30 4 the comparison suggested that the predicted contributions of the tributary sub catchment spatial sources to the virtually grouped sediment sample from each individual flood event were highly similar to the proportions of the total sampled loads estimated by mixsir but without pooling the instra storm samples more specifically the babazid sub catchment was the main contributor in the first three flood events and the kalkoshan sub catchment was the major source in the last event using both the individual intra storm and grouped pooled sediment samples in mixsir contrarily the predicted source apportionment results for the geological and channel bank source types differed substantially between individual intra storm and grouped pooled sediment samples for the first three flood events these contrasting results reflect the fact that the tributary sub catchment contributions to each sub event instantaneous suspended sediment sample did not vary across the storm hydrograph whereas the source type contributions from geological surface soil and channel bank source samples did vary substantially across the hydrographs of the first three events in the case of the last event on november 5th 2018 where quaternary was the major source for all intra storm sediment samples the predicted source proportions using the grouped sediment sample was similar 4 2 implications of the temporal dynamics of suspended sediment sources during successive flood events the results for both tributary sub catchment spatial sources and the surface soil and channel bank source types revealed intra storm variations in the responsive mountainous study catchment in general the source contribution results suggested that in the smaller sampled flow events sediment sources in the study area can change intermittently between eroding channel banks and surface soils quaternary geology but with an increase in the size of the flood event surface soils from the quaternary geology were clearly depicted as the major sediment source this geological unit is the most expansive 46 in the study area and it therefore seems logical that its contribution would dominate in the largest flood event sampled since more of the catchment could be expected to release sediment to the channel system at such times cf collins et al 1998 the spatial sourcing results however appear potentially counter intuitive in that the spatially more expansive babazid sub catchment could be expected to contribute more during the largest flood event when runoff and sediment would most likely be reaching the channel network from more upstream areas but the source tracing predicted a dominant contribution from the kalkoshan sub catchment here the source tracing results could be indicative of the deposition of sediment originating from the kalkoshan sub catchment in the lower reaches of the main channel system and its subsequent remobilisation during ensuing flood events alternatively the results could reflect spatial rainfall patterns during the different events integrating the contribution results for the tributary sub catchments based on sediment drape samples as end members and geological surface soil and channel bank sources source types can provide a better insight into the spatial distribution of the sediment sources and help pin point priority locations in the kamish study catchment in this regard fig 12 maps three scenarios for the provenance of the suspended sediment load transported during the four sampled storm events in the kamish study catchment scenario 1 occurred when the quaternary geological unit was the major source in the assessment of surface soil versus channel bank sources and among the three upstream sub catchment spatial sources the central unit i e the babazid sub catchment made the highest contribution integrating these two sets of results suggests that quaternary areas covering the upstream portions of the middle sub catchment were the major source of sampled suspended sediment this response scenario occurred for suspended sediment delivered before the discharge peak during the event on 1st january 2018 during the discharge peak for the 20th january event and late on during the event on the 17th february 2018 scenario 2 is indicative of a response when channel banks and the middle upstream tributary sub catchment were the major sources here integration of the information on spatial sources and source types suggests that the channel banks of the middle upstream river network contributed majorly to the suspended sediment transported during the recession of flow of the event on the 1st january 2018 and to the loads delivered before the discharge peaks for the flood events on the 20th january and 17th february 2018 scenario 3 occurs when the quaternary geological unit and the southern most tributary sub catchment i e the kalkoshan sub catchment dominated sediment source contributions to the sampled suspended sediment a high contribution from quaternary surface soils covering the southern parts of the kamish study catchment was predicted for the sediment sampled throughout the november flood event for the past twenty years sediment source tracing studies have increasingly deployed simple time integrating suspended sediment samplers originally reported by phillips et al 2000 to address logistical challenges for sampling in both space and time the trade off here is that some important information on the higher resolution capacity for different sources to release sediment that is mobilized to and through river channels is inevitably lost temporally lumped or time integrated samples do provide important information on the typical source contributions per unit time of deployment but there is a risk of bias in the information generated and that bias towards the most important sources will increase as the sampling time increases this risk is likely to be elevated in the case of source type contributions encompassing surface soils and channels banks given the complex interplay of factors controlling sediment mobilisation and delivery from these portions of a river catchment through time intra storm sampling provides a basis for examining the relative magnitude of sediment delivery from different sources across timescales this is important especially in responsive catchments since key driving forces for sediment mobilization and delivery such as effective precipitation mass movement or matric suction can change through time including at within event timescales lawler 2005 lawler et al 1999 simon et al 2000 this means that sediment responses manifested in the form of elevated sediment loads during storm periods can be driven by complex process interactions and combinations black 1997 lawler 1994 it therefore remains important to collect some data at within event timescales church 1996 4 3 process inference from the intra storm results and implications for sediment management sediment source fingerprinting data provide a means of making some process inference with regards to key mechanisms and factors driving sediment loss the event sampled on 1st january 2018 was characterized by a high sediment contribution from eroding channel banks near the peak in storm runoff figs 9 and 10 bank erosion associated with peak flow is most likely to reflect excess boundary shear stresses driving direct fluvial entrainment of bank source material duan et al 2001 jain and kothyari 2009 julian and torres 2006 lawler 2008 in contrast the contributions from eroding channel banks were higher during the falling stages of the flood events sampled on 20th january 2018 and 17th february 2018 figs 9 and 10 falling stage bank erosion has been noted by previous studies with potential mechanisms including a rise in pore water pressures a reduction in lateral hydrostatic confining pressures or hydraulic drawdown darby and thorne 1996 lawler and leeks 1992 midgley et al 2012 simon et al 2000 here one option for improving river bank protection would be planting protective vegetation fig 13 a d this acts mechanically via root enforcement and associated positive impacts on flow resistance and bank material strength paterson 1994 pollen 2007 tal and paola 2010 thorne 1990 but bank vegetation also delivers hydrologic impacts including a reduction in soil moisture content and pore water pressures in conjunction with rainfall interception and the direct protection of the bank face from the tractive force of channel flows black 1997 hupp and osterkamp 1996 krzeminska et al 2019 micheli et al 2004 the flow during the event sampled on 5th november 2018 was between 4 and 12 times higher than the flows during the other sampled events and the major sediment sources on this occasion were found to be the surface soils from the quaternary geology and the kalkoshan tributary sub catchment water erosion of soils is a complex process with controlling factors including climate soil type vegetation and land management toy et al 2002 here the interplay of such factors reflects the environmental setting in question govers 1987 souchere et al 1998 surface inter rill or sheet erosion of soils following raindrop impact and shallow overland flows is an important process driving hillslope erosion and is often a major source of fine grained sediment cumulatively such erosion is very effective because it can cover large areas of hillslopes due to the presence for example of soil crusts souchere et al 1998 which can concentrate overland flow and result in rill or even gully erosion toy et al 2002 valcárcel et al 2003 human activities including land use change from rangeland to arable cropping under dry land rain fed farming fig 13e f removal of crop residues by burning over cultivation and over grazing in the study area have all accelerated hillslope soil erosion ploughing and tillage on the local steep slopes and the resulting destruction of any protective canopy cover also enhances soil erodibility and increases the risk of both sheet and rill erosion govers 1991 jin et al 2007 toy et al 2002 valcárcel et al 2003 the babazid tributary sub catchment which was identified by the fingerprinting exercise as the main spatial source of fine grained sediment in three of the four sampled events comprises larger areas of dry land farming on the quaternary deposits compared to the other two tributary sub catchment spatial sources the conventional ploughing direction for local dry land farming is up and down slope and this is also an important factor takken et al 2001 especially on steep slopes for increasing the velocity of surface runoff and the rates of soil particle detachment in consequence soil tillage management quine and zhang 2004 by ceasing land use change from rangeland to dry land cultivation or at least changing conventional tillage practices to contour ploughing should be considered as soil erosion mitigation measures in the babazid tributary sub catchment in addition leaving crop stubbles in the soil after harvesting and planting cover crops to increase resistance to erosion are also relevant control measures worthy of consideration 5 conclusion a combination of intra storm suspended sediment sampling and sediment load estimation was used to examine temporal variability in both the proportions and instantaneous magnitude of sediment delivered from both tributary sub catchment spatial sources and source types to the outlet sampling site in combination the information on spatial sources and source types provides valuable data for planning sediment control strategies in the kamish river catchment knowing that the channel banks and quaternary surface soil areas covering upstream parts of the middle tributary spatial source babazid sub catchment and the quaternary area in the southern tributary sub catchment kalkoshan sub catchment are the dominant sources provides some basis for the targeting of sediment control measures the temporal variability of sediment sources during and between different flood events in flashy mountainous catchments needs to be considered carefully in designing restoration and mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of cumulative sediment source pollution future research needs to extend intra storm sampling programmes despite the sampling efforts they demand to maximise the likelihood of characterizing all possible storm period sediment response scenarios for source contributions credit authorship contribution statement kazem nosrati conceptualization data curation

4703,velocity measurements from experiments performed downstream of patches of submerged aquatic vegetation were analysed two patches of different species i e p crispus and m spicatum were characterised by the same size measurement points covered the water depth in the centre and at the sides of the patches from 0 1 m to 0 85 m downstream conditional quadrant analysis was modified and applied to the data to study turbulence structures propagating from the mixing layer formed at the interface between the vegetation canopy and flow above these structures were responsible for the majority of momentum transport and tended to vary with patch distance height and plant physical characteristics the stiffer plant i e m spicatum produced a higher difference between the contributions of even events i e sweeps and ejections and odd events i e outward and inward interactions the changes in the detected strong bursting events across measurement profiles indicated that two main kinds of organised motions occurred immediately behind the plant patches strong sweep motions carried water flow into the low velocity region below the vegetation height strong ejections which had the longest time of the occurrence and had the highest contributions to the u w reynolds stress pushed flow towards the water surface both kinds of extreme events produced the same reynolds stress in an instant but ejections had a higher frequency of occurrence the presented results show how the observed changes in ejection and sweeps distribution reflect the model where vegetation canopy induced vortices transform into the dual head hairpin vortices downstream of the inflection point keywords coherent structures aquatic vegetation river turbulence acoustic doppler velocimetry field experiments quadrant analysis 1 introduction one of the topics pursued in the analysis of flow is the phenomenon of turbulent structures which occur within certain time scales in the presence of a boundary layer willmarth and lu 1972 and show momentum fluxes nezu and nakagawa 1993 regarding vegetated flow boundaries of different scales are interconnected nikora 2010 aberle and järvelä 2015 and thus following the origins of detected structures is problematic for example in addition to vegetation induced mixing there are large scale phenomena present in rivers e g low frequency flow structures franca and lemmin 2014 and secondary currents occurring in bends termini and piraino 2011 the analysis of flow biota interactions is even more complex for the case of submerged vegetation as it tends to be more flexible than emergent species dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 moreover such plants undergo swaying motions called monami or for horizontally oriented flexible species flapping motions siniscalchi and nikora 2013 which help to reduce drag induced turbulence okamoto and nezu 2009 nevertheless the analysis of coherent structures provides information about momentum and mass transport between flow layers which in turn means nutrient and gas fluxes within the river depth ghisalberti and nepf 2002 coherent structures manifest in turbulent flow where fluctuating longitudinal and vertical velocity components contribute to the u w reynolds stress nezu and nakagawa 1993 near the bed ejection events are motions responsible for slow flow movement into the free flow layer while sweeps are quick motions directed towards the boundary layer salim et al 2017 to detect these periodic phenomena which are characterised by a second order moment of velocities a quadrant analysis method can be exploited lu and willmarth 1973 in many cases the investigation of quadrant contributions in the presence of vegetation focuses mostly on a contribution to the reynolds stress of all the events without using a threshold which leaves only turbulent events of the highest stress e g ghisalberti and nepf 2006 termini and di leonardo 2017 hence all the recorded u and w velocity fluctuations are taken into the analysis without focusing on the pairs producing the highest stress nezu and sanjou 2008 did not use a thresholding method arguing that less organised motions have a weak presence in vegetated flows on the other hand some of the momentum transport is lost within the vegetation due to the force needed to move flexible stems which retain the same frequency as ambient turbulence siniscalchi and nikora 2013 therefore this energy loss induced by stems and leaves should result in turbulence that forms small quickly dispersing vortices in a plant wake nikora 2010 in response to these studies conditional quadrant analysis was then recently used in simulations with flexible vegetation by marjoribanks et al 2017a and in laboratory experiments by caroppi et al 2018 and huai et al 2019 both laboratory investigations showed that above a certain threshold level implemented in the quadrant analysis the observable outward and inward interactions were severely diminished favouring stronger bursting events to focus more on these events that contribute most to the overall stress in turbulent flows i e sweeps and ejections an enhanced version of the quadrant technique was proposed by ferreira et al 2009 in short additional conditions based on the persistence of u were formulated to include events correlated with high enough values of longitudinal velocity fluctuations the thresholding method as well as the focus on sweeps and ejections were implemented in this paper in order to carry on specific investigation of bursts downstream of two aquatic plants species different plant species and patch configurations change the flow patterns in a channel which is vital for predicting channel resistance and sedimentation zones e g green 2005 marjoribanks et al 2017b yang and nepf 2019 moreover the production of turbulent energy in shear layers affects the sedimentation rate nepf 2012 liu et al 2018 additionally close to a channel bed coherent events transport momentum which affects coarser mobile particles ferreira et al 2009 sweeps and ejections were found to be dominant in a region of scouring behind an obstacle khan and sharma 2020 as these events occur at the canopy height huai et al 2019 there is a possibility that the strongest flow motion will affect particles entrapped in the plant leaves moreover even whole parts of the shoots can be affected and may be subject to their reproduction and spreading due to the fragmentation of shoots by water currents e g for invasive species santamaria 2002 tokarska guzik 2005 łoboda et al 2018a understanding the coherent flow structures downstream may also affect fish swimming as this subject is still in its infancy wilkes et al 2013 to date most of the investigations that have addressed turbulent events in the presence of vegetation have focused on large uniform canopies e g ghisalberti and nepf 2006 nezu and sanjou 2008 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2012 marjoribanks et al 2017a huai et al 2019 where ejection events dominate flow above the plant canopy analyses of turbulence performed in natural conditions with a single patch of flexible vegetation are very rare and new e g przyborowski et al 2018 2019a biggs et al 2019 and thus need more attention as a result experiments were conducted with the use of acoustic doppler velocimeters in an unobstructed lowland river with a low water level there the velocity field behind two patches of submerged vegetation was measured przyborowski et al 2019b the evolution of coherent structures in the presence of vegetation canopy were described by models derived from numerical simulations e g in wind flow above the forest dupont and brunet 2009 or water flow above uniform aquatic vegetation finnigan et al 2009 marjoribanks et al 2017a few laboratory research e g nezu and sanjou 2008 devi and kumar 2016 confirmed a specific relationship between sweeps and ejections in the canopy flow marjoribanks et al 2017a noted that flexible plants can display unknown types of turbulence in a mixing layer and wake it is then desirable to confirm and extend such studies into the case of flow in a natural river downstream of a vegetation patch it may serve as a control example and study case for extended laboratory investigations the use of conditional quadrant analysis enables to focus on the turbulent events of a chosen stress scale to find out if there were visible patterns in distribution and characteristics of strong coherent structures matching existing models we carried out further analysis of the streamwise and vertical fluctuations of velocity gathered in previous experiments przyborowski et al 2019b what is more the fact of having two distinct vegetation species allowed us to look on how the strongest bursting events propagate downstream of flexible plants what is the spatial extent of certain coherent structures and how morphological and biomechanical plant characteristics affect such turbulences 2 methods 2 1 data collection the measurements were conducted during two campaigns in summer 2017 in a sandy bedded lowland reach of the świder river in poland 52 06 21 2 n 21 13 42 0 e the measurements took place around 3 m from the right bank of the river where no other plants were present close to this spot two species were found in the channel potamogeton crispus l and myriophyllum spicatum l prior to each experiment plants were carefully moved onto the position and mounted with the river sediment as were originally a single species formed an individual patch of similar size i e each covered an approximately 1 m long and 0 2 m wide area each patch consisted of over a dozen of stems which were protruding from a circular place 0 20 m in diameter the stems were floating up to 0 15 0 20 m above the mobile sandy bed in approximately 0 3 m deep water these species were found to be different in terms of morphological and biomechanical traits przyborowski et al 2019b but both are flexible and exert wavy motions in morphology the key differences were 1 in stem cross sectional area where p crispus species has an ellipsoidal shape while m spicatum circular shape but both around 70 of empty air space and 2 in leaf shapes where p crispus is characterised by oblong stiffer curly leaves in comparison to thin multiple needles in whorls of m spicatum łoboda et al 2018b przyborowski et al 2019b thus mostly due to leaves morphology the patch formed from m spicatum species was identified as the one with slightly higher density see przyborowski et al 2019b fig 1 in biomechanics tests showed that m spicatum was characterised by higher flexural strain and rigidity than p crispus while modulus values indicated that m spicatum species is less prone to deformation and return to its undeformed form przyborowski et al 2019b vertical profiles 24 of which formed a 4x6 spatial mesh fig 1 were chosen to collect the 3d velocity field downstream of each plant the velocity time series used for further analysis were obtained using acoustic doppler velocimeters vectrino profiler revision 2779 1 32 nortek as rud norway mounted on a wide stabilized platform the frequency of the measurements was set to 50 hz and each sample time was at least 3 min long which gave 9000 recorded time steps per measured point 2 2 data processing the signal to noise ratio and signal correlation thresholds equal to 15 db and 70 respectively were used to eliminate unreliable data and replace them using linear interpolation in the next step modified 3d space thresholding filter goring and nikora 2002 wahl 2003 parsheh et al 2010 was used to remove spikes vectrino profilers bottom track feature allowed us to gather data about the probe s height above the mobile bed due to bed depth changes a normalised depth z h scale was used in the results the stress and velocity fields used as the background in relevant plots were produced using cubic interpolation between measured points 2 3 quadrant analysis post processed velocity data were used to compute the reynolds stress and to assign longitudinal u and vertical w velocity fluctuations into four groups outward and inward interactions sweeps and ejections to enhance the detection of events characteristic of vegetated flows i e sweeps and ejections additional criteria were applied following the updated quadrant technique proposed by ferreira et al 2009 this method matches our investigation of the turbulence in a rough vegetated channel with a small relative submergence as it was developed for a better understanding of how bedload transport affects the generation of coherent turbulent events in similar flow conditions franca et al 2014 the novelty implemented in the presented investigation was that points of highest u values from first and third quadrants did not count as sweeps and ejections in contrary to the above technique these updated criteria are described for the following quadrants for outward interactions 1 q out u w r u 0 w σ h u u σ for ejections 2 q ej u w r u 0 w 0 w σ h u u σ for inward interactions 3 q inw u w r u 0 w 0 w σ h u u σ for sweeps 4 q sw u w r u 0 w 0 w σ h u u σ w 0 where the threshold σh was obtained by the following equation σ h h u rms w rms and the thresholds σ and σ by 6 σ 2 5 u rms urms and wrms denote the root mean squares of the longitudinal and vertical velocity fluctuations the threshold coefficient h called the hole size is equal to 1 8 which was used in the ferreira et al 2009 method a higher value for example h 3 which was used by chen et al 2013 in laboratory conditions with vegetation would lower the number of detected extreme events 2 4 event contributions and event ratios at each measurement point the time averaged stress contribution from events in each quadrant is given by the following equation raupach 1981 7 u w i h lim t 1 t t 0 t 0 t u t w t q i h u t w t d t where i represents the quadrant number t is the whole time of the measurement and h is the hole size the angled brackets represent conditional averaging and qi h is a function equal to 1 if u w belongs to quadrant i according to the conditions shown in equations 1 to 4 otherwise it is equal to 0 therefore the relation of the time averaged stress from the quadrant to the time averaged reynolds stress u w is given by the following equation 8 s i h u w i h u w the summary contribution of the four quadrants is equal to 1 raupach 1981 when the hole size is equal to 0 consequently the ratio of sweep and ejection event contributions to the outward and inward interaction contributions was calculated as 9 s ratio s 2 0 s 4 0 s 1 0 s 3 0 the stress contributions from the quadrants were less investigated in the case of extreme events i e when h is greater than zero following the method proposed by ferreira et al 2009 strong longitudinal velocity fluctuations which would normally be omitted with a typical hyperbolic threshold were also included as extreme events the magnitude of extreme events was calculated by averaging the stress from those events by the number of time steps where the particular type of event was detected ni h not the actual number of time steps in 3 minute long average time measurements as follows 10 mag u w i h 1 n i h t 1 t u t w t q i h u t w t additionally the ratio of the number of detected events in the second n2 h and fourth n4 h quadrants to the number of events in the first n1 h and third n3 h quadrants was calculated as 11 n ratio n 2 h n 4 h n 1 h n 3 h 2 5 time characteristics based on the event identification scheme eqs 1 to 4 with the hole size h 1 8 the time characteristics of the events were calculated following the methodology shown by lu and willmarth 1973 and czernuszenko and rowiński 2008 sweeps and ejections represent motions in measured water volume that have significantly stronger or weaker velocity than time averaged value simultaneously in both streamwise and vertical directions what is more it is presumed that a singular event can be visible across a few adjacent data points in the time series as it has larger time scale than the higher frequency turbulences nezu and nakagawa 1993 in a flow over canopy this time period derives from the assumption that these events mark the passage of large scale coherent structures in form of hairpin vortices finnigan et al 2009 as the data collection frequency of the vectrino profiler was fixed at 50 hz the shortest single occurrence of an event in the time series was assumed to have a maximal duration of 0 02 sec if the same event was detected in k consecutive points in time it was counted as one long event here in time characteristics both cases i e single and prolonged event occurrence will be called a sequence thus the duration of a sequence was calculated as 12 δ t m i h 0 02 q i h u t j w t j 1 0 02 1 k q i h u t j k w t j k 1 where m is the number of identified sequences in the quadrant qi h is the event identification function j is a given point in the time series and k is a consecutive step in the time series the mean duration of events was then calculated as 13 t i h 1 n m 1 n δ t m i h where n is the sum of the identified sequences in each quadrant the maximal time of the event was calculated as 14 t max i h m a x δ t m i h and the frequency of occurrence of the events was calculated as 15 p i h m 1 n δ t m i h δ t where δt is the total duration of the measurement 3 results 3 1 mean velocity field the time averaged velocity field showed the overall structure of the flow downstream of the vegetation patch at normalized height z h between 0 4 and 0 5 i e at the height of the plants the effect on streamwise velocity was clearly visible fig 2 mean velocity was diminished by about 20 in the wake of p crispus in relation to points at both sides of the plant the bigger decrease was visible downstream of m spicatum fig 2b mean transversal velocity field suggests that both plants caused a slight change in flow direction at patch edges fig 3 moreover looking at the velocity field across the whole water depth a region of decreased longitudinal velocity is clearly recognizable up to z h 0 3 above the bed downstream of p crispus fig 4 while downstream of m spicatum up to z h 0 5 fig 5 sections 3 and 5 i e at the sides of p crispus showed decreased longitudinal velocity only below z h 0 3 fig 4a c which was due to shear caused by sand dunes while downstream of m spicatum section 3 still shows the influence of the plant fig 5a mean vertical velocity distribution presented resemblance between sections 4 downstream of p crispus and section 3 downstream of m spicatum where about 0 5 m downstream of both patches there is a switch in flow direction toward the bottom figs 6 and 7 otherwise vertical direction was randomly distributed except few instances where upward direction is correlated with lower longitudinal velocity i e close to the bottom 3 2 turbulent event contributions the plots presented in figs 8 and 9 were based on formula 7 where the summary stress from each event eqs 1 4 is averaged over the whole measurement time and then normalised by the time averaged reynolds stress eq 8 therefore the presented results do not give information about the average strength of a singular event or about how frequently events from a particular quadrant were observed instead the results show which quadrants contributed more on average through the whole observation time the outcomes of event contributions calculated using formula 8 mostly showed that sweeps and ejections had positive contributions whereas outward and inward interactions were characterised by much smaller and negative contributions figs 8 and 9 visible exceptions to this rule took place at the points where a positive mean reynolds stress value was present resulting in a switched sign of the contribution coefficient e g profile 0 6 m in section 5 of fig 8 in some cases where the mean reynolds stress was approximately equal to zero the calculated contribution exceeded a typical values figs 8 and 9 the percentage of the measurement time when the extreme events were detected did not exceed 4 on average for all the measurement points for any given quadrant in the section directly behind the plant i e section 4 in particular for the patch of p crispus outward interactions took 0 9 of the observation time while inward interactions took 0 5 sweeps 3 4 and ejections 3 1 in the case of m spicatum also in section 4 the values were on average 0 9 for outward interactions 0 7 for inward interactions 3 3 for sweeps and 3 6 for ejections for the stress contributions of extreme events downstream of p crispus the most notable was the highly negative contribution of extreme ejections in the upper part of the profile in cross section 4 compared to those in the adjacent ones fig 8 moreover extreme inward and outward interactions had negligible contributions to the reynolds stress in the case of m spicatum in sections 3 and 4 there was a visible change between the contribution rates of ejections and sweeps where the former dominated above the vegetation height and the latter dominated below it fig 9 looking at the ratio of event contributions eq 9 it is evident that strong ejection and sweep events play a dominant role across the whole depth of the water fig 10 moreover the common feature observed in section 4 downstream of both plants was a peak visible in the nearest 0 1 m downstream profiles just below z h 0 5 fig 10 this finding is similar to the results shown by huai et al 2019 additionally downstream of m spicatum it was especially visible how the ratio between the contributions of even events and the contributions of odd events decreased with the distance around the vegetation layer fig 10 3 3 extreme events in relation to the reynolds stress the magnitudes of the extreme turbulent events eq 10 h 1 8 in each quadrant were related to an interpolated field of the u w reynolds stress figs 11 and 12 the negative stress values of the field mean that the majority of the overall stress comes from velocity fluctuations in the second and fourth quadrants the event magnitudes show the actual mean strength of the events in each quadrant and this information should be compared with the extreme event contributions figs 8 and 9 for example the higher contributions of extreme ejections visible for the top two points above the plant height 0 1 m downstream of p crispus in fig 8 section 4 were not reflected by comparably higher event magnitudes in the same spots fig 11 the difference must come from the fact that at these two points the events detected in the second quadrant were more numerous and or produced higher stress than those in the other quadrants therefore they contributed more but the magnitudes of individual extreme events were more comparable in the case of p crispus section 4 showed a pattern of strong ejection events starting from the nearest profile at z h 0 56 i e a few cm above the patch height and ascending towards the third profile i e 0 6 m downstream at z h 0 65 fig 11 section 4 furthermore for m spicatum the pattern of elevated ejections was not as pronounced as all events around the maximal vegetation height had elevated strength fig 12 sections 3 and 4 but the strongest ejections were still present in the profiles nearest to the plant moreover the profiles in closest proximity to the patches were characterised by stronger sweeps below the vegetation height other instances of high magnitude sweeps in the fourth quadrant were randomly distributed through all profiles but mostly close to the bed and such behaviour is usually connected with sediment motion and entrapment diplas and dancey 2013 the view from above on the layer around the maximal vegetation height highlights areas with negative u w reynolds stress which shows the extent of the mixing layer downstream of each plant at this height fig 13 the magnitudes of extreme events were higher in the this area up to a distance of 0 4 m downstream of the plants in sections adjacent to lines marking the plant width there were also elevated event magnitudes that indicated the horizontal spread of plant induced coherent motions fig 13 that correlated with transversal flow velocities downstream fig 3 3 4 time characteristics of the turbulent events the bursting events although almost instantaneous have unique time scales and can contribute to the local reynolds stress in either a period of frequent small contributions or infrequent large contributions lu and willmarth 1973 following this assumption the duration of each type of event i e when the quadrant identification function was equal to 1 in consecutive time steps eq 12 and consequently the time characteristics of the events from the whole measurement time were obtained eqs 13 15 as this investigation is focused on the most violent bursting events threshold h 1 8 was also applied in the identification function the computational results confirmed that there were multiple chains of time steps in the measurement data where threshold analysis attached observable pairs of u and w velocity fluctuations to one particular quadrant based on the research of czernuszenko and rowiński 2008 attention was paid to the three coefficients describing the mean time of sequence duration fig 14 the number of sequences fig 15 and the frequency of occurrence of the events fig 16 reflecting the plots presenting event magnitudes figs 11 and 12 the mean duration of ejections was higher above the patch height while sweeps lasted longer below that level especially in profiles closest to the patch fig 14 events from even quadrants lasted an average of 0 012 0 0002 s longer than odd events in profiles downstream of p crispus downstream of m spicatum there was a decreasing difference in the profiles in the closest profile events from even quadrants were 0 020 s longer and in the farthest profile these events were 0 009 s longer on average the number of registered extreme event sequences showed that sweeps and ejections occurred much more often than the other two types of events and that sweeps tended to occur in equal or higher numbers than ejections below the vegetation height fig 15 there was a large difference in the frequency of occurrence between even and odd events i e sweeps and ejections occurred up to ten times more than outward and inward interactions fig 16 4 discussion 4 1 time contributions of turbulent events downstream of the patches huai et al 2019 noticed that most sweep and ejection events occurred within just one third of the observation time which was linked to the passage of large vortices although velocity measurements at consecutive points in the sections were not recorded simultaneously a constant contribution to stress production along the plant wake should be visible at all the affected measurement points in other words if plant induced events are semi periodic curves showing the stress contributions in relation to the percentage of occurrence should be comparable for consecutive measurement points along the plant wake ghisalberti and nepf 2006 as well as huai et al 2019 obtained similar curves for different runs in experiments with uniform plant canopies where 80 of the stress from the second and fourth quadrants occurred within 30 of the measurement time the results showed that downstream of m spicatum points in a shear layer above the vegetation height in the three closest profiles formed similar curves i e 80 of the stress generated by all sweeps and ejections h 0 occurred within 20 of the measurement time at these points fig 17 on the other hand looking at the points with the highest magnitudes of ejections downstream of p crispus fig 11 a large difference between the profiles at 0 1 m and 0 35 m was visible fig 17 this difference indicates a more chaotic movement of turbulent structures or that the bursts were not induced by the patch this is consistent with the shorter duration of even event sequences downstream of p crispus in relation to those in the same profile downstream of the m spicatum patch fig 14 the next view on an event s contribution requires a closer look at time characteristics where individual event occurrences were recorded in the sequences such sequences signal the presence of large scale coherent structures which is possible as the turbulence statistics indicated that mixing layer formed downstream the patches przyborowski et al 2019b the time characteristics show that the ejection events being the most frequent fig 16 were also the longest fig 14 and the most numerous fig 15 especially above z h 0 5 on the other hand the sweep sequences were more numerous below that height but were characterised by shorter durations occurring more than ejections in points closest to the bed moreover combining the number of the event sequences fig 15 with the amount of u w reynolds stress carried by the extreme events magnitude strips in figs 11 and 12 gives a view on how strong on average and in the smallest observable period each kind of event was from this comparison comes the fact that e g a single ejection sequence above z h 0 5 downstream of m spicatum in the profile 0 1 m downstream carried the most momentum but it was dispersed through time in the case of p crispus such ejection sequences were shorter fig 14 and carried less momentum this conclusion is in agreement with the curves shown in fig 17 i e even events delivered higher stress contributions in a shorter time downstream of m spicatum at the points nearest the patch below the vegetation height the extreme sweeps had higher magnitudes and time persistence than those above that level these insights highlight that downstream of the plants the nature of even events changed depending on the relative position to the patch this fact stays in agreement with the assumption that the evolution of large coherent structures in form of head down and head up hairpin vortices finnigan et al 2009 happened downstream of the patches 4 2 stress contributions of sweeps and ejections downstream of the patches when using the threshold events with small stress contributions are not considered in the presented quadrant analysis in such a case it is first noticeable that the sweep contributions diminished in all the sections that were not in the plant wake figs 8 and 9 second this approach narrows the analysis downstream of a patch pointing out exactly which events in which quadrant exert the highest stress on average in particular in the sections that cover the plant wake a clear transition between the dominance of sweeps over ejections at the height of the canopy is visible up to the third profile downstream sections 3 and 4 figs 8 and 9 in summary peaks in downward and upward momentum transport i e sweeps and ejections downstream of the patch around the height of the patch had similar spatial distribution to the situation where horizontal axis large scale vortices were generated at the boundaries of plant canopies ghisalberti and nepf 2006 marjoribanks et al 2017a caroppi et al 2018 what is more our observations match the reported results from the field experiment of sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2012 where monami motions were observed in a large vegetation patch which was attributed to the presence of coherent events along the mixing layer identical to horseshoe vortices our result are also comparable to those of marjoribanks et al 2017a there were reported vortices generating sweeps and ejections above the canopy of 0 15 m long flexible stems that were two times larger in diameter than ours however the canopy was characterized by similar density see przyborowski et al 2019b fig 1 4 3 turbulent event strength the observation of the magnitudes of extreme events and reynolds stress figs 11 and 12 showed that vegetation patch induced turbulence was projected downstream in a narrow mixing layer protruding from the end of the top of the vegetation hu et al 2018 przyborowski et al 2019b however this observation needs a few remarks first by taking into account only the velocity fluctuations above a certain threshold the fine scale turbulence induced by shoots is neglected on the other hand such small turbulence should dissipate into heat at a relatively short distance downstream ghisalberti and nepf 2002 second as a porous obstruction a patch of flexible plants does not disrupt large upstream flow motions which was shown by siniscalchi and nikora 2013 therefore the channel depth and boundary layer coherent structures from upstream remain visible downstream of flexible vegetation ghisalberti and nepf 2009 finally given the patch height and width aspect ratio only vertical patch scale eddies should propagate from the plant flow boundary hu et al 2018 therefore even without the smallest scale turbulence the magnitudes of extreme events still show a mixed picture of both ambient and vegetation induced coherent structures by considering the plant characteristics more details can be uncovered 4 4 effects of the vegetation characteristics on coherent structures in the investigated cases upward acceleration and longitudinal deceleration motions carrying the eddies towards the free surface are visible as a region of strong ejections above the vegetation height downstream of both plants figs 11 and 12 where mean velocity was substantially higher than below figs 4 and 5 the question is whether the plant flexibility and density its configuration in the water or its morphological traits were responsible for the fact that the ejections observed downstream of the stiffer plant were stronger in a previous paper przyborowski et al 2019b analogies to various investigations showed that all of these characteristics contribute to the stress produced in the mixing layer downstream of the patches more thorough studies in the future may provide answers regarding which characteristics are most influential for the generation of coherent structures in their works caroppi et al 2019 and marjoribanks et al 2017a noticed that the presence of foliage generated stronger coherent events this observation is hard to compare with the presented results as downstream of p crispus a species with more developed leaves larger and thicker the mean contribution of stress value in extreme ejection events was lower than that downstream of m spicatum figs 8 and 9 and the ratio of event contributions was higher at only one point fig 10 on the other hand in terms of the events contribution to the overall stress the results were comparable for both plants the difference may be connected to the frequency of stem motions which may have varied for both patches and thus affected the level of induced drag siniscalchi and nikora 2013 what is more when looking at mean streamwise velocity distribution figs 4 and 5 and on time averaged reynolds stresses figs 11 and 12 it is visible that p crispus had less pronounced effect on those characteristics and therefore induced less drag and produced weaker mixing layer another observable effect of the vegetation was that strong sweeps dominated in terms of the frequency fig 16 and stress contributions figs 8 and 9 at the points below a maximal vegetation height this behaviour is characteristic of canopy flows nezu and sanjou 2008 this implies that at least for the profiles 0 1 m downstream below the patch height observed coherent events may still retain traits similar to those of canopy flow where sweeps would penetrate vegetation cover in this case they transported the momentum into the lower velocity layer directly behind the plant through the roller vortices generated upstream hu et al 2018 such separation bubbles were found downstream from circular patches of rigid stems at the smaller distances along with the increase of patch density for solid volume fraction φ 0 05 vortices were absent zong and nepf 2011 the more submerged patch is such distance where recirculation is formed also decreases e g for circular patch of φ 0 23 and height of the half of water depth as in our case the recirculation bubble formed at distance equal to 0 32 of patch diameter chang et al 2020 what is more in our case the patch height was equal or shorter than its width and for such ratio the von karman vortex street was typically not observed hu et al 2018 instead the vertical vortices should dominate as sand jensen 1998 reported for the longer and wider patches of ranunculus peltatus shrank in the mixing layer coherent eddies are visible as the ejection and sweep motions nezu and sanjou 2008 which can also be generated by head down and head up hairpin vortices also called horseshoe vortices similar to simulation outcomes obtained by finnigan et al 2009 the observed pattern of the event magnitudes figs 11 and 12 matches this situation however marjoribanks et al 2017a noticed that in the case of highly flexible plants a noticeable increase in strong ejection events without a simultaneous increase in sweep events has an unknown origin in ecohydrology such phenomenon may have meaningful impact on the vegetative spread of patches sediment transport as well as nutrient dynamics clarke 2002 this is due to the fact that the organised water motions in upward direction can carry solids and air bubbles farther away downstream a plant patch additionally in this paper we did not look into the transversal velocity fluctuations which could signal a presence of vortices with vertical axis originating from the shear at the sides of vegetation patches such turbulence was once detected downstream a wide patch of m spicatum in the same river przyborowski et al 2019a and likely such phenomena also influence the distribution of streamwise velocity fluctuations considering the above remarks and that the investigated patches did not grow as a uniform canopy the following conclusion forms downstream of these patches signs matching the presence of hairpin vortices exist with the latter visible up to 0 6 m downstream of the stiffer patch fig 18 5 conclusions following the theoretical and experimental investigations of researchers cited in this paper and applying their observations to the described results two kinds of flow disturbances visible in a vertical plane can be distinguished downstream of both investigated submerged patches of flexible vegetation fig 18 1 a strong sweeping motion of the eddies forming in the wake of a patch pushing whirls into the low velocity region directly behind a plant 2 a disturbance observed above the patch height in the mixing layer where ejections carry vortices downstream towards the free surface but only up to a distance of 0 6 m i e approximately four times the height of the patch the above mentioned phenomena fit best to the model showing generation of sweep and ejection movements through existence of hairpin vortices forming above canopy downstream of inflection point finnigan et al 2009 our results imply that downstream of patches that cover half of the water depth the plant induced sweeps and ejections do not propagate further downstream than the patch length when aggregated into sequences it was evident that both kinds of organised motion were characterised by a 2 to 3 times longer duration and had a higher frequency than outward and inward interactions additionally the measured instantaneous stress values were more comparable meaning that on average the observed extreme sweep ejection motions were not much more violent than outward inward interactions but they produced more stress over time in a region closer to the patches but above their height extreme ejection events contributed much more to the overall stress than sweeps however there were differences in the obtained results between both patches as the dimensions of these patches were similar a combination of plant morphological and biomechanical traits was responsible for generation of shear and the extent of mixing layer downstream in particular the mean absolute strength of extreme ejections was higher in the case of the stiffer plant m spicatum and those events were visible in a longer and wider area downstream the sequences of both types of extreme even events were also more time persistent than those in the case of the flow region behind p crispus in conclusion the presented results mostly agree with the knowledge obtained in experiments with different conditions the extreme events had comparable percentages of detection in both cases while it was shown that downstream of m spicatum the strongest events remained present in consecutive profiles farther from the patch than those downstream of p crispus where sweep and ejection sequences were weaker the observable distribution of sweeps and ejections match models showing formation of hairpin vortices above vegetation canopies that knowledge is then desirable to understand processes like downstream accumulation of sediment nutrients and gas fluxes or even plants reproduction techniques from this perspective the phenomena of strong ejections observed downstream in both patches their possible connection to plant motions and the meaning of such events in river ecohydrology remain questions that need to be answered by further interdisciplinary research preferably experiments with rigid stems or rigid artificial plants of the same spatial characteristics performed in similar hydraulic conditions should show to what extent the plant flexibility is affecting the generation of coherent

4703,velocity measurements from experiments performed downstream of patches of submerged aquatic vegetation were analysed two patches of different species i e p crispus and m spicatum were characterised by the same size measurement points covered the water depth in the centre and at the sides of the patches from 0 1 m to 0 85 m downstream conditional quadrant analysis was modified and applied to the data to study turbulence structures propagating from the mixing layer formed at the interface between the vegetation canopy and flow above these structures were responsible for the majority of momentum transport and tended to vary with patch distance height and plant physical characteristics the stiffer plant i e m spicatum produced a higher difference between the contributions of even events i e sweeps and ejections and odd events i e outward and inward interactions the changes in the detected strong bursting events across measurement profiles indicated that two main kinds of organised motions occurred immediately behind the plant patches strong sweep motions carried water flow into the low velocity region below the vegetation height strong ejections which had the longest time of the occurrence and had the highest contributions to the u w reynolds stress pushed flow towards the water surface both kinds of extreme events produced the same reynolds stress in an instant but ejections had a higher frequency of occurrence the presented results show how the observed changes in ejection and sweeps distribution reflect the model where vegetation canopy induced vortices transform into the dual head hairpin vortices downstream of the inflection point keywords coherent structures aquatic vegetation river turbulence acoustic doppler velocimetry field experiments quadrant analysis 1 introduction one of the topics pursued in the analysis of flow is the phenomenon of turbulent structures which occur within certain time scales in the presence of a boundary layer willmarth and lu 1972 and show momentum fluxes nezu and nakagawa 1993 regarding vegetated flow boundaries of different scales are interconnected nikora 2010 aberle and järvelä 2015 and thus following the origins of detected structures is problematic for example in addition to vegetation induced mixing there are large scale phenomena present in rivers e g low frequency flow structures franca and lemmin 2014 and secondary currents occurring in bends termini and piraino 2011 the analysis of flow biota interactions is even more complex for the case of submerged vegetation as it tends to be more flexible than emergent species dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 moreover such plants undergo swaying motions called monami or for horizontally oriented flexible species flapping motions siniscalchi and nikora 2013 which help to reduce drag induced turbulence okamoto and nezu 2009 nevertheless the analysis of coherent structures provides information about momentum and mass transport between flow layers which in turn means nutrient and gas fluxes within the river depth ghisalberti and nepf 2002 coherent structures manifest in turbulent flow where fluctuating longitudinal and vertical velocity components contribute to the u w reynolds stress nezu and nakagawa 1993 near the bed ejection events are motions responsible for slow flow movement into the free flow layer while sweeps are quick motions directed towards the boundary layer salim et al 2017 to detect these periodic phenomena which are characterised by a second order moment of velocities a quadrant analysis method can be exploited lu and willmarth 1973 in many cases the investigation of quadrant contributions in the presence of vegetation focuses mostly on a contribution to the reynolds stress of all the events without using a threshold which leaves only turbulent events of the highest stress e g ghisalberti and nepf 2006 termini and di leonardo 2017 hence all the recorded u and w velocity fluctuations are taken into the analysis without focusing on the pairs producing the highest stress nezu and sanjou 2008 did not use a thresholding method arguing that less organised motions have a weak presence in vegetated flows on the other hand some of the momentum transport is lost within the vegetation due to the force needed to move flexible stems which retain the same frequency as ambient turbulence siniscalchi and nikora 2013 therefore this energy loss induced by stems and leaves should result in turbulence that forms small quickly dispersing vortices in a plant wake nikora 2010 in response to these studies conditional quadrant analysis was then recently used in simulations with flexible vegetation by marjoribanks et al 2017a and in laboratory experiments by caroppi et al 2018 and huai et al 2019 both laboratory investigations showed that above a certain threshold level implemented in the quadrant analysis the observable outward and inward interactions were severely diminished favouring stronger bursting events to focus more on these events that contribute most to the overall stress in turbulent flows i e sweeps and ejections an enhanced version of the quadrant technique was proposed by ferreira et al 2009 in short additional conditions based on the persistence of u were formulated to include events correlated with high enough values of longitudinal velocity fluctuations the thresholding method as well as the focus on sweeps and ejections were implemented in this paper in order to carry on specific investigation of bursts downstream of two aquatic plants species different plant species and patch configurations change the flow patterns in a channel which is vital for predicting channel resistance and sedimentation zones e g green 2005 marjoribanks et al 2017b yang and nepf 2019 moreover the production of turbulent energy in shear layers affects the sedimentation rate nepf 2012 liu et al 2018 additionally close to a channel bed coherent events transport momentum which affects coarser mobile particles ferreira et al 2009 sweeps and ejections were found to be dominant in a region of scouring behind an obstacle khan and sharma 2020 as these events occur at the canopy height huai et al 2019 there is a possibility that the strongest flow motion will affect particles entrapped in the plant leaves moreover even whole parts of the shoots can be affected and may be subject to their reproduction and spreading due to the fragmentation of shoots by water currents e g for invasive species santamaria 2002 tokarska guzik 2005 łoboda et al 2018a understanding the coherent flow structures downstream may also affect fish swimming as this subject is still in its infancy wilkes et al 2013 to date most of the investigations that have addressed turbulent events in the presence of vegetation have focused on large uniform canopies e g ghisalberti and nepf 2006 nezu and sanjou 2008 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2012 marjoribanks et al 2017a huai et al 2019 where ejection events dominate flow above the plant canopy analyses of turbulence performed in natural conditions with a single patch of flexible vegetation are very rare and new e g przyborowski et al 2018 2019a biggs et al 2019 and thus need more attention as a result experiments were conducted with the use of acoustic doppler velocimeters in an unobstructed lowland river with a low water level there the velocity field behind two patches of submerged vegetation was measured przyborowski et al 2019b the evolution of coherent structures in the presence of vegetation canopy were described by models derived from numerical simulations e g in wind flow above the forest dupont and brunet 2009 or water flow above uniform aquatic vegetation finnigan et al 2009 marjoribanks et al 2017a few laboratory research e g nezu and sanjou 2008 devi and kumar 2016 confirmed a specific relationship between sweeps and ejections in the canopy flow marjoribanks et al 2017a noted that flexible plants can display unknown types of turbulence in a mixing layer and wake it is then desirable to confirm and extend such studies into the case of flow in a natural river downstream of a vegetation patch it may serve as a control example and study case for extended laboratory investigations the use of conditional quadrant analysis enables to focus on the turbulent events of a chosen stress scale to find out if there were visible patterns in distribution and characteristics of strong coherent structures matching existing models we carried out further analysis of the streamwise and vertical fluctuations of velocity gathered in previous experiments przyborowski et al 2019b what is more the fact of having two distinct vegetation species allowed us to look on how the strongest bursting events propagate downstream of flexible plants what is the spatial extent of certain coherent structures and how morphological and biomechanical plant characteristics affect such turbulences 2 methods 2 1 data collection the measurements were conducted during two campaigns in summer 2017 in a sandy bedded lowland reach of the świder river in poland 52 06 21 2 n 21 13 42 0 e the measurements took place around 3 m from the right bank of the river where no other plants were present close to this spot two species were found in the channel potamogeton crispus l and myriophyllum spicatum l prior to each experiment plants were carefully moved onto the position and mounted with the river sediment as were originally a single species formed an individual patch of similar size i e each covered an approximately 1 m long and 0 2 m wide area each patch consisted of over a dozen of stems which were protruding from a circular place 0 20 m in diameter the stems were floating up to 0 15 0 20 m above the mobile sandy bed in approximately 0 3 m deep water these species were found to be different in terms of morphological and biomechanical traits przyborowski et al 2019b but both are flexible and exert wavy motions in morphology the key differences were 1 in stem cross sectional area where p crispus species has an ellipsoidal shape while m spicatum circular shape but both around 70 of empty air space and 2 in leaf shapes where p crispus is characterised by oblong stiffer curly leaves in comparison to thin multiple needles in whorls of m spicatum łoboda et al 2018b przyborowski et al 2019b thus mostly due to leaves morphology the patch formed from m spicatum species was identified as the one with slightly higher density see przyborowski et al 2019b fig 1 in biomechanics tests showed that m spicatum was characterised by higher flexural strain and rigidity than p crispus while modulus values indicated that m spicatum species is less prone to deformation and return to its undeformed form przyborowski et al 2019b vertical profiles 24 of which formed a 4x6 spatial mesh fig 1 were chosen to collect the 3d velocity field downstream of each plant the velocity time series used for further analysis were obtained using acoustic doppler velocimeters vectrino profiler revision 2779 1 32 nortek as rud norway mounted on a wide stabilized platform the frequency of the measurements was set to 50 hz and each sample time was at least 3 min long which gave 9000 recorded time steps per measured point 2 2 data processing the signal to noise ratio and signal correlation thresholds equal to 15 db and 70 respectively were used to eliminate unreliable data and replace them using linear interpolation in the next step modified 3d space thresholding filter goring and nikora 2002 wahl 2003 parsheh et al 2010 was used to remove spikes vectrino profilers bottom track feature allowed us to gather data about the probe s height above the mobile bed due to bed depth changes a normalised depth z h scale was used in the results the stress and velocity fields used as the background in relevant plots were produced using cubic interpolation between measured points 2 3 quadrant analysis post processed velocity data were used to compute the reynolds stress and to assign longitudinal u and vertical w velocity fluctuations into four groups outward and inward interactions sweeps and ejections to enhance the detection of events characteristic of vegetated flows i e sweeps and ejections additional criteria were applied following the updated quadrant technique proposed by ferreira et al 2009 this method matches our investigation of the turbulence in a rough vegetated channel with a small relative submergence as it was developed for a better understanding of how bedload transport affects the generation of coherent turbulent events in similar flow conditions franca et al 2014 the novelty implemented in the presented investigation was that points of highest u values from first and third quadrants did not count as sweeps and ejections in contrary to the above technique these updated criteria are described for the following quadrants for outward interactions 1 q out u w r u 0 w σ h u u σ for ejections 2 q ej u w r u 0 w 0 w σ h u u σ for inward interactions 3 q inw u w r u 0 w 0 w σ h u u σ for sweeps 4 q sw u w r u 0 w 0 w σ h u u σ w 0 where the threshold σh was obtained by the following equation σ h h u rms w rms and the thresholds σ and σ by 6 σ 2 5 u rms urms and wrms denote the root mean squares of the longitudinal and vertical velocity fluctuations the threshold coefficient h called the hole size is equal to 1 8 which was used in the ferreira et al 2009 method a higher value for example h 3 which was used by chen et al 2013 in laboratory conditions with vegetation would lower the number of detected extreme events 2 4 event contributions and event ratios at each measurement point the time averaged stress contribution from events in each quadrant is given by the following equation raupach 1981 7 u w i h lim t 1 t t 0 t 0 t u t w t q i h u t w t d t where i represents the quadrant number t is the whole time of the measurement and h is the hole size the angled brackets represent conditional averaging and qi h is a function equal to 1 if u w belongs to quadrant i according to the conditions shown in equations 1 to 4 otherwise it is equal to 0 therefore the relation of the time averaged stress from the quadrant to the time averaged reynolds stress u w is given by the following equation 8 s i h u w i h u w the summary contribution of the four quadrants is equal to 1 raupach 1981 when the hole size is equal to 0 consequently the ratio of sweep and ejection event contributions to the outward and inward interaction contributions was calculated as 9 s ratio s 2 0 s 4 0 s 1 0 s 3 0 the stress contributions from the quadrants were less investigated in the case of extreme events i e when h is greater than zero following the method proposed by ferreira et al 2009 strong longitudinal velocity fluctuations which would normally be omitted with a typical hyperbolic threshold were also included as extreme events the magnitude of extreme events was calculated by averaging the stress from those events by the number of time steps where the particular type of event was detected ni h not the actual number of time steps in 3 minute long average time measurements as follows 10 mag u w i h 1 n i h t 1 t u t w t q i h u t w t additionally the ratio of the number of detected events in the second n2 h and fourth n4 h quadrants to the number of events in the first n1 h and third n3 h quadrants was calculated as 11 n ratio n 2 h n 4 h n 1 h n 3 h 2 5 time characteristics based on the event identification scheme eqs 1 to 4 with the hole size h 1 8 the time characteristics of the events were calculated following the methodology shown by lu and willmarth 1973 and czernuszenko and rowiński 2008 sweeps and ejections represent motions in measured water volume that have significantly stronger or weaker velocity than time averaged value simultaneously in both streamwise and vertical directions what is more it is presumed that a singular event can be visible across a few adjacent data points in the time series as it has larger time scale than the higher frequency turbulences nezu and nakagawa 1993 in a flow over canopy this time period derives from the assumption that these events mark the passage of large scale coherent structures in form of hairpin vortices finnigan et al 2009 as the data collection frequency of the vectrino profiler was fixed at 50 hz the shortest single occurrence of an event in the time series was assumed to have a maximal duration of 0 02 sec if the same event was detected in k consecutive points in time it was counted as one long event here in time characteristics both cases i e single and prolonged event occurrence will be called a sequence thus the duration of a sequence was calculated as 12 δ t m i h 0 02 q i h u t j w t j 1 0 02 1 k q i h u t j k w t j k 1 where m is the number of identified sequences in the quadrant qi h is the event identification function j is a given point in the time series and k is a consecutive step in the time series the mean duration of events was then calculated as 13 t i h 1 n m 1 n δ t m i h where n is the sum of the identified sequences in each quadrant the maximal time of the event was calculated as 14 t max i h m a x δ t m i h and the frequency of occurrence of the events was calculated as 15 p i h m 1 n δ t m i h δ t where δt is the total duration of the measurement 3 results 3 1 mean velocity field the time averaged velocity field showed the overall structure of the flow downstream of the vegetation patch at normalized height z h between 0 4 and 0 5 i e at the height of the plants the effect on streamwise velocity was clearly visible fig 2 mean velocity was diminished by about 20 in the wake of p crispus in relation to points at both sides of the plant the bigger decrease was visible downstream of m spicatum fig 2b mean transversal velocity field suggests that both plants caused a slight change in flow direction at patch edges fig 3 moreover looking at the velocity field across the whole water depth a region of decreased longitudinal velocity is clearly recognizable up to z h 0 3 above the bed downstream of p crispus fig 4 while downstream of m spicatum up to z h 0 5 fig 5 sections 3 and 5 i e at the sides of p crispus showed decreased longitudinal velocity only below z h 0 3 fig 4a c which was due to shear caused by sand dunes while downstream of m spicatum section 3 still shows the influence of the plant fig 5a mean vertical velocity distribution presented resemblance between sections 4 downstream of p crispus and section 3 downstream of m spicatum where about 0 5 m downstream of both patches there is a switch in flow direction toward the bottom figs 6 and 7 otherwise vertical direction was randomly distributed except few instances where upward direction is correlated with lower longitudinal velocity i e close to the bottom 3 2 turbulent event contributions the plots presented in figs 8 and 9 were based on formula 7 where the summary stress from each event eqs 1 4 is averaged over the whole measurement time and then normalised by the time averaged reynolds stress eq 8 therefore the presented results do not give information about the average strength of a singular event or about how frequently events from a particular quadrant were observed instead the results show which quadrants contributed more on average through the whole observation time the outcomes of event contributions calculated using formula 8 mostly showed that sweeps and ejections had positive contributions whereas outward and inward interactions were characterised by much smaller and negative contributions figs 8 and 9 visible exceptions to this rule took place at the points where a positive mean reynolds stress value was present resulting in a switched sign of the contribution coefficient e g profile 0 6 m in section 5 of fig 8 in some cases where the mean reynolds stress was approximately equal to zero the calculated contribution exceeded a typical values figs 8 and 9 the percentage of the measurement time when the extreme events were detected did not exceed 4 on average for all the measurement points for any given quadrant in the section directly behind the plant i e section 4 in particular for the patch of p crispus outward interactions took 0 9 of the observation time while inward interactions took 0 5 sweeps 3 4 and ejections 3 1 in the case of m spicatum also in section 4 the values were on average 0 9 for outward interactions 0 7 for inward interactions 3 3 for sweeps and 3 6 for ejections for the stress contributions of extreme events downstream of p crispus the most notable was the highly negative contribution of extreme ejections in the upper part of the profile in cross section 4 compared to those in the adjacent ones fig 8 moreover extreme inward and outward interactions had negligible contributions to the reynolds stress in the case of m spicatum in sections 3 and 4 there was a visible change between the contribution rates of ejections and sweeps where the former dominated above the vegetation height and the latter dominated below it fig 9 looking at the ratio of event contributions eq 9 it is evident that strong ejection and sweep events play a dominant role across the whole depth of the water fig 10 moreover the common feature observed in section 4 downstream of both plants was a peak visible in the nearest 0 1 m downstream profiles just below z h 0 5 fig 10 this finding is similar to the results shown by huai et al 2019 additionally downstream of m spicatum it was especially visible how the ratio between the contributions of even events and the contributions of odd events decreased with the distance around the vegetation layer fig 10 3 3 extreme events in relation to the reynolds stress the magnitudes of the extreme turbulent events eq 10 h 1 8 in each quadrant were related to an interpolated field of the u w reynolds stress figs 11 and 12 the negative stress values of the field mean that the majority of the overall stress comes from velocity fluctuations in the second and fourth quadrants the event magnitudes show the actual mean strength of the events in each quadrant and this information should be compared with the extreme event contributions figs 8 and 9 for example the higher contributions of extreme ejections visible for the top two points above the plant height 0 1 m downstream of p crispus in fig 8 section 4 were not reflected by comparably higher event magnitudes in the same spots fig 11 the difference must come from the fact that at these two points the events detected in the second quadrant were more numerous and or produced higher stress than those in the other quadrants therefore they contributed more but the magnitudes of individual extreme events were more comparable in the case of p crispus section 4 showed a pattern of strong ejection events starting from the nearest profile at z h 0 56 i e a few cm above the patch height and ascending towards the third profile i e 0 6 m downstream at z h 0 65 fig 11 section 4 furthermore for m spicatum the pattern of elevated ejections was not as pronounced as all events around the maximal vegetation height had elevated strength fig 12 sections 3 and 4 but the strongest ejections were still present in the profiles nearest to the plant moreover the profiles in closest proximity to the patches were characterised by stronger sweeps below the vegetation height other instances of high magnitude sweeps in the fourth quadrant were randomly distributed through all profiles but mostly close to the bed and such behaviour is usually connected with sediment motion and entrapment diplas and dancey 2013 the view from above on the layer around the maximal vegetation height highlights areas with negative u w reynolds stress which shows the extent of the mixing layer downstream of each plant at this height fig 13 the magnitudes of extreme events were higher in the this area up to a distance of 0 4 m downstream of the plants in sections adjacent to lines marking the plant width there were also elevated event magnitudes that indicated the horizontal spread of plant induced coherent motions fig 13 that correlated with transversal flow velocities downstream fig 3 3 4 time characteristics of the turbulent events the bursting events although almost instantaneous have unique time scales and can contribute to the local reynolds stress in either a period of frequent small contributions or infrequent large contributions lu and willmarth 1973 following this assumption the duration of each type of event i e when the quadrant identification function was equal to 1 in consecutive time steps eq 12 and consequently the time characteristics of the events from the whole measurement time were obtained eqs 13 15 as this investigation is focused on the most violent bursting events threshold h 1 8 was also applied in the identification function the computational results confirmed that there were multiple chains of time steps in the measurement data where threshold analysis attached observable pairs of u and w velocity fluctuations to one particular quadrant based on the research of czernuszenko and rowiński 2008 attention was paid to the three coefficients describing the mean time of sequence duration fig 14 the number of sequences fig 15 and the frequency of occurrence of the events fig 16 reflecting the plots presenting event magnitudes figs 11 and 12 the mean duration of ejections was higher above the patch height while sweeps lasted longer below that level especially in profiles closest to the patch fig 14 events from even quadrants lasted an average of 0 012 0 0002 s longer than odd events in profiles downstream of p crispus downstream of m spicatum there was a decreasing difference in the profiles in the closest profile events from even quadrants were 0 020 s longer and in the farthest profile these events were 0 009 s longer on average the number of registered extreme event sequences showed that sweeps and ejections occurred much more often than the other two types of events and that sweeps tended to occur in equal or higher numbers than ejections below the vegetation height fig 15 there was a large difference in the frequency of occurrence between even and odd events i e sweeps and ejections occurred up to ten times more than outward and inward interactions fig 16 4 discussion 4 1 time contributions of turbulent events downstream of the patches huai et al 2019 noticed that most sweep and ejection events occurred within just one third of the observation time which was linked to the passage of large vortices although velocity measurements at consecutive points in the sections were not recorded simultaneously a constant contribution to stress production along the plant wake should be visible at all the affected measurement points in other words if plant induced events are semi periodic curves showing the stress contributions in relation to the percentage of occurrence should be comparable for consecutive measurement points along the plant wake ghisalberti and nepf 2006 as well as huai et al 2019 obtained similar curves for different runs in experiments with uniform plant canopies where 80 of the stress from the second and fourth quadrants occurred within 30 of the measurement time the results showed that downstream of m spicatum points in a shear layer above the vegetation height in the three closest profiles formed similar curves i e 80 of the stress generated by all sweeps and ejections h 0 occurred within 20 of the measurement time at these points fig 17 on the other hand looking at the points with the highest magnitudes of ejections downstream of p crispus fig 11 a large difference between the profiles at 0 1 m and 0 35 m was visible fig 17 this difference indicates a more chaotic movement of turbulent structures or that the bursts were not induced by the patch this is consistent with the shorter duration of even event sequences downstream of p crispus in relation to those in the same profile downstream of the m spicatum patch fig 14 the next view on an event s contribution requires a closer look at time characteristics where individual event occurrences were recorded in the sequences such sequences signal the presence of large scale coherent structures which is possible as the turbulence statistics indicated that mixing layer formed downstream the patches przyborowski et al 2019b the time characteristics show that the ejection events being the most frequent fig 16 were also the longest fig 14 and the most numerous fig 15 especially above z h 0 5 on the other hand the sweep sequences were more numerous below that height but were characterised by shorter durations occurring more than ejections in points closest to the bed moreover combining the number of the event sequences fig 15 with the amount of u w reynolds stress carried by the extreme events magnitude strips in figs 11 and 12 gives a view on how strong on average and in the smallest observable period each kind of event was from this comparison comes the fact that e g a single ejection sequence above z h 0 5 downstream of m spicatum in the profile 0 1 m downstream carried the most momentum but it was dispersed through time in the case of p crispus such ejection sequences were shorter fig 14 and carried less momentum this conclusion is in agreement with the curves shown in fig 17 i e even events delivered higher stress contributions in a shorter time downstream of m spicatum at the points nearest the patch below the vegetation height the extreme sweeps had higher magnitudes and time persistence than those above that level these insights highlight that downstream of the plants the nature of even events changed depending on the relative position to the patch this fact stays in agreement with the assumption that the evolution of large coherent structures in form of head down and head up hairpin vortices finnigan et al 2009 happened downstream of the patches 4 2 stress contributions of sweeps and ejections downstream of the patches when using the threshold events with small stress contributions are not considered in the presented quadrant analysis in such a case it is first noticeable that the sweep contributions diminished in all the sections that were not in the plant wake figs 8 and 9 second this approach narrows the analysis downstream of a patch pointing out exactly which events in which quadrant exert the highest stress on average in particular in the sections that cover the plant wake a clear transition between the dominance of sweeps over ejections at the height of the canopy is visible up to the third profile downstream sections 3 and 4 figs 8 and 9 in summary peaks in downward and upward momentum transport i e sweeps and ejections downstream of the patch around the height of the patch had similar spatial distribution to the situation where horizontal axis large scale vortices were generated at the boundaries of plant canopies ghisalberti and nepf 2006 marjoribanks et al 2017a caroppi et al 2018 what is more our observations match the reported results from the field experiment of sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2012 where monami motions were observed in a large vegetation patch which was attributed to the presence of coherent events along the mixing layer identical to horseshoe vortices our result are also comparable to those of marjoribanks et al 2017a there were reported vortices generating sweeps and ejections above the canopy of 0 15 m long flexible stems that were two times larger in diameter than ours however the canopy was characterized by similar density see przyborowski et al 2019b fig 1 4 3 turbulent event strength the observation of the magnitudes of extreme events and reynolds stress figs 11 and 12 showed that vegetation patch induced turbulence was projected downstream in a narrow mixing layer protruding from the end of the top of the vegetation hu et al 2018 przyborowski et al 2019b however this observation needs a few remarks first by taking into account only the velocity fluctuations above a certain threshold the fine scale turbulence induced by shoots is neglected on the other hand such small turbulence should dissipate into heat at a relatively short distance downstream ghisalberti and nepf 2002 second as a porous obstruction a patch of flexible plants does not disrupt large upstream flow motions which was shown by siniscalchi and nikora 2013 therefore the channel depth and boundary layer coherent structures from upstream remain visible downstream of flexible vegetation ghisalberti and nepf 2009 finally given the patch height and width aspect ratio only vertical patch scale eddies should propagate from the plant flow boundary hu et al 2018 therefore even without the smallest scale turbulence the magnitudes of extreme events still show a mixed picture of both ambient and vegetation induced coherent structures by considering the plant characteristics more details can be uncovered 4 4 effects of the vegetation characteristics on coherent structures in the investigated cases upward acceleration and longitudinal deceleration motions carrying the eddies towards the free surface are visible as a region of strong ejections above the vegetation height downstream of both plants figs 11 and 12 where mean velocity was substantially higher than below figs 4 and 5 the question is whether the plant flexibility and density its configuration in the water or its morphological traits were responsible for the fact that the ejections observed downstream of the stiffer plant were stronger in a previous paper przyborowski et al 2019b analogies to various investigations showed that all of these characteristics contribute to the stress produced in the mixing layer downstream of the patches more thorough studies in the future may provide answers regarding which characteristics are most influential for the generation of coherent structures in their works caroppi et al 2019 and marjoribanks et al 2017a noticed that the presence of foliage generated stronger coherent events this observation is hard to compare with the presented results as downstream of p crispus a species with more developed leaves larger and thicker the mean contribution of stress value in extreme ejection events was lower than that downstream of m spicatum figs 8 and 9 and the ratio of event contributions was higher at only one point fig 10 on the other hand in terms of the events contribution to the overall stress the results were comparable for both plants the difference may be connected to the frequency of stem motions which may have varied for both patches and thus affected the level of induced drag siniscalchi and nikora 2013 what is more when looking at mean streamwise velocity distribution figs 4 and 5 and on time averaged reynolds stresses figs 11 and 12 it is visible that p crispus had less pronounced effect on those characteristics and therefore induced less drag and produced weaker mixing layer another observable effect of the vegetation was that strong sweeps dominated in terms of the frequency fig 16 and stress contributions figs 8 and 9 at the points below a maximal vegetation height this behaviour is characteristic of canopy flows nezu and sanjou 2008 this implies that at least for the profiles 0 1 m downstream below the patch height observed coherent events may still retain traits similar to those of canopy flow where sweeps would penetrate vegetation cover in this case they transported the momentum into the lower velocity layer directly behind the plant through the roller vortices generated upstream hu et al 2018 such separation bubbles were found downstream from circular patches of rigid stems at the smaller distances along with the increase of patch density for solid volume fraction φ 0 05 vortices were absent zong and nepf 2011 the more submerged patch is such distance where recirculation is formed also decreases e g for circular patch of φ 0 23 and height of the half of water depth as in our case the recirculation bubble formed at distance equal to 0 32 of patch diameter chang et al 2020 what is more in our case the patch height was equal or shorter than its width and for such ratio the von karman vortex street was typically not observed hu et al 2018 instead the vertical vortices should dominate as sand jensen 1998 reported for the longer and wider patches of ranunculus peltatus shrank in the mixing layer coherent eddies are visible as the ejection and sweep motions nezu and sanjou 2008 which can also be generated by head down and head up hairpin vortices also called horseshoe vortices similar to simulation outcomes obtained by finnigan et al 2009 the observed pattern of the event magnitudes figs 11 and 12 matches this situation however marjoribanks et al 2017a noticed that in the case of highly flexible plants a noticeable increase in strong ejection events without a simultaneous increase in sweep events has an unknown origin in ecohydrology such phenomenon may have meaningful impact on the vegetative spread of patches sediment transport as well as nutrient dynamics clarke 2002 this is due to the fact that the organised water motions in upward direction can carry solids and air bubbles farther away downstream a plant patch additionally in this paper we did not look into the transversal velocity fluctuations which could signal a presence of vortices with vertical axis originating from the shear at the sides of vegetation patches such turbulence was once detected downstream a wide patch of m spicatum in the same river przyborowski et al 2019a and likely such phenomena also influence the distribution of streamwise velocity fluctuations considering the above remarks and that the investigated patches did not grow as a uniform canopy the following conclusion forms downstream of these patches signs matching the presence of hairpin vortices exist with the latter visible up to 0 6 m downstream of the stiffer patch fig 18 5 conclusions following the theoretical and experimental investigations of researchers cited in this paper and applying their observations to the described results two kinds of flow disturbances visible in a vertical plane can be distinguished downstream of both investigated submerged patches of flexible vegetation fig 18 1 a strong sweeping motion of the eddies forming in the wake of a patch pushing whirls into the low velocity region directly behind a plant 2 a disturbance observed above the patch height in the mixing layer where ejections carry vortices downstream towards the free surface but only up to a distance of 0 6 m i e approximately four times the height of the patch the above mentioned phenomena fit best to the model showing generation of sweep and ejection movements through existence of hairpin vortices forming above canopy downstream of inflection point finnigan et al 2009 our results imply that downstream of patches that cover half of the water depth the plant induced sweeps and ejections do not propagate further downstream than the patch length when aggregated into sequences it was evident that both kinds of organised motion were characterised by a 2 to 3 times longer duration and had a higher frequency than outward and inward interactions additionally the measured instantaneous stress values were more comparable meaning that on average the observed extreme sweep ejection motions were not much more violent than outward inward interactions but they produced more stress over time in a region closer to the patches but above their height extreme ejection events contributed much more to the overall stress than sweeps however there were differences in the obtained results between both patches as the dimensions of these patches were similar a combination of plant morphological and biomechanical traits was responsible for generation of shear and the extent of mixing layer downstream in particular the mean absolute strength of extreme ejections was higher in the case of the stiffer plant m spicatum and those events were visible in a longer and wider area downstream the sequences of both types of extreme even events were also more time persistent than those in the case of the flow region behind p crispus in conclusion the presented results mostly agree with the knowledge obtained in experiments with different conditions the extreme events had comparable percentages of detection in both cases while it was shown that downstream of m spicatum the strongest events remained present in consecutive profiles farther from the patch than those downstream of p crispus where sweep and ejection sequences were weaker the observable distribution of sweeps and ejections match models showing formation of hairpin vortices above vegetation canopies that knowledge is then desirable to understand processes like downstream accumulation of sediment nutrients and gas fluxes or even plants reproduction techniques from this perspective the phenomena of strong ejections observed downstream in both patches their possible connection to plant motions and the meaning of such events in river ecohydrology remain questions that need to be answered by further interdisciplinary research preferably experiments with rigid stems or rigid artificial plants of the same spatial characteristics performed in similar hydraulic conditions should show to what extent the plant flexibility is affecting the generation of coherent

4704,in this study a novel technique for grouping locations into spatially coherent homogeneous regions was presented along with its application in assessment of the impacts of potential climate change on regionalization of hydroclimatic variables the regionalization technique based on markov random field mrf model consisted of binary state variables representing low high values and monthly patterns of hydroclimatic variable across space and time changes in regionalization and regional hydroclimatic patterns over india in future under projected climate change were then investigated the hydroclimatic variables used were monthly precipitation monsoon precipitation and temperature and future climate data output corresponding to rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios were taken from a regional climate model rcm with the cnrm cm5 0 model of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 project as the parent general circulation model gcm the regions obtained for baseline 1971 2003 and future 2042 2068 periods under both scenarios were then compared using the mrf model spatially coherent and homogeneous regions were obtained and their ranking based on regional mean of the hydroclimatic variable was performed transitions of locations between the baseline and future regions were tracked using the jaccard coefficient our findings suggest that the number of homogeneous regions and the distribution of locations among different regions are projected to change in future scenarios wettest regions identified during baseline period are projected to remain wetter in future whereas regions in the moderate to heavy rainfall ranks have shown remarkable shift to increasingly wetter regions there is increase in regional monthly precipitation magnitudes and increases in regional average temperature are observed under all the scenarios in future highest under rcp 8 5 when compared to the baseline period despite the uncertainty and limitations involved in the scope of the current study the modifications in hydroclimatic patterns seen under changing climate emphasize the need for considering impacts of climate change in water resources management and regional policy and decision making keywords regionalization climate change markov random field hydroclimatic variables gibbs sampling 1 introduction hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation and temperature over a large region are influenced by the geographic spatial heterogeneity present as well as natural climatic variability anthropogenic climate change and land use land cover changes over time consequently significant spatio temporal patterns are known to exist in the occurrence and characteristics of extreme events such as droughts floods wild fires and cyclones hänsel et al 2016 barbero et al 2017 kwon et al 2019 bisht et al 2019 specifically in the context of management of water resources and climate water food energy nexus policies at regional scales analysis of potential changes in precipitation and temperature patterns is of great importance the implications of these changes on the socio economic development of the region are also well documented in literature bauman et al 2013 musolino et al 2017 in view of this it becomes necessary to identify hydroclimatologically homogeneous clusters of locations or regions that need not be geographically contiguous so that assessment of changes in the spatio temporal patterns in hydroclimatic variables could be carried out at a regional scale regionalization is the tool to identify and group locations in a larger region having similar characteristics for instance pertaining to a hydroclimatic variable of interest by extracting homogeneous clusters or regions i concise analysis of the spatial patterns are possible and ii information of hydroclimatic patterns at ungauged locations can be synthesized when the regionalization is carried out over different time periods and compared changes in regional hydroclimatic characteristics could be studied in the context of natural or anthropogenic drivers of change regionalization techniques are commonly adopted for regional scale hydrologic applications such as flow prediction in ungauged catchments prieto et al 2019 beck et al 2016 arsenault brissette 2014 campbell bates 2001 identification of homogeneous regions and hydrologic frequency analysis hosking wallis 1993 satyanarayana srinivas 2008 bharath srinivas 2015a bharath and srinivas 2015b among different regionalization techniques hybrid cluster analysis rao and srinivas 2006ba fuzzy cluster analysis rao and srinivas 2006a kernel based fuzzy clustering approach basu srinivas 2014 and k mean clustering nasseri zahraie 2011 have been widely used for regionalization in hydrological studies bharath srinivas 2015a delineated homogeneous regions based on 1 2 3 4 and 5 day durations annual maximum rainfall and spatial factors latitude longitude and altitude utilizing global fuzzy c means gfcm cluster analysis prior to regional rainfall frequency analysis they had validated their results by conducting tests for regional homogeneity popular regionalization studies are also outlined in their study highlighting the merits and demerits of the different approaches in a recent study raja aydin 2019 performed regionalization of mauritius region using hierarchical clustering approach to study the regional scale precipitation patterns six regions were identified when they performed clustering using the principal components extracted from factors such as precipitation elevation distance to coast aspect and slope studies have also performed regionalization at different temporal scales such as daily monthly and annual scale with variables such as temperature precipitation wind and runoff johnson green 2018 chang et al 2018 khastagir et al 2018 however majority of the regionalization studies focus on spatial clustering by incorporating spatial coordinates as attributes so that geographically contiguous clusters are obtained regionalization using spatial attributes have been found to compromise on hydrological homogeneity of the resulting clusters rao srinivas 2008 guntu et al 2020 and could be a source of uncertainty further some of these methods performed regionalization without accounting for temporal variability of the hydrological variable or the non stationarity that existed in the dataset while the dependence of both the localized spatial and temporal properties on large scale pattern holds great importance in regionalization of hydroclimatic variables a spatiotemporal clustering approach is therefore utilized to group locations with similar spatial as well as temporal attributes in contrast to spatial clustering it considers time element as a dimension shi pun cheng 2019 the spatial attributes can be two dimensional latitude longitude or three dimensional latitude longitude and altitude most of the regionalization studies based on hydrological variables considered two dimensional model with latitude and longitude data however when time is involved it has be to modelled as a third dimension in addition to two dimensional space latitude longitude time and attributes there is consideration for both time and space to define a cluster instead of relying only on its distribution pattern similarly heuristic data mining methods used for clustering do not work based on the principle of probabilistic inference clancey 1985 one advantage of using inferential probability based models is that they provide the probability associated with each cluster and it can abstain if the probability of choosing any particular cluster is too low cowpertwait 2011 performed regionalization of daily precipitation of study region in spain using a cluster probability model specifically a mixed multivariate gaussian model their model used statistical parameters such as mean coefficient of variation and autocorrelation of daily rainfall data to generate optimal clusters which were further revised using theissen polygon data to obtain spatially coherent regions however a probabilistic regionalization framework for hydroclimatic variables that involve spatiotemporal clustering of the time series data and the state of the variable at a defined spatial and temporal point without any constraints on the spatial parameters is not available till date the assumption of stationarity has also been discussed by many studies and changes in precipitation and temperature patterns are quite challenging to predict mainly due to the uncertainty associated with choice of future projections given numerous simulation models and change trajectories the importance of non stationarity analysis has been acknowledged in hydrologic studies in the context of anthropogenic climate change milly et al 2008 sun et al 2015 cardoso pereira et al 2020 regionalization studies using the historical hydroclimatic data may not indicate a pronounced influence of global warming raja and aydin 2019 łupikasza 2016 however since climate is changing ipcc 2014 changes in the regional hydroclimate patterns are likely and need to be investigated yang et al 2019 parracho et al 2016 performed k mean cluster analysis on precipitation at annual and seasonal scales for the iberian peninsula region they assumed the regionalization to be stationary in future scenario and projected that these regions will experience less rainfall in future relatively few studies have perfomed regionalization in the non stationary sense that is the model parameters were allowed to vary over space or time and limted to regional flood frequency analysis problems sun et al 2015 there is a need to evaluate regionalization of hydroclimatic variables under future climate and assess the possible transitions of patterns at regional scale which is the motivation for our study despite the research gaps regional scale impact assessment and risk analysis that aid in planning adaptation and mitigation strategies need to be performed and incorporated in decision making the objective of the present study was to provide a novel framework to perform regionalization of hydroclimatic variables that would facilitate an investigation of the effects of climate change on their regional patterns which is transferable to ungauged locations as well this study performed over the indian region as a test bed adopted the markov random field mrf technique as a probabilistic model to identify homogenous regions for three hydroclimatic variables monthly precipitation monsoon indian summer monsoon rainfall during months of june to september precipitation and monthly temperature the model first creates a discrete binary representation of the hydroclimatic field by introducing latent random variables whose values are estimated by probabilistic inference then this discrete representation was used for identifying spatially contiguous regions which are homogeneous with respect to temporal behaviour of the hydroclimatic variable under consideration regionalization was then performed on the future climate simulations of the variables obtained from climate model simulations over the study region to assess the impacts of climate change on regional hydroclimatic patterns both the number of regions and the distribution of grid locations in the different regions have changed in projected future the modified spatial rainfall patterns under changing climate assessed using the proposed framework could be used for understanding the changes in the water availability in a large study region where spatial heterogeneity of rainfall is significant both spatially and temporally the findings of the study regarding the potential changes and transitions emphasize the need to address the impacts of climate change in regional scale water resources management policies as well as planning in the context of climate water food energy nexus the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides details of the study area and data used and section 3 describes the proposed framework that utilized the mrf based regionalization model for an assessment of impacts of projected climate change on regionalization results from the study performed are discussed in detail in section 4 and conclusions of the study are presented in section 5 2 study area and data the region adopted for the proposed study india lies to the northern part of the equator in between 8 04 n and 37 06 n latitudes and 68 07 e and 97 25 e longitudes the administrative map of india with information on states and union territories is accessible from the website of the press information bureau pib government of india http 164 100 117 97 writereaddata userfiles india 20 20political1 pdf with a long coastal belt proximity to the tropics and bordering mountains ranges of the himalayas in the northern part the country is highly diverse with respect to geography topography and climate major climatic divisions of india are tropical wet subtropical humid arid and mountain regions according to the indian meteorological department imd india has four climatological seasons midya saha 2011 winter december february pre monsoon march may monsoon june september post monsoon october november the diverse climatic conditions result in highly variable precipitation and temperature patterns at both spatial and temporal scales across the country resulting in different hydroclimatic homogeneous regions therefore this region is an excellent candidate for testing the proposed mrf based regionalization approach for instance a study by satyanarayana srinivas 2008 had used the frequency distribution of indian summer monsoon rainfall to perform regionalization over india and obtained seventeen homogeneous regions similarly dash mamgain 2011 suggested seven homogeneous regions in india based on temperature but did not consider the spatial homogeneity of the regions an increase in spatial heterogeneity of rainfall extremes was reported by ghosh et al 2016 over india during the 1951 2003 period which was likely due to local topography land use land cover change and growth of urban sprawl in contrast the mean monsoon rainfall showed a decreasing trend in this period in the current study gridded daily rainfall at 0 25 spatial resolution and gridded daily temperature at 0 5 spatial resolution data obtained from imd were used as the observed rainfall and temperature datasets respectively the gridded imd daily rainfall data was prepared by pai et al 2014 using the observed rainfall measurements at 6955 rain gauge stations in india with varying availability period from 1901 to 2010 they used the inverse distance weighted interpolation idw scheme proposed by shepard 1968 to obtain the 0 25 spatial resolution data srivastava et al 2009 developed gridded temperature dataset using temperature data of 395 stations distributed all over india for the period 1969 2005 their study employed an angular distance weighting algorithm to develop the gridded temperature dataset the choice of climate model to perform climate change assessment in a region is important and the uncertainty associated with the rcm and its parent gcm the downscaling approach and bias correction can affect quality of climatic projection for that region studies by sperber et al 2013 sengupta rajeevan 2013 and gupta jain 2018 have worked with rcms for simulating the indian summer monsoon rainfall in future and examined the performance of the cmip5 rcms to study the impacts of projected future climate change on regionalization of hydroclimatic variables precipitation and temperature simulations from one of the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex south asia rcms were adopted in this study the cnrm cm 5 0 as driving gcm in cordex rcm suite available at 0 5 resolution was chosen in this study to analyse the historical baseline and future precipitation and temperature patterns two projected emission scenarios for future climate representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 were selected for this study while the rcp 4 5 pathway suggests a peaked greenhouse gas emission scenario corresponding to a radiative forcing of 4 5 w m2 around the 2050 s followed by no further increase the pathway of rcp 8 5 represents a consistently increasing emissions scenario that reaches the peak value of 8 5 w m2 by the year 2100 the rcm data for both temperature and precipitation were obtained from the centre for climate change research cccr indian institute of tropical meteorology http cccr tropmet res in cordex the baseline period was taken as 1971 2003 in this study while the future period chosen was 2042 2068 the model dataset was further regridded to match the coordinates of the observed dataset using simple bilinear interpolation 3 methodology 3 1 bias correction of climate model data in this study regionalization was performed using monthly precipitation monsoon precipitation indian summer monsoon during months of june to september and temperature variables for determining the changes in regionalization in future under projected climate change firstly the baseline rcm datasets of these variables were improved to match with historical observed datasets using the bias correction technique and then the future climate projections were corrected in a similar manner in this study we adopted a monthly bias correction technique ojha et al 2013 to rectify the rcm datasets for future regionalization the monthly time series of the hydroclimatic variable y i k of the selected rcm was standardized using eq 1 to remove the temporal statistic of rcm model dataset for each month i in year k 1 y i k y i k m model i s model i where m model i is the monthly mean and s model i is the standard deviation of the model data for the month i in the next step the observed monthly mean m observed i and the standard deviation s observed i obtained from the gridded imd dataset were imposed to the standardized dataset y i k to create a bias corrected dataset x i k at monthly level it is shown in eq 2 2 x i k y i k s observed i m observed i for correcting the temperature and precipitation dataset in the future scenario the monthly mean and standard deviation of the baseline period itself were used without any change 3 2 regionalization using markov random field mrf model 3 2 1 markov random field mrf model graphical model of joint and conditional probability distributions facilitate representation of statistical dependencies connecting edges among random variables nodes the regionalization approach adopted in the study utilized mrf li 1994 cross jain 1983 kindermann snell 1980 a graphical model that involves sets of random variables some of which may be observed and others which are latent or directly not measurable consider x an s d observation matrix such that each s d stores the observed value of hydroclimatic variable at location s for a month d the locations of the study area are ordered sequentially first according to longitude and then according to latitude observations in x are modeled as random variables using location specific mixture distributions at each location we fit a 2 mode mixture distribution to the data while one mode corresponds to higher values of the observations the other mode corresponds to lower values in this study gamma distribution was chosen to fit observations of precipitation and gaussian distribution was fit to temperature observations parameters of these distributions were estimated using the expectation maximization em algorithm this process helped us to binarize the data that is corresponding to each observation x s d we get a binary variable z s d indicating which of the two mixture modes fits x s d better the values of these latent variables are not known apriori but may be estimated by probabilistic inference for this purpose we define probability distributions linking these variables with each other and also with the observations x s d this is achieved by constructing a probabilistic graphical model which is basically a graph where each node is associated with one of these variables edges are added between pairs of nodes to encode their relationships as desired three sets of latent variables are present in this graphical model i discrete state z at each s d which indicates which of the two distributions fit the corresponding x s d ii a temporal clustering variable u for each time step month and iii a spatial clustering variable v for each grid point u and v takes integer values denoting the spatial pattern present in a month and the temporal pattern present at a location respectively the latent variables z u v as defined above are assumed to be spatiotemporally coherent in our model that is adjacent locations have the same values of z this resulted in a spatiotemporal graphical model as shown in fig 1 with z and x variable as nodes such that z s d is linked to the corresponding x s d using a data edge for two adjacent locations s and s z s d and z s d are connected using spatial edges for all values of d edges connecting z s d and z s d 1 are the temporal edges further edge potential functions are defined on each of these edges these edge potential functions are decided such that the spatiotemporal coherence of z is maximized and z fit the observations in x well through mixture distributions for details of these functions the readers are referred to mitra et al 2018 in this mrf model the joint probability distribution of all the variables is the product of all the edge potential functions the inference problem is to find the optimal values of all the z variables such that this joint probability is maximized and is achieved through gibbs sampling method casella george 1992 in this study first of all the latent variables are initialized according to simple thresholds after that each individual latent variable z s d u d and v s for different locations s and time points d are sampled one by one from their conditional distributions which can be derived easily from the distributions as defined in appendix a while sampling one variable all others are held constant in each iteration all variables are sampled once each and their values updated accordingly after an initial burn in period of 50 iterations by which the joint likelihood is found to converge values of these variables are recorded at regular intervals after a large enough number of iterations these records give us an approximation of the posterior distributions of the latent variables from which we can choose their modes as the maximum a posteriori map estimate the process is described in greater details in sections 3 2 3 and 3 2 4 these estimated values help us to identify the spatial clusters or regions discrete variables u u 1 u 2 u d and v v 1 v 2 v s defined in this model indicate a clustering of the time steps and clustering of the spatial locations respectively note that for the z variables each location has a d dimensional time series of z variables and each time step or month is represented with an s dimensional vector when the goal is clustering of the spatial locations or regionalization the focus is on v for any location s v s denotes its cluster index also the number of clusters k to be formed in the proposed regionalization are not fixed apriori and is inferred by the model from the data for a cluster k there is a canonical d dimensional binary time series and when v s k for any location the time series of z at location s is a noisy version of the k th canonical time series a user tuneable parameter called μ is defined therein based on the average amount of noise that is the number of time points where the z does not match with the canonical time series for a small value of μ it results in pure clusters with less noise as a result clusters formed are small in size and more in number and vice versa for large values of μ regional scale analyses and decision making for ungauged locations in a large region could be performed with greater ease when spatial clusters are also geographically contiguous therefore a prior distribution is assumed for the v variables based on chinese restaurant process pitman 1995 such that each location s joins the same cluster as at least one of its geographically adjacent locations and is more likely to join bigger clusters these additional constraints mean that a small number of homogeneous regions are formed which have reasonable size and are spatially contiguous will be formed in this clustering then to obtain the optimal values of v a joint distribution of x z v variables is defined using the gibbs sampling method the steps involved in the mrf based regionalization procedure is presented as a flowchart in fig 2 in this study μ was chosen as 2 and increment for the parameter was chosen to be 1 upto 20 the optimal value of μ was chosen based on the correlation coefficient and number of cluster corresponding to each μ the details of this mathematical framework and the parameter setup are provided in appendix a and appendix b respectively further details of the mrf formulation are available in mitra et al 2018 3 2 2 chinese restaurant process crp pitman 1995 developed the chinese restaurant process crp probability mass function pmf for clustering of sequential discrete random variables the prior distribution of the temporal clustering of the months by variables u u 1 u 2 u d is modeled as crp according to the following rule i the first month always chooses the first cluster that is p u 1 1 1 and ii the d th month chooses a cluster with probability proportional to the number of months already assigned to that cluster or form a new cluster with probability proportional to α 1 which is a scalar parameter of the process the prior distribution of u is given by eq 3 3 p u d u u 1 u d 1 n d u m d u i f u u 1 u d 1 α 1 f o r u max u 1 u d 1 1 for spatial clustering in the proposed model the prior distribution of the latent variables v v 1 v 2 v s is also modelled as crp in the process first grid point is assigned to the first cluster p v 1 1 1 the s th grid point is assigned to a cluster depending on the probability proportional to the number of grid points assigned to that cluster so far or a new cluster is formed with probability proportional to β 1 which is a tuning parameter of the process defined by the user the prior distribution of v is given by eq 4 4 p v s v v 1 v s 1 n s v i f v v 1 v s 1 β 1 f o r v max v 1 v s 1 1 3 2 3 gibbs sampling the gibbs sampling method neal 1993 is a common markov chain monte carlo mcmc technique for estimating a complicated joint or conditional distribution by collecting samples gibbs samplers are employed when probabilistic models can be formulated in such a way that the expressions for conditional probabilistic distributions for each model variable can be calculated and sampled efficiently unlike the metropolis hastings algorithm chib greenberg 1995 samples from the conditional distributions are collected at regular intervals after an initial burn in period to ensure that there is accuracy but no wasted computation mathematically the general approach of the gibbs sampler is to estimate a multivariate joint distribution for n random variables given by y y 1 y 2 y n by drawing samples of each random variable turn by turn keeping the others constant from marginal conditional distributions such as in eq 5 5 p y i y 1 y 2 y i 1 y i 1 y n p y i y i as discussed above n conditional distributions are required for n dimensional vectors to use the method to initiate gibbs sampling we generated an initial state y 0 y 1 0 y 2 0 y n 0 samples were drawn for each variable sequentially while keeping the other dimensions fixed once enough samples have been drawn the mode may be computed 3 2 4 inference from the proposed model the iterative procedure for gibbs sampling for the model described in previous section can be summarized as follows i the samples of p z s d z z u v x were collected iteratively by gibbs sampler using eq a 1 in appendix a each term of eq a 1 was computed using eq a2 a4 the procedure was conducted for each variable z s d where s 1 2 s d 1 2 d ii the sampling of variables u d and v s was done based on the crp prior eq 3 and 4 and the potential functions defined by eq a 3 the scaling parameter remains the same iii the parameters of gamma distribution precipitation and gaussian distribution temperature were recalculated at each iteration of the main loop corresponding to u d and v s using eq a 4 p z s d was recomputed and about 500 iterations were performed for the clustering iv the mode of the spatial variable v assigned to a grid point was chosen as the final cluster number for that grid point 3 3 regional homogeneity tests the results of regionalization were tested using the conventional l moments based method popularly adopted in hydrologic studies the homogeneity test statistics using the sampling properties of l moment ratios indicate the degree of heterogeneity of the regions clusters the three heterogeneity measures i h1 based on l coefficient of variation l cv ii h2 based on l cv and l skewness and iii h3 based on l skewness and l kurtosis were computed in this study for more details on these the readers are encouraged to refer hosking wallis 1993 the criteria to quantify the homogeneity of a cluster as per this method are provided in table 1 hosking wallis 1997 found h1 to be superior and the most suitable heterogeneity measure compared to h2 and h3 as the two statistics rarely give values larger than 2 even for highly heterogeneous regions therefore h1 was adopted in the present study as a heterogeneity measure the expression for h1 is given in eq 6 6 h 1 v μ v σ v where μ v and σ v represent the mean and standard deviation respectively of the n sim numbers of v v is the weighted standard deviation of the at site sample l cvs and is computed using eq 7 7 v i 1 n n i t i t r 2 i 1 n n i 1 2 where n i is the length of the dataset at grid point i whose sample l cv is denoted as t i t r is the regional average of the sample l cv in the study the number of realizations n sim was taken as 500 hosking wallis 1997 also suggested a critical value d i that indicates the degree of discordancy of a grid point with other grid points in a region this was also computed using eq 8 to test the regional homogeneity 8 d i 1 3 n r u i u t s u i u where u i t i t 3 i t 4 i t is the vector comprising l cv t i l skewness t 3 i and l kurtosis t 4 i for grid point i in the region s is a covariance matrix computed using eq 9 and u is the unweighted regional average of the l moment ratios computed using eq 10 9 s i 1 n r u i u u i u t 10 u i 1 n r u i n r 3 4 climate change and regionalization regionalization of hydroclimatic variables in the current and future climate under potential climate change were compared by assessing the similarity in homogeneous regions obtained in these two time periods in this regard the jaccard similarity coefficient s j given in eq 11 was used as a measure of similarity between two regions mcmanamay et al 2014 it compares grid points for two regions for evaluating their similarities and dissimilarities and the value ranges from 0 to 100 the higher the percentage the more similar the two regions 11 s j a a b c where a is the number of common grid points between two regions and b is the number of grid points in region 1 that is not shared by region 2 and c is the number of grid points in region 2 that is not shared by region 1 furthermore the hydroclimatic characteristics of homogeneous regions under the current and future scenarios were investigated in detail to assess the possible changes in regional patterns under potential climate change in future the framework developed in the study can thus address the changes in regionalization differences in characteristics of the homogeneous regions and determine how the possible transitions of grid locations between the two scenarios are associated with changing hydroclimatic patterns 4 results and discussion 4 1 bias correction of rcm datasets the simulations for temperature and precipitation at 0 5 resolution extracted from cnrm cm 5 0 as driving gcm cordex rcm were bias corrected using mbc method to obtain regions for current and future climate to carry out climate change impact assessment studies as the analysis was carried out at a monthly scale firstly the daily data were aggregated to a monthly scale before mbc was applied the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was computed at all the grid locations in the study region to assess the performance of bias correction are shown in the plots in fig 3 prior to bias correction the raw rcm simulations show poor performance as a proxy for observed precipitation and temperature data fig 3a 3c emphasizing the need for bias correction using the observed baseline datasets nse values in the range 0 8 to 0 9 were obtained after employing mbc technique for temperature fig 3d and precipitation fig 3b at most of the grid locations thus there is significant enhancement in datasets after the application of mbc the grid points present in the extreme north of india has not been considered for regionalization due to scarcity of observed stations for precipitation and temperature which may affect the quality of gridded data 4 2 mrf based regionalization model regionalization based on the monthly precipitation monsoon precipitation and temperature variables were performed to obtain regions of similar hydroclimatic characteristics in the mrf based clustering technique for regionalization adopted in this study the number of clusters was not predefined and estimated by the model depending on the user specified parameter μ in eq a 4 given in appendix a smaller the μ higher is the number of clusters and vice versa the spatial clusters were considered as regions in this approach to determine the optimal number of regions the mean correlation coefficient of regionalization that is the average value of the correlation between locations belonging to the homogeneous regions obtained corresponding to different cluster numbers were compared the results are plotted in fig 4 plots in fig 4 suggest that an increase in the number of clusters can improve the correlation coefficient upto a particular optimal value after which it does not significantly change it is also evident that the optimal number of clusters is not stationary with time for a variable it has different values for baseline and future climate scenarios the optimal μ parameters for monthly precipitation monsoon precipitation and temperature could be fixed considering both the correlation coefficient and the total number of clusters however regional homogeneity tests were further performed to fix the μ parameter in this study the heterogeneity h 1 of regions was tested using l moments method fig 5 shows the number of regions the maximum number of grid points present in a region and the mean of heterogeneity values corresponding to each value of μ fig 5 shows the results for monthly precipitation plots a b c monsoon precipitation plots d e f and temperature plots g h i that justify the choice of optimal parameters it is observed that the heterogeneity measure and the maximum number of grid points present in a region increase as the μ parameter increases with a corresponding decrease in the number of regions formed therefore choice of μ was based on optimizing the number of regions obtained such that their h 1 values are in acceptable range lower values of μ were avoided to limit the number of regions obtained for instance regionalization using μ 10 was chosen for monthly precipitation data in which 3 to 4 regions are found to be heterogeneous h 1 2 in all the scenarios containing large number of grid points further regionalization was then performed on these regions using the mrf model to obtain smaller homogeneous regions and were then verified using the discordancy test described previously in case of monsoon precipitation corresponding to μ parameter value of 10 the majority of the regions are found to be heterogeneous but when μ was chosen as 3 majority of the regions are found to be homogeneous total number regions are also found to be reasonable corresponding to the chosen μ in all the scenarios fig 5 d e f in this case only a discordancy test was performed to remove the discordant sites from the obtained regions similarly regions having very few grid points were either deleted or merged with other regions to improve the regionalization scheme in the case of temperature fig 5 g h i corresponding to μ parameter value of 3 the majority of the regions are found to be homogeneous with number of regions in acceptable range therefore site adjustment was done to bring the h 1 statistics within acceptable range that is 2 the final statistics of heterogeneity test corresponding to each region obtained from the mrf model based technique are shown in fig 6 the plots in fig 6 show each region s heterogeneity and the number of grid points obtained using monthly precipitation plots a b c monsoon precipitation plots d e f and temperature plots g h i the h 1 statistic is found to be 2 in all the scenarios that is the regions are either acceptably homogeneous h 1 1 or possibly homogeneous 1 h 1 2 the homogeneous regions in the baseline period and future period were analysed to understand the effects of potential climate change on regionalization 4 3 results of regionalization 4 3 1 regionalization in baseline and future periods the mrf based regionalization results for monthly precipitation variable are shown in fig 7 with the help of different coloured locations a few regions were found to have 10 grid points due to uneven temporal and spatial characteristics such regions were identified and then removed as they are unlikely to be physically meaningful the baseline period fig 7a rcp 4 5 future fig 7b and rcp 8 5 future fig 7c scenarios are found to have 38 34 and 30 homogeneous regions respectively as a result of regionalization the regions were ranked and labelled in ascending order of the mean monthly precipitation such that region 1 represents the lowest mean precipitation and the highest ranked region possesses the largest mean monthly precipitation among all the regions identified in the study region the regions in the north east india and along the west coast are found to receive higher rainfall in the baseline period when compared to other regions of india as the bay of bengal and arabian sea branches of monsoon arrive first in these areas the patterns obtained are similar in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future the north east part of india is found to have a different pattern compared to the rest of the country similarly parts of rajasthan and gujarat in the west are assigned to separate clusters as the factors such as presence of desert and proximity to sea affect their rainfall characteristics the regionalization results based on monsoon precipitation are shown in fig 8 when compared to monthly precipitation regionalization based on monsoon precipitation using the proposed method resulted in more number of clusters regions indicating larger spatial variability in monsoon rainfall in india once again the regions with very fewer grid points were removed using the same process as in the previous case and in total 39 36 and 35 clusters were obtained in the baseline period fig 8a rcp 4 5 future fig 8b and rcp 8 5 future fig 8c respectively the regions were then ranked and labelled in the ascending order of the mean monsoon precipitation as done in the case of monthly precipitation the north east and west coast of india are assigned to clusters having highest mean value as the bay of bengal and arabian sea branches of monsoon first touch down at these places during the rainy season however the regions in the east coast and north west part of india are found to experience less rainfall as the monsoon loses most of its moisture during its path numerous small clusters are also observed in the north eastern and western parts of india the regions identified as having similar temperature patterns are shown in fig 9 and it is found that the regional patterns in the temperature variable are not as erratic as compared to precipitation the regionalization using mrf technique resulted in 23 22 and 22 regions in the baseline period fig 9a rcp 4 5 future fig 9b and rcp 8 5 future fig 9c respectively the north central and interior peninsula regions of india that were delineated as two distinct regions in the study by dash and mamgain 2011 are found as nine distinct regions in the present study though the mean temperatures of each of these nine clusters were similar the standard deviations varied from cluster to cluster the north east part of india formed two clusters in all the scenarios the north and central part of india had 14 clusters in the baseline period it changed to 4 and 7 clusters in future under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively 4 3 2 changes in precipitation regionalization due to climate change owing to potential climate change the hydroclimatic patterns at a regional scale undergo a significant change in future which can manifest in the regionalization the metric jaccard coefficient s j rice belland 1982 was employed in this study to compute the degree of similarity between the old and newly formed regions and the influence of climate change can be explained based on the characteristics of newly formed regions the transitions of the grid points to new regions were analyzed while comparing the precipitation regionalization between the baseline and future time periods by tracking and measuring the transition of associated grid points from old regions to new regions the effect of climate change on regionalization could be understood fig 10 explains the degree of similarity among regions delineated for monthly precipitation under the assumption of a changing future climate the cluster numbers of baseline period future period in the abscissa ordinate are ranked in ascending order of the mean monthly precipitation the higher cluster numbers represent the regions of heavy rainfall and vice versa the coordinate of a point in the graph provides the old region x and new region y the colour of that point gives the jaccard s coefficient s j that is the degree of similarity between the old region x and new region y fig 10 suggests a general pattern the regions 1 2 3 4 and 5 that were associated with less rainfall lower rank since the clusters are labelled in ascending order of rainfall are projected to remain as the regions 1 having low rainfall however a few numbers of grid points originally belonging to drier regions ranked 10 in rcp 4 5 and ranked 7 8 9 and 10 in rcp 8 5 are found to shift to the regions associated with heavy rainfall the grid points in the regions receiving moderate rainfall ranked 10 to 18 in the baseline period are reclassified to higher ranked regions ranked 23 28 in rcp 4 5 and 8 5 with heavier rainfall in the future period the regions that received heavy rainfall in historical period are projected to remain so during the future period in both the scenarios the transition of many grid locations from moderate rainfall regions to heavy rainfall regions has led to an overall decrease in the number of regions in the future scenarios a few grid points in clusters 32 38 heavy rainfall regions in the baseline period are assigned to clusters 12 9 and 7 low rainfall regions in rcp 8 5 future these regions constitute parts of states of maharashtra and karnataka cluster 39 the wettest region in the baseline period remained as a heavy rainfall region in rcp 4 5 future a similar analysis was conducted for the transition of regions based on monsoon precipitation regionalization as shown in fig 11 the jacard coefficient values for the transitions from baseline period to rcp 4 5 future fig 11a and from baseline period to rcp 8 5 future fig 11b suggest similar trends that the heavy low rainfall regions are projected to remain heavy low rainfall regions during the future period in both the scenarios minor transitions are seen such as redistribution of few grid points in clusters 4 to 8 to moderate rainfall clusters 15 16 18 and 19 in both future scenarios and to a heavy rainfall cluster 33 in rcp 8 5 future whereas few grid points in clusters 39 38 and 37 heavy rainfall clusters are assigned to clusters 7 9 and 13 in rcp 4 5 future and clusters 15 17 and 19 in rcp 8 5 future which are lower rainfall regions 4 3 3 changes in regional hydroclimatic characteristics fig 12 explains the temporal variability of the regional average values of the hydroclimatic variables considered in this study between baseline and future periods under potential climate change the cluster numbers denote the rank of a region in the ascending order of the variable mean fig 12 a suggests that for monthly precipitation variable there is minimum change in its regional average between the baseline period and rcp 4 5 future whereas all the regions are projected to have more severe rainfall in rcp 8 5 future scenario fig 12 b indicated the occurrence of similar patterns in the regions having low monsoon precipitation moderate to heavy monsoon precipitation regions beyond cluster number 11 of baseline period have increased magnitude of mean rainfall in rcp 4 5 future whereas only a slight increase is seen in this characteristic between baseline period and rcp 8 5 future the results suggest that the wet season may become wetter and the dry season may become drier in future under rcp 8 5 scenario increase in regional average temperature is observed under all the scenarios in future highest under rcp 8 5 when compared to the baseline period values in both the extremely warm and cold locations of india the proposed framework further investigated the possible modifications in spatiotemporal hydroclimatic patterns under changing climate at a regional scale taking the state of odisha in east india as an example grid locations in odisha were in clusters 16 25 28 29 and 30 with regional average precipitation of 68 26 90 02 105 64 108 38 and 127 50 mm respectively fig 12a in the baseline period in rcp 4 5 future clusters projected are 13 24 26 and 29 respectively fig 10a with regional averages of 66 71 100 62 107 90 and 125 19 mm respectively whereas in rcp 8 5 scenario clusters 18 19 and 24 fig 10b are projected in odisha with regional averages 99 86 100 02 and 121 92 mm respectively the transition in rcp 4 5 scenario represents a small change while there is an increase projected in precipitation magnitude in rcp 8 5 scenario in odisha the nature of the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 future trajectories are evident in these transition patterns similarly the regionalization based on monsoon precipitation data indicated that odisha has clusters 24 27 and 30 with regional averages 241 31 253 63 and 286 63 mm respectively in the baseline period in rcp 4 5 future clusters 14 18 24 27 and 28 fig 11a with regional averages 184 56 231 87 262 52 276 43 and 278 49 mm are projected in rcp 8 5 future clusters 15 18 22 and 24 fig 11b are projected with regional averages of monsoon precipitation 192 33 231 87 256 33 and 262 52 mm respectively the future monsoon precipitation regionalization presents different transition patterns for baseline regions of moderate and high rainfall the regionalization based on monthly temperature data indicated clusters 9 12 16 17 21 and 22 in odisha with regional averages 25 91 26 71 26 93 26 95 27 57 and 27 68 c respectively in rcp 4 5 future projected clusters are 10 11 12 and 16 with regional average temperatures 25 49 25 97 26 03 and 26 60 c respectively while clusters 13 14 15 and 17 with regional averages 26 16 26 25 26 41 and 26 85 c respectively are projected in rcp 8 5 future it is seen that temperature patterns in this region do not present any conclusive trend when compared to precipitation 5 conclusions a novel regionalization approach was presented in this paper for investigating the impacts of potential climate change on spatiotemporal patterns of hydroclimatic variables the aforementioned analysis was conducted on the tropical country india with diverse hydroclimatic features and distinct climate regions an mrf based probabilistic model was used in this study to identify homogeneous regions using the monthly precipitation monsoon precipitation and monthly temperature datasets for current and future periods which has not been previously done the homogeneous regions identified and ranked on the basis of regional averages were tracked between the baseline period and future rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the changes in hydroclimatic characteristics as well as regional patterns in the future scenario under potential climate change were evaluated the jaccard coefficient was used to track the transitions of the regions between baseline and future periods the results of the study showed that there are appreciable changes in regionalization as well as the characteristics of the homogenous regions due to projected climate change these transitions are not alike and of varying degree of magnitude and trend when compared for drier and wetter regions and for cooler and warmer regions the conclusions of the study are as follows i bias correction of rcm precipitation was more challenging when compared to temperature by using mbc technique bias present in rcm datasets was significantly reduced the technique performed better for the locations in the eastern part of india the nse was found to be in the range of 0 6 to 0 9 for most of the locations in india ii regionalization performed in this study did not include spatial attributes data yet the mrf based model was successful in providing hydroclimatically and geographically contiguous regions as output unlike previous studies the southern part of india is found to have more regions in precipitation based regionalization when compared to north india likely due to the presence of eastern ghats western ghats and peninsula also future outputs show less variability in patterns across space iii the results projected that changes in net annual seasonal rainfall are likely in future under either climate change scenario rcps 4 5 and 8 5 when regional monthly averages were compared an increase in precipitation is seen which is more in rcp 8 5 when compared to rcp 4 5 scenario changes in regional characteristics due to the transition of locations suggest possibility of increasing as well as decreasing trends additionally sub seasonal changes in the regional characteristics may take place in the future iv with respect to temperature regionalization the regions representing extreme warmer and cooler parts of the country are projected to have slightly increased average temperatures in the future the warmer regions identified in the southern part of india under rcp 4 5 scenario have increased average temperature under the rcp 8 5 scenario in the context of hydroclimatic regionalization it has to be noted that homogeneous regions obtained using different variables need not be identical however within the proposed scheme the spatio temporal patterns could be identified the framework adopted in the study using baseline and future hydroclimatic variables can be performed for any large spatial domain it is evident that the regional hydroclimatic homogeneity need not be geographically contiguous could vary with the chosen variables as well as their time scales and vary temporally in the future owing to climate variability previous studies singh et al 2017 have pointed out that simulations of rainfall over india from cordex rcms like the one used in the present study are not better when compared with their host cmip5 gcm outputs therefore it is understood that projections from improved regional models that have better skill in representing the rainfall characteristics of the study region be used in the proposed framework for future decision making and impacts mitigation similarly the use of multiple climate models scenarios and ensemble approaches is recommended to fully understand the likely changes in regional hydroclimatic patterns owing to climate change we would like to emphasize that the direct applicability of results of the reported study as well as other studies employing climate models for future decision making is limited by uncertainties such as model single intermodel multiple gcms rcms intramodel multiple runs of same gcms rcms uncertainty scenario uncertainty and downscaling and or bias correction model uncertainty kannan et al 2014 accounting of different sources of uncertainties is not however within the scope of the reported study but would be the future direction of work for comprehensive assessment of

4704,in this study a novel technique for grouping locations into spatially coherent homogeneous regions was presented along with its application in assessment of the impacts of potential climate change on regionalization of hydroclimatic variables the regionalization technique based on markov random field mrf model consisted of binary state variables representing low high values and monthly patterns of hydroclimatic variable across space and time changes in regionalization and regional hydroclimatic patterns over india in future under projected climate change were then investigated the hydroclimatic variables used were monthly precipitation monsoon precipitation and temperature and future climate data output corresponding to rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios were taken from a regional climate model rcm with the cnrm cm5 0 model of coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 project as the parent general circulation model gcm the regions obtained for baseline 1971 2003 and future 2042 2068 periods under both scenarios were then compared using the mrf model spatially coherent and homogeneous regions were obtained and their ranking based on regional mean of the hydroclimatic variable was performed transitions of locations between the baseline and future regions were tracked using the jaccard coefficient our findings suggest that the number of homogeneous regions and the distribution of locations among different regions are projected to change in future scenarios wettest regions identified during baseline period are projected to remain wetter in future whereas regions in the moderate to heavy rainfall ranks have shown remarkable shift to increasingly wetter regions there is increase in regional monthly precipitation magnitudes and increases in regional average temperature are observed under all the scenarios in future highest under rcp 8 5 when compared to the baseline period despite the uncertainty and limitations involved in the scope of the current study the modifications in hydroclimatic patterns seen under changing climate emphasize the need for considering impacts of climate change in water resources management and regional policy and decision making keywords regionalization climate change markov random field hydroclimatic variables gibbs sampling 1 introduction hydroclimatic variables such as precipitation and temperature over a large region are influenced by the geographic spatial heterogeneity present as well as natural climatic variability anthropogenic climate change and land use land cover changes over time consequently significant spatio temporal patterns are known to exist in the occurrence and characteristics of extreme events such as droughts floods wild fires and cyclones hänsel et al 2016 barbero et al 2017 kwon et al 2019 bisht et al 2019 specifically in the context of management of water resources and climate water food energy nexus policies at regional scales analysis of potential changes in precipitation and temperature patterns is of great importance the implications of these changes on the socio economic development of the region are also well documented in literature bauman et al 2013 musolino et al 2017 in view of this it becomes necessary to identify hydroclimatologically homogeneous clusters of locations or regions that need not be geographically contiguous so that assessment of changes in the spatio temporal patterns in hydroclimatic variables could be carried out at a regional scale regionalization is the tool to identify and group locations in a larger region having similar characteristics for instance pertaining to a hydroclimatic variable of interest by extracting homogeneous clusters or regions i concise analysis of the spatial patterns are possible and ii information of hydroclimatic patterns at ungauged locations can be synthesized when the regionalization is carried out over different time periods and compared changes in regional hydroclimatic characteristics could be studied in the context of natural or anthropogenic drivers of change regionalization techniques are commonly adopted for regional scale hydrologic applications such as flow prediction in ungauged catchments prieto et al 2019 beck et al 2016 arsenault brissette 2014 campbell bates 2001 identification of homogeneous regions and hydrologic frequency analysis hosking wallis 1993 satyanarayana srinivas 2008 bharath srinivas 2015a bharath and srinivas 2015b among different regionalization techniques hybrid cluster analysis rao and srinivas 2006ba fuzzy cluster analysis rao and srinivas 2006a kernel based fuzzy clustering approach basu srinivas 2014 and k mean clustering nasseri zahraie 2011 have been widely used for regionalization in hydrological studies bharath srinivas 2015a delineated homogeneous regions based on 1 2 3 4 and 5 day durations annual maximum rainfall and spatial factors latitude longitude and altitude utilizing global fuzzy c means gfcm cluster analysis prior to regional rainfall frequency analysis they had validated their results by conducting tests for regional homogeneity popular regionalization studies are also outlined in their study highlighting the merits and demerits of the different approaches in a recent study raja aydin 2019 performed regionalization of mauritius region using hierarchical clustering approach to study the regional scale precipitation patterns six regions were identified when they performed clustering using the principal components extracted from factors such as precipitation elevation distance to coast aspect and slope studies have also performed regionalization at different temporal scales such as daily monthly and annual scale with variables such as temperature precipitation wind and runoff johnson green 2018 chang et al 2018 khastagir et al 2018 however majority of the regionalization studies focus on spatial clustering by incorporating spatial coordinates as attributes so that geographically contiguous clusters are obtained regionalization using spatial attributes have been found to compromise on hydrological homogeneity of the resulting clusters rao srinivas 2008 guntu et al 2020 and could be a source of uncertainty further some of these methods performed regionalization without accounting for temporal variability of the hydrological variable or the non stationarity that existed in the dataset while the dependence of both the localized spatial and temporal properties on large scale pattern holds great importance in regionalization of hydroclimatic variables a spatiotemporal clustering approach is therefore utilized to group locations with similar spatial as well as temporal attributes in contrast to spatial clustering it considers time element as a dimension shi pun cheng 2019 the spatial attributes can be two dimensional latitude longitude or three dimensional latitude longitude and altitude most of the regionalization studies based on hydrological variables considered two dimensional model with latitude and longitude data however when time is involved it has be to modelled as a third dimension in addition to two dimensional space latitude longitude time and attributes there is consideration for both time and space to define a cluster instead of relying only on its distribution pattern similarly heuristic data mining methods used for clustering do not work based on the principle of probabilistic inference clancey 1985 one advantage of using inferential probability based models is that they provide the probability associated with each cluster and it can abstain if the probability of choosing any particular cluster is too low cowpertwait 2011 performed regionalization of daily precipitation of study region in spain using a cluster probability model specifically a mixed multivariate gaussian model their model used statistical parameters such as mean coefficient of variation and autocorrelation of daily rainfall data to generate optimal clusters which were further revised using theissen polygon data to obtain spatially coherent regions however a probabilistic regionalization framework for hydroclimatic variables that involve spatiotemporal clustering of the time series data and the state of the variable at a defined spatial and temporal point without any constraints on the spatial parameters is not available till date the assumption of stationarity has also been discussed by many studies and changes in precipitation and temperature patterns are quite challenging to predict mainly due to the uncertainty associated with choice of future projections given numerous simulation models and change trajectories the importance of non stationarity analysis has been acknowledged in hydrologic studies in the context of anthropogenic climate change milly et al 2008 sun et al 2015 cardoso pereira et al 2020 regionalization studies using the historical hydroclimatic data may not indicate a pronounced influence of global warming raja and aydin 2019 łupikasza 2016 however since climate is changing ipcc 2014 changes in the regional hydroclimate patterns are likely and need to be investigated yang et al 2019 parracho et al 2016 performed k mean cluster analysis on precipitation at annual and seasonal scales for the iberian peninsula region they assumed the regionalization to be stationary in future scenario and projected that these regions will experience less rainfall in future relatively few studies have perfomed regionalization in the non stationary sense that is the model parameters were allowed to vary over space or time and limted to regional flood frequency analysis problems sun et al 2015 there is a need to evaluate regionalization of hydroclimatic variables under future climate and assess the possible transitions of patterns at regional scale which is the motivation for our study despite the research gaps regional scale impact assessment and risk analysis that aid in planning adaptation and mitigation strategies need to be performed and incorporated in decision making the objective of the present study was to provide a novel framework to perform regionalization of hydroclimatic variables that would facilitate an investigation of the effects of climate change on their regional patterns which is transferable to ungauged locations as well this study performed over the indian region as a test bed adopted the markov random field mrf technique as a probabilistic model to identify homogenous regions for three hydroclimatic variables monthly precipitation monsoon indian summer monsoon rainfall during months of june to september precipitation and monthly temperature the model first creates a discrete binary representation of the hydroclimatic field by introducing latent random variables whose values are estimated by probabilistic inference then this discrete representation was used for identifying spatially contiguous regions which are homogeneous with respect to temporal behaviour of the hydroclimatic variable under consideration regionalization was then performed on the future climate simulations of the variables obtained from climate model simulations over the study region to assess the impacts of climate change on regional hydroclimatic patterns both the number of regions and the distribution of grid locations in the different regions have changed in projected future the modified spatial rainfall patterns under changing climate assessed using the proposed framework could be used for understanding the changes in the water availability in a large study region where spatial heterogeneity of rainfall is significant both spatially and temporally the findings of the study regarding the potential changes and transitions emphasize the need to address the impacts of climate change in regional scale water resources management policies as well as planning in the context of climate water food energy nexus the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides details of the study area and data used and section 3 describes the proposed framework that utilized the mrf based regionalization model for an assessment of impacts of projected climate change on regionalization results from the study performed are discussed in detail in section 4 and conclusions of the study are presented in section 5 2 study area and data the region adopted for the proposed study india lies to the northern part of the equator in between 8 04 n and 37 06 n latitudes and 68 07 e and 97 25 e longitudes the administrative map of india with information on states and union territories is accessible from the website of the press information bureau pib government of india http 164 100 117 97 writereaddata userfiles india 20 20political1 pdf with a long coastal belt proximity to the tropics and bordering mountains ranges of the himalayas in the northern part the country is highly diverse with respect to geography topography and climate major climatic divisions of india are tropical wet subtropical humid arid and mountain regions according to the indian meteorological department imd india has four climatological seasons midya saha 2011 winter december february pre monsoon march may monsoon june september post monsoon october november the diverse climatic conditions result in highly variable precipitation and temperature patterns at both spatial and temporal scales across the country resulting in different hydroclimatic homogeneous regions therefore this region is an excellent candidate for testing the proposed mrf based regionalization approach for instance a study by satyanarayana srinivas 2008 had used the frequency distribution of indian summer monsoon rainfall to perform regionalization over india and obtained seventeen homogeneous regions similarly dash mamgain 2011 suggested seven homogeneous regions in india based on temperature but did not consider the spatial homogeneity of the regions an increase in spatial heterogeneity of rainfall extremes was reported by ghosh et al 2016 over india during the 1951 2003 period which was likely due to local topography land use land cover change and growth of urban sprawl in contrast the mean monsoon rainfall showed a decreasing trend in this period in the current study gridded daily rainfall at 0 25 spatial resolution and gridded daily temperature at 0 5 spatial resolution data obtained from imd were used as the observed rainfall and temperature datasets respectively the gridded imd daily rainfall data was prepared by pai et al 2014 using the observed rainfall measurements at 6955 rain gauge stations in india with varying availability period from 1901 to 2010 they used the inverse distance weighted interpolation idw scheme proposed by shepard 1968 to obtain the 0 25 spatial resolution data srivastava et al 2009 developed gridded temperature dataset using temperature data of 395 stations distributed all over india for the period 1969 2005 their study employed an angular distance weighting algorithm to develop the gridded temperature dataset the choice of climate model to perform climate change assessment in a region is important and the uncertainty associated with the rcm and its parent gcm the downscaling approach and bias correction can affect quality of climatic projection for that region studies by sperber et al 2013 sengupta rajeevan 2013 and gupta jain 2018 have worked with rcms for simulating the indian summer monsoon rainfall in future and examined the performance of the cmip5 rcms to study the impacts of projected future climate change on regionalization of hydroclimatic variables precipitation and temperature simulations from one of the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex south asia rcms were adopted in this study the cnrm cm 5 0 as driving gcm in cordex rcm suite available at 0 5 resolution was chosen in this study to analyse the historical baseline and future precipitation and temperature patterns two projected emission scenarios for future climate representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 were selected for this study while the rcp 4 5 pathway suggests a peaked greenhouse gas emission scenario corresponding to a radiative forcing of 4 5 w m2 around the 2050 s followed by no further increase the pathway of rcp 8 5 represents a consistently increasing emissions scenario that reaches the peak value of 8 5 w m2 by the year 2100 the rcm data for both temperature and precipitation were obtained from the centre for climate change research cccr indian institute of tropical meteorology http cccr tropmet res in cordex the baseline period was taken as 1971 2003 in this study while the future period chosen was 2042 2068 the model dataset was further regridded to match the coordinates of the observed dataset using simple bilinear interpolation 3 methodology 3 1 bias correction of climate model data in this study regionalization was performed using monthly precipitation monsoon precipitation indian summer monsoon during months of june to september and temperature variables for determining the changes in regionalization in future under projected climate change firstly the baseline rcm datasets of these variables were improved to match with historical observed datasets using the bias correction technique and then the future climate projections were corrected in a similar manner in this study we adopted a monthly bias correction technique ojha et al 2013 to rectify the rcm datasets for future regionalization the monthly time series of the hydroclimatic variable y i k of the selected rcm was standardized using eq 1 to remove the temporal statistic of rcm model dataset for each month i in year k 1 y i k y i k m model i s model i where m model i is the monthly mean and s model i is the standard deviation of the model data for the month i in the next step the observed monthly mean m observed i and the standard deviation s observed i obtained from the gridded imd dataset were imposed to the standardized dataset y i k to create a bias corrected dataset x i k at monthly level it is shown in eq 2 2 x i k y i k s observed i m observed i for correcting the temperature and precipitation dataset in the future scenario the monthly mean and standard deviation of the baseline period itself were used without any change 3 2 regionalization using markov random field mrf model 3 2 1 markov random field mrf model graphical model of joint and conditional probability distributions facilitate representation of statistical dependencies connecting edges among random variables nodes the regionalization approach adopted in the study utilized mrf li 1994 cross jain 1983 kindermann snell 1980 a graphical model that involves sets of random variables some of which may be observed and others which are latent or directly not measurable consider x an s d observation matrix such that each s d stores the observed value of hydroclimatic variable at location s for a month d the locations of the study area are ordered sequentially first according to longitude and then according to latitude observations in x are modeled as random variables using location specific mixture distributions at each location we fit a 2 mode mixture distribution to the data while one mode corresponds to higher values of the observations the other mode corresponds to lower values in this study gamma distribution was chosen to fit observations of precipitation and gaussian distribution was fit to temperature observations parameters of these distributions were estimated using the expectation maximization em algorithm this process helped us to binarize the data that is corresponding to each observation x s d we get a binary variable z s d indicating which of the two mixture modes fits x s d better the values of these latent variables are not known apriori but may be estimated by probabilistic inference for this purpose we define probability distributions linking these variables with each other and also with the observations x s d this is achieved by constructing a probabilistic graphical model which is basically a graph where each node is associated with one of these variables edges are added between pairs of nodes to encode their relationships as desired three sets of latent variables are present in this graphical model i discrete state z at each s d which indicates which of the two distributions fit the corresponding x s d ii a temporal clustering variable u for each time step month and iii a spatial clustering variable v for each grid point u and v takes integer values denoting the spatial pattern present in a month and the temporal pattern present at a location respectively the latent variables z u v as defined above are assumed to be spatiotemporally coherent in our model that is adjacent locations have the same values of z this resulted in a spatiotemporal graphical model as shown in fig 1 with z and x variable as nodes such that z s d is linked to the corresponding x s d using a data edge for two adjacent locations s and s z s d and z s d are connected using spatial edges for all values of d edges connecting z s d and z s d 1 are the temporal edges further edge potential functions are defined on each of these edges these edge potential functions are decided such that the spatiotemporal coherence of z is maximized and z fit the observations in x well through mixture distributions for details of these functions the readers are referred to mitra et al 2018 in this mrf model the joint probability distribution of all the variables is the product of all the edge potential functions the inference problem is to find the optimal values of all the z variables such that this joint probability is maximized and is achieved through gibbs sampling method casella george 1992 in this study first of all the latent variables are initialized according to simple thresholds after that each individual latent variable z s d u d and v s for different locations s and time points d are sampled one by one from their conditional distributions which can be derived easily from the distributions as defined in appendix a while sampling one variable all others are held constant in each iteration all variables are sampled once each and their values updated accordingly after an initial burn in period of 50 iterations by which the joint likelihood is found to converge values of these variables are recorded at regular intervals after a large enough number of iterations these records give us an approximation of the posterior distributions of the latent variables from which we can choose their modes as the maximum a posteriori map estimate the process is described in greater details in sections 3 2 3 and 3 2 4 these estimated values help us to identify the spatial clusters or regions discrete variables u u 1 u 2 u d and v v 1 v 2 v s defined in this model indicate a clustering of the time steps and clustering of the spatial locations respectively note that for the z variables each location has a d dimensional time series of z variables and each time step or month is represented with an s dimensional vector when the goal is clustering of the spatial locations or regionalization the focus is on v for any location s v s denotes its cluster index also the number of clusters k to be formed in the proposed regionalization are not fixed apriori and is inferred by the model from the data for a cluster k there is a canonical d dimensional binary time series and when v s k for any location the time series of z at location s is a noisy version of the k th canonical time series a user tuneable parameter called μ is defined therein based on the average amount of noise that is the number of time points where the z does not match with the canonical time series for a small value of μ it results in pure clusters with less noise as a result clusters formed are small in size and more in number and vice versa for large values of μ regional scale analyses and decision making for ungauged locations in a large region could be performed with greater ease when spatial clusters are also geographically contiguous therefore a prior distribution is assumed for the v variables based on chinese restaurant process pitman 1995 such that each location s joins the same cluster as at least one of its geographically adjacent locations and is more likely to join bigger clusters these additional constraints mean that a small number of homogeneous regions are formed which have reasonable size and are spatially contiguous will be formed in this clustering then to obtain the optimal values of v a joint distribution of x z v variables is defined using the gibbs sampling method the steps involved in the mrf based regionalization procedure is presented as a flowchart in fig 2 in this study μ was chosen as 2 and increment for the parameter was chosen to be 1 upto 20 the optimal value of μ was chosen based on the correlation coefficient and number of cluster corresponding to each μ the details of this mathematical framework and the parameter setup are provided in appendix a and appendix b respectively further details of the mrf formulation are available in mitra et al 2018 3 2 2 chinese restaurant process crp pitman 1995 developed the chinese restaurant process crp probability mass function pmf for clustering of sequential discrete random variables the prior distribution of the temporal clustering of the months by variables u u 1 u 2 u d is modeled as crp according to the following rule i the first month always chooses the first cluster that is p u 1 1 1 and ii the d th month chooses a cluster with probability proportional to the number of months already assigned to that cluster or form a new cluster with probability proportional to α 1 which is a scalar parameter of the process the prior distribution of u is given by eq 3 3 p u d u u 1 u d 1 n d u m d u i f u u 1 u d 1 α 1 f o r u max u 1 u d 1 1 for spatial clustering in the proposed model the prior distribution of the latent variables v v 1 v 2 v s is also modelled as crp in the process first grid point is assigned to the first cluster p v 1 1 1 the s th grid point is assigned to a cluster depending on the probability proportional to the number of grid points assigned to that cluster so far or a new cluster is formed with probability proportional to β 1 which is a tuning parameter of the process defined by the user the prior distribution of v is given by eq 4 4 p v s v v 1 v s 1 n s v i f v v 1 v s 1 β 1 f o r v max v 1 v s 1 1 3 2 3 gibbs sampling the gibbs sampling method neal 1993 is a common markov chain monte carlo mcmc technique for estimating a complicated joint or conditional distribution by collecting samples gibbs samplers are employed when probabilistic models can be formulated in such a way that the expressions for conditional probabilistic distributions for each model variable can be calculated and sampled efficiently unlike the metropolis hastings algorithm chib greenberg 1995 samples from the conditional distributions are collected at regular intervals after an initial burn in period to ensure that there is accuracy but no wasted computation mathematically the general approach of the gibbs sampler is to estimate a multivariate joint distribution for n random variables given by y y 1 y 2 y n by drawing samples of each random variable turn by turn keeping the others constant from marginal conditional distributions such as in eq 5 5 p y i y 1 y 2 y i 1 y i 1 y n p y i y i as discussed above n conditional distributions are required for n dimensional vectors to use the method to initiate gibbs sampling we generated an initial state y 0 y 1 0 y 2 0 y n 0 samples were drawn for each variable sequentially while keeping the other dimensions fixed once enough samples have been drawn the mode may be computed 3 2 4 inference from the proposed model the iterative procedure for gibbs sampling for the model described in previous section can be summarized as follows i the samples of p z s d z z u v x were collected iteratively by gibbs sampler using eq a 1 in appendix a each term of eq a 1 was computed using eq a2 a4 the procedure was conducted for each variable z s d where s 1 2 s d 1 2 d ii the sampling of variables u d and v s was done based on the crp prior eq 3 and 4 and the potential functions defined by eq a 3 the scaling parameter remains the same iii the parameters of gamma distribution precipitation and gaussian distribution temperature were recalculated at each iteration of the main loop corresponding to u d and v s using eq a 4 p z s d was recomputed and about 500 iterations were performed for the clustering iv the mode of the spatial variable v assigned to a grid point was chosen as the final cluster number for that grid point 3 3 regional homogeneity tests the results of regionalization were tested using the conventional l moments based method popularly adopted in hydrologic studies the homogeneity test statistics using the sampling properties of l moment ratios indicate the degree of heterogeneity of the regions clusters the three heterogeneity measures i h1 based on l coefficient of variation l cv ii h2 based on l cv and l skewness and iii h3 based on l skewness and l kurtosis were computed in this study for more details on these the readers are encouraged to refer hosking wallis 1993 the criteria to quantify the homogeneity of a cluster as per this method are provided in table 1 hosking wallis 1997 found h1 to be superior and the most suitable heterogeneity measure compared to h2 and h3 as the two statistics rarely give values larger than 2 even for highly heterogeneous regions therefore h1 was adopted in the present study as a heterogeneity measure the expression for h1 is given in eq 6 6 h 1 v μ v σ v where μ v and σ v represent the mean and standard deviation respectively of the n sim numbers of v v is the weighted standard deviation of the at site sample l cvs and is computed using eq 7 7 v i 1 n n i t i t r 2 i 1 n n i 1 2 where n i is the length of the dataset at grid point i whose sample l cv is denoted as t i t r is the regional average of the sample l cv in the study the number of realizations n sim was taken as 500 hosking wallis 1997 also suggested a critical value d i that indicates the degree of discordancy of a grid point with other grid points in a region this was also computed using eq 8 to test the regional homogeneity 8 d i 1 3 n r u i u t s u i u where u i t i t 3 i t 4 i t is the vector comprising l cv t i l skewness t 3 i and l kurtosis t 4 i for grid point i in the region s is a covariance matrix computed using eq 9 and u is the unweighted regional average of the l moment ratios computed using eq 10 9 s i 1 n r u i u u i u t 10 u i 1 n r u i n r 3 4 climate change and regionalization regionalization of hydroclimatic variables in the current and future climate under potential climate change were compared by assessing the similarity in homogeneous regions obtained in these two time periods in this regard the jaccard similarity coefficient s j given in eq 11 was used as a measure of similarity between two regions mcmanamay et al 2014 it compares grid points for two regions for evaluating their similarities and dissimilarities and the value ranges from 0 to 100 the higher the percentage the more similar the two regions 11 s j a a b c where a is the number of common grid points between two regions and b is the number of grid points in region 1 that is not shared by region 2 and c is the number of grid points in region 2 that is not shared by region 1 furthermore the hydroclimatic characteristics of homogeneous regions under the current and future scenarios were investigated in detail to assess the possible changes in regional patterns under potential climate change in future the framework developed in the study can thus address the changes in regionalization differences in characteristics of the homogeneous regions and determine how the possible transitions of grid locations between the two scenarios are associated with changing hydroclimatic patterns 4 results and discussion 4 1 bias correction of rcm datasets the simulations for temperature and precipitation at 0 5 resolution extracted from cnrm cm 5 0 as driving gcm cordex rcm were bias corrected using mbc method to obtain regions for current and future climate to carry out climate change impact assessment studies as the analysis was carried out at a monthly scale firstly the daily data were aggregated to a monthly scale before mbc was applied the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was computed at all the grid locations in the study region to assess the performance of bias correction are shown in the plots in fig 3 prior to bias correction the raw rcm simulations show poor performance as a proxy for observed precipitation and temperature data fig 3a 3c emphasizing the need for bias correction using the observed baseline datasets nse values in the range 0 8 to 0 9 were obtained after employing mbc technique for temperature fig 3d and precipitation fig 3b at most of the grid locations thus there is significant enhancement in datasets after the application of mbc the grid points present in the extreme north of india has not been considered for regionalization due to scarcity of observed stations for precipitation and temperature which may affect the quality of gridded data 4 2 mrf based regionalization model regionalization based on the monthly precipitation monsoon precipitation and temperature variables were performed to obtain regions of similar hydroclimatic characteristics in the mrf based clustering technique for regionalization adopted in this study the number of clusters was not predefined and estimated by the model depending on the user specified parameter μ in eq a 4 given in appendix a smaller the μ higher is the number of clusters and vice versa the spatial clusters were considered as regions in this approach to determine the optimal number of regions the mean correlation coefficient of regionalization that is the average value of the correlation between locations belonging to the homogeneous regions obtained corresponding to different cluster numbers were compared the results are plotted in fig 4 plots in fig 4 suggest that an increase in the number of clusters can improve the correlation coefficient upto a particular optimal value after which it does not significantly change it is also evident that the optimal number of clusters is not stationary with time for a variable it has different values for baseline and future climate scenarios the optimal μ parameters for monthly precipitation monsoon precipitation and temperature could be fixed considering both the correlation coefficient and the total number of clusters however regional homogeneity tests were further performed to fix the μ parameter in this study the heterogeneity h 1 of regions was tested using l moments method fig 5 shows the number of regions the maximum number of grid points present in a region and the mean of heterogeneity values corresponding to each value of μ fig 5 shows the results for monthly precipitation plots a b c monsoon precipitation plots d e f and temperature plots g h i that justify the choice of optimal parameters it is observed that the heterogeneity measure and the maximum number of grid points present in a region increase as the μ parameter increases with a corresponding decrease in the number of regions formed therefore choice of μ was based on optimizing the number of regions obtained such that their h 1 values are in acceptable range lower values of μ were avoided to limit the number of regions obtained for instance regionalization using μ 10 was chosen for monthly precipitation data in which 3 to 4 regions are found to be heterogeneous h 1 2 in all the scenarios containing large number of grid points further regionalization was then performed on these regions using the mrf model to obtain smaller homogeneous regions and were then verified using the discordancy test described previously in case of monsoon precipitation corresponding to μ parameter value of 10 the majority of the regions are found to be heterogeneous but when μ was chosen as 3 majority of the regions are found to be homogeneous total number regions are also found to be reasonable corresponding to the chosen μ in all the scenarios fig 5 d e f in this case only a discordancy test was performed to remove the discordant sites from the obtained regions similarly regions having very few grid points were either deleted or merged with other regions to improve the regionalization scheme in the case of temperature fig 5 g h i corresponding to μ parameter value of 3 the majority of the regions are found to be homogeneous with number of regions in acceptable range therefore site adjustment was done to bring the h 1 statistics within acceptable range that is 2 the final statistics of heterogeneity test corresponding to each region obtained from the mrf model based technique are shown in fig 6 the plots in fig 6 show each region s heterogeneity and the number of grid points obtained using monthly precipitation plots a b c monsoon precipitation plots d e f and temperature plots g h i the h 1 statistic is found to be 2 in all the scenarios that is the regions are either acceptably homogeneous h 1 1 or possibly homogeneous 1 h 1 2 the homogeneous regions in the baseline period and future period were analysed to understand the effects of potential climate change on regionalization 4 3 results of regionalization 4 3 1 regionalization in baseline and future periods the mrf based regionalization results for monthly precipitation variable are shown in fig 7 with the help of different coloured locations a few regions were found to have 10 grid points due to uneven temporal and spatial characteristics such regions were identified and then removed as they are unlikely to be physically meaningful the baseline period fig 7a rcp 4 5 future fig 7b and rcp 8 5 future fig 7c scenarios are found to have 38 34 and 30 homogeneous regions respectively as a result of regionalization the regions were ranked and labelled in ascending order of the mean monthly precipitation such that region 1 represents the lowest mean precipitation and the highest ranked region possesses the largest mean monthly precipitation among all the regions identified in the study region the regions in the north east india and along the west coast are found to receive higher rainfall in the baseline period when compared to other regions of india as the bay of bengal and arabian sea branches of monsoon arrive first in these areas the patterns obtained are similar in rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future the north east part of india is found to have a different pattern compared to the rest of the country similarly parts of rajasthan and gujarat in the west are assigned to separate clusters as the factors such as presence of desert and proximity to sea affect their rainfall characteristics the regionalization results based on monsoon precipitation are shown in fig 8 when compared to monthly precipitation regionalization based on monsoon precipitation using the proposed method resulted in more number of clusters regions indicating larger spatial variability in monsoon rainfall in india once again the regions with very fewer grid points were removed using the same process as in the previous case and in total 39 36 and 35 clusters were obtained in the baseline period fig 8a rcp 4 5 future fig 8b and rcp 8 5 future fig 8c respectively the regions were then ranked and labelled in the ascending order of the mean monsoon precipitation as done in the case of monthly precipitation the north east and west coast of india are assigned to clusters having highest mean value as the bay of bengal and arabian sea branches of monsoon first touch down at these places during the rainy season however the regions in the east coast and north west part of india are found to experience less rainfall as the monsoon loses most of its moisture during its path numerous small clusters are also observed in the north eastern and western parts of india the regions identified as having similar temperature patterns are shown in fig 9 and it is found that the regional patterns in the temperature variable are not as erratic as compared to precipitation the regionalization using mrf technique resulted in 23 22 and 22 regions in the baseline period fig 9a rcp 4 5 future fig 9b and rcp 8 5 future fig 9c respectively the north central and interior peninsula regions of india that were delineated as two distinct regions in the study by dash and mamgain 2011 are found as nine distinct regions in the present study though the mean temperatures of each of these nine clusters were similar the standard deviations varied from cluster to cluster the north east part of india formed two clusters in all the scenarios the north and central part of india had 14 clusters in the baseline period it changed to 4 and 7 clusters in future under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively 4 3 2 changes in precipitation regionalization due to climate change owing to potential climate change the hydroclimatic patterns at a regional scale undergo a significant change in future which can manifest in the regionalization the metric jaccard coefficient s j rice belland 1982 was employed in this study to compute the degree of similarity between the old and newly formed regions and the influence of climate change can be explained based on the characteristics of newly formed regions the transitions of the grid points to new regions were analyzed while comparing the precipitation regionalization between the baseline and future time periods by tracking and measuring the transition of associated grid points from old regions to new regions the effect of climate change on regionalization could be understood fig 10 explains the degree of similarity among regions delineated for monthly precipitation under the assumption of a changing future climate the cluster numbers of baseline period future period in the abscissa ordinate are ranked in ascending order of the mean monthly precipitation the higher cluster numbers represent the regions of heavy rainfall and vice versa the coordinate of a point in the graph provides the old region x and new region y the colour of that point gives the jaccard s coefficient s j that is the degree of similarity between the old region x and new region y fig 10 suggests a general pattern the regions 1 2 3 4 and 5 that were associated with less rainfall lower rank since the clusters are labelled in ascending order of rainfall are projected to remain as the regions 1 having low rainfall however a few numbers of grid points originally belonging to drier regions ranked 10 in rcp 4 5 and ranked 7 8 9 and 10 in rcp 8 5 are found to shift to the regions associated with heavy rainfall the grid points in the regions receiving moderate rainfall ranked 10 to 18 in the baseline period are reclassified to higher ranked regions ranked 23 28 in rcp 4 5 and 8 5 with heavier rainfall in the future period the regions that received heavy rainfall in historical period are projected to remain so during the future period in both the scenarios the transition of many grid locations from moderate rainfall regions to heavy rainfall regions has led to an overall decrease in the number of regions in the future scenarios a few grid points in clusters 32 38 heavy rainfall regions in the baseline period are assigned to clusters 12 9 and 7 low rainfall regions in rcp 8 5 future these regions constitute parts of states of maharashtra and karnataka cluster 39 the wettest region in the baseline period remained as a heavy rainfall region in rcp 4 5 future a similar analysis was conducted for the transition of regions based on monsoon precipitation regionalization as shown in fig 11 the jacard coefficient values for the transitions from baseline period to rcp 4 5 future fig 11a and from baseline period to rcp 8 5 future fig 11b suggest similar trends that the heavy low rainfall regions are projected to remain heavy low rainfall regions during the future period in both the scenarios minor transitions are seen such as redistribution of few grid points in clusters 4 to 8 to moderate rainfall clusters 15 16 18 and 19 in both future scenarios and to a heavy rainfall cluster 33 in rcp 8 5 future whereas few grid points in clusters 39 38 and 37 heavy rainfall clusters are assigned to clusters 7 9 and 13 in rcp 4 5 future and clusters 15 17 and 19 in rcp 8 5 future which are lower rainfall regions 4 3 3 changes in regional hydroclimatic characteristics fig 12 explains the temporal variability of the regional average values of the hydroclimatic variables considered in this study between baseline and future periods under potential climate change the cluster numbers denote the rank of a region in the ascending order of the variable mean fig 12 a suggests that for monthly precipitation variable there is minimum change in its regional average between the baseline period and rcp 4 5 future whereas all the regions are projected to have more severe rainfall in rcp 8 5 future scenario fig 12 b indicated the occurrence of similar patterns in the regions having low monsoon precipitation moderate to heavy monsoon precipitation regions beyond cluster number 11 of baseline period have increased magnitude of mean rainfall in rcp 4 5 future whereas only a slight increase is seen in this characteristic between baseline period and rcp 8 5 future the results suggest that the wet season may become wetter and the dry season may become drier in future under rcp 8 5 scenario increase in regional average temperature is observed under all the scenarios in future highest under rcp 8 5 when compared to the baseline period values in both the extremely warm and cold locations of india the proposed framework further investigated the possible modifications in spatiotemporal hydroclimatic patterns under changing climate at a regional scale taking the state of odisha in east india as an example grid locations in odisha were in clusters 16 25 28 29 and 30 with regional average precipitation of 68 26 90 02 105 64 108 38 and 127 50 mm respectively fig 12a in the baseline period in rcp 4 5 future clusters projected are 13 24 26 and 29 respectively fig 10a with regional averages of 66 71 100 62 107 90 and 125 19 mm respectively whereas in rcp 8 5 scenario clusters 18 19 and 24 fig 10b are projected in odisha with regional averages 99 86 100 02 and 121 92 mm respectively the transition in rcp 4 5 scenario represents a small change while there is an increase projected in precipitation magnitude in rcp 8 5 scenario in odisha the nature of the rcp 4 5 and 8 5 future trajectories are evident in these transition patterns similarly the regionalization based on monsoon precipitation data indicated that odisha has clusters 24 27 and 30 with regional averages 241 31 253 63 and 286 63 mm respectively in the baseline period in rcp 4 5 future clusters 14 18 24 27 and 28 fig 11a with regional averages 184 56 231 87 262 52 276 43 and 278 49 mm are projected in rcp 8 5 future clusters 15 18 22 and 24 fig 11b are projected with regional averages of monsoon precipitation 192 33 231 87 256 33 and 262 52 mm respectively the future monsoon precipitation regionalization presents different transition patterns for baseline regions of moderate and high rainfall the regionalization based on monthly temperature data indicated clusters 9 12 16 17 21 and 22 in odisha with regional averages 25 91 26 71 26 93 26 95 27 57 and 27 68 c respectively in rcp 4 5 future projected clusters are 10 11 12 and 16 with regional average temperatures 25 49 25 97 26 03 and 26 60 c respectively while clusters 13 14 15 and 17 with regional averages 26 16 26 25 26 41 and 26 85 c respectively are projected in rcp 8 5 future it is seen that temperature patterns in this region do not present any conclusive trend when compared to precipitation 5 conclusions a novel regionalization approach was presented in this paper for investigating the impacts of potential climate change on spatiotemporal patterns of hydroclimatic variables the aforementioned analysis was conducted on the tropical country india with diverse hydroclimatic features and distinct climate regions an mrf based probabilistic model was used in this study to identify homogeneous regions using the monthly precipitation monsoon precipitation and monthly temperature datasets for current and future periods which has not been previously done the homogeneous regions identified and ranked on the basis of regional averages were tracked between the baseline period and future rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios the changes in hydroclimatic characteristics as well as regional patterns in the future scenario under potential climate change were evaluated the jaccard coefficient was used to track the transitions of the regions between baseline and future periods the results of the study showed that there are appreciable changes in regionalization as well as the characteristics of the homogenous regions due to projected climate change these transitions are not alike and of varying degree of magnitude and trend when compared for drier and wetter regions and for cooler and warmer regions the conclusions of the study are as follows i bias correction of rcm precipitation was more challenging when compared to temperature by using mbc technique bias present in rcm datasets was significantly reduced the technique performed better for the locations in the eastern part of india the nse was found to be in the range of 0 6 to 0 9 for most of the locations in india ii regionalization performed in this study did not include spatial attributes data yet the mrf based model was successful in providing hydroclimatically and geographically contiguous regions as output unlike previous studies the southern part of india is found to have more regions in precipitation based regionalization when compared to north india likely due to the presence of eastern ghats western ghats and peninsula also future outputs show less variability in patterns across space iii the results projected that changes in net annual seasonal rainfall are likely in future under either climate change scenario rcps 4 5 and 8 5 when regional monthly averages were compared an increase in precipitation is seen which is more in rcp 8 5 when compared to rcp 4 5 scenario changes in regional characteristics due to the transition of locations suggest possibility of increasing as well as decreasing trends additionally sub seasonal changes in the regional characteristics may take place in the future iv with respect to temperature regionalization the regions representing extreme warmer and cooler parts of the country are projected to have slightly increased average temperatures in the future the warmer regions identified in the southern part of india under rcp 4 5 scenario have increased average temperature under the rcp 8 5 scenario in the context of hydroclimatic regionalization it has to be noted that homogeneous regions obtained using different variables need not be identical however within the proposed scheme the spatio temporal patterns could be identified the framework adopted in the study using baseline and future hydroclimatic variables can be performed for any large spatial domain it is evident that the regional hydroclimatic homogeneity need not be geographically contiguous could vary with the chosen variables as well as their time scales and vary temporally in the future owing to climate variability previous studies singh et al 2017 have pointed out that simulations of rainfall over india from cordex rcms like the one used in the present study are not better when compared with their host cmip5 gcm outputs therefore it is understood that projections from improved regional models that have better skill in representing the rainfall characteristics of the study region be used in the proposed framework for future decision making and impacts mitigation similarly the use of multiple climate models scenarios and ensemble approaches is recommended to fully understand the likely changes in regional hydroclimatic patterns owing to climate change we would like to emphasize that the direct applicability of results of the reported study as well as other studies employing climate models for future decision making is limited by uncertainties such as model single intermodel multiple gcms rcms intramodel multiple runs of same gcms rcms uncertainty scenario uncertainty and downscaling and or bias correction model uncertainty kannan et al 2014 accounting of different sources of uncertainties is not however within the scope of the reported study but would be the future direction of work for comprehensive assessment of
