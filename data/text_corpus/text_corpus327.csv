1635,dissolved phase contaminants transported by diffusion into the low permeability matrix of fractured sedimentary rock pose a challenge to groundwater cleanup efforts because this stored mass may persist even when the upgradient source zone is removed in this context if contaminant biodegradation takes place within the low permeability matrix plume persistence may be substantially reduced therefore it is important to characterize microbial communities within the low permeability rock matrix pores instead of only from groundwater samples which represent biomass from fast flowing fractures this research relies on depth discrete data from both core and groundwater samples collected from two locations representing a mid plume and plume front condition within an aged mixed organic contaminant plume in a sedimentary rock aquifer results from multiple analyte measurements on rock and groundwater indicate that biodegradation in the lower permeability matrix of fractured sedimentary rocks and the microbial consortia is spatially variable due to differences in hydrochemistry redox conditions and contaminant concentrations dechlorinating microorganisms were detected in the sandstone matrix at both locations but the detected microbial diversity calculated with pcr dgge was significantly higher in samples collected from the core located closer to the source zone where contaminant concentrations are higher and contaminant compositions more diverse compared to samples from the plume front location graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial diversity rock core groundwater chemistry chlorinated solvents fractured sedimentary rock natural attenuation 1 introduction in fractured sedimentary rocks dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl contaminants are preferentially transported through the fracture network and due to their density have the potential to penetrate deep into the subsurface as dnapl dissolves in fracture spaces the dissolved phase is transported by advection in the fractures and by diffusion into the adjacent low permeability yet porous rock matrix within a few years to decades after the dnapl spill most of the contaminant mass will be found in the matrix blocks as dissolved and sorbed phases rather than as dnapl in the fractures parker et al 1994 parker et al 2012 this mass stored in the low permeability rock matrix poses a challenge to cleanup efforts because most remedial technologies cannot directly access or quickly deliver amendments to the diffusion controlled zones e g pump and treat surfactants or in situ chemical oxidation reduction furthermore remedial technologies focused on reduction of contaminant mass in the groundwater of the high permeability fracture network are ineffective because back diffusion driven by higher contaminant concentrations in the matrix than in the fractures continues to contribute contaminants to the fracture groundwater resulting in long term plume persistence liu and ball 2002 lu et al 2006 parker et al 2010 seyedabbasi et al 2012 adamson et al 2015 in this context if potential for contaminant biodegradation exists within the low permeability matrix of fractured sedimentary rocks the contaminant mass stored in the matrix would decline reducing plume persistence by back diffusion fluxes west and kueper 2010 lima et al 2012 most studies on contaminant biodegradation in fractured sedimentary bedrocks have relied only on microbial characterization of the biomass suspended in groundwater mostly drawn from highly conductive fractures nativ et al 1999 hohnstock ashe et al 2001 lenczewski et al 2003 arnon et al 2005 chartrand et al 2005 castegnier et al 2006 bradley et al 2009 little or no attention has been focused on characterization of the biomass attached to fracture surfaces or trapped within the low hydraulic conductivity but high storage volume rock matrix clay aquitards and the interfaces between these units and adjacent aquifers provide analogous hydraulic conductivity and porosity contrasts to those present in fractured porous rocks several studies have shown that the interface between aquifers and aquitards is a highly reactive zone in which fatty acids organic matter electron donors i e h2 and electron acceptors diffuse out of organic rich aquitards and sustain the biodegradation activities of microorganisms on the aquifer side of the interface mcmahon 2001 van stempvoort et al 2009 mcmahon and chapelle 1991 krumholz et al 1997 evidence that biodegraders grow inside pores of clay aquitards and also rock matrices has been found in laboratory and in field cases takeuchi et al 2011 lima and sleep 2007 scheutz et al 2010 lima et al 2012 in all these cases microorganisms responsible for dechlorination were found at distances away from the aquifer aquitard interface varying from centimeters up to 1 m in one case higher numbers of dehalococcoides species and h2 producing bacteria were found in the aquitard than in aquifer samples takeuchi et al 2011 from these results it is reasonable to hypothesize that the interface between the fractures and rock matrix and rock matrix itself with its large storage volume for water and contaminants would be similarly active in terms of biodegradation characterization of the microbial community in rock core samples is an important step toward understanding potential contaminant biodegradation processes in the matrix of fractured sedimentary rocks it is noteworthy that matrix pore sizes in sandstones are typically larger than 10 μm and pore throats are generally 2 μm they may be smaller than 2 μm in tight sandstones whereas shale pore throat sizes are smaller than 0 1 μm nelson 2009 based on these typical pore and pore throat sizes some sandstone matrix pores are large enough to harbor microbial growth gregory et al 2014 there is evidence that viable cells can exist in these rock matrices fredrickson et al 1997 additionally dechlorinating microorganisms were detected in sandstone samples collected as part of a previous investigation at the site presented here lima et al 2012 however growth of microorganisms capable of biodegradation is not only a function of rock matrix pore sizes but also of nutrient availability especially in oligotrophic environments the presence of appropriate electron acceptors and donors and the flux of metabolic products depending on the mineralogy the rock itself may be a source of inorganic electron acceptors such as mg ii fe iii and sulphate but if natural organic carbon content is very low or absent the indigenous biomass may not develop to detectable levels without laboratory cultivation in such cases the presence of mixed organic contaminants including aromatics and aliphatic chemicals may increase community diversity compared to that of the indigenous community this hypothesis opposes what is expected in unconsolidated media in which stresses due to contaminants decreases microbial diversity in soils and sediments compared to pristine conditions kozdroj and van elsas 2001 becker et al 2006 joynt et al 2006 if soils and sediments are nutrient rich before contamination they are able to support a rich and diverse indigenous microbial community decreased diversity resulting from contamination is a consequence of community specialization some microorganisms die because of the poisoning effects of the contaminants causing the microbial community to transition toward one that is able to withstand contaminants and even use them in their metabolic pathways however little is known about how contaminants affect microbial communities in oligotrophic and fractured sedimentary rocks the primary objective of this study is to determine how varying contaminant concentrations and compositions impact the microbial community structures and diversity in two rock cores obtained from an oligotrophic flat lying sandstone dolostone sequence contaminated many decades ago with chlorinated solvents ketones and aromatics therefore continuous cores were collected in 2008 from two locations along the centerline of an established groundwater plume where contaminant conditions were known to differ locations mp 19d and mp 21d are located about 0 75 and 1 6 km downgradient of the persistent dnapl source respectively dna was extracted from numerous depth discrete rock samples representing the low permeability matrices from both core locations population diversity was determined by pcr dgge for the hypervariable region v3 of the 16s rdna gene of bacteria pcr dgge was chosen for this study because previous studies have shown dgge can predict major microbial groups li et al 2006 liu et al 2009 although pcr dgge underestimates the overall microbial diversity lee et al 2010 it is still a valid methodology to investigate major players in the microbial community when applied to a large number of samples because it offers a good compromise between the number of samples processed and the information obtained forney et al 2004 pcr dgge was the microbiology tool used in this study because at the time 2008 it was a useful tool for investigating the depth discrete spatial variability of community fingerprints for the volatile organic compound voc contaminated lone rock formation fm sandstone based on high resolution sampling of continuous rock cores lima et al 2012 however due to the limitations mentioned above the species richness obtained reflects only the most abundant microorganisms 1 of the total communities the dechlorinating community of microorganisms in the low permeability matrix of the lone rock sandstones along the mp 19d core was previously characterized lima et al 2012 and these results are compared with those from the mp 21d core located farther down gradient from the persistent dnapl source zone in the same lithostratigraphic unit but where contaminant concentrations and hydrochemical conditions in the groundwater are different 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and contaminant history the study site is located in dane county wisconsin and is underlain by unconsolidated pleistocene glacial deposits over cambrian ordovician sandstones and dolostones meyer et al 2014 meyer et al 2016 groundwater flow is primarily horizontal in many of the hydrogeologic units delineated at the site due to their large bulk horizontal hydraulic conductivities and lateral extent meyer et al 2008 between 1950 and 1970 contaminants were released into the subsurface resulting in an accumulation of dnapl in the lone rock fm sandstone between 45 and 56 m bgs referred to as the source zone and subsequent development of a dissolved phase plume extending up to 2 8 km downgradient in the same sandstone hsi geotrans 1999 geotrans 2003 the main contaminants in the dnapl are tetrachloroethene pce trichloroethene tce 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca btex benzene toluene ethyl benzene and xylenes ketones chloromethanes and minor amounts of chlorofluorocarbon compounds cfcs hsi geotrans 1999 fig 1 shows a map indicating the dnapl source zone extent of the dissolved phase plume migrating in the lone rock fm sandstones prior to initiating pump and treat for hydraulic capture the conventional well monitoring network multilevel systems and the mp 19d and mp 21d corehole multilevel system locations used in this study fig 1 also shows the location of four pump and treat system wells operating for four years prior to the mp 19d and mp 21d coring done for this study these locations were selected within mp 19 and down gradient mp 21 of the pump and treat system capture zone where the contaminant concentrations and fluxes would be much lower at the mp 21d location compared to the upgradient mp 19d location 2 2 rock core sampling rock coring procedures followed the discrete fracture network dfn approach and framework developed by parker et al 2012 the dfn approach is applied to fractured rock sites to develop a site specific conceptual model in which various characterization methods are deployed in order to identify the key processes affecting plume behaviour and due to the dual porosity characteristics requires a wide variety of data sets from both the borehole and cores to adequately determine the spatial variability of the fracture network controlling fluid flow and role of low permeability zones on mass storage and reactions parker et al 2012 the datasets include lithology fracture logs and rock core voc concentrations plus geophysical and hydraulic information collected from open coreholes natural gamma resistivity acoustic televiewer depth discrete horizontal hydraulic conductivity etc these datasets are then used to design the position and length of monitoring intervals in high resolution westbay multilevel systems that provide temporal data at the site rock cores were obtained from two locations mp 19 and mp 21 fig 1 the mp 19 and mp 21 locations both included two one shallow s and one deep d continuously cored holes to minimize downward mobilization of contaminants the coring methods were described previously by lima et al 2012 rock cores from mp 19s and mp 21s were not sampled for voc concentrations because the depths for these two cored holes overlapped with mp 19d and mp 21d cores obtained in the same field episode high resolution voc sampling was performed in mp 21d following the same methodology adopted for mp 19d lima et al 2012 lithology and fractures were logged in detail and matrix sampling positions were determined according to absence existence of natural fractures and lithology changes fig 2 rock matrix sampling and field processing methods are described in detail by sterling et al 2005 and lima et al 2012 and summarized here rock matrix samples 5 cm in length were removed from the core using a hammer and clean chisel and split in half along the axis of the core one half of the sample was processed for voc extraction and analysis by disaggregating it using a hydraulic crusher and immediately preserving the crushed rock in purge and trap grade methanol in 40 ml volatile organic analysis voa bottles with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe lined septa with screw caps the half of the sample for dna extraction and analysis was wrapped tightly in a clean piece of aluminum foil followed by clear plastic wrap and plastic paraffin film and then sealed in a plastic zip top bag the rock voc samples and rock dna samples were shipped on ice to stone environmental laboratory montpelier vt and the university of guelph respectively for extraction and analysis vocs were extracted using a shake flask method dincutoiu et al 2003 aliquots of the methanol were then analyzed for 36 vocs using gas chromatography mass spectrometry techniques following the epa method sw8260b us epa 1996 the resulting concentrations were validated using a comprehensive qa qc procedure through application of a modified epa validation process us epa 1999 2 3 dna extraction end point pcr and dgge on 16s rrna genes in rock matrix samples sample handling and dna extraction procedure from selected rock matrix samples from mp 21d were done according to methodology previously detailed for mp 19d lima et al 2012 end point pcr assays targeted 16s rrna gene regions using published protocols for dehalococcoides ballerstedt et al 2004 dehalobacter grostern and edwards 2006 sulfurospirillum duhamel and edwards 2006 and geobacter duhamel and edwards 2006 due to the low biomass expected in most of the rock matrix samples a nested pcr strategy was adopted for all pcr amplifications loffler et al 2000 lima et al 2012 reaction volumes were 20 μl end point pcr or 25 μl pcr dgge archaea was detected with universal primers 1af 1100ar embley et al 1992 but pcr dgge for archaea was not performed success of pcr was verified in agarose gels stained with 1 ethidium bromide dgge fingerprints were obtained from 25 dna samples extracted from mp 21d lone rock fm rock matrix samples using primers that amplify the hypervariable region v3 of the 16s rdna gene muyzer et al 1993 duhamel and edwards 2006 all visible dgge bands were excised re amplified and sent for sequencing at the genomics facility at the university of guelph following procedure detailed elsewhere lima et al 2012 sequences were checked for closest matches using blast http blast ncbi nlm nih gov and only similarities 95 were considered for positive identifications to genus pcr dgge with band sequencing obtained with this methodology yields dna fragments of maximum 193 base pairs which does not always allow for resolution to species level van stempvoort et al 2009 population diversity indices were obtained for microbial communities in each sample dgge fingerprint by calculating shannon s index of general diversity h σ n i n log n i n these diversity indices are a function of the peak height of each individual band n i the sum of peak heights of all bands n and the total number of bands s in a track sample peak height and number of bands in each track were determined from densitometry curves generated with gene tools v 4 01 software syngene cambridge uk in which band intensity is translated by a peak in the curve minimum peak height was taken as 1 of the tallest band in the sample t tests were performed to determine if differences in h d and j between the two rock cores were statistically significant p 01 although the use of diversity indices with dgge has been previously contested bent et al 2007 the application of such methodology in the present study is justified as the objective was to have a comparative measure of diversity not an absolute measure smith et al 2010 cluster analyses of dna fingerprints in eubacterial communities represented by the densitometry curves were performed with the gene directory v 2 01a software syngene cambridge uk using jacquard similarity coefficient unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean upgma and relative band positions with tolerance of 1 2 4 groundwater sampling two high resolution westbay multilevel systems with an average of 4 monitoring zones per 10 m were installed in the shallow and deep coreholes at mp 19 and mp 21 locations to allow for depth discrete measurements of hydraulic head and collection of groundwater samples meyer et al 2014 meyer et al 2016 each monitoring interval is isolated using water inflatable packers and a detailed description of the design and installation of these multilevel systems is provided elsewhere meyer et al 2014 meyer et al 2016 although groundwater was collected from the shallow and deep multilevel systems at both locations the focus of this investigation is the lone rock fm sandstone between 45 and 56 m bgs which is only monitored by the shallow system at each location the mp 19s and mp 21s multilevel systems include 16 and 15 monitoring zones respectively westbay multilevel systems were sampled using a downhole tool referred to as a westbay mosdax sampler probe and evacuated stainless steel canisters attached in line to the probe during sampling the probe and canisters are lowered down the multilevel system on a wireline using a winch and aligned with the port of the monitoring zone targeted for groundwater sampling a control box at the surface is used to seat and connect the probe into the port allowing the ambient groundwater outside the westbay casing to be accessed for formation fluid pressure measurements and groundwater sampling once the probe is seated the control box is used to open a valve connecting the probe to the attached evacuated canisters the difference in pressure between the groundwater at depth and the evacuated canisters causes groundwater to pass through the port flow through the sampler probe and collect in the attached canisters once the canisters are filled as indicated by the pressure read out on the control box the valve is closed and the probe and canisters are brought to surface using the winch once at surface the groundwater in the containers is decanted into appropriate laboratory containers for the purposes of better understanding redox conditions groundwater samples were collected for quantitation of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon fe2 mn2 no3 and so4 2 from the mp 19s and mp 21s multilevel systems groundwater samples were collected from 6 of the 16 monitoring zones in mp 19s and 7 of the 15 monitoring zones in mp 21s inorganic cation samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm filter placed in 250 ml high density polyethylene hdpe sample bottles preserved to a ph 2 using 35 trace metal grade nitric acid samples for inorganic anions and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon were collected in 250 ml hdpe sample bottles both sets of samples were shipped on ice to sgs analytical inc lakefield on canada for analysis analysis for no3 and so4 2 were done using high performance liquid chromatography following a modified epa method 300 1 for fe2 and mn2 using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry following a modified niosh 7300 epa method 200 7 u s epa 1994 and method 3120 american public health association 2005 and for dissolved inorganic carbon using a skalar colorimetric technique and method 5310c american public health association 2005 groundwater samples for the analysis of dissolved gases were collected from all monitoring zones in both mp 19s and mp 21s and shipped on ice in 40 ml voa bottles with no headspace to the groundwater laboratory at the university of waterloo ontario canada ethene ethane ethyne and methane concentrations were determined using gas chromatography and a flame ionization detector prevailing redox conditions were determined for each monitoring zone using concentrations of inorganic ions and methane based on published recommendations chapelle et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 voc concentration in rock matrix voc concentrations were validated and results were qualified according to 4 categories fig 3 i quantifiable results above the limit of quantitation loq ii detected but not quantifiable mdl and loq iii flagged due to detects in the associated field blank and iv not detected mdl high quality detectable results excluding field blank flagged samples were used to calculate the total voc tvoc concentration μg g wet rock and contaminant composition expressed as mole percent for each sample only 10 of the 31 samples collected from the lone rock fm at the mp 21d location had high quality detectable contaminant concentrations for only five analytes 1 1 1 tca 1 2 dca 1 1 dce cis 1 2 dce and carbon tetrachloride fig 3 this is in contrast to the mp 19d location where 28 of the 32 rock voc samples collected from the lone rock fm had high quality detectable concentrations of 17 analytes including chlorinated aliphatic parent and daughter compounds aromatics and ketones fig 4 although the variety of contaminants differs between mp 19 and mp 21 the broad trends in the vertical distribution of contaminants within the bedrock are similar at both locations the peak concentration is located within the lone rock fm at mp 21 220 6 m amsl supplementary information fig s1 and mp 19 222 5 m amsl lima et al 2012 and the peaks in both locations are associated with the same stratigraphic feature the top of a maximum flooding interval meyer et al 2016 concentrations above the lone rock fm are typically at least 1 order of magnitude less than those observed in the lone rock formation and concentrations below the lone rock fm are generally non detect at both mp 21 supplementary information fig s1 and mp 19 lima et al 2012 indicating that the majority of the contaminant mass occurs in the lone rock fm matrix samples collected beneath the lone rock fm at both locations serve as background control on the molecular biology methods at both the mp 21 supplementary information fig s1 and mp 19 lima et al 2012 locations there are only sporadic detections of dna associated with dechlorinating bacteria beneath the lone rock fm 3 2 microbial community in mp 21 compared to mp 19 all sequenced bands from dgge gels of mp 21d fig 3 resulted in matches closest to aerobic microorganisms while mp 19d fig 4 had both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms lima et al 2012 redox conditions in the rock matrix have not been evaluated directly at the site although the fracture groundwater is not necessarily in equilibrium with the porewater in the rock matrix it does provide insight into the general hydrochemistry within the plume therefore groundwater samples collected from wells which are most representative of the fracture water are used to constrain the general redox conditions throughout the plume for example previous investigations at the site using groundwater hydrochemistry data from nearby conventional monitoring wells screened over the full lone rock fm indicated that mp 19d is within a mildly anaerobic zone while mp 21d is located where aerobic conditions dominate fig 1 miao 2008 these redox conditions were confirmed in the current study with the newly installed depth discrete groundwater samples obtained from multilevel systems installed in the mp 19s and mp 21s coreholes at the mp 19 location fig 5 the combination of non detect nitrate concentrations moderate concentrations of mn2 moderate to high concentrations of fe2 low sulphate concentrations consistent with background 1 4 16 mg l and quantifiable methane indicate the hydrochemistry varies between manganese iron and sulphate reduction there is one monitoring interval between 42 3 and 43 5 m bgs where the methane ch4 concentration of 1 2 mg l indicates stronger methanogenesis in that interval at the mp 21 location nitrate reducing conditions prevail in the lone rock fm in most of the monitoring zones with the exception of the zone between 38 9 and 39 5 m bgs where manganese reducing conditions were detected fig 5 hydrochemical conditions at the mp 19 location are more reducing and therefore are more conducive to reductive dechlorination than at the mp 21 location rock core voc concentrations corroborate this observation as more daughter products of degradation are detected at the mp 19 location compared to the mp 21 location figs 3 and 4 the fractions of organic carbon f oc in the lone rock fm are below mdl between 0 01 and 0 05 dry mass throughout the site austin 2005 lima et al 2012 if f oc is present below the mdl it could still serve as a reservoir of carbon to support degradation of the contaminants alternatively it is possible that the presence of toluene fig 4 in concentrations varying between quantifiable loq and detectable mdl and loq could drive aerobic co metabolic degradation of tce in the rock matrix hopkins and mccarty 1995 azizian et al 2007 and may stimulate growth of a more diverse microbial community in mp 19 compared to mp 21 determination of the exact carbon source or sources for degradation requires additional investigation similar to the results observed for mp 19d rock samples dehalococcoides sulfurospirillum and dehalobacter were also detected by end point pcr applied to rock matrix samples from mp 21d figs 3 and 4 positive detections for dehalococcoides also occurred in regions of the lone rock fm at the mp 21d location where no detectable levels of contaminants were present fig 3 suggesting past contamination at depths where contaminants are currently non detect sequences from mp 21d dgge excised bands resulted in a community that has among others delftia acidovorans stenotrophomonas and pseudomonas fig 3 fig s2 show all excised bands from these microbes only the genus pseudomonas is previously been shown to have affiliated members involved in dehalogenation of carbon tetrachloride ct criddle et al 1990 delftia species were found as part of a consortium degrading carbon tetrachloride in laboratory columns lima and sleep 2007 but to date organisms from this genus have not been characterized as capable of tce or 1 1 1 tca dechlorination a strain affiliated to the genus stenotrophomonas was isolated from a biofilm capable of btex removal lee et al 2002 however no btex was detected in samples from mp 21d fig 3 perhaps consistent with past occurrence but now completely attenuated at this position in the plume even though all sequenced dgge bands from mp 21d samples matched aerobic microorganisms the detection of dehalococcoides dehalobacter and sulfurospirillum using specific pcr primers demonstrate that the mp 21 microbial community has the ability to carry out dechlorination however the molecular method is dna based and cannot confirm if these microorganisms are actively performing dechlorination future studies using rna based methods could provide quantitative information linking presence to function additionally the presence of dechlorinators among the aerobic microorganisms in the mp 21d rock matrix is an interesting result worthy of further investigation two possible explanations include heterogeneity in redox conditions that occurs at a smaller scale than the rock samples and a recent change in redox conditions due to changes in the position of the plume that has not yet been fully reflected in the microbial population currently given the existence of only parent compounds in the lone rock fm in mp 21 anaerobic dechlorinating microorganisms are likely suffering inhibition due to the prevailing aerobic conditions 3 3 microbial diversity in mp 19 and mp 21 cluster analyses on microbial community compositions measured on the mp 21d and mp 19d cores from pcr dgge assays show that dna fingerprints fig 6a and b are highly heterogeneous even in samples spaced only a few centimeters apart for example at mp 21d 4 dna fingerprints between 43 12 and 43 17 m bgs have 40 similarity fig 6b the same is observed in samples from mp 19d in which 3 dna fingerprints taken side by side from 43 02 m bgs within a few centimeters distance from each other have similarity below 50 fig 6a this lack of similarity in the dna collected from closely spaced samples is consistent with the vertical variability observed between adjacent samples in the tvoc profiles for example at the mp 19 location the tvoc concentration increased by an order of magnitude from 0 021 to 0 23 μg g wet rock between 44 9 and 45 m bgs and the tvoc composition shifted from a nearly even mixture of cis 1 2 dce and tce to a mixture dominated by mek with lesser amounts of 1 1 dca and tce sharp changes in rock matrix concentrations with depth are to be expected due the combined influences of dnapl source zone heterogeneity variability in active fracture distribution and small scale differences in diffusion from the fractures into the rock matrix these small scale heterogeneities likely create micro scale redox zonation in the rock matrix kappler et al 2005 and differences in nutrient availability both of which can create micro environments where different microorganisms are able to survive exacerbated by low abundance of microbes overall although concerns have been raised that pcr dgge alone is not reliable for microbial community characterization it is possible to use these data for the purposes of determining microbial richness and diversity in a comparative manner one of the reasons for this claim is that in some cases a single band in a dgge gel could represent more than one organism for example several dehalococcoides spp with the same 16s rdna gene sequence or one organism could have multiple copies of the 16s rdna gene with different sequences li et al 2006 the number of bands and shannon diversity index are both significantly higher p 01 in the mp 19d samples than in those from mp 21d fig 7 suggesting that a larger number of different microorganisms are found in the matrix of the lone rock fm in mp 19d which is closer to the source zone compared to mp 21d which is located 920 m down gradient from mp 19d mp 19d has quantifiable amounts of toluene which is a labile source of carbon and electrons for microbial processes otherwise non existent in oligotrophic environments like the sandstones at the study site it is likely that the contaminant mass stored in the matrix in these rocks stimulates growth of a dechlorinating community that is responsible for formation of daughter products such as cis dce and dcm even though regression analyses did not reveal significant correlations p 05 and r2 0 5 in all cases results not shown between quantifiable concentrations of each individual contaminant and total vocs tvocs with diversity indices the significantly higher diversity detected in mp 19d compared to mp 21d indicates that the variability in contaminant composition at the mp 19d location could be associated with increased microbial diversity in initially oligotrophic sedimentary rocks 4 conclusions 1 dechlorinating microorganisms were detected in samples from mp 21 confirming what was obtained at mid plume mp 19 demonstrating that a diverse microbial community capable of contaminant degradation may develop within the primary pore space of sedimentary rocks where the permeability is low but mass storage is high compared to that provided by secondary porosity fractures 2 microbial diversity obtained from pcr dgge was significantly higher in samples closer to the source zone compared to samples farther from the source zone suggesting that in oligotrophic rock matrix the presence of a broad mixture of contaminants stimulates microbial growth and different redox and hydrochemical conditions 3 high resolution spatial sampling for contaminant concentrations and microbial dna assessment shows the inter dependence of contaminant concentrations and composition groundwater hydrochemistry and microbial community diversity hence assessment of natural attenuation in sedimentary rock aquifers and prediction of future plume conditions benefits from evaluation of hydrochemical contaminant and microbial community variability at different positions within the plume as well as between fracture and matrix porosities

1635,dissolved phase contaminants transported by diffusion into the low permeability matrix of fractured sedimentary rock pose a challenge to groundwater cleanup efforts because this stored mass may persist even when the upgradient source zone is removed in this context if contaminant biodegradation takes place within the low permeability matrix plume persistence may be substantially reduced therefore it is important to characterize microbial communities within the low permeability rock matrix pores instead of only from groundwater samples which represent biomass from fast flowing fractures this research relies on depth discrete data from both core and groundwater samples collected from two locations representing a mid plume and plume front condition within an aged mixed organic contaminant plume in a sedimentary rock aquifer results from multiple analyte measurements on rock and groundwater indicate that biodegradation in the lower permeability matrix of fractured sedimentary rocks and the microbial consortia is spatially variable due to differences in hydrochemistry redox conditions and contaminant concentrations dechlorinating microorganisms were detected in the sandstone matrix at both locations but the detected microbial diversity calculated with pcr dgge was significantly higher in samples collected from the core located closer to the source zone where contaminant concentrations are higher and contaminant compositions more diverse compared to samples from the plume front location graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microbial diversity rock core groundwater chemistry chlorinated solvents fractured sedimentary rock natural attenuation 1 introduction in fractured sedimentary rocks dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl contaminants are preferentially transported through the fracture network and due to their density have the potential to penetrate deep into the subsurface as dnapl dissolves in fracture spaces the dissolved phase is transported by advection in the fractures and by diffusion into the adjacent low permeability yet porous rock matrix within a few years to decades after the dnapl spill most of the contaminant mass will be found in the matrix blocks as dissolved and sorbed phases rather than as dnapl in the fractures parker et al 1994 parker et al 2012 this mass stored in the low permeability rock matrix poses a challenge to cleanup efforts because most remedial technologies cannot directly access or quickly deliver amendments to the diffusion controlled zones e g pump and treat surfactants or in situ chemical oxidation reduction furthermore remedial technologies focused on reduction of contaminant mass in the groundwater of the high permeability fracture network are ineffective because back diffusion driven by higher contaminant concentrations in the matrix than in the fractures continues to contribute contaminants to the fracture groundwater resulting in long term plume persistence liu and ball 2002 lu et al 2006 parker et al 2010 seyedabbasi et al 2012 adamson et al 2015 in this context if potential for contaminant biodegradation exists within the low permeability matrix of fractured sedimentary rocks the contaminant mass stored in the matrix would decline reducing plume persistence by back diffusion fluxes west and kueper 2010 lima et al 2012 most studies on contaminant biodegradation in fractured sedimentary bedrocks have relied only on microbial characterization of the biomass suspended in groundwater mostly drawn from highly conductive fractures nativ et al 1999

reactive zone in which fatty acids organic matter electron donors i e h2 and electron acceptors diffuse out of organic rich aquitards and sustain the biodegradation activities of microorganisms on the aquifer side of the interface mcmahon 2001 van stempvoort et al 2009 mcmahon and chapelle 1991 krumholz et al 1997 evidence that biodegraders grow inside pores of clay aquitards and also rock matrices has been found in laboratory and in field cases takeuchi et al 2011 lima and sleep 2007 scheutz et al 2010 lima et al 2012 in all these cases microorganisms responsible for dechlorination were found at distances away from the aquifer aquitard interface varying from centimeters up to 1 m in one case higher numbers of dehalococcoides species and h2 producing bacteria were found in the aquitard than in aquifer samples takeuchi et al 2011 from these results it is reasonable to hypothesize that the interface between the fractures and rock matrix and rock matrix itself with its large storage volume for water and contaminants would be similarly active in terms of biodegradation characterization of the microbial community in rock core samples is an important step toward understanding potential contaminant biodegradation processes in the matrix of fractured sedimentary rocks it is noteworthy that matrix pore sizes in sandstones are typically larger than 10 μm and pore throats are generally 2 μm they may be smaller than 2 μm in tight sandstones whereas shale pore throat sizes are smaller than 0 1 μm nelson 2009 based on these typical pore and pore throat sizes some sandstone matrix pores are large enough to harbor microbial growth gregory et al 2014 there is evidence that viable cells can exist in these rock matrices fredrickson et al 1997 additionally dechlorinating microorganisms were detected in sandstone samples collected as part of a previous investigation at the site presented here lima et al 2012 however growth of microorganisms capable of biodegradation is not only a function of rock matrix pore sizes but also of nutrient availability especially in oligotrophic environments the presence of appropriate electron acceptors and donors and the flux of metabolic products depending on the mineralogy the rock itself may be a source of inorganic electron acceptors such as mg ii fe iii and sulphate but if natural organic carbon content is very low or absent the indigenous biomass may not develop to detectable levels without laboratory cultivation in such cases the presence of mixed organic contaminants including aromatics and aliphatic chemicals may increase community diversity compared to that of the indigenous community this hypothesis opposes what is expected in unconsolidated media in which stresses due to contaminants decreases microbial diversity in soils and sediments compared to pristine conditions kozdroj and van elsas 2001 becker et al 2006 joynt et al 2006 if soils and sediments are nutrient rich before contamination they are able to support a rich and diverse indigenous microbial community decreased diversity resulting from contamination is a consequence of community specialization some microorganisms die because of the poisoning effects of the contaminants causing the microbial community to transition toward one that is able to withstand contaminants and even use them in their metabolic pathways however little is known about how contaminants affect microbial communities in oligotrophic and fractured sedimentary rocks the primary objective of this study is to determine how varying contaminant concentrations and compositions impact the microbial community structures and diversity in two rock cores obtained from an oligotrophic flat lying sandstone dolostone sequence contaminated many decades ago with chlorinated solvents ketones and aromatics therefore continuous cores were collected in 2008 from two locations along the centerline of an established groundwater plume where contaminant conditions were known to differ locations mp 19d and mp 21d are located about 0 75 and 1 6 km downgradient of the persistent dnapl source respectively dna was extracted from numerous depth discrete rock samples representing the low permeability matrices from both core locations population diversity was determined by pcr dgge for the hypervariable region v3 of the 16s rdna gene of bacteria pcr dgge was chosen for this study because previous studies have shown dgge can predict major microbial groups li et al 2006 liu et al 2009 although pcr dgge underestimates the overall microbial diversity lee et al 2010 it is still a valid methodology to investigate major players in the microbial community when applied to a large number of samples because it offers a good compromise between the number of samples processed and the information obtained forney et al 2004 pcr dgge was the microbiology tool used in this study because at the time 2008 it was a useful tool for investigating the depth discrete spatial variability of community fingerprints for the volatile organic compound voc contaminated lone rock formation fm sandstone based on high resolution sampling of continuous rock cores lima et al 2012 however due to the limitations mentioned above the species richness obtained reflects only the most abundant microorganisms 1 of the total communities the dechlorinating community of microorganisms in the low permeability matrix of the lone rock sandstones along the mp 19d core was previously characterized lima et al 2012 and these results are compared with those from the mp 21d core located farther down gradient from the persistent dnapl source zone in the same lithostratigraphic unit but where contaminant concentrations and hydrochemical conditions in the groundwater are different 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and contaminant history the study site is located in dane county wisconsin and is underlain by unconsolidated pleistocene glacial deposits over cambrian ordovician sandstones and dolostones meyer et al 2014 meyer et al 2016 groundwater flow is primarily horizontal in many of the hydrogeologic units delineated at the site due to their large bulk horizontal hydraulic conductivities and lateral extent meyer et al 2008 between 1950 and 1970 contaminants were released into the subsurface resulting in an accumulation of dnapl in the lone rock fm sandstone between 45 and 56 m bgs referred to as the source zone and subsequent development of a dissolved phase plume extending up to 2 8 km downgradient in the same sandstone hsi geotrans 1999 geotrans 2003 the main contaminants in the dnapl are tetrachloroethene pce trichloroethene tce 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca btex benzene toluene ethyl benzene and xylenes ketones chloromethanes and minor amounts of chlorofluorocarbon compounds cfcs hsi geotrans 1999 fig 1 shows a map indicating the dnapl source zone extent of the dissolved phase plume migrating in the lone rock fm sandstones prior to initiating pump and treat for hydraulic capture the conventional well monitoring network multilevel systems and the mp 19d and mp 21d corehole multilevel system locations used in this study fig 1 also shows the location of four pump and treat system wells operating for four years prior to the mp 19d and mp 21d coring done for this study these locations were selected within mp 19 and down gradient mp 21 of the pump and treat system capture zone where the contaminant concentrations and fluxes would be much lower at the mp 21d location compared to the upgradient mp 19d location 2 2 rock core sampling rock coring procedures followed the discrete fracture network dfn approach and framework developed by parker et al 2012 the dfn approach is applied to fractured rock sites to develop a site specific conceptual model in which various characterization methods are deployed in order to identify the key processes affecting plume behaviour and due to the dual porosity characteristics requires a wide variety of data sets from both the borehole and cores to adequately determine the spatial variability of the fracture network controlling fluid flow and role of low permeability zones on mass storage and reactions parker et al 2012 the datasets include lithology fracture logs and rock core voc concentrations plus geophysical and hydraulic information collected from open coreholes natural gamma resistivity acoustic televiewer depth discrete horizontal hydraulic conductivity etc these datasets are then used to design the position and length of monitoring intervals in high resolution westbay multilevel systems that provide temporal data at the site rock cores were obtained from two locations mp 19 and mp 21 fig 1 the mp 19 and mp 21 locations both included two one shallow s and one deep d continuously cored holes to minimize downward mobilization of contaminants the coring methods were described previously by lima et al 2012 rock cores from mp 19s and mp 21s were not sampled for voc concentrations because the depths for these two cored holes overlapped with mp 19d and mp 21d cores obtained in the same field episode high resolution voc sampling was performed in mp 21d following the same methodology adopted for mp 19d lima et al 2012 lithology and fractures were logged in detail and matrix sampling positions were determined according to absence existence of natural fractures and lithology changes fig 2 rock matrix sampling and field processing methods are described in detail by sterling et al 2005 and lima et al 2012 and summarized here rock matrix samples 5 cm in length were removed from the core using a hammer and clean chisel and split in half along the axis of the core one half of the sample was processed for voc extraction and analysis by disaggregating it using a hydraulic crusher and immediately preserving the crushed rock in purge and trap grade methanol in 40 ml volatile organic analysis voa bottles with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe lined septa with screw caps the half of the sample for dna extraction and analysis was wrapped tightly in a clean piece of aluminum foil followed by clear plastic wrap and plastic paraffin film and then sealed in a plastic zip top bag the rock voc samples and rock dna samples were shipped on ice to stone environmental laboratory montpelier vt and the university of guelph respectively for extraction and analysis vocs were extracted using a shake flask method dincutoiu et al 2003 aliquots of the methanol were then analyzed for 36 vocs using gas chromatography mass spectrometry techniques following the epa method sw8260b us epa 1996 the resulting concentrations were validated using a comprehensive qa qc procedure through application of a modified epa validation process us epa 1999 2 3 dna extraction end point pcr and dgge on 16s rrna genes in rock matrix samples sample handling and dna extraction procedure from selected rock matrix samples from mp 21d were done according to methodology previously detailed for mp 19d lima et al 2012 end point pcr assays targeted 16s rrna gene regions using published protocols for dehalococcoides ballerstedt et al 2004 dehalobacter grostern and edwards 2006 sulfurospirillum duhamel and edwards 2006 and geobacter duhamel and edwards 2006 due to the low biomass expected in most of the rock matrix samples a nested pcr strategy was adopted for all pcr amplifications loffler et al 2000 lima et al 2012 reaction volumes were 20 μl end point pcr or 25 μl pcr dgge archaea was detected with universal primers 1af 1100ar embley et al 1992 but pcr dgge for archaea was not performed success of pcr was verified in agarose gels stained with 1 ethidium bromide dgge fingerprints were obtained from 25 dna samples extracted from mp 21d lone rock fm rock matrix samples using primers that amplify the hypervariable region v3 of the 16s rdna gene muyzer et al 1993 duhamel and edwards 2006 all visible dgge bands were excised re amplified and sent for sequencing at the genomics facility at the university of guelph following procedure detailed elsewhere lima et al 2012 sequences were checked for closest matches using blast http blast ncbi nlm nih gov and only similarities 95 were considered for positive identifications to genus pcr dgge with band sequencing obtained with this methodology yields dna fragments of maximum 193 base pairs which does not always allow for resolution to species level van stempvoort et al 2009 population diversity indices were obtained for microbial communities in each sample dgge fingerprint by calculating shannon s index of general diversity h σ n i n log n i n these diversity indices are a function of the peak height of each individual band n i the sum of peak heights of all bands n and the total number of bands s in a track sample peak height and number of bands in each track were determined from densitometry curves generated with gene tools v 4 01 software syngene cambridge uk in which band intensity is translated by a peak in the curve minimum peak height was taken as 1 of the tallest band in the sample t tests were performed to determine if differences in h d and j between the two rock cores were statistically significant p 01 although the use of diversity indices with dgge has been previously contested bent et al 2007 the application of such methodology in the present study is justified as the objective was to have a comparative measure of diversity not an absolute measure smith et al 2010 cluster analyses of dna fingerprints in eubacterial communities represented by the densitometry curves were performed with the gene directory v 2 01a software syngene cambridge uk using jacquard similarity coefficient unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean upgma and relative band positions with tolerance of 1 2 4 groundwater sampling two high resolution westbay multilevel systems with an average of 4 monitoring zones per 10 m were installed in the shallow and deep coreholes at mp 19 and mp 21 locations to allow for depth discrete measurements of hydraulic head and collection of groundwater samples meyer et al 2014 meyer et al 2016 each monitoring interval is isolated using water inflatable packers and a detailed description of the design and installation of these multilevel systems is provided elsewhere meyer et al 2014 meyer et al 2016 although groundwater was collected from the shallow and deep multilevel systems at both locations the focus of this investigation is the lone rock fm sandstone between 45 and 56 m bgs which is only monitored by the shallow system at each location the mp 19s and mp 21s multilevel systems include 16 and 15 monitoring zones respectively westbay multilevel systems were sampled using a downhole tool referred to as a westbay mosdax sampler probe and evacuated stainless steel canisters attached in line to the probe during sampling the probe and canisters are lowered down the multilevel system on a wireline using a winch and aligned with the port of the monitoring zone targeted for groundwater sampling a control box at the surface is used to seat and connect the probe into the port allowing the ambient groundwater outside the westbay casing to be accessed for formation fluid pressure measurements and groundwater sampling once the probe is seated the control box is used to open a valve connecting the probe to the attached evacuated canisters the difference in pressure between the groundwater at depth and the evacuated canisters causes groundwater to pass through the port flow through the sampler probe and collect in the attached canisters once the canisters are filled as indicated by the pressure read out on the control box the valve is closed and the probe and canisters are brought to surface using the winch once at surface the groundwater in the containers is decanted into appropriate laboratory containers for the purposes of better understanding redox conditions groundwater samples were collected for quantitation of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon fe2 mn2 no3 and so4 2 from the mp 19s and mp 21s multilevel systems groundwater samples were collected from 6 of the 16 monitoring zones in mp 19s and 7 of the 15 monitoring zones in mp 21s inorganic cation samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm filter placed in 250 ml high density polyethylene hdpe sample bottles preserved to a ph 2 using 35 trace metal grade nitric acid samples for inorganic anions and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon were collected in 250 ml hdpe sample bottles both sets of samples were shipped on ice to sgs analytical inc lakefield on canada for analysis analysis for no3 and so4 2 were done using high performance liquid chromatography following a modified epa method 300 1 for fe2 and mn2 using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry following a modified niosh 7300 epa method 200 7 u s epa 1994 and method 3120 american public health association 2005 and for dissolved inorganic carbon using a skalar colorimetric technique and method 5310c american public health association 2005 groundwater samples for the analysis of dissolved gases were collected from all monitoring zones in both mp 19s and mp 21s and shipped on ice in 40 ml voa bottles with no headspace to the groundwater laboratory at the university of waterloo ontario canada ethene ethane ethyne and methane concentrations were determined using gas chromatography and a flame ionization detector prevailing redox conditions were determined for each monitoring zone using concentrations of inorganic ions and methane based on published recommendations chapelle et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 voc concentration in rock matrix voc concentrations were validated and results were qualified according to 4 categories fig 3 i quantifiable results above the limit of quantitation loq ii detected but not quantifiable mdl and loq iii flagged due to detects in the associated field blank and iv not detected mdl high quality detectable results excluding field blank flagged samples were used to calculate the total voc tvoc concentration μg g wet rock and contaminant composition expressed as mole percent for each sample only 10 of the 31 samples collected from the lone rock fm at the mp 21d location had high quality detectable contaminant concentrations for only five analytes 1 1 1 tca 1 2 dca 1 1 dce cis 1 2 dce and carbon tetrachloride fig 3 this is in contrast to the mp 19d location where 28 of the 32 rock voc samples collected from the lone rock fm had high quality detectable concentrations of 17 analytes including chlorinated aliphatic parent and daughter compounds aromatics and ketones fig 4 although the variety of contaminants differs between mp 19 and mp 21 the broad trends in the vertical distribution of contaminants within the bedrock are similar at both locations the peak concentration is located within the lone rock fm at mp 21 220 6 m amsl supplementary information fig s1 and mp 19 222 5 m amsl lima et al 2012 and the peaks in both locations are associated with the same stratigraphic feature the top of a maximum flooding interval meyer et al 2016 concentrations above the lone rock fm are typically at least 1 order of magnitude less than those observed in the lone rock formation and concentrations below the lone rock fm are generally non detect at both mp 21 supplementary information fig s1 and mp 19 lima et al 2012 indicating that the majority of the contaminant mass occurs in the lone rock fm matrix samples collected beneath the lone rock fm at both locations serve as background control on the molecular biology methods at both the mp 21 supplementary information fig s1 and mp 19 lima et al 2012 locations there are only sporadic detections of dna associated with dechlorinating bacteria beneath the lone rock fm 3 2 microbial community in mp 21 compared to mp 19 all sequenced bands from dgge gels of mp 21d fig 3 resulted in matches closest to aerobic microorganisms while mp 19d fig 4 had both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms lima et al 2012 redox conditions in the rock matrix have not been evaluated directly at the site although the fracture groundwater is not necessarily in equilibrium with the porewater in the rock matrix it does provide insight into the general hydrochemistry within the plume therefore groundwater samples collected from wells which are most representative of the fracture water are used to constrain the general redox conditions throughout the plume for example previous investigations at the site using groundwater hydrochemistry data from nearby conventional monitoring wells screened over the full lone rock fm indicated that mp 19d is within a mildly anaerobic zone while mp 21d is located where aerobic conditions dominate fig 1 miao 2008 these redox conditions were confirmed in the current study with the newly installed depth discrete groundwater samples obtained from multilevel systems installed in the mp 19s and mp 21s coreholes at the mp 19 location fig 5 the combination of non detect nitrate concentrations moderate concentrations of mn2 moderate to high concentrations of fe2 low sulphate concentrations consistent with background 1 4 16 mg l and quantifiable methane indicate the hydrochemistry varies between manganese iron and sulphate reduction there is one monitoring interval between 42 3 and 43 5 m bgs where the methane ch4 concentration of 1 2 mg l indicates stronger methanogenesis in that interval at the mp 21 location nitrate reducing conditions prevail in the lone rock fm in most of the monitoring zones with the exception of the zone between 38 9 and 39 5 m bgs where manganese reducing conditions were detected fig 5 hydrochemical conditions at the mp 19 location are more reducing and therefore are more conducive to reductive dechlorination than at the mp 21 location rock core voc concentrations corroborate this observation as more daughter products of degradation are detected at the mp 19 location compared to the mp 21 location figs 3 and 4 the fractions of organic carbon f oc in the lone rock fm are below mdl between 0 01 and 0 05 dry mass throughout the site austin 2005 lima et al 2012 if f oc is present below the mdl it could still serve as a reservoir of carbon to support degradation of the contaminants alternatively it is possible that the presence of toluene fig 4 in concentrations varying between quantifiable loq and detectable mdl and loq could drive aerobic co metabolic degradation of tce in the rock matrix hopkins and mccarty 1995 azizian et al 2007 and may stimulate growth of a more diverse microbial community in mp 19 compared to mp 21 determination of the exact carbon source or sources for degradation requires additional investigation similar to the results observed for mp 19d rock samples dehalococcoides sulfurospirillum and dehalobacter were also detected by end point pcr applied to rock matrix samples from mp 21d figs 3 and 4 positive detections for dehalococcoides also occurred in regions of the lone rock fm at the mp 21d location where no detectable levels of contaminants were present fig 3 suggesting past contamination at depths where contaminants are currently non detect sequences from mp 21d dgge excised bands resulted in a community that has among others delftia acidovorans stenotrophomonas and pseudomonas fig 3 fig s2 show all excised bands from these microbes only the genus pseudomonas is previously been shown to have affiliated members involved in dehalogenation of carbon tetrachloride ct criddle et al 1990 delftia species were found as part of a consortium degrading carbon tetrachloride in laboratory columns lima and sleep 2007 but to date organisms from this genus have not been characterized as capable of tce or 1 1 1 tca dechlorination a strain affiliated to the genus stenotrophomonas was isolated from a biofilm capable of btex removal lee et al 2002 however no btex was detected in samples from mp 21d fig 3 perhaps consistent with past occurrence but now completely attenuated at this position in the plume even though all sequenced dgge bands from mp 21d samples matched aerobic microorganisms the detection of dehalococcoides dehalobacter and sulfurospirillum using specific pcr primers demonstrate that the mp 21 microbial community has the ability to carry out dechlorination however the molecular method is dna based and cannot confirm if these microorganisms are actively performing dechlorination future studies using rna based methods could provide quantitative information linking presence to function additionally the presence of dechlorinators among the aerobic microorganisms in the mp 21d rock matrix is an interesting result worthy of further investigation two possible explanations include heterogeneity in redox conditions that occurs at a smaller scale than the rock samples and a recent change in redox conditions due to changes in the position of the plume that has not yet been fully reflected in the microbial population currently given the existence of only parent compounds in the lone rock fm in mp 21 anaerobic dechlorinating microorganisms are likely suffering inhibition due to the prevailing aerobic conditions 3 3 microbial diversity in mp 19 and mp 21 cluster analyses on microbial community compositions measured on the mp 21d and mp 19d cores from pcr dgge assays show that dna fingerprints fig 6a and b are highly heterogeneous even in samples spaced only a few centimeters apart for example at mp 21d 4 dna fingerprints between 43 12 and 43 17 m bgs have 40 similarity fig 6b the same is observed in samples from mp 19d in which 3 dna fingerprints taken side by side from 43 02 m bgs within a few centimeters distance from each other have similarity below 50 fig 6a this lack of similarity in the dna collected from closely spaced samples is consistent with the vertical variability observed between adjacent samples in the tvoc profiles for example at the mp 19 location the tvoc concentration increased by an order of magnitude from 0 021 to 0 23 μg g wet rock between 44 9 and 45 m bgs and the tvoc composition shifted from a nearly even mixture of cis 1 2 dce and tce to a mixture dominated by mek with lesser amounts of 1 1 dca and tce sharp changes in rock matrix concentrations with depth are to be expected due the combined influences of dnapl source zone heterogeneity variability in active fracture distribution and small scale differences in diffusion from the fractures into the rock matrix these small scale heterogeneities likely create micro scale redox zonation in the rock matrix kappler et al 2005 and differences in nutrient availability both of which can create micro environments where different microorganisms are able to survive exacerbated by low abundance of microbes overall although concerns have been raised that pcr dgge alone is not reliable for microbial community characterization it is possible to use these data for the purposes of determining microbial richness and diversity in a comparative manner one of the reasons for this claim is that in some cases a single band in a dgge gel could represent more than one organism for example several dehalococcoides spp with the same 16s rdna gene sequence or one organism could have multiple copies of the 16s rdna gene with different sequences li et al 2006 the number of bands and shannon diversity index are both significantly higher p 01 in the mp 19d samples than in those from mp 21d fig 7 suggesting that a larger number of different microorganisms are found in the matrix of the lone rock fm in mp 19d which is closer to the source zone compared to mp 21d which is located 920 m down gradient from mp 19d mp 19d has quantifiable amounts of toluene which is a labile source of carbon and electrons for microbial processes otherwise non existent in oligotrophic environments like the sandstones at the study site it is likely that the contaminant mass stored in the matrix in these rocks stimulates growth of a dechlorinating community that is responsible for formation of daughter products such as cis dce and dcm even though regression analyses did not reveal significant correlations p 05 and r2 0 5 in all cases results not shown between quantifiable concentrations of each individual contaminant and total vocs tvocs with diversity indices the significantly higher diversity detected in mp 19d compared to mp 21d indicates that the variability in contaminant composition at the mp 19d location could be associated with increased microbial diversity in initially oligotrophic sedimentary rocks 4 conclusions 1 dechlorinating microorganisms were detected in samples from mp 21 confirming what was obtained at mid plume mp 19 demonstrating that a diverse microbial community capable of contaminant degradation may develop within the primary pore space of sedimentary rocks where the permeability is low but mass storage is high compared to that provided by secondary porosity fractures 2 microbial diversity obtained from pcr dgge was significantly higher in samples closer to the source zone compared to samples farther from the source zone suggesting that in oligotrophic rock matrix the presence of a broad mixture of contaminants stimulates microbial growth and different redox and hydrochemical conditions 3 high resolution spatial sampling for contaminant concentrations and microbial dna assessment shows the inter dependence of contaminant concentrations and composition groundwater hydrochemistry and microbial community diversity hence assessment of natural attenuation in sedimentary rock aquifers and prediction of future plume conditions benefits from evaluation of hydrochemical contaminant and microbial community variability at different positions within the plume as well as between fracture and matrix porosities

1636,1 2 dibromoethane ethylene dibromide edb is a probable human carcinogen that was historically added to leaded gasoline as a scavenger to prevent the build up of lead oxide deposits in engines studies indicate that edb is present at thousands of past fuel spill sites above its stringent epa maximum contaminant level mcl of 0 05 μg l there are currently no proven in situ options to enhance edb degradation in groundwater to meet this requirement based on successful laboratory studies showing that ethane can be used as a primary substrate to stimulate the aerobic cometabolic biodegradation of edb to 0 015 μg l hatzinger et al 2015 a groundwater recirculation system was installed at the fs 12 edb plume on joint base cape cod jbcc ma to facilitate in situ treatment groundwater was taken from an existing extraction well amended with ethane oxygen and inorganic nutrients and then recharged into the aquifer upgradient of the extraction well creating an in situ reactive zone the concentrations of edb ethane oxygen and anions in groundwater were measured with time in a series of nested monitoring wells installed between the extraction and injection well edb concentrations in the six monitoring wells that were hydraulically well connected to the pumping system declined from 0 3 μg l the average concentration in the recirculation cell after 3 months of operation without amendment addition to 0 02 μg l during the 4 month amendment period meeting both the federal mcl and the more stringent massachusetts mcl 0 02 μg l the data indicate that cometabolic treatment is a promising in situ technology for edb and that low regulatory levels can be achieved with this biological approach keywords 1 2 dibromoethane edb ethane ethylene dibromide cometabolism biodegradation bioremediation groundwater recirculation 1 introduction 1 2 dibromoethane ethylene dibromide edb was historically added to leaded automobile fuels at 300 mg l and to aviation gasoline at 600 mg l to prevent the formation of lead deposits in internal combustion engines falta et al 2005 wilson et al 2008 the compound was also once widely applied as a soil fumigant and subsequently observed to be very persistent in soils being detected decades after last use steinberg et al 1987 pignatello et al 1990 based upon its potential adverse effects on several different mammalian organs and systems including the heart liver nervous system and kidneys as well as its probable human carcinogenicity the us environmental protection agency epa promulgated a maximum contaminant level mcl for edb in drinking water of 0 05 μg l in 1992 far lower than for nearly all other drinking water contaminants including common chlorinated solvents pcbs pesticides except dioxin heavy metals and gasoline derived organics epa 2018 edb was previously observed at concentrations exceeding its federal mcl at hundreds of underground storage tank sites ust in south carolina with a median concentration of 5 μg l and with 10 of locations having at least one well exceeding 200 μg l falta 2004 falta et al 2005 this is true despite the fact that its use was largely discontinued in the 1980s as leaded fuels were phased out if the data from south carolina are representative of the us as a whole then many thousands of ust sites alone are expected to have edb in groundwater exceeding the federal mcl however the most commonly employed analytical technique to detect volatile organic chemicals in groundwater gas chromatography mass spectrometry epa method 8260 has a detection limit for edb that is typically at least 50 fold greater than the mcl so the real prevalence of this compound in groundwater is unknown wilson et al 2008 where groundwater is a potential drinking water source epa method 504 1 which has a practical quantitation limit pql of 0 002 μg l can be used to detect edb down to relevant federal and state mcls edb is subject to abiotic degradation by hydrolysis vogel and reinhard 1986 koster van groos et al 2018 and via dehalogenation reactions catalyzed by various sulfide species including hydrogen sulfide and iron sulfide schwartzenbach et al 1985 wilson et al 2008 koster van groos et al 2018 the compound is also degraded by both anaerobic dehalogenation bower and mccarty 1985 belay and daniels 1987 peethambaram 2010 yu et al 2013 and aerobic cometabolism mediated by organisms utilizing ammonia vannelli et al 1990 phenol baek et al 2013 and a variety of short chain alkanes such as methane ethane propane and pentane hartzell et al 2001 mckeever et al 2012 danko et al 2012 hatzinger et al 2015 the strain mycobacterium sp strain gp1 has also been reported to grow on edb under aerobic conditions poelarends et al 1999 the apparent persistence of edb in soils and groundwater despite numerous laboratory reports of aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation likely has multiple causes including 1 limited bioavailability in soil matrices steinberg et al 1987 2 groundwater concentrations that may be below thresholds for microbial growth alexander 1999 falta 2004 and 3 absence of cometabolic substrates such as propane pentane and ammonia in most aerobic groundwater environments the physicochemical properties of edb including its high water solubility 4300 mg l low octanol water partitioning coefficient kow 58 and low henry s law constant 0 029 falta et al 2005 falta 2004 are also likely to play an important role in its long term persistence based on its physiochemical traits when gasoline with edb enters a groundwater aquifer the edb is expected to partition rapidly from the resulting non aqueous phase liquid napl to groundwater and to be transported ahead of many more hydrophobic fuel hydrocarbons thus while edb may undergo reductive dehalogenation or abiotic transformation in the fuel source area if rates of edb partitioning and transport with groundwater exceed degradation rates the compound is likely to form a large dilute plume downgradient of the spill at concentrations far above the mcl henderson et al 2009 multiple plumes of edb are currently undergoing ex situ treatment at joint base cape cod jbcc formerly called the massachusetts military reservation mmr on cape cod massachusetts usa afcee 2010 currently three pump and treat p t systems at the site remove edb from groundwater using granular activated carbon gac which is subsequently taken off site for reactivation some of these p t systems are expected to operate for decades similarly a new p t system has recently been installed at kirtland air force base new mexico usa to intercept a large dilute edb plume 1 2 km in length that has moved off base property from a past fueling station leak usace 2011 at present there are few in situ remediation options for treating low concentrations of edb in groundwater making p t systems the primary approach however these systems are expensive to build and often require operation for decades to meet remedial goals the objective of this research was to field test an in situ bioremediation approach for treating dilute edb in groundwater that consisted of a groundwater recirculation system amended with ethane oxygen and inorganic nutrients to promote in situ cometabolic treatment of edb this approach is based upon previous microcosm and enrichment culture studies indicating that indigenous bacteria in the regional aquifer are capable of biodegrading edb to 0 015 μg l during aerobic growth on ethane hatzinger et al 2015 the concentrations of edb ethane oxygen and anions in groundwater were measured with time in a series of nested monitoring wells installed between an operating extraction and injection well one of the novel and interesting aspects of this work is the application of cometabolic biodegradation to treat edb concentrations from 1 μg l to low ng l in a field setting this demonstration focused on the fs 12 plume that originated from an estimated 265 000 l fuel release that was originally discovered in 1972 see site map in supplementary data fig s1 source area remediation was initiated in october 1995 through the installation of an air sparging soil vapor extraction as sve system this system was shut down in february 1998 after achieving the soil cleanup goals however a large edb plume in groundwater resulted from this spill the edb plume is being treated with a groundwater extraction treatment and reinjection etr approach and is currently 500 m long reduced from 1200 m long in the 1990s the projected operational period for the etr system is expected to extend through at least 2034 afcee 2010 speim 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 site geology and hydrogeology jbcc is located over a sole source aquifer that provides drinking water for 200 000 year round and 500 000 seasonal residents of cape cod ma the aquifer under jbcc is referred to as the sagamore lens the demonstration site area fs 12 is characterized as a glacial outwash aquifer of quaternary age consisting of highly permeable sand and gravel with distinct discontinuous layers of finer silty sand silt and clay the shallower aquifer sediments generally consist of glaciofluvial coarse grained sand and gravel or nearshore glaciolacustrine fine to coarse sand and gravel with silt and clay the deepest sediments are generally basal till deposits underlain by crystalline bedrock of low permeability the coarse grained outwash deposits are typically about 60 m thick near the study area walter et al 2002 bedrock is located approximately 85 m below ground surface bgs and is considered relatively impermeable compared to the unconsolidated sediments groundwater is characterized by unconfined water table conditions within the saturated zone and the water table is located approximately 21 m bgs the depth of interest for this demonstration is associated with the edb plume and located between 50 m bgs and 70 m bgs within the subject depth interval soil borings indicated there are two distinct geological zones the more shallow zone is generally characterized by medium grained brown sand with traces of coarse sand silt and fine gravel while the deeper zone below 60 m bgs is characterized by less conductive grey fine grained sand with traces of silt the pilot test was intended to assess treatment of edb contamination in both the upper medium grained sand unit as well as the lower finer grained sand unit 2 2 aquifer amendments ethane oxygen and diammonium phosphate dap nh4 2hpo4 were added to the aquifer to promote growth of bacteria capable of degrading edb see next paragraph for concentrations added based on previous laboratory studies with site samples and an enrichment culture from this location hatzinger et al 2015 these studies showed that ethane and oxygen stimulated the biological degradation of edb and that concentrations of 0 015 μg l pql for edb in the laboratory studies could be achieved but only in the presence of inorganic nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus from dap presumably due to the oligotrophic nature of the cape cod aquifer in this region nutrients and oxygen alone did not stimulate edb biodegradation hatzinger et al 2015 in this case ethane was used as the primary carbon source electron donor for bacterial growth in the aquifer and oxygen as the electron acceptor dap was used to provide required inorganic n as nh4 and p as po4 3 for microbial growth in order to estimate field dosages the ratios of ethane oxygen and nitrogen for growth of ethane degrading bacteria were calculated the required molar ratio of ethane to oxygen o2 for complete oxidation of ethane c2h6 to carbon dioxide is 3 5 mols o2 to 1 mol c2h6 eq 1 if one incorporates microbial cell growth on a portion of the carbon from ethane assuming 40 of ethane utilized for cell growth and 60 for respiration then the molar ratio declines to 2 1 mols o2 to 1 mol c2h6 eq 2 cell biomass in eq 2 is represented by c5h7o2n which roughly represents the molar ratio of these elements in bacterial cells rittman and mccarty 2001 this equation also predicts the cellular requirement for n as 0 28 m nh4 per mol c2h6 when converted to a mg l basis the above stoichiometry suggests that the oxygen and ammonium requirement for bacteria to biodegrade 1 mg l of c2h6 is 2 2 mg l o2 3 7 mg l if biomass growth is not included and 0 17 mg l nh4 based on these assumptions the injection system was designed to provide 2 4 mg l of ethane gas and 8 16 mg l of o2 in the influent water with flexibility to modify concentrations based on performance and residual concentrations of o2 in the monitoring wells it should be noted that with time decay of biomass will potentially increase the oxygen demand in the aquifer and that cation exchange processes will result in abiotic losses of nh4 therefore stoichiometric measurements should be used only as a general guideline nutrients were added in small doses 2 3 times per week to ensure that the requirement for n and p which is not included in the equation are met p requirements for cells are 10 of that for n on a molar basis so dap provides the required amount of p as well as n 1 c 2 h 6 3 5 o 2 2co 2

was extracted from a single existing extraction well 90ew0019 and re injected into a single injection well 90iw0001 the design groundwater recirculation rate was 38 l per minute lpm the groundwater was taken from 90ew0019 typically pumping 450 lpm through a 2 5 cm id hose to a steel shipping container conex box used to house the mixing and injection systems where the water flow was passed through a bag filter to remove any particulate material the pressure from the extraction well was expected to be adequate for reinjection based on initial calculations but booster pumps were included in the system design in case the extraction well pressure was insufficient to provide the necessary recharge rate the groundwater flow was split into two lines one of which was amended with industrial oxygen gas air gas lakeville ma and the second of which received instrument grade ethane gas air gas 99 5 purity and dap reagent grade siedler chemical newark nj for inorganic nutrients oxygen gas was supplied by cylinder through a manifold system passed through a filter unit a mass flow controller and then added to groundwater using a static mixer as described in section 2 3 the desired concentration of oxygen in the influent water was between 8 and 16 mg l the design for ethane gas addition was basically the same as that for oxygen except that the gas storage was in a separate cage located at the other end of the conex box to allow adequate separation from oxygen cylinders the target concentration of ethane in the influent water was between 2 and 4 mg l a 570 l tank was placed within the conex box for addition of dap the nutrient solution was added to the water line carrying ethane gas 3 times per week in batch using a dosing pump controlled via a remote dial in system at a total water flow rate of 38 lpm and assuming an ethane addition rate of 3 mg l approximately 200 g of nh4 was calculated to be required on a weekly basis see eq 2 this weekly value was increased by 5 to 10 fold to make sure that microbial nutrients were provided in excess ammonia and nitrate were monitored in the demonstration plot and downgradient of the system to ensure that relevant regulatory levels were not exceeded after ethane nutrient and oxygen addition each water stream exited the conex box and passed through a 2 5 cm id hose in the buried carrier pipe to the injection well down the well and through an inflatable packer the packer was installed at 56 m bgs which was above both the upper and lower screen interval in well 90iw0001 see section 2 5 for well details a nitrogen cylinder which was stored in the cage with the oxygen cylinders was used to keep the packer inflated at 6 9 bar the power supply for the system was obtained from an existing adjacent building safety features within the conex box included a lower explosive limit lel meter designed to shut down the system and gas supply at 5 of the lel in case of an ethane or oxygen leak in the box an alarm condition would occur in this instance and an intrinsically safe fan would be activated to vent any gas from the conex box the ethane and oxygen cylinders also were fitted with flow control valves just after the manifold to shut off gas supply if flow rates exceed specific settings suggesting a possible leak in the gas supply system system shut downs activation of the ventilation fan in the conex box or any alarm condition activated an outgoing mobile phone call 2 4 well network the groundwater well network for this project included one extraction well one injection well and a series of nested performance monitoring wells placed between these two wells in the recirculation zone fig 1 one 10 cm diameter injection well 90iw0001 was installed 23 m north and hydraulically upgradient of existing extraction well 90ew0019 90iw0001 was constructed with two separate screened zones targeting the upper medium sand and deeper fine sand zones that contain dissolved phase edb in groundwater a packer could be placed between these zones to target the lower less conductive interval if necessary in addition two triple nested monitoring wells 90mw0207a b c and 90mw0208a b c were installed within the planned recirculation cell area between the extraction and injection well with monitoring screens at target elevations within both dominant geologic formations well nest 90 mw0208 was located 11 7 m hydraulically downgradient of 90iw0001 and well nest 90 mw0207 was 17 1 m downgradient of 90iw0001 an existing monitoring well cluster 90 mw0106 was also present within the monitoring well network two of these wells 90 mw0106 a c were 4 1 m downgradient of 90iw0001 and the other 90 mw0106 b was located 7 3 m from 90iw0001 three of the wells were screened either predominantly above 90mw0207c 90mw0208c or below 90mw0106a the primary zone of edb contamination and groundwater recirculation the scaled well plot layout fig s2 and well construction details table s1 are provided in the supplementary data 2 5 system operation during the first 3 months of the demonstration groundwater was recirculated in the demonstration plot i e pumped from the extraction well to the injection well but no amendments were added this allowed an assessment of changes in edb concentrations in the monitoring well network due to system operation i e movement and mixing of groundwater in the absence of ethane oxygen and nutrient addition one round of sampling was performed before system start up and three rounds were conducted during the recirculation phase see section 2 6 for sampling details during the next 4 months of operation ethane and oxygen were added to groundwater at initial target concentrations of 2 4 mg l and 8 16 mg l respectively and a system design flow rate of 38 lpm 19 lpm from the line feeding oxygen and 19 lpm from the line feeding ethane and nutrients inorganic nutrients were added in batch during this period five full groundwater sampling events were conducted during this phase and three events were conducted days 99 100 and 104 only for field parameters including do and orp anions bromide and dissolved gases ethane shortly after these compounds were initially added to the aquifer a sodium bromide tracer was added to the injection well between day 96 and day 100 to help evaluate the connectivity of each of the monitoring well screens to the system injection well a total of 25 kg of sodium bromide was mixed into 450 l of site groundwater approximately 360 l of the solution was added between the aforementioned days the fs 12 pumping system at jbcc was off for a period of time during this test so the flow in the recirculation cell was not continuous as planned the remaining bromide solution was added to the aquifer with the first batch of inorganic nutrients the bromide data could not be used to precisely estimate the rate of groundwater flow through the plot due to the intermittent nature of the addition and pumping within the plot however the bromide test was useful for determining the connectivity of each monitoring well screen interval to the injection well which was the primary purpose of the test 2 6 groundwater sample collection and analysis groundwater samples were collected utilizing low flow purging in accordance with epa low flow ground water sampling procedures puls and barcelona 1996 samples were obtained from each monitoring well using a dedicated submersible bladder pump and a flow through cell with a ysi field meter or equivalent to allow measurement of field geochemical parameters ph orp temperature specific conductivity and dissolved oxygen all field meters were calibrated once at the beginning of the day the submersible bladder pumps and tubing used to sample all wells were dedicated and therefore did not require decontamination before each sampling event groundwater elevation measurements were collected using an electronic water level indicator measurements were obtained from the top of casing and recorded to the nearest 0 3 cm groundwater samples were collected for the following analyses 1 edb epa method 504 1 testamerica savannah ga 2 anions including bromide nitrate nitrite orthophosphate sulfate and chloride epa method 300 0 aptim lawrenceville nj 3 dissolved alkane gases including ethane ethene propane and methane gas chromatography with flame

via field meter 3 results 3 1 groundwater recirculation and amendment addition the groundwater recirculation system was initially operated for 96 days without the addition of any amendments in order to establish a new baseline for edb in the test plot wells ethane and oxygen addition commenced on day 97 and day 98 respectively and addition of inorganic nutrients was initiated on day 119 the average total water flow through the system was 38 8 lpm which was within the planned operational range the groundwater flow in the line carrying ethane gas and nutrients declined slowly from around day 150 to day 180 from 21 lpm to 15 lpm and the lines were switched on day 183 to rebalance the flow mineral fouling e g precipitation of phosphate minerals or biofouling most likely contributed to the slow decline in flow over the duration of the study the system recirculated just under 12 million l of groundwater to the injection well fig 2 the ethane gas flow was set at 0 14 lpm throughout the addition period day 97 day 216 the oxygen flow was initially set at 0 5 lpm and then reduced to between 0 2 and 0 3 lpm after day 183 based on oxygen concentrations throughout the demonstration plot an inorganic nutrient solution consisting 0 017 kg l of dap was mixed in a tank in the conex box on day 119 approximately 280 l of the dap solution were added in 11 23 l batches between day 119 and day 163 a second more concentrated batch of dap 0 472 kg l was mixed on day 163 and 160 l of this solution were added between that date and shutdown on day 216 in general nutrients were added 3 times per week via remote system access 3 2 ethane ethane was continually added to the aquifer beginning on day 97 and served as a good hydraulic tracer during the initial weeks of addition before significant biodegradation was apparent ethane was detected at 1 mg l in 90mw0106c on day 99 2 days after addition began and stayed 1 mg l through day 124 fig 3 on day 124 27 days after addition began ethane was 2 3 mg l in the injection well 90iw0001 and was detected at 500 μg l in 90mw0106b 90mw0208a and 90mw0208b and at 180 μg l in 90mw0207a and 90mw0207b thus significant quantities of ethane were detected in both the upper brown medium sand and the deeper grey fine sand deposits the extraction well recirculation loop from 90ew0019 through the conex box had 68 μg l on day 124 so clearly groundwater from the injection well 90iw0001 had moved through the recirculation cell to the extraction well 90ew0019 a 23 m distance within 27 days giving a groundwater flow rate of at least 0 9 m day ethane was not detected in 90mw0106a or 90mw0207c a concentration of 13 μg l was detected in 90mw0208c on day 124 but not thereafter ethane concentrations declined significantly in many of the wells between day 124 and day 152 and then further by day 180 despite continuous addition to the injection well fig 3 all mws had 20 μg l most 5 μg l on day 180 and 209 the ethane concentration in the injection well 90iw0001 was 1080 μg l on day 180 and 1120 μg l on day 209 giving an average of 1100 μg l on both days the concentration in the closest monitoring well 90mw0106c was 4 μg l indicating that all ethane moving through the shallow brown sand was consumed between these wells which were located 4 15 m apart assuming an estimated groundwater flow rate of 0 9 m day the minimal rate of ethane consumption in this reactive zone was on the order of 160 μg l day 3 3 bromide bromide was added to the aquifer as a tracer beginning on day 96 and ending on day 100 but groundwater flow was unexpectedly interrupted during this time due to a power outage so that continuous addition was not possible thus the data do not allow an accurate prediction of groundwater residence time in the treatment plot during pumping conditions however bromide was detected in well 90mw0106c the closest monitoring well to the injection well at 33 mg l on day 99 sampling was not conducted on day 98 which indicates a groundwater flow rate in this region closest to the injection well during pumping of at least 1 4 m day fig 4 ethane was detected in this same well after only 2 days indicating a groundwater flow rate as high as 2 1 m day between the injection well and first monitoring well location see section 3 3 bromide was detected in all of the wells where ethane was observed with the highest concentrations occurring in 90mw0106c 90mw0106b and 90mw0207a at days 100 124 and 152 respectively bromide was not detected in 90mw0106a and was detected only in trace concentrations 0 3 mg l in both 90mw0207c and 90mw0208c which is consistent with the ethane and edb baseline data after pumping but prior to amendment addition for these wells see section 3 5 3 4 edb a complete initial round of groundwater sampling was conducted for the demonstration plot monitoring wells prior to recirculation and then on day 26 day 54 and day 82 after start up of the groundwater extraction reinjection system the edb concentration data from these four sampling events are provided in table 1 the initial edb concentration at the injection well 90iw0001 screened in both the shallower medium brown sand and the deeper grey fine sand fig 1 was 1 μg l during the first event well above the federal mcl 0 05 μg l and the more stringent massachusetts state mcl mmcl 0 02 μg l within the grey fine sand interval moving downgradient toward the extraction well 90ew0019 baseline edb concentrations were 5 0 μg l 90mw0106b 0 088 μg l 90mw0208a and 0 075 μg l 90mw0207a these concentrations decreased with proximity to the extraction well which had a concentration of 0 42 μg l during the initial pre design sampling event this well is an active pumping well in the fs 12 treatment system 450 lpm flow the shallower monitoring wells screened in the higher conductivity brown sand had concentrations of 0 140 μg l 90mw0106c 0 052 μg l 90mw0208b and 0 005 μg l 90mw0207b and 90mw0207c as with the deeper interval edb concentrations decreased in proximity to the extraction well at the conclusion of the three months of system operation without addition of ethane or inorganic nutrients i e recharging groundwater at 38 to 49 lpm from 90ew0019 to 90iw0001 the concentrations of edb in several of the monitoring wells stabilized at 0 3 μg l which was also the concentration in the recirculation loop table 1 operation of the system without amendments during this time interval was performed in order to establish new experimental baseline concentrations for edb in the monitoring wells edb concentrations did not increase significantly in two of the wells 90mw0207c and 90mw0208c each of which are screened in the shallow zone these wells appear to be poorly connected to the zone of influence of the recirculation system which is not unexpected based on their screen intervals see fig 1 and s1 the remaining wells 90mw0106a and 90mw0207b showed slow moderate increases in edb over the course of 3 months of pumping each reaching 0 16 μg l during this time these wells appear to be only partially connected to the flow field of the system resulting in the slow change in edb concentration in each with time these data are consistent with both the bromide and ethane data edb concentrations showed a significant decline in all of the wells that were hydraulically well connected to the pumping system after the gas and nutrient amendments were added to the groundwater fig 5a edb concentrations in wells 90mw0106c 90mw0208a 90mw0208b and 90mw0207a declined from 0 3 μg l at the final baseline round day 82 to 0 002 μg l pql by day 209 well 90mw0106b declined from 0 31 μg l to 0 014 μg l and 90mw0207b declined from 0 16 μg l to 0 0097 μg l during the same time interval thus edb concentrations in all of these wells were below the mmcl of 0 02 μg l within 4 months after beginning amendment addition among the wells that were less well connected to the system based on ethane and bromide distribution 90mw207c had very low edb concentrations throughout the study i e was not affected by the recirculation system edb in wells 90mw0106a and 90mw0208c increased slowly to 0 18 μg l and 0 16 μg l respectively on day 124 and then declined to 0 062 μg l and 0 093 μg l respectively at the end of the study fig 5b it is likely that the recirculation system moved some water with edb into the screen intervals of these wells trace bromide was detected in each subsequently as edb concentrations declined throughout the treatment area they declined accordingly but more slowly in these wells overall the recirculation system proved to be highly effective for treating edb in groundwater the edb concentration in the recycle loop through the conex box which is a groundwater taken from pumping well 90ew0019 also showed a steady decline during the period when inorganic nutrients ethane and oxygen were added to the injection well but not during the previous 3 months when these amendments were not added during the final sampling event this concentration had declined to 0 21 μg l from an average pre amendment concentration of 0 33 μg l only four months earlier a 36 reduction it is possible that this reduction reflects a natural decline based upon the ongoing pumping at the site however considering the short duration and timing of this decline it is more likely that the in situ treatment system reduced the total edb concentration in pumping well 90ew0019 which was pumping 450 lpm further analysis concerning the distribution and concentration profile of edb in the groundwater captured by 90ew0019 i e in the zone treated by the in situ remediation and that not within the zone of influence would be required to confirm this hypothesis 3 5 treatment efficiency and rate of edb biodegradation if one considers an in situ recirculation system such as this to follow plug flow behavior as has been suggested for similar in situ recirculation designs chu et al 2018 goltz and christ 2012 christ et al 1999 then it is possible to calculate a pseudo first order reaction rate and treatment efficiency for the system at optimal performance which in this case was during the period from day 180 to day 209 of recirculation and amendment addition the following formula can be used for this calculation 3 η 1 e kt where η is the treatment efficiency in a single pass t is the residence time and k is the rate constant christ et al 1999 goltz and christ 2012 on day 180 and day 209 complete degradation of edb occurred from 0 2 μg l in the injection well to 0 002 μg l in the closest monitoring well screened in the brown sand 90mw0106b the treatment efficiency over this interval can be estimated at 99 which can be assumed for η in that these wells are spaced 4 15 m apart with an estimated groundwater flow during the pumping phase of 1 4 to 2 1 m day based on relevant bromide and ethane data giving a t value of between 2 and 3 days the estimated k value during this operational period ranges from 1 5 to 2 3 day 1 or a half life of 0 3 to 0 5 days similarly for the deeper grey fine sand deposits edb was below detection 0 002 μg l in well 90mw208a on days 180 and 209 at an influent of 0 2 μg l this also provided a treatment efficiency of 99 and assuming a groundwater flow rate of 1 7 m day based upon ethane being detected in this well 11 6 m from the injection well within 7 days the estimated k value for this zone is 0 7 day 1 or a half life of 1 1 days 3 6 dissolved oxygen and inorganic nutrients the system provided enough oxygen to support the complete oxidation of ethane throughout the plot with concentrations generally exceeding 5 mg l and ranging to 20 mg l fig 6 the one exception was well 90mw0106a which generally had dissolved oxygen below 1 mg l while the amendments were added this is the deepest well in the treatment plot and also one of the wells that appeared to be poorly connected to the treatment system flow field based on ethane and bromide data ammonium and phosphate were generally near or below detection throughout the treatment plot the highest ammonium concentration detected was 0 7 mg l and the highest concentration of phosphate detected was 0 3 mg l nitrite and nitrate possible oxidation products of ammonium showed no appreciable increase generally remaining below 0 2 μg l data not shown 3 7 microbial cells the bacterial enzyme or enzyme s responsible for ethane and edb degradation in the jbcc aquifer are not currently known therefore it was not possible to target a specific gene and analyze samples via qpcr to evaluate changes in the population of ethane edb degraders during the in situ study 4 discussion to our knowledge this is the first field study evaluating the aerobic cometabolic biodegradation of edb in a groundwater aquifer the data show that edb can be treated to reach stringent regulatory levels 0 05 μg l federal mcl and 0 02 μg l mmcl using an approach consisting of continuous addition of oxygen and ethane to a groundwater recirculation system with periodic amendment with inorganic nutrients the data from this study are consistent with previous microcosm and enrichment culture studies conducted by our group indicating that indigenous bacteria in the local jbcc aquifer are capable of growing on ethane gas and degrading edb to low ng l concentrations but only in the presence of sufficient nitrogen and phosphorus hatzinger et al 2015 a pure culture mycobacterium sphagni env482 was subsequently isolated from the ethane degrading enrichment culture be 3r and found to degrade edb koster van groos et al 2018 and a variety of other contaminants including trichloroethene tce and 1 4 dioxane hatzinger et al 2017a while m sphagni env482 was clearly observed to debrominate edb in laboratory studies unpublished data the pathway and products remain under investigation however with removal of one or both bromide ions it is likely that resulting products e g 2 bromoethanol and ethylene oxide frietas dos santos et al 1996 would be readily biodegradable under aerobic conditions and not subject to the same stringent regulatory levels biological approaches are not typically considered for treating a few μg l of a contaminant to low ng l concentrations as is often the case for edb in groundwater moreover a typical growth linked degradative process e g cells growing on edb as a carbon source is unlikely to be successful in this regard because not enough contaminant is present to support cell maintenance and or growth or sometimes even to induce responsible enzymes a phenomenon known as a threshold effect alexander 1999 and references therein conversely during cometabolic treatment a primary substrate e g methane ethane propane is typically supplied in mg l concentrations allowing growth of a large microbial population independent of the concentration of the contaminant of concern moreover the primary substrate typically induces the same enzyme that is responsible for contaminant degradation for these reasons cometabolism has advantages over growth linked biodegradation when contaminant concentrations are low a comparison of growth linked and cometabolic degradation of 1 4 dioxane which explores and models some of these general principles was recently published by barajas rodriguez and freedman 2018 during this study edb was reduced from 0 3 μg l to concentrations 0 002 μg l i e 2 ng l in some wells after amendment addition and presumably significant growth of ethane degrading bacteria in the aquifer the ability to achieve low ng l contaminant concentrations during cometabolic treatment was also recently reported for n nitrosodimethylamine ndma in propane fed cultures fournier et al 2009 and in a field scale bioreactor system which reduced this contaminant in groundwater to 0 004 μg l at a hydraulic residence time of only 20 min hatzinger et al 2017b recent field studies also have shown that low concentrations of 1 4 dioxane can be achieved in groundwater through biosparging with propane and oxygen gas with final concentrations 1 2 μg l achieved from initial concentrations as high as 1 mg l lippincott et al 2015 and through the application of a recirculation cell using these same amendments chu et al 2018 tce and cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce were also treated to 1 μg l and 0 18 μg l respectively in the latter study in another example full scale in situ treatment of a large dilute vinyl chloride vc plume vc 2 to 27 μg l was successfully completed to 2 μg l with the addition of oxygen and ethene where initial vc concentrations would have been too low for direct aerobic biostimulation alone begley et al 2012 thus the ability to achieve low contaminant concentrations with cometabolic treatment has been demonstrated for several different important contaminants of concern now including edb there are multiple ways to distribute gaseous amendments for cometabolic treatment of contaminants including biosparging passive in well addition and groundwater recirculation with active gas addition as was utilized in this case goltz and christ 2012 lippincott et al 2015 one of the primary advantages of the groundwater recirculation approach is an ability to effectively mix and distribute necessary amendments in an aquifer and to provide those amendments at desired ratios in groundwater it is also much easier to supply inorganic nutrients or bioaugmentation cultures in a groundwater recirculation system than in a biosparging system among the disadvantages are the potential for biofouling of injection wells and the higher costs associated with groundwater pumping than with many other passive techniques some minor iron precipitation was apparent in the lines used to transport water from the conex box to the injection well during this study but this probably resulted from the fact that the flow field to well 90ew0019 typically includes both aerobic and anoxic zones in the aquifer additionally there was a decline in flow in the ethane nutrient line during active treatment which likely reflects mineral or biological fouling but this decline was not sufficient to affect system performance over the four month amendment addition period however when this system was subsequently operated at a higher amendment dosing rate flow to the injection well diminished significantly with time presumably due to biological growth in the injection line and possibly the well screen and filter pack fouling in the injection line was observed during decommissioning thus over longer term operation biofouling prevention and mitigation measures such as addition of hydrogen peroxide or chlorine dioxide mccarty et al 1998 estcp 2005 chu et al 2018 and or periodic well redevelopment should be included in operational plans another potential means to control biofouling is to utilize a pulsed addition of high concentrations of amendments rather than continuous addition mccarty et al 1998 goltz and christ 2012 hatzinger et al 2008 while this approach can be effective it should also be noted that for cometabolic processes the primary substrate is often a competitive inhibitor of the degradation of the contaminant of concern e g alvarez cohen and mccarty 1991 sharp et al 2005 as such when a high concentration of primary substrate is present degradation of the contaminant will slow or cease thus while periodic pulsing of high concentrations of a gaseous amendment may mitigate fouling to some extent it may also lead to reduced rates of contaminant degradation during the periods of addition i e until the amendments are degraded to non inhibitory concentrations the rate of groundwater flow through the demonstration plot area during active pumping of the fs 12 treatment system was initially modeled using the southeast ranges groundwater model which is a three dimensional model originally developed in 1997 and updated several times thereafter that covers the western cape cod region afcee 2005 the groundwater flow in the treatment area was estimated to be 0 6 m day based upon this model data not shown which would provide a residence time of 38 days between the injection and extraction well however our data from ethane and bromide addition to the treatment plot suggest groundwater flow rates as high as 2 1 m day providing a residence time within the plot of 11 days or less this may reflect preferential flow through the more permeable brown medium sand deposits but ethane was also detected in 90mw0208a which is screened in the less permeable grey fine sand deposits within 7 days at a distance of 11 6 m from the injection well yielding a flow rate of 1 7 m day when reaction rates were highest in the system edb biodegradation in the brown medium sand was complete to 0 002 μg l by the first monitoring well 90mw0106c which was only 4 1 m from the injection well at estimated groundwater flow rates of 1 4 to 2 1 m day based on relevant bromide and ethane data respectively this yields a k value from 1 5 to 2 3 day 1 a similar calculation for the deeper grey fine sand deposits yielded a reaction rate on the order of 0 7 day 1 a previous model of the fs 12 plume estimated a natural attenuation rate for edb of only 0 04 year 1 falta 2004 which is 4 orders of magnitude lower than the rate calculated in the demonstration plot although there are no other comparable data for edb during in situ cometabolic treatment the calculated rates are reasonably comparable to the 1 5 day 1 reported by chu et al 2018 for degradation of 1 4 dioxane in a propane and oxygen fed recirculation system and a range of 0 7 2 0 day 1 in cometabolic studies in which toluene mccarty et al 1998 kuo et al 2004 or phenol hopkins et al 1993 were added to recirculating groundwater to promote in situ tce biodegradation 5 conclusions edb can be expected to be present in groundwater from numerous historical releases analytical methods that reach relevant detection limits should be used for site characterization and groundwater monitoring the data from this field study show for the first time that in situ cometabolic treatment of edb to meet regulatory requirements is feasible a groundwater recirculation design was effectively used to distribute necessary amendments which included ethane oxygen and inorganic nutrients within 4 months after amendment addition which was continuous for ethane and oxygen and conducted in small batches for the inorganic nutrients all hydraulically connected wells had edb concentrations of 0 02 μg l and multiple wells were below 0 002 μg l compared to 0 2 to 0 3 μg l in the groundwater continuously entering the plot the data indicate that cometabolic treatment is a promising in situ technology for treating edb and that low regulatory levels in this case the federal mcl of 0 05 μg l and the more stringent massachusetts mcl of 0 02 μg l can be achieved with this

1636,1 2 dibromoethane ethylene dibromide edb is a probable human carcinogen that was historically added to leaded gasoline as a scavenger to prevent the build up of lead oxide deposits in engines studies indicate that edb is present at thousands of past fuel spill sites above its stringent epa maximum contaminant level mcl of 0 05 μg l there are currently no proven in situ options to enhance edb degradation in groundwater to meet this requirement based on successful laboratory studies showing that ethane can be used as a primary substrate to stimulate the aerobic cometabolic biodegradation of edb to 0 015 μg l hatzinger et al 2015 a groundwater recirculation system was installed at the fs 12 edb plume on joint base cape cod jbcc ma to facilitate in situ treatment groundwater was taken from an existing extraction well amended with ethane oxygen and inorganic nutrients and then recharged into the aquifer upgradient of the extraction well creating an in situ reactive zone the concentrations of edb ethane oxygen and anions in groundwater were measured with time in a series of nested monitoring wells installed between the extraction and injection well edb concentrations in the six monitoring wells that were hydraulically well connected to the pumping system declined from 0 3 μg l the average concentration in the recirculation cell after 3 months of operation without amendment addition to 0 02 μg l during the 4 month amendment period meeting both the federal mcl and the more stringent massachusetts mcl 0 02 μg l the data indicate that cometabolic treatment is a promising in situ technology for edb and that low regulatory levels can be achieved with this biological approach keywords 1 2 dibromoethane edb ethane ethylene dibromide cometabolism biodegradation bioremediation groundwater recirculation 1 introduction 1 2 dibromoethane ethylene dibromide edb was historically added to leaded automobile fuels at 300 mg l and to aviation gasoline at 600 mg l to prevent the formation of lead deposits in internal combustion engines falta et al 2005 wilson et al 2008 the compound was also once widely applied as a soil fumigant and subsequently observed to be very persistent in soils being detected decades after last use steinberg et al 1987 pignatello et al 1990 based upon its potential adverse effects on several different mammalian organs and systems including the heart liver nervous system and kidneys as well as its probable human carcinogenicity the us environmental protection agency epa promulgated a maximum contaminant level mcl for edb in drinking water of 0 05 μg l in 1992 far lower than for nearly all other drinking water contaminants including common chlorinated solvents pcbs pesticides except dioxin heavy metals and gasoline derived organics epa 2018 edb was previously observed at concentrations exceeding its federal mcl at hundreds of underground storage tank sites ust in south carolina with a median concentration of 5 μg l and with 10 of locations having at least one well exceeding 200 μg l falta 2004 falta et al 2005 this is true despite the fact that its use was largely discontinued in the 1980s as leaded fuels were phased out if the data from south carolina are representative of the us as a whole then many thousands of ust sites alone are expected to have edb in groundwater exceeding the federal mcl however the most commonly employed analytical technique to detect volatile organic chemicals in groundwater gas chromatography mass spectrometry epa method 8260 has a detection limit for edb that is typically at least 50 fold greater than the mcl so the real prevalence of this compound in groundwater is unknown wilson et al 2008 where groundwater is a potential drinking water source epa method 504 1 which has a practical quantitation limit pql of 0 002 μg l can be used to detect edb down to relevant federal and state mcls edb is subject to abiotic degradation by hydrolysis vogel and reinhard 1986 koster van groos et al 2018 and via dehalogenation reactions catalyzed by various sulfide species including hydrogen sulfide and iron sulfide schwartzenbach et al 1985 wilson et al 2008 koster van groos et al 2018 the compound is also degraded by both anaerobic dehalogenation bower and mccarty 1985 belay and daniels 1987 peethambaram 2010 yu et al 2013 and aerobic cometabolism mediated by organisms utilizing ammonia vannelli et al 1990 phenol baek et al 2013 and a variety of short chain alkanes such as methane ethane propane and pentane hartzell et al 2001 mckeever et al 2012 danko et al 2012 hatzinger et al 2015 the strain mycobacterium sp strain gp1 has also been reported to grow on edb under aerobic conditions poelarends et al 1999 the apparent persistence of edb in soils and groundwater despite numerous laboratory reports of aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation likely has multiple causes including 1 limited bioavailability in soil matrices steinberg et al 1987 2 groundwater concentrations that may be below thresholds for microbial growth alexander 1999 falta 2004 and 3 absence of cometabolic substrates such as propane pentane and ammonia in most aerobic groundwater environments the physicochemical properties of edb including its high water solubility 4300 mg l low octanol water partitioning coefficient kow 58 and low henry s law constant 0 029 falta et al 2005 falta 2004 are also likely to play an important role in its long term persistence based on its physiochemical traits when gasoline with edb enters a groundwater aquifer the edb is expected to partition rapidly from the resulting non aqueous phase liquid napl to groundwater and to be transported ahead of many more hydrophobic fuel hydrocarbons thus while edb may undergo reductive dehalogenation or abiotic transformation in the fuel source area if rates of edb partitioning and transport with groundwater exceed degradation rates the compound is likely to form a large dilute plume downgradient of the spill at concentrations far above the mcl henderson et al 2009 multiple plumes of edb are currently undergoing ex situ treatment at joint base cape cod jbcc formerly called the massachusetts military reservation mmr on cape cod massachusetts usa afcee 2010 currently three pump and treat p t systems at the site remove edb from groundwater using granular activated carbon gac which is subsequently taken off site for reactivation some of these p t systems are expected to operate for decades similarly a new p t system has recently been installed at kirtland air force base new mexico usa to intercept a large dilute edb plume 1 2 km in length that has moved off base property from a past fueling station leak usace 2011 at present there are few in situ remediation options for treating low concentrations of edb in groundwater making p t systems the primary approach however these systems are expensive to build and often require operation for decades to meet remedial goals the objective of this research was to field test an in situ bioremediation approach for treating dilute edb in groundwater that consisted of a groundwater recirculation system amended with ethane oxygen and inorganic nutrients to promote in situ cometabolic treatment of edb this approach is based upon previous microcosm and enrichment culture studies indicating that indigenous bacteria in the regional aquifer are capable of biodegrading edb to 0 015 μg l during aerobic growth on ethane hatzinger et al 2015 the concentrations of edb ethane oxygen and anions in groundwater were measured with time in a series of nested monitoring wells installed between an operating extraction and injection well one of the novel and interesting aspects of this work is the application of cometabolic biodegradation to treat edb concentrations from 1 μg l to low ng l in a field setting this demonstration focused on the fs 12 plume that originated from an estimated 265 000 l fuel release that was originally discovered in 1972 see site map in supplementary data fig s1 source area remediation was initiated in october 1995 through the installation of an air sparging soil vapor extraction as sve system this system was shut down in february 1998 after achieving the soil cleanup goals however a large edb plume in groundwater resulted from this spill the edb plume is being treated with a groundwater extraction treatment and reinjection etr approach and is currently 500 m long reduced from 1200 m long in the 1990s the projected operational period for the etr system is expected to extend through at least 2034 afcee 2010 speim 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 site geology and hydrogeology jbcc is located over a sole source aquifer that provides drinking water for 200 000 year round and 500 000 seasonal residents of cape cod ma the aquifer under jbcc is referred to as the sagamore lens the demonstration site area fs 12 is characterized as a glacial outwash aquifer of quaternary age consisting of highly permeable sand and gravel with distinct discontinuous layers of finer silty sand silt and clay the shallower aquifer sediments generally consist of glaciofluvial coarse grained sand and gravel or nearshore glaciolacustrine fine to coarse sand and gravel with silt and clay the deepest sediments are generally basal till deposits underlain by crystalline bedrock of low permeability the coarse grained outwash deposits are typically about 60 m thick near the study area walter et al 2002 bedrock is located approximately 85 m below ground surface bgs and is considered relatively impermeable compared to the unconsolidated sediments groundwater is characterized by unconfined water table conditions within the saturated zone and the water table is located approximately 21 m bgs the depth of interest for this demonstration is associated with the edb plume and located between 50 m bgs and 70 m bgs within the subject depth interval soil borings indicated there are two distinct geological zones the more shallow zone is generally characterized by medium grained brown sand with traces of coarse sand silt and fine gravel while the deeper zone below 60 m bgs is characterized by less conductive grey fine grained sand with traces of silt the pilot test was intended to assess treatment of edb contamination in both the upper medium grained sand unit as well as the lower finer grained sand unit 2 2 aquifer amendments ethane oxygen and diammonium phosphate dap nh4 2hpo4 were added to the aquifer to promote growth of bacteria capable of degrading edb see next paragraph for concentrations added based on previous laboratory studies with site samples and an enrichment culture from this location hatzinger et al 2015 these studies showed that ethane and oxygen stimulated the biological degradation of edb and that concentrations of 0 015 μg l pql for edb in the laboratory studies could be achieved but only in the presence of inorganic nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus from dap presumably due to the oligotrophic nature of the cape cod aquifer in this region nutrients and oxygen alone did not stimulate edb biodegradation hatzinger et al 2015 in this case ethane was used as the primary carbon source electron donor for bacterial growth in the aquifer and oxygen as the electron acceptor dap was used to provide required inorganic n as nh4 and p as po4 3 for microbial growth in order to estimate field dosages the ratios of ethane oxygen and nitrogen for growth of ethane degrading bacteria were calculated the required molar ratio of ethane to oxygen o2 for complete oxidation of ethane c2h6 to carbon dioxide is 3 5 mols o2 to 1 mol c2h6 eq 1 if one incorporates microbial cell growth on a portion of the carbon from ethane assuming 40 of ethane utilized for cell growth and 60 for respiration then the molar ratio declines to 2 1 mols o2 to 1 mol c2h6 eq 2 cell biomass in eq 2 is represented by c5h7o2n which roughly represents the molar ratio of these elements in bacterial cells rittman and mccarty 2001 this equation also predicts the cellular requirement for n as 0 28 m nh4 per mol c2h6 when converted to a mg l basis the above stoichiometry suggests that the oxygen and ammonium requirement for bacteria to biodegrade 1 mg l of c2h6 is 2 2 mg l o2 3 7 mg l if biomass growth is not included and 0 17 mg l nh4 based on these assumptions the injection system was designed to provide 2 4 mg l of ethane gas and 8 16 mg l of o2 in the influent water with flexibility to modify concentrations based on performance and residual concentrations of o2 in the monitoring wells it should be noted that with time decay of biomass will potentially increase the oxygen demand in the aquifer and that cation exchange processes will result in abiotic losses of nh4 therefore stoichiometric measurements should be used only as a general guideline nutrients were added in small doses 2 3 times per week to ensure that the requirement for n and p which is not included in the equation are met p requirements for cells are 10 of that for n on a molar basis so dap provides the required amount of p as well as n 1 c 2 h 6 3 5 o 2 2co 2

was extracted from a single existing extraction well 90ew0019 and re injected into a single injection well 90iw0001 the design groundwater recirculation rate was 38 l per minute lpm the groundwater was taken from 90ew0019 typically pumping 450 lpm through a 2 5 cm id hose to a steel shipping container conex box used to house the mixing and injection systems where the water flow was passed through a bag filter to remove any particulate material the pressure from the extraction well was expected to be adequate for reinjection based on initial calculations but booster pumps were included in the system design in case the extraction well pressure was insufficient to provide the necessary recharge rate the groundwater flow was split into two lines one of which was amended with industrial oxygen gas air gas lakeville ma and the second of which received instrument grade ethane gas air gas 99 5 purity and dap reagent grade siedler chemical newark nj for inorganic nutrients oxygen gas was supplied by cylinder through a manifold system passed through a filter unit a mass flow controller and then added to groundwater using a static mixer as described in section 2 3 the desired concentration of oxygen in the influent water was between 8 and 16 mg l the design for ethane gas addition was basically the same as that for oxygen except that the gas storage was in a separate cage located at the other end of the conex box to allow adequate separation from oxygen cylinders the target concentration of ethane in the influent water was between 2 and 4 mg l a 570 l tank was placed within the conex box for addition of dap the nutrient solution was added to the water line carrying ethane gas 3 times per week in batch using a dosing pump controlled via a remote dial in system at a total water flow rate of 38 lpm and assuming an ethane addition rate of 3 mg l approximately 200 g of nh4 was calculated to be required on a weekly basis see eq 2 this weekly value was increased by 5 to 10 fold to make sure that microbial nutrients were provided in excess ammonia and nitrate were monitored in the demonstration plot and downgradient of the system to ensure that relevant regulatory levels were not exceeded after ethane nutrient and oxygen addition each water stream exited the conex box and passed through a 2 5 cm id hose in the buried carrier pipe to the injection well down the well and through an inflatable packer the packer was installed at 56 m bgs which was above both the upper and lower screen interval in well 90iw0001 see section 2 5 for well details a nitrogen cylinder which was stored in the cage with the oxygen cylinders was used to keep the packer inflated at 6 9 bar the power supply for the system was obtained from an existing adjacent building safety features within the conex box included a lower explosive limit lel meter designed to shut down the system and gas supply at 5 of the lel in case of an ethane or oxygen leak in the box an alarm condition would occur in this instance and an intrinsically safe fan would be activated to vent any gas from the conex box the ethane and oxygen cylinders also were fitted with flow control valves just after the manifold to shut off gas supply if flow rates exceed specific settings suggesting a possible leak in the gas supply system system shut downs activation of the ventilation fan in the conex box or any alarm condition activated an outgoing mobile phone call 2 4 well network the groundwater well network for this project included one extraction well one injection well and a series of nested performance monitoring wells placed between these two wells in the recirculation zone fig 1 one 10 cm diameter injection well 90iw0001 was installed 23 m north and hydraulically upgradient of existing extraction well 90ew0019 90iw0001 was constructed with two separate screened zones targeting the upper medium sand and deeper fine sand zones that contain dissolved phase edb in groundwater a packer could be placed between these zones to target the lower less conductive interval if necessary in addition two triple nested monitoring wells 90mw0207a b c and 90mw0208a b c were installed within the planned recirculation cell area between the extraction and injection well with monitoring screens at target elevations within both dominant geologic formations well nest 90 mw0208 was located 11 7 m hydraulically downgradient of 90iw0001 and well nest 90 mw0207 was 17 1 m downgradient of 90iw0001 an existing monitoring well cluster 90 mw0106 was also present within the monitoring well network two of these wells 90 mw0106 a c were 4 1 m downgradient of 90iw0001 and the other 90 mw0106 b was located 7 3 m from 90iw0001 three of the wells were screened either predominantly above 90mw0207c 90mw0208c or below 90mw0106a the primary zone of edb contamination and groundwater recirculation the scaled well plot layout fig s2 and well construction details table s1 are provided in the supplementary data 2 5 system operation during the first 3 months of the demonstration groundwater was recirculated in the demonstration plot i e pumped from the extraction well to the injection well but no amendments were added this allowed an assessment of changes in edb concentrations in the monitoring well network due to system operation i e movement and mixing of groundwater in the absence of ethane oxygen and nutrient addition one round of sampling was performed before system start up and three rounds were conducted during the recirculation phase see section 2 6 for sampling details during the next 4 months of operation ethane and oxygen were added to groundwater at initial target concentrations of 2 4 mg l and 8 16 mg l respectively and a system design flow rate of 38 lpm 19 lpm from the line feeding oxygen and 19 lpm from the line feeding ethane and nutrients inorganic nutrients were added in batch during this period five full groundwater sampling events were conducted during this phase and three events were conducted days 99 100 and 104 only for field parameters including do and orp anions bromide and dissolved gases ethane shortly after these compounds were initially added to the aquifer a sodium bromide tracer was added to the injection well between day 96 and day 100 to help evaluate the connectivity of each of the monitoring well screens to the system injection well a total of 25 kg of sodium bromide was mixed into 450 l of site groundwater approximately 360 l of the solution was added between the aforementioned days the fs 12 pumping system at jbcc was off for a period of time during this test so the flow in the recirculation cell was not continuous as planned the remaining bromide solution was added to the aquifer with the first batch of inorganic nutrients the bromide data could not be used to precisely estimate the rate of groundwater flow through the plot due to the intermittent nature of the addition and pumping within the plot however the bromide test was useful for determining the connectivity of each monitoring well screen interval to the injection well which was the primary purpose of the test 2 6 groundwater sample collection and analysis groundwater samples were collected utilizing low flow purging in accordance with epa low flow ground water sampling procedures puls and barcelona 1996 samples were obtained from each monitoring well using a dedicated submersible bladder pump and a flow through cell with a ysi field meter or equivalent to allow measurement of field geochemical parameters ph orp temperature specific conductivity and dissolved oxygen all field meters were calibrated once at the beginning of the day the submersible bladder pumps and tubing used to sample all wells were dedicated and therefore did not require decontamination before each sampling event groundwater elevation measurements were collected using an electronic water level indicator measurements were obtained from the top of casing and recorded to the nearest 0 3 cm groundwater samples were collected for the following analyses 1 edb epa method 504 1 testamerica savannah ga 2 anions including bromide nitrate nitrite orthophosphate sulfate and chloride epa method 300 0 aptim lawrenceville nj 3 dissolved alkane gases including ethane ethene propane and methane gas chromatography with flame

via field meter 3 results 3 1 groundwater recirculation and amendment addition the groundwater recirculation system was initially operated for 96 days without the addition of any amendments in order to establish a new baseline for edb in the test plot wells ethane and oxygen addition commenced on day 97 and day 98 respectively and addition of inorganic nutrients was initiated on day 119 the average total water flow through the system was 38 8 lpm which was within the planned operational range the groundwater flow in the line carrying ethane gas and nutrients declined slowly from around day 150 to day 180 from 21 lpm to 15 lpm and the lines were switched on day 183 to rebalance the flow mineral fouling e g precipitation of phosphate minerals or biofouling most likely contributed to the slow decline in flow over the duration of the study the system recirculated just under 12 million l of groundwater to the injection well fig 2 the ethane gas flow was set at 0 14 lpm throughout the addition period day 97 day 216 the oxygen flow was initially set at 0 5 lpm and then reduced to between 0 2 and 0 3 lpm after day 183 based on oxygen concentrations throughout the demonstration plot an inorganic nutrient solution consisting 0 017 kg l of dap was mixed in a tank in the conex box on day 119 approximately 280 l of the dap solution were added in 11 23 l batches between day 119 and day 163 a second more concentrated batch of dap 0 472 kg l was mixed on day 163 and 160 l of this solution were added between that date and shutdown on day 216 in general nutrients were added 3 times per week via remote system access 3 2 ethane ethane was continually added to the aquifer beginning on day 97 and served as a good hydraulic tracer during the initial weeks of addition before significant biodegradation was apparent ethane was detected at 1 mg l in 90mw0106c on day 99 2 days after addition began and stayed 1 mg l through day 124 fig 3 on day 124 27 days after addition began ethane was 2 3 mg l in the injection well 90iw0001 and was detected at 500 μg l in 90mw0106b 90mw0208a and 90mw0208b and at 180 μg l in 90mw0207a and 90mw0207b thus significant quantities of ethane were detected in both the upper brown medium sand and the deeper grey fine sand deposits the extraction well recirculation loop from 90ew0019 through the conex box had 68 μg l on day 124 so clearly groundwater from the injection well 90iw0001 had moved through the recirculation cell to the extraction well 90ew0019 a 23 m distance within 27 days giving a groundwater flow rate of at least 0 9 m day ethane was not detected in 90mw0106a or 90mw0207c a concentration of 13 μg l was detected in 90mw0208c on day 124 but not thereafter ethane concentrations declined significantly in many of the wells between day 124 and day 152 and then further by day 180 despite continuous addition to the injection well fig 3 all mws had 20 μg l most 5 μg l on day 180 and 209 the ethane concentration in the injection well 90iw0001 was 1080 μg l on day 180 and 1120 μg l on day 209 giving an average of 1100 μg l on both days the concentration in the closest monitoring well 90mw0106c was 4 μg l indicating that all ethane moving through the shallow brown sand was consumed between these wells which were located 4 15 m apart assuming an estimated groundwater flow rate of 0 9 m day the minimal rate of ethane consumption in this reactive zone was on the order of 160 μg l day 3 3 bromide bromide was added to the aquifer as a tracer beginning on day 96 and ending on day 100 but groundwater flow was unexpectedly interrupted during this time due to a power outage so that continuous addition was not possible thus the data do not allow an accurate prediction of groundwater residence time in the treatment plot during pumping conditions however bromide was detected in well 90mw0106c the closest monitoring well to the injection well at 33 mg l on day 99 sampling was not conducted on day 98 which indicates a groundwater flow rate in this region closest to the injection well during pumping of at least 1 4 m day fig 4 ethane was detected in this same well after only 2 days indicating a groundwater flow rate as high as 2 1 m day between the injection well and first monitoring well location see section 3 3 bromide was detected in all of the wells where ethane was observed with the highest concentrations occurring in 90mw0106c 90mw0106b and 90mw0207a at days 100 124 and 152 respectively bromide was not detected in 90mw0106a and was detected only in trace concentrations 0 3 mg l in both 90mw0207c and 90mw0208c which is consistent with the ethane and edb baseline data after pumping but prior to amendment addition for these wells see section 3 5 3 4 edb a complete initial round of groundwater sampling was conducted for the demonstration plot monitoring wells prior to recirculation and then on day 26 day 54 and day 82 after start up of the groundwater extraction reinjection system the edb concentration data from these four sampling events are provided in table 1 the initial edb concentration at the injection well 90iw0001 screened in both the shallower medium brown sand and the deeper grey fine sand fig 1 was 1 μg l during the first event well above the federal mcl 0 05 μg l and the more stringent massachusetts state mcl mmcl 0 02 μg l within the grey fine sand interval moving downgradient toward the extraction well 90ew0019 baseline edb concentrations were 5 0 μg l 90mw0106b 0 088 μg l 90mw0208a and 0 075 μg l 90mw0207a these concentrations decreased with proximity to the extraction well which had a concentration of 0 42 μg l during the initial pre design sampling event this well is an active pumping well in the fs 12 treatment system 450 lpm flow the shallower monitoring wells screened in the higher conductivity brown sand had concentrations of 0 140 μg l 90mw0106c 0 052 μg l 90mw0208b and 0 005 μg l 90mw0207b and 90mw0207c as with the deeper interval edb concentrations decreased in proximity to the extraction well at the conclusion of the three months of system operation without addition of ethane or inorganic nutrients i e recharging groundwater at 38 to 49 lpm from 90ew0019 to 90iw0001 the concentrations of edb in several of the monitoring wells stabilized at 0 3 μg l which was also the concentration in the recirculation loop table 1 operation of the system without amendments during this time interval was performed in order to establish new experimental baseline concentrations for edb in the monitoring wells edb concentrations did not increase significantly in two of the wells 90mw0207c and 90mw0208c each of which are screened in the shallow zone these wells appear to be poorly connected to the zone of influence of the recirculation system which is not unexpected based on their screen intervals see fig 1 and s1 the remaining wells 90mw0106a and 90mw0207b showed slow moderate increases in edb over the course of 3 months of pumping each reaching 0 16 μg l during this time these wells appear to be only partially connected to the flow field of the system resulting in the slow change in edb concentration in each with time these data are consistent with both the bromide and ethane data edb concentrations showed a significant decline in all of the wells that were hydraulically well connected to the pumping system after the gas and nutrient amendments were added to the groundwater fig 5a edb concentrations in wells 90mw0106c 90mw0208a 90mw0208b and 90mw0207a declined from 0 3 μg l at the final baseline round day 82 to 0 002 μg l pql by day 209 well 90mw0106b declined from 0 31 μg l to 0 014 μg l and 90mw0207b declined from 0 16 μg l to 0 0097 μg l during the same time interval thus edb concentrations in all of these wells were below the mmcl of 0 02 μg l within 4 months after beginning amendment addition among the wells that were less well connected to the system based on ethane and bromide distribution 90mw207c had very low edb concentrations throughout the study i e was not affected by the recirculation system edb in wells 90mw0106a and 90mw0208c increased slowly to 0 18 μg l and 0 16 μg l respectively on day 124 and then declined to 0 062 μg l and 0 093 μg l respectively at the end of the study fig 5b it is likely that the recirculation system moved some water with edb into the screen intervals of these wells trace bromide was detected in each subsequently as edb concentrations declined throughout the treatment area they declined accordingly but more slowly in these wells overall the recirculation system proved to be highly effective for treating edb in groundwater the edb concentration in the recycle loop through the conex box which is a groundwater taken from pumping well 90ew0019 also showed a steady decline during the period when inorganic nutrients ethane and oxygen were added to the injection well but not during the previous 3 months when these amendments were not added during the final sampling event this concentration had declined to 0 21 μg l from an average pre amendment concentration of 0 33 μg l only four months earlier a 36 reduction it is possible that this reduction reflects a natural decline based upon the ongoing pumping at the site however considering the short duration and timing of this decline it is more likely that the in situ treatment system reduced the total edb concentration in pumping well 90ew0019 which was pumping 450 lpm further analysis concerning the distribution and concentration profile of edb in the groundwater captured by 90ew0019 i e in the zone treated by the in situ remediation and that not within the zone of influence would be required to confirm this hypothesis 3 5 treatment efficiency and rate of edb biodegradation if one considers an in situ recirculation system such as this to follow plug flow behavior as has been suggested for similar in situ recirculation designs chu et al 2018 goltz and christ 2012 christ et al 1999 then it is possible to calculate a pseudo first order reaction rate and treatment efficiency for the system at optimal performance which in this case was during the period from day 180 to day 209 of recirculation and amendment addition the following formula can be used for this calculation 3 η 1 e kt where η is the treatment efficiency in a single pass t is the residence time and k is the rate constant christ et al 1999 goltz and christ 2012 on day 180 and day 209 complete degradation of edb occurred from 0 2 μg l in the injection well to 0 002 μg l in the closest monitoring well screened in the brown sand 90mw0106b the treatment efficiency over this interval can be estimated at 99 which can be assumed for η in that these wells are spaced 4 15 m apart with an estimated groundwater flow during the pumping phase of 1 4 to 2 1 m day based on relevant bromide and ethane data giving a t value of between 2 and 3 days the estimated k value during this operational period ranges from 1 5 to 2 3 day 1 or a half life of 0 3 to 0 5 days similarly for the deeper grey fine sand deposits edb was below detection 0 002 μg l in well 90mw208a on days 180 and 209 at an influent of 0 2 μg l this also provided a treatment efficiency of 99 and assuming a groundwater flow rate of 1 7 m day based upon ethane being detected in this well 11 6 m from the injection well within 7 days the estimated k value for this zone is 0 7 day 1 or a half life of 1 1 days 3 6 dissolved oxygen and inorganic nutrients the system provided enough oxygen to support the complete oxidation of ethane throughout the plot with concentrations generally exceeding 5 mg l and ranging to 20 mg l fig 6 the one exception was well 90mw0106a which generally had dissolved oxygen below 1 mg l while the amendments were added this is the deepest well in the treatment plot and also one of the wells that appeared to be poorly connected to the treatment system flow field based on ethane and bromide data ammonium and phosphate were generally near or below detection throughout the treatment plot the highest ammonium concentration detected was 0 7 mg l and the highest concentration of phosphate detected was 0 3 mg l nitrite and nitrate possible oxidation products of ammonium showed no appreciable increase generally remaining below 0 2 μg l data not shown 3 7 microbial cells the bacterial enzyme or enzyme s responsible for ethane and edb degradation in the jbcc aquifer are not currently known therefore it was not possible to target a specific gene and analyze samples via qpcr to evaluate changes in the population of ethane edb degraders during the in situ study 4 discussion to our knowledge this is the first field study evaluating the aerobic cometabolic biodegradation of edb in a groundwater aquifer the data show that edb can be treated to reach stringent regulatory levels 0 05 μg l federal mcl and 0 02 μg l mmcl using an approach consisting of continuous addition of oxygen and ethane to a groundwater recirculation system with periodic amendment with inorganic nutrients the data from this study are consistent with previous microcosm and enrichment culture studies conducted by our group indicating that indigenous bacteria in the local jbcc aquifer are capable of growing on ethane gas and degrading edb to low ng l concentrations but only in the presence of sufficient nitrogen and phosphorus hatzinger et al 2015 a pure culture mycobacterium sphagni env482 was subsequently isolated from the ethane degrading enrichment culture be 3r and found to degrade edb koster van groos et al 2018 and a variety of other contaminants including trichloroethene tce and 1 4 dioxane hatzinger et al 2017a while m sphagni env482 was clearly observed to debrominate edb in laboratory studies unpublished data the pathway and products remain under investigation however with removal of one or both bromide ions it is likely that resulting products e g 2 bromoethanol and ethylene oxide frietas dos santos et al 1996 would be readily biodegradable under aerobic conditions and not subject to the same stringent regulatory levels biological approaches are not typically considered for treating a few μg l of a contaminant to low ng l concentrations as is often the case for edb in groundwater moreover a typical growth linked degradative process e g cells growing on edb as a carbon source is unlikely to be successful in this regard because not enough contaminant is present to support cell maintenance and or growth or sometimes even to induce responsible enzymes a phenomenon known as a threshold effect alexander 1999 and references therein conversely during cometabolic treatment a primary substrate e g methane ethane propane is typically supplied in mg l concentrations allowing growth of a large microbial population independent of the concentration of the contaminant of concern moreover the primary substrate typically induces the same enzyme that is responsible for contaminant degradation for these reasons cometabolism has advantages over growth linked biodegradation when contaminant concentrations are low a comparison of growth linked and cometabolic degradation of 1 4 dioxane which explores and models some of these general principles was recently published by barajas rodriguez and freedman 2018 during this study edb was reduced from 0 3 μg l to concentrations 0 002 μg l i e 2 ng l in some wells after amendment addition and presumably significant growth of ethane degrading bacteria in the aquifer the ability to achieve low ng l contaminant concentrations during cometabolic treatment was also recently reported for n nitrosodimethylamine ndma in propane fed cultures fournier et al 2009 and in a field scale bioreactor system which reduced this contaminant in groundwater to 0 004 μg l at a hydraulic residence time of only 20 min hatzinger et al 2017b recent field studies also have shown that low concentrations of 1 4 dioxane can be achieved in groundwater through biosparging with propane and oxygen gas with final concentrations 1 2 μg l achieved from initial concentrations as high as 1 mg l lippincott et al 2015 and through the application of a recirculation cell using these same amendments chu et al 2018 tce and cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis dce were also treated to 1 μg l and 0 18 μg l respectively in the latter study in another example full scale in situ treatment of a large dilute vinyl chloride vc plume vc 2 to 27 μg l was successfully completed to 2 μg l with the addition of oxygen and ethene where initial vc concentrations would have been too low for direct aerobic biostimulation alone begley et al 2012 thus the ability to achieve low contaminant concentrations with cometabolic treatment has been demonstrated for several different important contaminants of concern now including edb there are multiple ways to distribute gaseous amendments for cometabolic treatment of contaminants including biosparging passive in well addition and groundwater recirculation with active gas addition as was utilized in this case goltz and christ 2012 lippincott et al 2015 one of the primary advantages of the groundwater recirculation approach is an ability to effectively mix and distribute necessary amendments in an aquifer and to provide those amendments at desired ratios in groundwater it is also much easier to supply inorganic nutrients or bioaugmentation cultures in a groundwater recirculation system than in a biosparging system among the disadvantages are the potential for biofouling of injection wells and the higher costs associated with groundwater pumping than with many other passive techniques some minor iron precipitation was apparent in the lines used to transport water from the conex box to the injection well during this study but this probably resulted from the fact that the flow field to well 90ew0019 typically includes both aerobic and anoxic zones in the aquifer additionally there was a decline in flow in the ethane nutrient line during active treatment which likely reflects mineral or biological fouling but this decline was not sufficient to affect system performance over the four month amendment addition period however when this system was subsequently operated at a higher amendment dosing rate flow to the injection well diminished significantly with time presumably due to biological growth in the injection line and possibly the well screen and filter pack fouling in the injection line was observed during decommissioning thus over longer term operation biofouling prevention and mitigation measures such as addition of hydrogen peroxide or chlorine dioxide mccarty et al 1998 estcp 2005 chu et al 2018 and or periodic well redevelopment should be included in operational plans another potential means to control biofouling is to utilize a pulsed addition of high concentrations of amendments rather than continuous addition mccarty et al 1998 goltz and christ 2012 hatzinger et al 2008 while this approach can be effective it should also be noted that for cometabolic processes the primary substrate is often a competitive inhibitor of the degradation of the contaminant of concern e g alvarez cohen and mccarty 1991 sharp et al 2005 as such when a high concentration of primary substrate is present degradation of the contaminant will slow or cease thus while periodic pulsing of high concentrations of a gaseous amendment may mitigate fouling to some extent it may also lead to reduced rates of contaminant degradation during the periods of addition i e until the amendments are degraded to non inhibitory concentrations the rate of groundwater flow through the demonstration plot area during active pumping of the fs 12 treatment system was initially modeled using the southeast ranges groundwater model which is a three dimensional model originally developed in 1997 and updated several times thereafter that covers the western cape cod region afcee 2005 the groundwater flow in the treatment area was estimated to be 0 6 m day based upon this model data not shown which would provide a residence time of 38 days between the injection and extraction well however our data from ethane and bromide addition to the treatment plot suggest groundwater flow rates as high as 2 1 m day providing a residence time within the plot of 11 days or less this may reflect preferential flow through the more permeable brown medium sand deposits but ethane was also detected in 90mw0208a which is screened in the less permeable grey fine sand deposits within 7 days at a distance of 11 6 m from the injection well yielding a flow rate of 1 7 m day when reaction rates were highest in the system edb biodegradation in the brown medium sand was complete to 0 002 μg l by the first monitoring well 90mw0106c which was only 4 1 m from the injection well at estimated groundwater flow rates of 1 4 to 2 1 m day based on relevant bromide and ethane data respectively this yields a k value from 1 5 to 2 3 day 1 a similar calculation for the deeper grey fine sand deposits yielded a reaction rate on the order of 0 7 day 1 a previous model of the fs 12 plume estimated a natural attenuation rate for edb of only 0 04 year 1 falta 2004 which is 4 orders of magnitude lower than the rate calculated in the demonstration plot although there are no other comparable data for edb during in situ cometabolic treatment the calculated rates are reasonably comparable to the 1 5 day 1 reported by chu et al 2018 for degradation of 1 4 dioxane in a propane and oxygen fed recirculation system and a range of 0 7 2 0 day 1 in cometabolic studies in which toluene mccarty et al 1998 kuo et al 2004 or phenol hopkins et al 1993 were added to recirculating groundwater to promote in situ tce biodegradation 5 conclusions edb can be expected to be present in groundwater from numerous historical releases analytical methods that reach relevant detection limits should be used for site characterization and groundwater monitoring the data from this field study show for the first time that in situ cometabolic treatment of edb to meet regulatory requirements is feasible a groundwater recirculation design was effectively used to distribute necessary amendments which included ethane oxygen and inorganic nutrients within 4 months after amendment addition which was continuous for ethane and oxygen and conducted in small batches for the inorganic nutrients all hydraulically connected wells had edb concentrations of 0 02 μg l and multiple wells were below 0 002 μg l compared to 0 2 to 0 3 μg l in the groundwater continuously entering the plot the data indicate that cometabolic treatment is a promising in situ technology for treating edb and that low regulatory levels in this case the federal mcl of 0 05 μg l and the more stringent massachusetts mcl of 0 02 μg l can be achieved with this

1637,this study aims to determine upscaling factors for the radionuclides distribution coefficients kd on crushed rocks to intact rock for the safety analysis of radionuclide migration from spent nuclear fuel in bedrock towards biosphere here we report the distribution coefficients for intact rock determined by electromigration sorption experiments and compare the results with those from recently performed batch sorption experiments in total 34 rock samples representing three typical rock types from olkiluoto finland were studied in order to determine distribution coefficients effective diffusion coefficients and porosities using the electromigration sorption experiments formation factor experiments and porosity measurement the parameters determined represent the three main parameters of geosphere used in the safety assessment of spent nuclear fuel disposal the distribution coefficients of cesium and strontium on intact rock varied between 0 12 26 2 10 3 m3 kg and 1 4 13 3 10 3 m3 kg respectively whereas recent results for crushed rock varied between 2 57 10 3 m3 kg and 17 40 10 3 m3 kg respectively this implies that crushing increases the distribution coefficient significantly and upscaling factors from 3 to 33 were determined for scaling the distribution coefficients of crushed rock to ones of intact rock the determined distribution coefficients of cesium and strontium for intact rock can be directly applied in the safety assessment whereas the upscaling factors can be used to convert distribution coefficients determined for crushed rock into ones for intact rock based on the results for porosities and effective diffusion coefficients it was concluded that they do not seem to correlate with sorption parameters however an alteration state heterogeneity and mineral content seem to be important factors affecting the distribution coefficients and upscaling factors keywords electromigration sorption distribution coefficient formation factor effective diffusion coefficient porosity 1 introduction in finland the spent nuclear fuel from the currently operating nuclear power reactors will be disposed of in a bedrock repository at a depth of about 400 m in the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel in geological formations such as bedrock in finland the rock above the waste acts as the last barrier against the release of radionuclides into the biosphere this has been taken into account in the safety assessment of the final disposal concept by the evaluation of the transport properties of radionuclides in the bedrock the retardation mechanisms of radionuclides in bedrock are matrix diffusion and sorption on the minerals posiva 2013 in the safety assessment effective porosity diffusion coefficient and distribution coefficient kd define the transport properties of the rock and the magnitude of matrix diffusion and sorption the effective diffusion coefficient depends only slightly on the considered radionuclide while the distribution coefficient varies strongly from radionuclide to another furthermore the transport parameters especially the distribution coefficient depend on the rock type and the mineral composition of rock the porosity is fairly straightforward to determine while the distribution and effective diffusion coefficient offer challenges particularly in case of crystalline rock the distribution coefficients are typically determined using crushed rock this however creates new surface area directly in contact with water molecules capable of sorbing radionuclides and thus distribution coefficients determined using crushed rock samples overestimate the distribution coefficient of intact rock it has been found out that the distribution coefficients determined using crushed rock can be significantly higher than the ones determined using intact rock crawford 2010 furthermore the batch sorption experiments are typically performed using a water rock ratios that are not realistic for intact rocks the diffusion coefficients on the other hand are typically measured using long lasting and tedious experiments there are a great number of distribution coefficients determined by batch sorption experiments available hakanen et al 2012 currently conservative estimates for the upscaling factors have to be used before they can be used to estimate the distribution coefficient of intact rock in the safety assessment however their utilization using less conservative approaches would be beneficial and it has not been thoroughly investigated so far to this end a systematic study to determine the upscaling factors for distribution coefficients from crushed to intact rock was performed the distribution coefficient of cesium and strontium were determined for the most common rock types of olkiluoto using the electromigration sorption experiments on drill core samples in order to obtain the factors suitable for upscaling these results were compared with the ones determined using batch sorption experiments in a recent study lehto et al 2018 cesium and strontium exist as cations in aqueous solutions cs and sr2 and their sorption mechanism on mineral surfaces is ion exchange that can be taken into account in safety assessment using kd concept in crystalline rock samples mica minerals have the highest sorption capacity of cesium and the ion exchange takes place on basal planes on crystal surfaces frayed edge sites and third type sites kyllönen et al 2014 the electromigration sorption experiments have been previously developed and tested by andré et al 2006 2008 2009 the method is based on enhancing the migration of ions into the intact rock by applying electrical potential over a drill core sample due to the enhancement longer rock cores can be used than in traditional through diffusion experiments tachi et al 2015 and thus effects arising from sample preparation e g drilling and sawing are reduced due to the experimental setup the measurement cannot be used for determining effective diffusion coefficients however they were estimated using the same experimental setup by performing electrical resistivity measurements that offer information on a formation factor and can be used further to estimate the effective diffusion coefficient löfgren and neretnieks 2003 the method has been widely used in a swedish program of the spent nuclear fuel disposal and its limitations and advantages have been thoroughly discussed by löfgren 2015 in general the method is faster than traditional through diffusion experiments that are used for determining the effective diffusion coefficient the method has been further developed in order to perform the through electromigration experiments löfgren and neretnieks 2006 furthermore the porosities of the samples were determined using water saturation and immersion methods voutilainen et al 2012 this work aims to determine the three most important transport parameters of bedrock distribution coefficients effective diffusion coefficients and porosity related to safety assessment for intact rock samples the aim is to test the experimental methods for a wide range of rock samples from olkiluoto finland and to produce transport parameters that can be used directly in safety assessment furthermore we propose the upscaling factors for converting the distribution coefficients obtained by batch sorption experiments with crushed rock into ones for intact rock the rock samples and their mineral compositions as well as the electrical methods for measuring effective diffusion coefficient and distribution coefficient and porosity measurements are described in the work 2 materials and methods 2 1 bedrock of olkiluoto olkiluoto bedrock consists of four major rock types contents given in parentheses migmatitic gneisses 64 pegmatitic granites 20 gneisses 9 and tonalite granodiorite granite gneisses 8 the main minerals in these rocks are quartz 25 35 potassium feldspar 5 35 plagioclase 15 35 and biotite 10 30 kärki and paulamäki 2006 an exception for biotite is the pegmatitic granite the biotite content of which is low round 1 in addition to biotite these rocks contain other mica minerals e g muscovite but at lower content the rocks contain also pinite and sericite the alteration products of cordierite and plagioclase these minerals are known to have a major effect to sorption capacity due to their mineral structure alteration state and chemical composition of the rock and thus to the retention of radionuclide migration in crystalline rocks torstenfelt et al 1982 2 2 rock samples the electromigration sorption experiments were done with altogether 32 drill core samples 26 for cesium and 6 for strontium furthermore formation factors and effective diffusion coefficients were measured for 24 and porosities for all 32 of these samples the selected samples represent three of the typical rock types in olkiluoto mica gneiss mgn tonalite granodiorite granite gneiss tgg and pegmatitic granite pgr for four mgn and tgg drill core samples pp309 pp219 kr56 pp175 the mineralogical composition was determined by several methods see table 1 for these samples batch experiments were done as a function of grain size and as a function of cesium and strontium concentration and the specific surface areas of various grain sizes were measured lehto et al 2018 the samples for these experiments were taken from the same drill cores as close as possible to the drill core samples for the electromigration sorption experiments see fig 1 for four other drill cores kr43 pp131 51 pp131 70 pp249 only one batch sorption experiment was done using the equilibrium concentrations of cesium and strontium from the electromigration experiments the mineral contents of these latter four rock samples in table 1 are the average values of the minerals in these rock types and they were taken from kärki and paulamäki 2006 the drill core samples diameter 50 mm were cut with a diamond blade saw to 3 30 mm long sections for the electromigration sorption experiments as an example two mgn drill cores are shown fig 1 exactly the same samples were used in porosity and electrical formation factor measurements 2 3 volumetric porosity experiments the volumetric porosities of the drill core samples were determined by the water saturation method first the samples were dried in a vacuum to a constant weight the bulk volumes of the rock samples were determined by a water immersion method voutilainen et al 2012 then the samples were put into a vessel where vacuum was pumped and deionized water millipore milli q was added to the vessel the rock samples were saturated under water for three weeks then the weights of the rock samples were measured after their surfaces were quickly dried the difference of the dry and wet weights gave the amount of water inside the rock the volume of the water and further the volumetric porosities of the rock samples were determined using the density of water and the bulk volumes of the samples possible systematical uncertainty sources of the experiment arise from remaining water after drying and remaining air after water saturation here the drying and water saturation were continued until constant weight in order to minimize the effect of these uncertainty sources 2 4 electromigration sorption experiments the experimental setup for electromigration is presented in fig 2 the setup consists of an experimental vessel that was made of acrylic plastic and it contained two chambers that were separated by a drill core sample the chambers were filled with 0 01 m nacl solution and platinum electrodes were placed in the chambers in order to prevent creation of ph and concentration gradients over the sample due to the electric current solutions in the chambers were mixed continuously with each other using a peristaltic pump the flow of solution from chamber to the other was made drop wise to prevent the electrical connection along the water column in tubes before adding the cesium and strontium tracers an electrical potential over the sample was applied and it was kept for at least two weeks in order to stabilize the system after this 134cscl 1 10 4 m cscl or 85srcl2 1 10 6 m srcl2 was added into the nacl solution and the tracer concentration in the chambers was measured by taking samples of the mixed solution the total volume of solution varied from 233 ml to 403 ml the total volume of solution was kept constant by adding deionized milli q water in order to compensate the decomposed water to h2 and o2 due to electrolysis at the electrodes the concentrations of cesium and strontium were determined by measuring their activity in the water samples using a gamma counter perkin elmer 1480 wizard after the measurement the water samples were brought back into the experimental system in order to maintain the total activity of the solution the measured concentrations were then compared with the initial concentrations and the kd values of 134cs and 85sr for the rock samples were determined using equation 1 k d v s m 100 s where v is the total volume of the solution s is the sorption percentage and m is the mass of the rock sample 2 5 formation factor and effective diffusion coefficient experiments the formation factors of the drill core samples were determined using the electrical method löfgren and neretnieks 2003 before the experiments the drill core samples were saturated with 0 01 m nacl solution for two weeks and the saturated samples were then placed in the electromigration system described in the previous section the voltage over the rock sample was then gradually increased from 1 v to 30 v and the electric current through the rock sample was measured as a function of the voltage following analysis was performed in order to determine the formation factors from measured data first the resistivity of the rock sample ρ was determined by using equation löfgren and neretnieks 2003 2 ρ a l u i 2 l w κ w a e where a is cross sectional area of the rock sample and l is the length of the rock sample δu is the measured electrical potential over the rock sample i is the measured electric current lw is the thickness of the water column between the sample and the electrode κw is the conductivity of the solution and ae is the inner surface area of the chamber the formation factor ff can then be determined from the resistivity of the rock sample by using equation löfgren and neretnieks 2003 3 f f 1 ρ κ w in practice the ff is a measure for pore structures influence on the resistance of the sample typically the effective diffusion coefficient de can be estimated from ff using the equation 4 d e f f d 0 where d0 is the diffusion coefficient of the tracer ion in water here it is assumed that pore space of the rock affects the effective diffusion coefficient and resistivity of the rock similarly this assumption leads to ff being equivalent with the pore geometry factor g that commonly defined to be a function of porosity and tortuosity in our experiments there were cl and na ions in the solution and their diffusion coefficients in water at room temperature are 2 0 10 9 m2 s and 1 3 10 9 m2 s respectively their average value 1 65 10 9 m2 s was used when determining the effective diffusion coefficients 3 results 3 1 porosities formation factors and effective diffusion coefficients the porosities formation factors and effective diffusion coefficients of the drill core samples used in the electromigration sorption experiments are presented in table 2 the observed porosity values represent the typical values for rock samples taken from the olkiluoto area smellie et al 2014 however these values are closer to the low porous end of typical values there was no correlation found between the determined porosities and rock type that is typical for crystalline rock samples taken from the same site the results for ff and de are given as an uncertainty weighted averages over all independent measurements here different electric potentials and their uncertainties were taken into account the variations of the results over each drill core and rock type arise from the heterogeneity of the rock and more importantly the heterogeneity of the pore structure such variations are common in crystalline rock at the studied scale sammaljärvi et al 2017 the average effective diffusion coefficients of mgn samples were 24 6 10 14 m2 s pp219 and 7 3 10 14 m2 s pp309 the difference is relatively small when taking into account the differences in mineral composition grain size and foliation it can be concluded that slightly larger grain size probably lower tortuosity of pore space and more heterogeneous structure of the pp219 drill core has caused its slightly larger de compared with one of pp309 drill core these values are also in accordance with the porosities pp219 0 24 0 04 pp309 0 07 0 01 typically a sample with higher porosity has a higher de than a sample with lower porosity if the pore structure remains similar the average effective diffusion coefficients for tgg samples were 6 4 10 14 m2 s pp175 and 64 11 10 14 m2 s kr56 the difference is over one order of magnitude and it reflects large differences in mineral composition and in pore structure between these rock samples examination of the mineral compositions reveal see table 1 that the pp175 samples have much higher content of biotite than the kr56 samples the pore space of biotite consists of space between the randomly ordered biotite grains and nanometer scale apertures between the biotite lamellae within each grain the nanometer scale pores have extremely low constrictivity and they tend to decrease the de of the rock if biotite content is high in this case straight conclusion according to porosity pp175 0 07 0 01 kr56 0 19 0 08 and de cannot be drawn due to the remarkable difference in mineral content and pore structure however the porosities happen to be larger for the samples from the drill core kr56 than the ones from the drill core pp175 for all of the samples determined effective diffusion coefficients are within the range of ones determined in earlier studies smellie et al 2014 however the values are closer to the high diffusivity end of typical values 3 2 distribution coefficients for intact rock and their up scaling factors the electromigration sorption experiments were done to determine the distribution coefficients of cesium and strontium for intact rock and to determine the upscaling factors for distribution coefficients from crushed to intact rock seven example curves for the concentration of cesium in the solution chambers as a function of time are shown in fig 3 these concentration curves represent the rate of sorption larger change indicates greater sorption and a larger distribution coefficient the experiments were run until a steady state concentration was reached typically the equilibrium was reached after 2000 7000 h see fig 3 the equilibrium concentration was then used for determining the distribution coefficients see table 3 it is obvious that porosity kd and ff of the rock affect the shape of the concentration curve and the time when equilibrium is reached the kd determines the value where the concentration levels out because electric potential is used to transport cesium through the sample and more importantly closer to the potential sorption sites the ff affects the curve part before leveling out in practice for samples with high ff the concentration becomes constant faster than the ones with low ff e g see curve for pp131 70 in fig 3 for samples with a low ff it takes a long time to achieve the equilibrium concentration since it takes time to reach the sorption sites even with electric potential as driving force the distribution coefficients were determined from the steady state concentration using eq 1 and the results for all rock samples and averages for studied rock types are given in table 3 the selection criteria for equilibrium concentration were as follows 1 if the concentration had leveled an average of the 2 3 last values was used 2 if the concentration had an increasing trend at the end of the experiment the average value of all points after an initial decrease was used 3 if the concentration was still decreasing at the end of the experiment sign was used to indicate that the steady state value is smaller than the presented one this means that steady state value for distribution coefficients crushed and intact are greater than the presented ones in this case the upscaling factor is given as most probable value and is indicated with sing the distribution coefficients of cesium for crushed rock were taken from curves presenting the distribution coefficients as a function of cesium concentration lehto et al 2018 at the same cesium concentration as was the equilibrium concentration in the electromigration sorption experiment with the same rock sample for the samples not studied by lehto et al 2018 pp131 51 kr43 pp131 70 and pp249 the distribution coefficients were determined by separate experiments with equilibrium concentration of about 50 μm that was a typical value for equilibrium concentration is these experiments the distribution coefficients of cesium for crushed rock are from 1 1 to 60 times greater than the ones of intact rock see table 3 in general the batch sorption experiments exaggerate the distribution coefficient of intact rock considerably and the average upscaling factors of 7 4 3 1 and 33 30 were determined for mgn tgg and pgr samples respectively the variances between different rock types however are not very similar for rock samples with a high biotite content the variation of the upscaling factors are rather similar whereas for pgr samples higher variation was observed for the mgn samples the upscaling factors vary from 1 1 to 12 for the tgg samples they vary from 1 4 to 4 7 and for pgr samples they vary from 1 2 to 60 in general the variations in the upscaling factors are rather high which might make it difficult to convert a distribution coefficient of single batch sorption to one for intact rock for mgn and tgg samples the variation can be explained by heterogeneity in the porespace and mineral content of the rock samples that can be seen in fig 1 furthermore for samples of each drill core there are both low and high upscaling factors determined previously kuva et al 2018 have shown the effect of mineral heterogeneity on the transport of cesium in crystalline rock samples from olkiluoto for pgr samples the low upscaling factors were determined for samples of pp131 70 and the high upscaling factors for the ones from pp249 the same applies also for distribution coefficients determined for both intact and crushed rock the pgr samples contain a few percent of biotite and variation in its content cannot explain this however it is plausible that the samples of the different drill core have undergone different alteration processes due to seritization and muscovization of plagioclase more reactive mineral grains and more surface area is created effect of this can be seen as a higher distribution coefficient of cesium for the samples of the drill core pp131 than the ones of the drill core pp249 when less altered drill core pp249 is crushed respectively more surface area is created and thus the upscaling factor becomes greater for less altered samples than for more altered ones lehto et al 2018 observed that crushing does not only create more surface on the outer surfaces of the grains but also the inner surface due to mechanical stress proportion of inner and outer surfaces varied considerably from sample to another and grain size affected significantly proportion it can be concluded that alteration state of the sample can affect considerably the distribution coefficient and the upscaling factor and thus a number of measurement using samples with different alteration states should be used in order to get a representative result for the average upscaling factor there was no clear correlation found between effective diffusion coefficient and distribution coefficient it seems that pore structure of the rock affects more the effective diffusion coefficient whereas the distribution coefficient and upscaling factor are more affected by the mineral content and alteration state the electromigration sorption experiments were done for strontium with drill cores pp219 mgn and pp175 tgg example curves for the decrease of strontium concentration in the solution phase as a function of time are shown in fig 4 as in the cesium experiments these experiments were run until an equilibrium concentration was reached typically 300 1400 h the equilibrium concentration was then used for determining the distribution coefficients see table 4 the concentration of strontium was still decreasing at the end of the experiments with pp175 samples and thus the distribution coefficients are given as lower limits in table 4 for drill core pp219 mgn the concentration starts to increase slightly after 20 60 days which is plausibly caused by small changes in water chemistry due to water rock interaction the effect of the concentration decrease has been however taken into account as higher uncertainty for equilibrium concentration for strontium the equilibrium concentration did not affect considerably the distribution coefficient for crushed rock at the studied concentration range lehto et al 2018 and thus the maximum values for the upscaling factors of pp175 samples are given the shape of the concentration curves and the value for leveling out were otherwise interpreted in the same way as for the cesium curves the concentration curves for mgn samples leveled out faster than the ones for tgg samples which is caused by systematic difference in the measured formation factors and effective diffusion coefficients the distribution coefficients of strontium for crushed rock have been measured by lehto et al 2018 the values of the upscaling factors for strontium did not differ considerably from those of cesium with mgn and tgg no experiments were done with pgr also for strontium the batch sorption experiments exaggerate the distribution coefficient of intact rock considerably and the average upscaling factors of 4 3 and 7 2 were determined for mgn and tgg respectively see table 3 for the mgn samples the upscaling factors vary from 2 4 to 12 for the tgg samples they vary from 3 to 10 5 as in the measurements using cesium the variation in mineral content and heterogeneity can explain the variation of results within both rock types furthermore there was no correlation found between the upscaling factor and effective diffusion coefficient in general there is no significant difference between the results of cesium and strontium and thus it can be concluded that variation in the mineral content and properties of the rock affect more the results than radionuclide in question here we have used cesium and strontium that both are sorbed on the mineral surfaces by ion exchange 4 discussion the determined porosities and diffusion coefficients were within the range of ones determined in earlier studies however the values for effective diffusion coefficients were closer to the high diffusivity end of typical values while the porosities were closer to the low porosity end these findings are in contradiction as in general effective diffusion coefficient increases with increasing porosity observed effect is likely arising from the slight overestimation of the effective diffusion coefficients by the electrical formation factor measurements löfgren 2015 compared effective diffusion coefficients determined by through diffusion measurements and electrical formation factor measurements from earlier studies and found that the electrical methods tend to overestimate the effective diffusion coefficient by a factor of 1 2 to 2 4 potentially due to presence of electrically conductive mineral grains the variation in the over estimation is fairly high and is clearly dependent on the content of the electrically conductive mineral grains within the transport routes on the other hand the content of these minerals must correlate with the rock type in order to improve knowledge between overestimation and rock type further studies could be performed it was shown that the distribution coefficients for intact rock are considerably lower than the ones determined for crushed rock however the variations of the upscaling factors were found to be rather high which reduces their applicability when converting results of batch sorption experiments for intact rock the upscaling factors give further insight which kind of values should be used when estimating the distribution coefficient of intact rock based on results for crushed rock as most of the distribution coefficients used in current safety assessment are determined by batch sorption experiments however in future studies it would be beneficial to use the electromigration sorption experiments for determining distribution coefficients in order to increase the confidence of the results currently the batch sorption experiments are needed for studying the sorption of redox sensitive radionuclides in theory it might be possible to study the sorption and diffusion of the redox sensitive radionuclides this however would require further development of the measurement setup and experimental techniques due to e g the effect of electrical voltage on the oxidation state 5 conclusions the main aim of this work was to determine the distribution coefficients of intact rock and to produce the upscaling factors of distribution coefficients determined by batch sorption experiments to those of intact rock to this end the electromigration sorption experiments were performed here for intact samples and the upscaling factors were determined using the distribution coefficients determined for crushed rock samples by lehto et al 2018 it was shown that the distribution coefficients of cesium and strontium for intact rock are considerably lower than the ones determined for crushed rock and thus it can be concluded that the electromigration sorption experiments offer a more realistic approach to determine the distribution coefficients of radionuclides for intact rock the average upscaling factor for different rock types varied from 3 to 33 that shows large variation within rock types these factors can be used to convert the distribution coefficients of cesium and strontium for crushed rock to ones for intact rock it was concluded that heterogeneity of the rock alteration state and mineral content affect the distribution coefficients and further the upscaling factors the upscaling factors for cesium and strontium are very similar and the properties of the rock affect more the results than the radionuclide in question in general the sorption parameters determined here offer ways for a less conservative approach with respect to the current approach for the safety assessment of spent nuclear fuel repositories furthermore the methods used here can be applied for other safety relevant anionic and cationic radionuclides the determined effective diffusion coefficients and porosities were in agreement with previously determined values for samples of olkiluoto the methods applied offer fast and reliable ways to measure these parameters before the electromigration sorption experiments without destroying the samples in the end all three parameters of bedrock used in the safety assessment of the spent nuclear fuel repositories were determined here for exactly the same samples the values can be directly applied in the safety assessment and they can be used to increase its confidence and decrease the conservativeness of the values used current in safety assessment 
1637,this study aims to determine upscaling factors for the radionuclides distribution coefficients kd on crushed rocks to intact rock for the safety analysis of radionuclide migration from spent nuclear fuel in bedrock towards biosphere here we report the distribution coefficients for intact rock determined by electromigration sorption experiments and compare the results with those from recently performed batch sorption experiments in total 34 rock samples representing three typical rock types from olkiluoto finland were studied in order to determine distribution coefficients effective diffusion coefficients and porosities using the electromigration sorption experiments formation factor experiments and porosity measurement the parameters determined represent the three main parameters of geosphere used in the safety assessment of spent nuclear fuel disposal the distribution coefficients of cesium and strontium on intact rock varied between 0 12 26 2 10 3 m3 kg and 1 4 13 3 10 3 m3 kg respectively whereas recent results for crushed rock varied between 2 57 10 3 m3 kg and 17 40 10 3 m3 kg respectively this implies that crushing increases the distribution coefficient significantly and upscaling factors from 3 to 33 were determined for scaling the distribution coefficients of crushed rock to ones of intact rock the determined distribution coefficients of cesium and strontium for intact rock can be directly applied in the safety assessment whereas the upscaling factors can be used to convert distribution coefficients determined for crushed rock into ones for intact rock based on the results for porosities and effective diffusion coefficients it was concluded that they do not seem to correlate with sorption parameters however an alteration state heterogeneity and mineral content seem to be important factors affecting the distribution coefficients and upscaling factors keywords electromigration sorption distribution coefficient formation factor effective diffusion coefficient porosity 1 introduction in finland the spent nuclear fuel from the currently operating nuclear power reactors will be disposed of in a bedrock repository at a depth of about 400 m in the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel in geological formations such as bedrock in finland the rock above the waste acts as the last barrier against the release of radionuclides into the biosphere this has been taken into account in the safety assessment of the final disposal concept by the evaluation of the transport properties of radionuclides in the bedrock the retardation mechanisms of radionuclides in bedrock are matrix diffusion and sorption on the minerals posiva 2013 in the safety assessment effective porosity diffusion coefficient and distribution coefficient kd define the transport properties of the rock and the magnitude of matrix diffusion and sorption the effective diffusion coefficient depends only slightly on the considered radionuclide while the distribution coefficient varies strongly from radionuclide to another furthermore the transport parameters especially the distribution coefficient depend on the rock type and the mineral composition of rock the porosity is fairly straightforward to determine while the distribution and effective diffusion coefficient offer challenges particularly in case of crystalline rock the distribution coefficients are typically determined using crushed rock this however creates new surface area directly in contact with water molecules capable of sorbing radionuclides and thus distribution coefficients determined using crushed rock samples overestimate the distribution coefficient of intact rock it has been found out that the distribution coefficients determined using crushed rock can be significantly higher than the ones determined using intact rock crawford 2010 furthermore the batch sorption experiments are typically performed using a water rock ratios that are not realistic for intact rocks the diffusion coefficients on the other hand are typically measured using long lasting and tedious experiments there are a great number of distribution coefficients determined by batch sorption experiments available hakanen et al 2012 currently conservative estimates for the upscaling factors have to be used before they can be used to estimate the distribution coefficient of intact rock in the safety assessment however their utilization using less conservative approaches would be beneficial and it has not been thoroughly investigated so far to this end a systematic study to determine the upscaling factors for distribution coefficients from crushed to intact rock was performed the distribution coefficient of cesium and strontium were determined for the most common rock types of olkiluoto using the electromigration sorption experiments on drill core samples in order to obtain the factors suitable for upscaling these results were compared with the ones determined using batch sorption experiments in a recent study lehto et al 2018 cesium and strontium exist as cations in aqueous solutions cs and sr2 and their sorption mechanism on mineral surfaces is ion exchange that can be taken into account in safety assessment using kd concept in crystalline rock samples mica minerals have the highest sorption capacity of cesium and the ion exchange takes place on basal planes on crystal surfaces frayed edge sites and third type sites kyllönen et al 2014 the electromigration sorption experiments have been previously developed and tested by andré et al 2006 2008 2009 the method is based on enhancing the migration of ions into the intact rock by applying electrical potential over a drill core sample due to the enhancement longer rock cores can be used than in traditional through diffusion experiments tachi et al 2015 and thus effects arising from sample preparation e g drilling and sawing are reduced due to the experimental setup the measurement cannot be used for determining effective diffusion coefficients however they were estimated using the same experimental setup by performing electrical resistivity measurements that offer information on a formation factor and can be used further to estimate the effective diffusion coefficient löfgren and neretnieks 2003 the method has been widely used in a swedish program of the spent nuclear fuel disposal and its limitations and advantages have been thoroughly discussed by löfgren 2015 in general the method is faster than traditional through diffusion experiments that are used for determining the effective diffusion coefficient the method has been further developed in order to perform the through electromigration experiments löfgren and neretnieks 2006 furthermore the porosities of the samples were determined using water saturation and immersion methods voutilainen et al 2012 this work aims to determine the three most important transport parameters of bedrock distribution coefficients effective diffusion coefficients and porosity related to safety assessment for intact rock samples the aim is to test the experimental methods for a wide range of rock samples from olkiluoto finland and to produce transport parameters that can be used directly in safety assessment furthermore we propose the upscaling factors for converting the distribution coefficients obtained by batch sorption experiments with crushed rock into ones for intact rock the rock samples and their mineral compositions as well as the electrical methods for measuring effective diffusion coefficient and distribution coefficient and porosity measurements are described in the work 2 materials and methods 2 1 bedrock of olkiluoto olkiluoto bedrock consists of four major rock types contents given in parentheses migmatitic gneisses 64 pegmatitic granites 20 gneisses 9 and tonalite granodiorite granite gneisses 8 the main minerals in these rocks are quartz 25 35 potassium feldspar 5 35 plagioclase 15 35 and biotite 10 30 kärki and paulamäki 2006 an exception for biotite is the pegmatitic granite the biotite content of which is low round 1 in addition to biotite these rocks contain other mica minerals e g muscovite but at lower content the rocks contain also pinite and sericite the alteration products of cordierite and plagioclase these minerals are known to have a major effect to sorption capacity due to their mineral structure alteration state and chemical composition of the rock and thus to the retention of radionuclide migration in crystalline rocks torstenfelt et al 1982 2 2 rock samples the electromigration sorption experiments were done with altogether 32 drill core samples 26 for cesium and 6 for strontium furthermore formation factors and effective diffusion coefficients were measured for 24 and porosities for all 32 of these samples the selected samples represent three of the typical rock types in olkiluoto mica gneiss mgn tonalite granodiorite granite gneiss tgg and pegmatitic granite pgr for four mgn and tgg drill core samples pp309 pp219 kr56 pp175 the mineralogical composition was determined by several methods see table 1 for these samples batch experiments were done as a function of grain size and as a function of cesium and strontium concentration and the specific surface areas of various grain sizes were measured lehto et al 2018 the samples for these experiments were taken from the same drill cores as close as possible to the drill core samples for the electromigration sorption experiments see fig 1 for four other drill cores kr43 pp131 51 pp131 70 pp249 only one batch sorption experiment was done using the equilibrium concentrations of cesium and strontium from the electromigration experiments the mineral contents of these latter four rock samples in table 1 are the average values of the minerals in these rock types and they were taken from kärki and paulamäki 2006 the drill core samples diameter 50 mm were cut with a diamond blade saw to 3 30 mm long sections for the electromigration sorption experiments as an example two mgn drill cores are shown fig 1 exactly the same samples were used in porosity and electrical formation factor measurements 2 3 volumetric porosity experiments the volumetric porosities of the drill core samples were determined by the water saturation method first the samples were dried in a vacuum to a constant weight the bulk volumes of the rock samples were determined by a water immersion method voutilainen et al 2012 then the samples were put into a vessel where vacuum was pumped and deionized water millipore milli q was added to the vessel the rock samples were saturated under water for three weeks then the weights of the rock samples were measured after their surfaces were quickly dried the difference of the dry and wet weights gave the amount of water inside the rock the volume of the water and further the volumetric porosities of the rock samples were determined using the density of water and the bulk volumes of the samples possible systematical uncertainty sources of the experiment arise from remaining water after drying and remaining air after water saturation here the drying and water saturation were continued until constant weight in order to minimize the effect of these uncertainty sources 2 4 electromigration sorption experiments the experimental setup for electromigration is presented in fig 2 the setup consists of an experimental vessel that was made of acrylic plastic and it contained two chambers that were separated by a drill core sample the chambers were filled with 0 01 m nacl solution and platinum electrodes were placed in the chambers in order to prevent creation of ph and concentration gradients over the sample due to the electric current solutions in the chambers were mixed continuously with each other using a peristaltic pump the flow of solution from chamber to the other was made drop wise to prevent the electrical connection along the water column in tubes before adding the cesium and strontium tracers an electrical potential over the sample was applied and it was kept for at least two weeks in order to stabilize the system after this 134cscl 1 10 4 m cscl or 85srcl2 1 10 6 m srcl2 was added into the nacl solution and the tracer concentration in the chambers was measured by taking samples of the mixed solution the total volume of solution varied from 233 ml to 403 ml the total volume of solution was kept constant by adding deionized milli q water in order to compensate the decomposed water to h2 and o2 due to electrolysis at the electrodes the concentrations of cesium and strontium were determined by measuring their activity in the water samples using a gamma counter perkin elmer 1480 wizard after the measurement the water samples were brought back into the experimental system in order to maintain the total activity of the solution the measured concentrations were then compared with the initial concentrations and the kd values of 134cs and 85sr for the rock samples were determined using equation 1 k d v s m 100 s where v is the total volume of the solution s is the sorption percentage and m is the mass of the rock sample 2 5 formation factor and effective diffusion coefficient experiments the formation factors of the drill core samples were determined using the electrical method löfgren and neretnieks 2003 before the experiments the drill core samples were saturated with 0 01 m nacl solution for two weeks and the saturated samples were then placed in the electromigration system described in the previous section the voltage over the rock sample was then gradually increased from 1 v to 30 v and the electric current through the rock sample was measured as a function of the voltage following analysis was performed in order to determine the formation factors from measured data first the resistivity of the rock sample ρ was determined by using equation löfgren and neretnieks 2003 2 ρ a l u i 2 l w κ w a e where a is cross sectional area of the rock sample and l is the length of the rock sample δu is the measured electrical potential over the rock sample i is the measured electric current lw is the thickness of the water column between the sample and the electrode κw is the conductivity of the solution and ae is the inner surface area of the chamber the formation factor ff can then be determined from the resistivity of the rock sample by using equation löfgren and neretnieks 2003 3 f f 1 ρ κ w in practice the ff is a measure for pore structures influence on the resistance of the sample typically the effective diffusion coefficient de can be estimated from ff using the equation 4 d e f f d 0 where d0 is the diffusion coefficient of the tracer ion in water here it is assumed that pore space of the rock affects the effective diffusion coefficient and resistivity of the rock similarly this assumption leads to ff being equivalent with the pore geometry factor g that commonly defined to be a function of porosity and tortuosity in our experiments there were cl and na ions in the solution and their diffusion coefficients in water at room temperature are 2 0 10 9 m2 s and 1 3 10 9 m2 s respectively their average value 1 65 10 9 m2 s was used when determining the effective diffusion coefficients 3 results 3 1 porosities formation factors and effective diffusion coefficients the porosities formation factors and effective diffusion coefficients of the drill core samples used in the electromigration sorption experiments are presented in table 2 the observed porosity values represent the typical values for rock samples taken from the olkiluoto area smellie et al 2014 however these values are closer to the low porous end of typical values there was no correlation found between the determined porosities and rock type that is typical for crystalline rock samples taken from the same site the results for ff and de are given as an uncertainty weighted averages over all independent measurements here different electric potentials and their uncertainties were taken into account the variations of the results over each drill core and rock type arise from the heterogeneity of the rock and more importantly the heterogeneity of the pore structure such variations are common in crystalline rock at the studied scale sammaljärvi et al 2017 the average effective diffusion coefficients of mgn samples were 24 6 10 14 m2 s pp219 and 7 3 10 14 m2 s pp309 the difference is relatively small when taking into account the differences in mineral composition grain size and foliation it can be concluded that slightly larger grain size probably lower tortuosity of pore space and more heterogeneous structure of the pp219 drill core has caused its slightly larger de compared with one of pp309 drill core these values are also in accordance with the porosities pp219 0 24 0 04 pp309 0 07 0 01 typically a sample with higher porosity has a higher de than a sample with lower porosity if the pore structure remains similar the average effective diffusion coefficients for tgg samples were 6 4 10 14 m2 s pp175 and 64 11 10 14 m2 s kr56 the difference is over one order of magnitude and it reflects large differences in mineral composition and in pore structure between these rock samples examination of the mineral compositions reveal see table 1 that the pp175 samples have much higher content of biotite than the kr56 samples the pore space of biotite consists of space between the randomly ordered biotite grains and nanometer scale apertures between the biotite lamellae within each grain the nanometer scale pores have extremely low constrictivity and they tend to decrease the de of the rock if biotite content is high in this case straight conclusion according to porosity pp175 0 07 0 01 kr56 0 19 0 08 and de cannot be drawn due to the remarkable difference in mineral content and pore structure however the porosities happen to be larger for the samples from the drill core kr56 than the ones from the drill core pp175 for all of the samples determined effective diffusion coefficients are within the range of ones determined in earlier studies smellie et al 2014 however the values are closer to the high diffusivity end of typical values 3 2 distribution coefficients for intact rock and their up scaling factors the electromigration sorption experiments were done to determine the distribution coefficients of cesium and strontium for intact rock and to determine the upscaling factors for distribution coefficients from crushed to intact rock seven example curves for the concentration of cesium in the solution chambers as a function of time are shown in fig 3 these concentration curves represent the rate of sorption larger change indicates greater sorption and a larger distribution coefficient the experiments were run until a steady state concentration was reached typically the equilibrium was reached after 2000 7000 h see fig 3 the equilibrium concentration was then used for determining the distribution coefficients see table 3 it is obvious that porosity kd and ff of the rock affect the shape of the concentration curve and the time when equilibrium is reached the kd determines the value where the concentration levels out because electric potential is used to transport cesium through the sample and more importantly closer to the potential sorption sites the ff affects the curve part before leveling out in practice for samples with high ff the concentration becomes constant faster than the ones with low ff e g see curve for pp131 70 in fig 3 for samples with a low ff it takes a long time to achieve the equilibrium concentration since it takes time to reach the sorption sites even with electric potential as driving force the distribution coefficients were determined from the steady state concentration using eq 1 and the results for all rock samples and averages for studied rock types are given in table 3 the selection criteria for equilibrium concentration were as follows 1 if the concentration had leveled an average of the 2 3 last values was used 2 if the concentration had an increasing trend at the end of the experiment the average value of all points after an initial decrease was used 3 if the concentration was still decreasing at the end of the experiment sign was used to indicate that the steady state value is smaller than the presented one this means that steady state value for distribution coefficients crushed and intact are greater than the presented ones in this case the upscaling factor is given as most probable value and is indicated with sing the distribution coefficients of cesium for crushed rock were taken from curves presenting the distribution coefficients as a function of cesium concentration lehto et al 2018 at the same cesium concentration as was the equilibrium concentration in the electromigration sorption experiment with the same rock sample for the samples not studied by lehto et al 2018 pp131 51 kr43 pp131 70 and pp249 the distribution coefficients were determined by separate experiments with equilibrium concentration of about 50 μm that was a typical value for equilibrium concentration is these experiments the distribution coefficients of cesium for crushed rock are from 1 1 to 60 times greater than the ones of intact rock see table 3 in general the batch sorption experiments exaggerate the distribution coefficient of

make it difficult to convert a distribution coefficient of single batch sorption to one for intact rock for mgn and tgg samples the variation can be explained by heterogeneity in the porespace and mineral content of the rock samples that can be seen in fig 1 furthermore for samples of each drill core there are both low and high upscaling factors determined previously kuva et al 2018 have shown the effect of mineral heterogeneity on the transport of cesium in crystalline rock samples from olkiluoto for pgr samples the low upscaling factors were determined for samples of pp131 70 and the high upscaling factors for the ones from pp249 the same applies also for distribution coefficients determined for both intact and crushed rock the pgr samples contain a few percent of biotite and variation

that heterogeneity of the rock alteration state and mineral content affect the distribution coefficients and further the upscaling factors the upscaling factors for cesium and strontium are very similar and the properties of the rock affect more the results than the radionuclide in question in general the sorption parameters determined here offer ways for a less conservative approach with respect to the current approach for the safety assessment of spent nuclear fuel repositories furthermore the methods used here can be applied for other safety relevant anionic and cationic radionuclides the determined effective diffusion coefficients and porosities were in agreement with previously determined values for samples of olkiluoto the methods applied offer fast and reliable ways to measure these parameters before the electromigration sorption experiments without destroying the samples in the end all three parameters of bedrock used in the safety assessment of the spent nuclear fuel repositories were determined here for exactly the same samples the values can be directly applied in the safety assessment and they can be used to increase its confidence and decrease the conservativeness of the values used current in safety assessment 
1638,polyfluorinated benzoic acids pbas can be used as non reactive tracers to characterize reactive mass transport mechanisms in groundwater the use of pbas as non reactive tracers assumes that their reactivities are negligible if this assumption is not valid pbas may not be appropriate to use as non reactive tracers in this study the reactivity of two pbas 2 6 difluorobenzoic acid 2 6 dfba and pentafluorobenzoic acid pfba was tested in situ a series of two single well push pull tests were conducted in two hydrogeologically similar yet spatially distinct groundwater monitoring wells bromide 2 6 dfba and pfba were added to the injection fluid and periodically measured in the extraction fluid along with chloride nitrate sulfate and fluoride linear regression of the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of both pbas indicated zero order decay accompanied by nitrate and subsequent sulfate removal the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of chloride a non reactive halide similar to bromide showed no evidence of reactivity these results strongly suggested that biodegradation of both pbas occurred under anaerobic conditions the results of this study implied that pbas may not be appropriate to use as non reactive tracers in certain hydrogeologic settings presumably those where they can serve as carbon and or electron donors to stimulate microbial activity future studies would benefit from using ring 14c labeled pbas to determine the fate of carbon combined with microbial analyses to characterize the pba degrading members of the microbial community keywords tracer fluorobenzoic acid biodegradation anaerobic 1 introduction the use of tracers is important for the accurate characterization of physical chemical and biological processes in hydrologic settings davis et al 1980 defined a tracer as matter or energy carried by water that will give information concerning the direction and or velocity of the water as well as potential contaminants that could be transported by the water tracers can exist naturally or be released artificially and exist in many forms including dyes halides stable isotopes radionuclides colloids bacteria fluorocarbons and heat abbott et al 2016 becker and coplen 2001 davis et al 1980 flury and wai 2003 herczeg and leaney 2011 koeniger et al 2016 phillips 1995 rau et al 2014 thompson et al 1974 ideally a hydrologic tracer should be non toxic inexpensive easy to detect high in specificity and most importantly non reactive meaning that it does not undergo transformations or attach to solids the in situ use of fluorocarbons as artificial and non reactive tracers particularly polyfluorinated benzoic acids pbas has been substantial in the past several decades due to their nearly ideal characteristics bowman and gibbens 1992 bowman and rice 1986 dahan et al 1999 hu et al 2001 jaynes et al 2001 kung et al 2000 lu et al 2011 meigs and beauheim 2001 queloz et al 2015a reimus et al 2003 salve et al 2004 pbas can be especially useful for characterizing unique groundwater flow paths dahan et al 1999 jaynes et al 2001 kung et al 2000 this is due to the many isomers of di tri and tetra fluorobenzoic acids and pentafluorobenzoic acid all of which have nearly identical transport characteristics yet are analytically discernable benson and bowman 1994 hu and moran 2005 perhaps the most common use of pbas is to characterize diffusive mass transport from mobile to immobile pore and or fracture matrices i e matrix diffusion callahan et al 2000 hu and brusseau 1995 hu et al 2001 lu et al 2011 meigs and beauheim 2001 reimus et al 2003 salve et al 2004 this is due to their relatively low aqueous diffusion coefficients with respect to commonly and concurrently used halide tracers such as bromide and chloride flury and wai 2003 hu and moran 2005 however it is well known that pbas are not ideal under low ph conditions where significant sorption has been observed onto soil organic matter benson and bowman 1994 boggs and adams 1992 mccarthy et al 2000 seaman 1998 furthermore there is relatively sparse yet mounting evidence that pbas are susceptible to biodegradation under certain conditions cass et al 1987 nimmo et al 1990 queloz et al 2015a queloz et al 2015b a study by cass et al 1987 demonstrated biodegradation of 2 5 difluorobenzoic acid 2 5 dfba by pseudomonas putida by showing that 85 of the total fluorine in 2 5 dfba was biotransformed to fluoride ion in a laboratory experiment conducted with synthetic growth media under aerobic conditions p putida once considered an obligate aerobe has since been recognized as a ubiquitous and metabolically versatile bacterium with the genetic potential to degrade halogenated organic compounds under oxygen limited conditions dos santos et al 2004 more recently p putida strains have been isolated under anaerobic conditions freikowski et al 2010 pascual et al 2015 nimmo et al 1990 demonstrated complete mineralization of ring 14c labeled 2 6 difluorobenzoic acid 2 6 dfba to 14co2 in a laboratory experiment conducted with two different soils under aerobic conditions it was assumed that degradation of 2 6 dfba was microbial mediated more recently queloz et al 2015a provided evidence of microbial mediated degradation of di and tri fluorobenzoic acids within highly controlled and vegetated hydrologic mesocosms based on mass balance analyses the experimental results were then corroborated with theoretical analyses and model simulations queloz et al 2015b it is becoming clearer that pbas are indeed susceptible to biodegradation in the laboratory and may also biodegrade under certain field conditions presumably those where they can serve as carbon and or electron donors to stimulate microbial activity it is also clear that there is no such thing as a perfectly ideal tracer hu and moran 2005 suggested that the transport behavior of any potential tracer under relevant geochemical conditions preferably in the field should be evaluated before beginning ambitious large scale field tracer experiments the objective of this study was to test the in situ reactivity of four non reactive tracers bromide chloride 2 6 dfba and pentafluorobenzoic acid pfba in a shallow unconfined and heterogeneous aquifer the hypothesis of this study was that the pbas would be susceptible to biodegradation this hypothesis was informed by the characteristics of the aquifer that suggested biodegradation as opposed to matrix diffusion or sorption would likely be the dominant non ideal mass transport transformation mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located within area 2 of the united states department of energy doe oak ridge reservation orr in oak ridge tennessee fig 1 the subsurface within area 2 is comprised of approximately 6 m of unconsolidated and heterogeneous fill materials e g silty and clayey fill related to historical construction activities underlain by undisturbed and weathered bedrock moon et al 2006 watson et al 2004 fig 2 slug and single well pumping tests indicated that the hydraulic conductivity of the fill materials was approximately two orders of magnitude greater than the weathered bedrock e g 10 6 versus 10 8 m s paradis et al 2018b fig 2 the study site contains 13 monitoring wells fw218 through fw230 two of which were used as test wells fw222 and fw224 and one as a source well fw228 for the injection fluid for the push pull tests fig 1 the test wells were installed by direct push geoprobe model 6610dt using a 3 8 cm outside diameter drive casing the test wells are constructed of 2 7 cm outside dimeter and 1 9 cm inside diameter schedule 80 polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe fig 2 the test wells are screened across the unconfined aquifer and in direct contact with the fill materials from 3 7 to 6 1 m below ground surface mbgs fig 2 the source well is constructed of 5 1 cm inside diameter pvc pipe and is screened within the fill materials the shallow groundwater aquifer is unconfined and the depth to groundwater is approximately 3 5 mbgs the average magnitude and direction of the hydraulic gradient is approximately 0 045 m m and to the south southwest respectively fig 1 single well pumping and push pull tests indicated that the hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity of the porous media associated with test wells were relatively similar paradis et al 2018a paradis et al 2018b table 1 groundwater sampling indicated that the ph of the aquifer fluid associated with the test wells is near neutral paradis et al 2016 table 1 microbial activity in area 2 and in the monitoring wells of the study site is known to be limited by carbon and or electron donors paradis et al 2016 watson et al 2004 2 2 push pull tests the single well push pull tests were conducted according to the methodology of istok 2013 and the data was analyzed according to the methodology of paradis et al 2018b a push pull test is conducted by injecting a volume of water containing one or more non reactive and reactive tracers into a single well push phase followed by a non pumping period rest phase and subsequent extraction of groundwater from the same well pull phase the extraction fluid is comprised of a mixture between the injection and aquifer fluids the concentration of a reactive tracer in the extraction fluid can be adjusted for dilution based on the concentration of a non reactive tracer to generate a dilution adjusted concentration versus time elapsed profile dilution adjusted breakthrough curve any deviation of the dilution adjusted breakthrough curve of the reactive tracer from its injected concentration can be attributed to reactivity if the mass transport characteristics both the non reactive and reactive tracers e g advection mechanical dispersion molecular diffusion and sorption are no different analysis of the dilution adjusted breakthrough curve can be utilized to quantify the reaction rate of a tracer by fitting it an appropriate kinetic model e g zero order first order michaelis menton etc ten liters of groundwater were collected from the source well fw228 fig 1 using a peristaltic pump and stored in a plastic carboy potassium bromide kbr 2 6 dfba c7h4o2f2 and pfba c7ho2f5 sigma aldrich inc 98 purity were added to the 10 liters of groundwater to create an injection fluid that contained 100 mg l of bromide br and de protonated 2 6 dfba c7h3o2f2 and pfba c7o2f5 the injection fluid was thoroughly mixed by recirculation using a peristaltic pump during mixing of the injection fluid three samples were collected filtered 0 2 μm filter stored in 20 ml scintillation vials preserved at 4 c and promptly analyzed for bromide chloride 2 6 dfba pfba nitrate sulfate and fluoride by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 immediately prior to the injection three samples were collected from the test well to determine the concentrations of bromide chloride 2 6 dfba pfba nitrate sulfate and fluoride in the aquifer fluid associated with the test well these samples were processed identically to the injection fluid samples the 10 liter injection fluid was pumped into the test well at approximately 250 to 500 ml min immediately after the injection a 35 minute resting i e non pumping period occurred groundwater comprised of a mixture of the injection and aquifer fluids was then continuously extracted from the test well at approximately 125 ml min until 22 to 24 l was collected samples were collected every liter for the first 10 l of extracted fluid and every two liters thereafter e g at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 14 etc liters extracted these samples were processed identically to the injection and aquifer fluid samples the first push pull test was conducted in test well fw222 because it is located approximately 6 m down side gradient of test well fw224 fig 1 and therefore unlikely to have influenced the aquifer fluid associated with test well fw224 the radius of influence of the injection fluid can be estimated from istok 2013 as given by 1 r i v i πb n e r w 2 1 2 where r i radius of influence l v i volume of injection fluid l3 b saturated aquifer thickness l n e effective porosity dimensionless r w radius of test well l eq 1 assumes that the aquifer is confined homogeneous and isotropic and that the transport of the injection fluid is radial governed by advection and not affected by ambient groundwater flow therefore the radius of influence of the 10 liter injection fluid was approximately 0 25 m 2 3 data analysis the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of bromide chloride dfba pfba nitrate sulfate and fluoride were generated according to the method by paradis et al 2018b as given by 2 c e 2 c e 2 c i 2 c e 2 e where c e 2 dilution adjusted

concentrations at time equal to zero 2 the concentrations of both tracers are equal to their aquifer concentrations as time approaches infinity and 3 the mass transport characteristics both the non reactive and reactive tracers e g advection mechanical dispersion molecular diffusion and sorption are no different during a push pull test each independent variable in eq 3 is measured therefore eq 3 can be used to compare the expected concentration of a reactive tracer c e 2e to the measured concentration of a reactive tracer c e 2 any difference between the two concentrations can be attributed to reactivity eq 2 accounts for such differences and allows for generating a dilution adjusted breakthrough curve of a reactive tracer the dilution adjusted breakthrough curve from eq 2 can be utilized to quantify the reaction rate of a tracer linear regression of the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves was performed using the microsoft excel data analysis regression tool 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre test conditions the concentrations of bromide 2 6 dfba and pfba in the injection fluid were approximately 400 times greater than within the aquifer fluid table 2 the relatively high concentrations of bromide 2 6 dfba and pfba were expected because these tracers were added to the injection fluid to establish a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio with respect to the aquifer fluid the concentrations of nitrate and sulfate in the injection fluid were approximately 17 and 3 times greater than within the aquifer fluid respectively table 2 and their relatively high concentrations were not expected because these tracers were not added to the injection fluid and were therefore naturally present within the aquifer fluid obtained from the nearby and up gradient source well fw228 fig 1 these results suggested that the spatial variability of some tracers e g nitrate and sulfate within the shallow and unconfined aquifer were considerable the concentrations of chloride and fluoride in the injection and aquifer fluids were not identical but nevertheless very similar table 2 despite the spatial variability of nitrate and sulfate the concentrations of other tracers within the injection and aquifer fluids of the test wells were relatively similar table 2 moreover the physical characteristics of the porous media and the ph near neutral of the aquifer fluid associated with the test wells were relatively similar table 1 therefore the test wells were hydrogeologically similar tables 1 and 2 yet spatially distinct as indicated by test well fw222 being located down gradient with respect to test well fw224 fig 1 making the pair of wells ideal for in situ experimentation 3 2 push pull tests 3 2 1 bromide and chloride the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of bromide were identical to their injected concentrations of 100 mg l table 2 for the duration of the tests in both wells fig 3 according to eqs 2 and 3 the dilution adjusted breakthrough curve of the pre determined non reactive tracer e g bromide will always be equal to its injected concentration if the assumptions of the analytical method by paradis et al 2018b are valid therefore any deviation of the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of all other tracers e g chloride 2 6 dfba pfba nitrate sulfate and fluoride from their injected concentrations can be attributed to reactivity the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of chloride were nearly identical to their injected concentrations of 18 0 and 19 6 mg l table 2 for the duration of the tests in wells fw222 and fw224 respectively fig 3 these results strongly suggested that the mass transport characteristics of chloride e g advection mechanical dispersion molecular diffusion and sorption were no different than bromide these results were expected based on the nearly identical physical properties of bromide and chloride e g aqueous solubility and aqueous diffusion coefficients and their observed non reactive transport in a wide range of hydrogeological settings davis et al 1980 eggenkamp and coleman 2009 flury and wai 2003 hu and moran 2005 3 2 2 2 6 dfba and pfba the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of 2 6 dfba and pfba showed strong and linear decreases starting from slightly above their injected concentrations of 100 mg l table 2 for the duration of the tests in both wells fig 4 the zero order decay coefficients for 2 6 dfba and pfba in both wells were similar statistically significant and ranged from 3 0 0 8 to 4 5 0 4 mg l h fig 4 these results strongly suggested that the mass transfer and or transformation processes that affected 2 6 dfba and pfba were significantly different in magnitude and or type than those that affected bromide the dilution adjusted concentrations of 2 6 dfba and pfba were slightly above their injected concentrations of 100 mg l these elevated values were likely due to their difference in diffusion coefficient with respect to bromide the diffusion coefficient of bromide is approximately 3 times greater than those of 2 6 dfba and pfba flury and wai 2003 hu and moran 2005 therefore preferential diffusive mass transport of bromide would likely result in expected concentrations of 2 6 dfba and pfba lower than their measured concentrations an inspection of eq 2 shows that when the expected concentration of a reactive tracer c e 2e is less than its measured concentration c e 2 the dilution adjusted concentration c e 2 is greater than its injected concentration c i 2 sorption of 2 6 dfba and pfba was likely negligible based on a previous study by mccarthy et al 2000 that demonstrated that sorption of 2 6 dfba pfba and bromide were nearly identical in laboratory experiments conducted with sediments from within the oak ridge reserve under circumneutral ph conditions the ph of the aquifer fluid associated with the test wells is near neutral paradis et al 2016 degradation of 2 6 dfba was possible based on a previous study by nimmo et al 1990 that demonstrated that ring 14c labeled 2 6 dfba was degraded to 14co2 in a laboratory experiment conducted with two different soils under aerobic conditions it was assumed that degradation of 2 6 dfba was microbial mediated moreover microbial mediated biotransformation of 2 5 dfba a nearly identical isomer of 2 6 dfba by p putida was demonstrated in a study by cass et al 1987 that showed that 85 of the total fluorine in 2 5 dfba was biotransformed to fluoride ion in a laboratory experiment conducted with synthetic growth media pseudomonas species have been commonly detected in sediments and groundwater at the oak ridge reserve cardenas et al 2008 fields et al 2005 although degradation of pfba was also possible the only studies to date that have demonstrated pfba degradation were associated with ultraviolet assisted photo defluorination ravichandran et al 2007 ravichandran et al 2010 in contrast numerous studies both in the laboratory and in situ have demonstrated that the mass transport of 2 6 dfba and pfba in unsaturated and saturated porous media were nearly identical to bromide becker and coplen 2001 bowman and gibbens 1992 hu and moran 2005 mccarthy et al 2000 which makes the results presented here relatively interesting however previous studies typically compared percent mass recovery and mean retention or arrival times becker and coplen 2001 bowman and gibbens 1992 hu and moran 2005 mccarthy et al 2000 which theoretically can be similar if the effects of diffusive mass transport of bromide and biodegradation of 2 6 dfba and pfba result in similar breakthrough curves moreover relatively few previous studies were conducted in situ and those that were were not conducted in anaerobic aquifers becker and coplen 2001 bowman and gibbens 1992 microbial mediated anaerobic degradation of mono fluorobenzoic acids e g 2 3 and 4 fluorobenzoic acids under nitrate and sulfate reducing conditions has been well documented in the literature kiel and engesser 2015 therefore the zero order decay of 2 6 dfba and pfba was likely due biodegradation under anaerobic conditions as opposed to matrix diffusion or sorption nitrate and sulfate are the predominant dissolved phase electron acceptors at the study site paradis et al 2016 and were measured in the injection and aquifer fluids immediately prior to conducting the push pull tests table 2 therefore if the zero order decay of 2 6 dfba and pfba was primarily due to biodegradation under anaerobic conditions it would be expected that sequential nitrate and sulfate reduction would occur nitrate is a higher energy yielding electron acceptor than sulfate and would theoretically be preferentially depleted before the onset of sulfate reduction essaid et al 2015 it would also be expected that defluorination of 2 6 dfba and pfba would occur and therefore result in the production of fluoride ion kiel and engesser 2015 the complete oxidation of 2 6 dfba and pfba to carbon dioxide coupled to reduction of nitrate and sulfate can be described by the following equations 4 5 c 7 h 3 o 2 f 2 26 n o 3 21 h 35 c o 2 10 f 13 n 2 18 h 2 o 5 3 c 7 h 3 o 2 f 2 13 s o 4 2 23 h 21 c o 2 6 f 13 s 16 h 2 o 6 c 7 o 2 f 5 4 n o 3 7 c o 2 5 f 2 n 2 7 3 c 7 o 2 f 5 10 s o 4 2 8 h 21 c o 2 15 f 10 s 4 h 2 o it is important to note that solid phase electron acceptors e g manganese and ferric oxides are known to be present within area 2 moon et al 2006 and therefore had the potential to serve as electron acceptors in addition to nitrate and sulfate manganese and ferric oxides are typically less energetically favorable than nitrate but more energetically favorable than sulfate as electron acceptors essaid et al 2015 3 2 3 sulfate nitrate and fluoride the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of nitrate for wells fw222 and fw224 showed strong and linear decreases starting from slightly below or near their injected concentrations of 7 72 and 13 7 mg l table 2 respectively fig 5 the zero order decay coefficients of nitrate for wells fw222 and fw224 were comparable statistically significant and ranged from 3 5 2 3 to 2 0 0 1 mg l h respectively fig 5 these results strongly suggested that nitrate reduction occurred in both wells the dilution adjusted breakthrough curve of sulfate for well fw222 showed a strong and linear decrease starting from near its injected concentration of 19 5 mg l table 2 for the duration of the test whereas the breakthrough of sulfate for well fw224 was nearly identical to its injected concentration of 14 2 mg l table 2 fig 5 these results strongly suggested that sulfate reduction occurred in well fw222 and did not occur in well fw224 these results further suggested that sequential nitrate and sulfate reduction occurred as predicted by eqs 4 7 for example for well fw222 nitrate concentrations decreased to below 1 mg l within the first half hour followed by a significant and sustained decrease in sulfate concentrations from approximately 20 to 10 mg l fig 5 these results suggested that nitrate was rapidly and effectively depleted to sufficiently low enough concentrations to trigger the onset of sulfate reducing conditions in contrast for well fw224 nitrate concentrations decreased from approximately 14 mg l at the beginning of the test to approximately 8 mg l by the end of the test during the time sulfate concentrations were nearly identical to their injected concentrations fig 5 these results suggested that nitrate was rapidly but not effectively depleted to sufficiently low enough concentrations to trigger the onset of sulfate reducing conditions it is important to note that a previous study by paradis et al 2016 stimulated microbial mediated nitrate and sulfate reduction in wells fw222 and fw224 that was coupled to ethanol oxidation ethanol like 2 6 dfba and pfba in this study was added to the injection fluid during the push pull tests bromide was also added to the injection fluid to serve as a non reactive tracer the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of fluoride were nearly identical to their injected concentrations of 0 19 and 0 18 mg l table 2 for the duration of the tests in wells fw222 and fw224 respectively fig 6 the zero order decay coefficients of fluoride for wells fw222 and fw224 were 0 012 0 003 mg l h and 0 003 0 002 mg l h respectively and relatively negligible fig 6 these results were not expected based on eqs 4 7 that predicted that defluorination of 2 6 dfba and pfba would result in the production of fluoride ion and based on previous studies that demonstrated substantial production of fluoride ion resulting from microbial mediated defluorination of mono and or polyfluorobenzoic acids cass et al 1987 kiel and engesser 2015 however the previous studies that demonstrated the production of fluoride ion were conducted using synthetic growth media in the laboratory cass et al 1987 kiel and engesser 2015 as opposed to natural porous media in the field the porous media within area 2 fig 1 and the oak ridge reserve is known to contain ferric oxides hu and moran 2005 moon et al 2006 and significant sorption of fluoride ion to ferric oxides has been demonstrated in previous studies farrah and pickering 1986 including those conducted with porous media from the oak ridge reserve and numerous other doe sites hu and moran 2005 according to hu and moran 2005 fluoride is the least appropriate halide for use as a hydrologic tracer because of its strong specific chemical binding to mineral surfaces therefore if microbial mediated defluorination of 2 6 dfba and pfba under nitrate and or sulfate reducing occurred as the data suggested figs 4 and 5 it would be reasonable to assume that significant sorption of fluoride ion occurred which may explain the negligible production of dissolved phase fluoride fig 6 the eqs 4 7 can be used to predict the rates of sulfate and nitrate decreases and fluoride increases based on the calculated rates of 2 6 dfba and pfba decreases table 3 for example for well fw222 it would be predicted that 15 1 2 3 mg l h of sulfate would be reduced table 3 if 4 0 0 7 and 3 0 0 8 mg l h of 2 6 dfba and pfba respectively fig 4 were completely oxidized to carbon dioxide however the results for well fw222 suggested that only 4 0 0 2 mg l h of sulfate was reduced table 3 the calculated rates of nitrate and sulfate reduction for both wells were substantially less than the prediction rates table 3 as previously noted solid phase electron acceptors e g manganese and ferric oxides are known to be present within area 2 moon et al 2006 and therefore had the potential to serve as electron acceptors in addition to nitrate and sulfate therefore it would be reasonable to assume that substantial reduction of manganese and ferric oxides occurred which may explain the lower than predicted rates of nitrate and sulfate reduction table 3 the calculated rates of fluoride production for both wells were negligible and therefore substantially less than the prediction rates table 3 as previously noted significant sorption of fluoride ion was assumed to have occurred which may explain the negligible production of dissolved phase fluoride therefore the predicted rates of fluoride production are presented here simply for completeness and for reference of future studies table 3 4 conclusions the in situ decay of two pbas 2 6 dfba and pfba was accompanied by nitrate and subsequent sulfate removal during single well push pull tests conducted in two hydrogeologically similar yet spatially distinct groundwater monitoring wells these results strongly suggested that biodegradation of both pbas occurred under anaerobic conditions and implied that pbas may not be appropriate to use as non reactive tracers in certain hydrogeologic settings the hydrogeologic setting of the study site is low in carbon and electron donors therefore it was likely that the pbas served as carbon and or electron donors to stimulate microbial activity however future studies are needed to provide stronger evidence of in situ biodegradation of pbas such studies would benefit from using ring 14c labeled pbas to determine the fate of carbon combined with microbial analyses to assess any changes in biomass and community structure function in both groundwater and sediments acknowledgments this

1994 boggs and adams 1992 mccarthy et al 2000 seaman 1998 furthermore there is relatively sparse yet mounting evidence that pbas are susceptible to biodegradation under certain conditions cass et al 1987 nimmo et al 1990 queloz et al 2015a queloz et al 2015b a study by cass et al 1987 demonstrated biodegradation of 2 5 difluorobenzoic acid 2 5 dfba by pseudomonas putida by showing that 85 of the total fluorine in 2 5 dfba was biotransformed to fluoride ion in a laboratory experiment conducted with synthetic growth media under aerobic conditions p putida once considered an obligate aerobe has since been recognized as a ubiquitous and metabolically versatile bacterium with the genetic potential to degrade halogenated organic compounds under oxygen limited conditions dos santos et al 2004 more recently p putida strains have been isolated under anaerobic conditions freikowski et al 2010 pascual et al 2015 nimmo et al 1990 demonstrated complete mineralization of ring 14c labeled 2 6 difluorobenzoic acid 2 6 dfba to 14co2 in a laboratory experiment conducted with two different soils under aerobic conditions it was assumed that degradation of 2 6 dfba was microbial mediated more recently queloz et al 2015a provided evidence of microbial mediated degradation of di and tri fluorobenzoic acids within highly controlled and vegetated hydrologic mesocosms based on mass balance analyses the experimental results were then corroborated with theoretical analyses and model simulations queloz et al 2015b it is becoming clearer that pbas are indeed susceptible to biodegradation in the laboratory and may also biodegrade under certain field conditions presumably those where they can serve as carbon and or electron donors to stimulate microbial activity it is also clear that there is no such thing as a perfectly ideal tracer hu and moran 2005 suggested that the transport behavior of any potential tracer under relevant geochemical conditions preferably in the field should be evaluated before beginning ambitious large scale field tracer experiments the objective of this study was to test the in situ reactivity of four non reactive tracers bromide chloride 2 6 dfba and pentafluorobenzoic acid pfba in a shallow unconfined and heterogeneous aquifer the hypothesis of this study was that the pbas would be susceptible to biodegradation this hypothesis was informed by the characteristics of the aquifer that suggested biodegradation as opposed to matrix diffusion or sorption would likely be the dominant non ideal mass transport transformation mechanism 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located within area 2 of the united states department of energy doe oak ridge reservation orr in oak ridge tennessee fig 1 the subsurface within area 2 is comprised of approximately 6 m of unconsolidated and heterogeneous fill materials e g silty and clayey fill related to historical construction activities underlain by undisturbed and weathered bedrock moon et al 2006 watson et al 2004 fig 2 slug and single well pumping tests indicated that the hydraulic conductivity of the fill materials was approximately two orders of magnitude greater than the weathered bedrock e g 10 6 versus 10 8 m s paradis et al 2018b fig 2 the study site contains 13 monitoring wells fw218 through fw230 two of which were used as test wells fw222 and fw224 and one as a source well fw228 for the injection fluid for the push pull tests fig 1 the test wells were installed by direct push geoprobe model 6610dt using a 3 8 cm outside diameter drive casing the test wells are constructed of 2 7 cm outside dimeter and 1 9 cm inside diameter schedule 80 polyvinyl chloride pvc pipe fig 2 the test wells are screened across the unconfined aquifer and in direct contact with the fill materials from 3 7 to 6 1 m below ground surface mbgs fig 2 the source well is constructed of 5 1 cm inside diameter pvc pipe and is screened within the fill materials the shallow groundwater aquifer is unconfined and the depth to groundwater is approximately 3 5 mbgs the average magnitude and direction of the hydraulic gradient is approximately 0 045 m m and to the south southwest respectively fig 1 single well pumping and push pull tests indicated that the hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity of the porous media associated with test wells were relatively similar paradis et al 2018a paradis et al 2018b table 1 groundwater sampling indicated that the ph of the aquifer fluid associated with the test wells is near neutral paradis et al 2016 table 1 microbial activity in area 2 and in the monitoring wells of the study site is known to be limited by carbon and or electron donors paradis et al 2016 watson et al 2004 2 2 push pull tests the single well push pull tests were conducted according to the methodology of istok 2013 and the data was analyzed according to the methodology of paradis et al 2018b a push pull test is conducted by injecting a volume of water containing one or more non reactive and reactive tracers into a single well push phase followed by a non pumping period rest phase and subsequent extraction of groundwater from the same well pull phase the extraction fluid is comprised of a mixture between the injection and aquifer fluids the concentration of a reactive tracer in the extraction fluid can be adjusted for dilution based on the concentration of a non reactive tracer to generate a dilution adjusted concentration versus time elapsed profile dilution adjusted breakthrough curve any deviation of the dilution adjusted breakthrough curve of the reactive tracer from its injected concentration can be attributed to reactivity if the mass transport characteristics both the non reactive and reactive tracers e g advection mechanical dispersion molecular diffusion and sorption are no different analysis of the dilution adjusted breakthrough curve can be utilized to quantify the reaction rate of a tracer by fitting it an appropriate kinetic model e g zero order first order michaelis menton etc ten liters of groundwater were collected from the source well fw228 fig 1 using a peristaltic pump and stored in a plastic carboy potassium bromide kbr 2 6 dfba c7h4o2f2 and pfba c7ho2f5 sigma aldrich inc 98 purity were added to the 10 liters of groundwater to create an injection fluid that contained 100 mg l of bromide br and de protonated 2 6 dfba c7h3o2f2 and pfba c7o2f5 the injection fluid was thoroughly mixed by recirculation using a peristaltic pump during mixing of the injection fluid three samples were collected filtered 0 2 μm filter stored in 20 ml scintillation vials preserved at 4 c and promptly analyzed for bromide chloride 2 6 dfba pfba nitrate sulfate and fluoride by ion chromatography dionex ics 5000 immediately prior to the injection three samples were collected from the test well to determine the concentrations of bromide chloride 2 6 dfba pfba nitrate sulfate and fluoride in the aquifer fluid associated with the test well these samples were processed identically to the injection fluid samples the 10 liter injection fluid was pumped into the test well at approximately 250 to 500 ml min immediately after the injection a 35 minute resting i e non pumping period occurred groundwater comprised of a mixture of the injection and aquifer fluids was then continuously extracted from the test well at approximately 125 ml min until 22 to 24 l was collected samples were collected every liter for the first 10 l of extracted fluid and every two liters thereafter e g at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 14 etc liters extracted these samples were processed identically to the injection and aquifer fluid samples the first push pull test was conducted in test well fw222 because it is located approximately 6 m down side gradient of test well fw224 fig 1 and therefore unlikely to have influenced the aquifer fluid associated with test well fw224 the radius of influence of the injection fluid can be estimated from istok 2013 as given by 1 r i v i πb n e r w 2 1 2 where r i radius of influence l v i volume of injection fluid l3 b saturated aquifer thickness l n e effective porosity dimensionless r w radius of test well l eq 1 assumes that the aquifer is confined homogeneous and isotropic and that the transport of the injection fluid is radial governed by advection and not affected by ambient groundwater flow therefore the radius of influence of the 10 liter injection fluid was approximately 0 25 m 2 3 data analysis the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of bromide chloride dfba pfba nitrate sulfate and fluoride were generated according to the method by paradis et al 2018b as given by 2 c e 2 c e 2 c i 2 c e 2 e where c e 2 dilution adjusted concentration of reactive tracer in the extraction fluid m l3 c e 2 concentration of reactive tracer in the extraction fluid m l3 c i 2 concentration of reactive tracer in the injection fluid m l3 c e

concentrations at time equal to zero 2 the concentrations of both tracers are equal to their aquifer concentrations as time approaches infinity and 3 the mass transport characteristics both the non reactive and reactive tracers e g advection mechanical dispersion molecular diffusion and sorption are no different during a push pull test each independent variable in eq 3 is measured therefore eq 3 can be used to compare the expected concentration of a reactive tracer c e 2e to the measured concentration of a reactive tracer c e 2 any difference between the two concentrations can be attributed to reactivity eq 2 accounts for such differences and allows for generating a dilution adjusted breakthrough curve of a reactive tracer the dilution adjusted breakthrough curve from eq 2 can be utilized to quantify the reaction rate of a tracer linear regression of the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves was performed using the microsoft excel data analysis regression tool 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre test conditions the concentrations of bromide 2 6 dfba and pfba in the injection fluid were approximately 400 times greater than within the aquifer fluid table 2 the relatively high concentrations of bromide 2 6 dfba and pfba were expected because these tracers were added to the injection fluid to establish a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio with respect to the aquifer fluid the concentrations of nitrate and sulfate in the injection fluid were approximately 17 and 3 times greater than within the aquifer fluid respectively table 2 and their relatively high concentrations were not expected because these tracers were not added to the injection fluid and were therefore naturally present within the aquifer fluid obtained from the nearby and up gradient source well fw228 fig 1 these results suggested that the spatial variability of some tracers e g nitrate and sulfate within the shallow and unconfined aquifer were considerable the concentrations of chloride and fluoride in the injection and aquifer fluids were not identical but nevertheless very similar table 2 despite the spatial variability of nitrate and sulfate the concentrations of other tracers within the injection and aquifer fluids of the test wells were relatively similar table 2 moreover the physical characteristics of the porous media and the ph near neutral of the aquifer fluid associated with the test wells were relatively similar table 1 therefore the test wells were hydrogeologically similar tables 1 and 2 yet spatially distinct as indicated by test well fw222 being located down gradient with respect to test well fw224 fig 1 making the pair of wells ideal for in situ experimentation 3 2 push pull tests 3 2 1 bromide and chloride the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of bromide were identical to their injected concentrations of 100 mg l table 2 for the duration of the tests in both wells fig 3 according to eqs 2 and 3 the dilution adjusted breakthrough curve of the pre determined non reactive tracer e g bromide will always be equal to its injected concentration if the assumptions of the analytical method by paradis et al 2018b are valid therefore any deviation of the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of all other tracers e g chloride 2 6 dfba pfba nitrate sulfate and fluoride from their injected concentrations can be attributed to reactivity the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of chloride were nearly identical to their injected concentrations of 18 0 and 19 6 mg l table 2 for the duration of the tests in wells fw222 and fw224 respectively fig 3 these results strongly suggested that the mass transport characteristics of chloride e g advection mechanical dispersion molecular diffusion and sorption were no different than bromide these results were expected based on the nearly identical physical properties of bromide and chloride e g aqueous solubility and aqueous diffusion coefficients and their observed non reactive transport in a wide range of hydrogeological settings davis et al 1980 eggenkamp and coleman 2009 flury and wai 2003 hu and moran 2005 3 2 2 2 6 dfba and pfba the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of 2 6 dfba and pfba showed strong and linear decreases starting from slightly above their injected concentrations of 100 mg l table 2 for the duration of the tests in both wells fig 4 the zero order decay coefficients for 2 6 dfba and pfba in both wells were similar statistically significant and ranged from 3 0 0 8 to 4 5 0 4 mg l h fig 4 these results strongly suggested that the mass transfer and or transformation processes that affected 2 6 dfba and pfba were significantly different in magnitude and or type than those that affected bromide the dilution adjusted concentrations of 2 6 dfba and pfba were slightly above their injected concentrations of 100 mg l these elevated values were likely due to their difference in diffusion coefficient with respect to bromide the diffusion coefficient of bromide is approximately 3 times greater than those of 2 6 dfba and pfba flury and wai 2003 hu and moran 2005 therefore preferential diffusive mass transport of bromide would likely result in expected concentrations of 2 6 dfba and pfba lower than their measured concentrations an inspection of eq 2 shows that when the expected concentration of a reactive tracer c e 2e is less than its measured concentration c e 2 the dilution adjusted concentration c e 2 is greater than its injected concentration c i 2 sorption of 2 6 dfba and pfba was likely negligible based on a previous study by mccarthy et al 2000 that demonstrated that sorption of 2 6 dfba pfba and bromide were nearly identical in laboratory experiments conducted with sediments from within the oak ridge reserve under circumneutral ph conditions the ph of the aquifer fluid associated with the test wells is near neutral paradis et al 2016 degradation of 2 6 dfba was possible based on a previous study by nimmo et al 1990 that demonstrated that ring 14c labeled 2 6 dfba was degraded to 14co2 in a laboratory experiment conducted with two different soils under aerobic conditions it was assumed that degradation of 2 6 dfba was microbial mediated moreover microbial mediated biotransformation of 2 5 dfba a nearly identical isomer of 2 6 dfba by p putida was demonstrated in a study by cass et al 1987 that showed that 85 of the total fluorine in 2 5 dfba was biotransformed to fluoride ion in a laboratory experiment conducted with synthetic growth media pseudomonas species have been commonly detected in sediments and groundwater at the oak ridge reserve cardenas et al 2008 fields et al 2005 although degradation of pfba was also possible the only studies to date that have demonstrated pfba degradation were associated with ultraviolet assisted photo defluorination ravichandran et al 2007 ravichandran et al 2010 in contrast numerous studies both in the laboratory and in situ have demonstrated that the mass transport of 2 6 dfba and pfba in unsaturated and saturated porous media were nearly identical to bromide becker and coplen 2001 bowman and gibbens 1992 hu and moran 2005 mccarthy et al 2000 which makes the results presented here relatively interesting however previous studies typically compared percent mass recovery and mean retention or arrival times becker and coplen 2001 bowman and gibbens 1992 hu and moran 2005 mccarthy et al 2000 which theoretically can be similar if the effects of diffusive mass transport of bromide and biodegradation of 2 6 dfba and pfba result in similar breakthrough curves moreover relatively few previous studies were conducted in situ and those that were were not conducted in anaerobic aquifers becker and coplen 2001 bowman and gibbens 1992 microbial mediated anaerobic degradation of mono fluorobenzoic acids e g 2 3 and 4 fluorobenzoic acids under nitrate and sulfate reducing conditions has been well documented in the literature kiel and engesser 2015 therefore the zero order decay of 2 6 dfba and pfba was likely due biodegradation under anaerobic conditions as opposed to matrix diffusion or sorption nitrate and sulfate are the predominant dissolved phase electron acceptors at the study site paradis et al 2016 and were measured in the injection and aquifer fluids immediately prior to conducting the push pull tests table 2 therefore if the zero order decay of 2 6 dfba and pfba was primarily due to biodegradation under anaerobic conditions it would be expected that sequential nitrate and sulfate reduction would occur nitrate is a higher energy yielding electron acceptor than sulfate and would theoretically be preferentially depleted before the onset of sulfate reduction essaid et al 2015 it would also be expected that defluorination of 2 6 dfba and pfba would occur and therefore result in the production of fluoride ion kiel and engesser 2015 the complete oxidation of 2 6 dfba and pfba to carbon dioxide coupled to reduction of nitrate and sulfate can be described by the following equations 4 5 c 7 h 3 o 2 f 2 26 n o 3 21 h 35 c o 2 10 f 13 n 2 18 h 2 o 5 3 c 7 h 3 o 2 f 2 13 s o 4 2 23 h 21 c o 2 6 f 13 s 16 h 2 o 6 c 7 o 2 f 5 4 n o 3 7 c o 2 5 f 2 n 2 7 3 c 7 o 2 f 5 10 s o 4 2 8 h 21 c o 2 15 f 10 s 4 h 2 o it is important to note that solid phase electron acceptors e g manganese and ferric oxides are known to be present within area 2 moon et al 2006 and therefore had the potential to serve as electron acceptors in addition to nitrate and sulfate manganese and ferric oxides are typically less energetically favorable than nitrate but more energetically favorable than sulfate as electron acceptors essaid et al 2015 3 2 3 sulfate nitrate and fluoride the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of nitrate for wells fw222 and fw224 showed strong and linear decreases starting from slightly below or near their injected concentrations of 7 72 and 13 7 mg l table 2 respectively fig 5 the zero order decay coefficients of nitrate for wells fw222 and fw224 were comparable statistically significant and ranged from 3 5 2 3 to 2 0 0 1 mg l h respectively fig 5 these results strongly suggested that nitrate reduction occurred in both wells the dilution adjusted breakthrough curve of sulfate for well fw222 showed a strong and linear decrease starting from near its injected concentration of 19 5 mg l table 2 for the duration of the test whereas the breakthrough of sulfate for well fw224 was nearly identical to its injected concentration of 14 2 mg l table 2 fig 5 these results strongly suggested that sulfate reduction occurred in well fw222 and did not occur in well fw224 these results further suggested that sequential nitrate and sulfate reduction occurred as predicted by eqs 4 7 for example for well fw222 nitrate concentrations decreased to below 1 mg l within the first half hour followed by a significant and sustained decrease in sulfate concentrations from approximately 20 to 10 mg l fig 5 these results suggested that nitrate was rapidly and effectively depleted to sufficiently low enough concentrations to trigger the onset of sulfate reducing conditions in contrast for well fw224 nitrate concentrations decreased from approximately 14 mg l at the beginning of the test to approximately 8 mg l by the end of the test during the time sulfate concentrations were nearly identical to their injected concentrations fig 5 these results suggested that nitrate was rapidly but not effectively depleted to sufficiently low enough concentrations to trigger the onset of sulfate reducing conditions it is important to note that a previous study by paradis et al 2016 stimulated microbial mediated nitrate and sulfate reduction in wells fw222 and fw224 that was coupled to ethanol oxidation ethanol like 2 6 dfba and pfba in this study was added to the injection fluid during the push pull tests bromide was also added to the injection fluid to serve as a non reactive tracer the dilution adjusted breakthrough curves of fluoride were nearly identical to their injected concentrations of 0 19 and 0 18 mg l table 2 for the duration of the tests in wells fw222 and fw224 respectively fig 6 the zero order decay coefficients of fluoride for wells fw222 and fw224 were 0 012 0 003 mg l h and 0 003 0 002 mg l h respectively and relatively negligible fig 6 these results were not expected based on eqs 4 7 that predicted that defluorination of 2 6 dfba and pfba would result in the production of fluoride ion and based on previous studies that demonstrated substantial production of fluoride ion resulting from microbial mediated defluorination of mono and or polyfluorobenzoic acids cass et al 1987 kiel and engesser 2015 however the previous studies that demonstrated the production of fluoride ion were conducted using synthetic growth media in the laboratory cass et al 1987 kiel and engesser 2015 as opposed to natural porous media in the field the porous media within area 2 fig 1 and the oak ridge reserve is known to contain ferric oxides hu and moran 2005 moon et al 2006 and significant sorption of fluoride ion to ferric oxides has been demonstrated in previous studies farrah and pickering 1986 including those conducted with porous media from the oak ridge reserve and numerous other doe sites hu and moran 2005 according to hu and moran 2005 fluoride is the least appropriate halide for use as a hydrologic tracer because of its strong specific chemical binding to mineral surfaces therefore if microbial mediated defluorination of 2 6 dfba and pfba under nitrate and or sulfate reducing occurred as the data suggested figs 4 and 5 it would be reasonable to assume that significant sorption of fluoride ion occurred which may explain the negligible production of dissolved phase fluoride fig 6 the eqs 4 7 can be used to predict the rates of sulfate and nitrate decreases and fluoride increases based on the calculated rates of 2 6 dfba and pfba decreases table 3 for example for well fw222 it would be predicted that 15 1 2 3 mg l h of sulfate would be reduced table 3 if 4 0 0 7 and 3 0 0 8 mg l h of 2 6 dfba and pfba respectively fig 4 were completely oxidized to carbon dioxide however the results for well fw222 suggested that only 4 0 0 2 mg l h of sulfate was reduced table 3 the calculated rates of nitrate and sulfate reduction for both wells were substantially less than the prediction rates table 3 as previously noted solid phase electron acceptors e g manganese and ferric oxides are known to be present within area 2 moon et al 2006 and therefore had the potential to serve as electron acceptors in addition to nitrate and sulfate therefore it would be reasonable to assume that substantial reduction of manganese and ferric oxides occurred which may explain the lower than predicted rates of nitrate and sulfate reduction table 3 the calculated rates of fluoride production for both wells were negligible and therefore substantially less than the prediction rates table 3 as previously noted significant sorption of fluoride ion was assumed to have occurred which may explain the negligible production of dissolved phase fluoride therefore the predicted rates of fluoride production are presented here simply for completeness and for reference of future studies table 3 4 conclusions the in situ decay of two pbas 2 6 dfba and pfba was accompanied by nitrate and subsequent sulfate removal during single well push pull tests conducted in two hydrogeologically similar yet spatially distinct groundwater monitoring wells these results strongly suggested that biodegradation of both pbas occurred under anaerobic conditions and implied that pbas may not be appropriate to use as non reactive tracers in certain hydrogeologic settings the hydrogeologic setting of the study site is low in carbon and electron donors therefore it was likely that the pbas served as carbon and or electron donors to stimulate microbial activity however future studies are needed to provide stronger evidence of in situ biodegradation of pbas such studies would benefit from using ring 14c labeled pbas to determine the fate of carbon combined with microbial analyses to assess any changes in biomass and community structure function in both groundwater and sediments acknowledgments this

1639,contaminants diffusing from fractures into the immobile porosity of the rock matrix are subject to prolonged residence times organic contaminants can adsorb onto organic carbonaceous materials in the matrix extending contaminant retention an investigation of spatial variability of the fraction of organic carbon f oc is conducted on samples of rock core from seven closely spaced boreholes in a mudstone aquifer contaminated with trichloroethene tce a total of 378 samples were analyzed at depths between 14 and 36 m below land surface mudstone units associated with deep water deposition have the largest f oc with a maximum value of 0 0396 and units associated with shallow water deposition have the smallest f oc even though f oc correlates with depositional conditions f oc still varies over more than an order of magnitude in continuous mudstone layers between boreholes and there is large variability in f oc over short distances perpendicular to bedding simulations of diffusion and linear equilibrium adsorption of tce using spatially variable f oc in the rock matrix show order of magnitude variability in the adsorbed tce over short distances in the matrix and residence times extending to hundreds of years following remediation in adjacent fractures simulations using average values of f oc do not capture the range of tce mass that can be retained in a rock matrix characterized by spatially variable f oc bounds on tce mass within the rock matrix can be obtained by simulations with spatially uniform values of f oc equal to the maximum and minimum values of f oc for a given mudstone unit 1 introduction the use of chlorinated solvents at many federal industrial and commercial facilities over the past several decades has resulted in widespread groundwater contamination pankow et al 1996 mccarty 2010 in fractured rock aquifers characterizing the spatial extent and longevity of contamination and designing effective remediation strategies has been particularly challenging nas 2015 fractures control the spatial extent of contamination however aqueous phase constituents can diffuse from fractures into the immobile fluid within the primary porosity of the rock also referred to as the rock matrix when concentration gradients are conducive constituents diffuse back into permeable fractures and migrate down gradient resulting in degraded water quality to down gradient receptors over decades to centuries mutch et al 1993 chapman and parker 2005 sale et al 2008 in addition to diffusive exchange between fractures and the rock matrix the retention of chlorinated solvents in fractured rock is also controlled by adsorption partitioning between the aqueous phase and solid surfaces associated with fracture walls or within the rock matrix a linear equilibrium model is frequently applied in characterizing the adsorption of organic compounds allen king et al 1996 1 c s k d c aq where c s is the concentration of the constituent in the adsorbed phase c aq is the concentration of the constituent in the aqueous phase and k d is the partitioning coefficient defined as cwiertny and scherer 2010 2 k d k oc f oc where k oc is the constituent s equilibrium partitioning coefficient defining its susceptibility to adsorb to organic carbon the equilibrium adsorption model leads to the definition of a retardation factor r domenico and schwartz 1990 3 r 1 ρ b n k d 1 ρ b n k oc f oc where ρ b is the bulk density of the aquifer material and n is the porosity the retardation factor scales the diffusive flux relative to constituents that do not adsorb to aquifer materials freeze and cherry 1979 more complex models of the adsorption have also been proposed to account for the nonlinearity of adsorption over a larger range of aqueous concentrations allen king et al 2002 huang et al 2003 in this investigation however we consider only the application of a linear equilibrium adsorption model identifying f oc is a critical component in site characterization to evaluate the significance of the adsorption of organic contaminants kueper et al 2003 sedimentary rocks can exhibit variations in f oc depending on the rock type gehman 1962 and depositional environment lacombe and burton 2010 calm deep water environments support aquatic life in the water column while providing anoxic conditions upon deposition that suppress the decomposition of organic materials in contrast shallow waters often exhibit turbidity and wave action that limit the growth of aquatic vegetation and promote dissolved oxygen and decomposition thus f oc can vary between classifications of sedimentary rocks depending on the composition of the sediments and the depositional environment associated with those sediments itrc 2015 provides a compilation of values of f oc explicitly noting characteristics of unconsolidated sediments and rock types however even within a given type of sedimentary rock for example sandstone versus mudstone changing depositional conditions can give rise to variations in the content of organic materials in the lithified rock lacombe and burton 2010 the significance of quantifying f oc in sedimentary rocks to evaluate the retention and release of organic contaminants from the rock matrix is widely recognized kueper et al 2003 itrc 2015 in comparing the mass of aqueous and adsorbed tce in a mudstone shapiro et al 2017 concluded that adsorption is responsible for the majority of tce retained in the rock matrix indicating that assigning representative values of f oc is critical in quantifying the retention of organic contaminants in many instances representative values of f oc are determined from a small number of rock samples usually by taking an average and combining those results with representative values of other parameters to estimate a retardation factor associated with the rock matrix kueper et al 2003 sterling et al 2005 several previous investigations have addressed the effect of spatially variable formation properties on the adsorption of chemical constituents however these investigations have focused primarily on the variability of these properties along groundwater flow paths valocchi 1989 cvetkovic and shapiro 1990 rajaram 1997 the retention and release of organic contaminants by diffusion in the matrix of sedimentary rocks due to spatial variability of f oc within the rock matrix has not been fully investigated the purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate the range of spatial variability in f oc in a fractured mudstone aquifer and the control that depositional conditions have on the magnitude and variability of f oc the significance of that variability in the retention and release of tce from the rock matrix is demonstrated through simulations of tce diffusion into and out of the rock matrix and comparisons are made to simulations using average values of f oc this investigation uses f oc analyses from rock samples collected from seven closely spaced boreholes in the upper 36 m of the mudstone aquifer underlying the former naval air warfare center nawc west trenton nj fig 1 variability in f oc with depth in individual boreholes is investigated along with the areal continuity of f oc along continuous mudstone layers in addition a detailed characterization of the rock cores is used to correlate f oc with characteristics of the depositional conditions associated with mudstone layers 2 naval air warfare center the nawc is a 0 24 km2 facility in west trenton nj fig 1 that served as a testing facility for aircraft engines the use of tce at the facility resulted in releases that were later detected in the groundwater lacombe 2000 2011 provides details of the source areas of tce contamination and the subsequent remedial groundwater treatments the nawc is underlain by triassic age rocks of the newark basin olsen et al 1996 a fault zone at the southern extent of the nawc demarks the contact between the stockton and lockatong formations fig 1 however tce has only been detected in the lockatong formation underlying the nawc lacombe 2000 the lockatong formation is classified as a mudstone that is characterized by cyclical transgressive and regressive marine floor conditions during deposition olsen et al 1996 lacombe and burton 2010 four different rock types are discernable as mudstone layers these rock types include light gray massive gry mas and reddish massive red mas mudstone that do not exhibit layering dark gray laminated gry lam mudstone and black carbon rich fissile blk fis mudstone lacombe 2000 lacombe and burton 2010 the gry mas and red mas mudstone are products of shallow water deposition whereas the blk fis mudstone is attributed to deep water depositional conditions and the gry lam mudstone is associated with depositional conditions that transition between shallow and deep water the different mudstone layers are areally continuous and can be correlated between boreholes separated by distances over 100 m lacombe 2000 lacombe and burton 2010 the mudstone strata have an orientation striking n65oe with a dip angle of approximately 25onw hydraulically conductive bedding plane fractures are associated with the rheologically weaker blk fis mudstone lacombe 2000 tiedeman et al 2010 weathering from land surface to depths of approximately 15 m has also induced permeability in the laminated mudstones permeable bedding plane partings are usually not observed in the gry mas and red mas mudstones however regional compression has created vertical jointing perpendicular to bedding in general vertical joints are confined within the individual strata and are less permeable than bedding plane features tiedeman et al 2010 robinson et al 2016 installed seven closely spaced boreholes at the nawc denoted as 83br 89br fig 1 as part of an investigation using geophysical methods to track the introduction of remediation amendments in fractured rock continuous 0 06 m diameter rock core was collected in each borehole up to approximately 36 m below land surface the core was inspected to identify the different types of mudstone as a function of depth in each borehole shapiro and hayes 2017 only the gry mas gry lam and blk fis mudstones were observed in cores from 83br 89br the red mas mudstone occurs at greater depths at this location underlying the nawc following the lithologic inspection of the rock cores samples of rock core from 83br 89br were selected for analyses of n shapiro and evans 2017 shapiro et al 2017 and foc shapiro and brenneis 2018 because the presence of fractures and fissile rocks often provides poor or displaced core recovery results of the borehole wall image logs were used to correct the depths of rock core collected during coring the depths of rock samples were corrected by correlating features observed in the optical televiewer images of the borehole wall with similar features observed in the core natural gamma logs were used to correct for the dip of the sedimentary bedding to compare rock properties between adjacent boreholes the geophysical logs for boreholes 83br 89br are available from the u s geological survey usgs web application usgs geolog locator https webapps usgs gov geologlocator 3 variability of f oc in total 378 samples of rock core from the seven boreholes were selected for analyses of the total carbon fraction f c and f oc analyses for f c were conducted for comparison and as a constraint on results for f oc the details of the sample preparation the methods of analysis and a listing of the results for f c and f oc are given in shapiro and brenneis 2018 the depth in the borehole and the mudstone type associated with each rock sample are also listed values of f oc vary over two orders of magnitude with a standard deviation 0 0068 approximately equal to the mean 0 0064 table 1 fig 2 shows values of f oc and mudstone lithology plotted as a function of depth for each borehole where the depths in each borehole are adjusted to account for the dip of bedding adjusting the elevations to account for the dipping mudstone units shows the continuity of the mudstone layers in particular the continuity of the blk fis mudstone units at depths of approximately 25 30 and 34 m weathering of the rock due to increased groundwater flow and unrecovered sections of core affect interpretations of the continuity of the blk fis mudstone at depths 20 m shapiro et al 2017 fig 2 also shows the largest values of f oc in each borehole appear in close proximity to blk fis mudstone this is also demonstrated in fig 3 where f oc from all the boreholes are merged into a single plot as a function of depth adjusted for the dip of bedding in fig 3 the largest values of f oc are associated with samples of the blk fis mudstone however at those depths where the largest values of f oc are identified there is also large variability in f oc indicating that within continuous mudstone units f oc can vary significantly for both the gry mas and gry lam mudstone strata between the blk fis mudstone units there is also significant variability in f oc fig 3 however the maximum f oc for the gry mas and gry lam mudstones is less than that for the blk fis mudstone the range in f oc associated with each rock type is illustrated in the histogram shown in fig 4 with values of f oc for the gry mas and gry lam rocks ranging over approximately two orders of magnitude and the range associated with the blk fis rock is approximately one order of magnitude in addition there is significant overlap in the ranges associated with the three types of mudstone although the categories assigned to the mudstone are based on observations of color texture and mineral content and attributed to a specific depositional environment there are not necessarily sharp demarcations in the rock characteristics used in assigning these rock types there is likely a spectrum of conditions ranging from deep water deposition to shallow water deposition associated with the mudstone the categorization into three types of mudstone is intended to assist in the interpretation of rock properties but it cannot capture fully the spectrum of depositional conditions the range in f oc for each type of mudstone is likely a reflection of the variability that occurs with the depositional conditions the distribution of f oc shown in fig 4 is bimodal with peaks at approximately 0 001 and 0 01 the abundance of values for f oc of the blk fis mudstone around 0 01 are responsible for the dominant mode of the entire data set the range of the distributions of f oc for both the gry mas and gry lam are similar however the gry mas rocks have a larger number of samples at the lower end of the range whereas the gry lam rocks have a larger number of samples at the upper end of the range this offset in the distributions of the gry mas and gry lam rock types is consistent with the conceptualization that the mudstone depositional environment affects f oc the gry mas rock is associated with a shallow deposition that is least conducive to the retention of organic carbon and thus it has the largest number of samples associated with the lowest values of f oc the gry lam rock is associated with a transitional depositional environment and has a greater number of samples with larger values of f oc in comparison to the gry mas rock this is also reflected in the relation between the average f oc for the gry mas and gry lam rocks table 1 the average f oc for the gry mas and gry lam rocks is 0 0035 and 0 0048 respectively in contrast samples of the blk fis rock dominate the largest values of f oc in the distribution fig 4 this is consistent with the interpretation of blk fis rock being associated with a deep water depositional environment that is conducive to the retention of organic carbon in comparison to the distributions for the gry mas and gry lam rocks the blk fis rock has the smallest standard deviation σ for the log10 f oc table 1 if one considers the statistics of f oc rather than log10 f oc σ associated with the blk fis rock is larger than the other rock types table 1 this implies that the gry mas and gry lam rocks are dominated by small values ranging over many orders of magnitude which skew the magnitude of σ consequently conceptualizing the distribution of f oc from a selected number of samples can affect how one characterizes representative statistics of f oc 4 spatial correlation of f oc the relation between lithology and f oc discussed in the previous section suggests a spatial structure to f oc within the mudstone understanding the spatial characteristics of f oc is potentially important in evaluating rock properties that can affect the retention of organic contaminants the spatial structure of f oc can be investigated by the semivariogram which is a measure of the average dissimilarity in a spatially varying property over increasing separation distances isaaks and srivastava 1989 the semivariogram is defined as deutsch and journel 1998 4 γ oc h 1 2 n h m 1 n h f oc x f oc x h m 2 where γ oc h is the semivariogram of f oc defined as a function of the separation vector h n h represents the total number of data pairs for the separation vector and the subscript m denotes a particular data pair in general over larger separation distances spatially varying rock properties become uncorrelated corresponding to values of γ oc approaching the variance of the data set also the semivariogram can vary according to orientation of the vector h however in this investigation we only consider the evaluation of γ oc in the vertical direction which is approximately perpendicular to the bedding plane fractures the variability of f oc in the horizontal direction can generally be seen in fig 3 because of the limited number of boreholes and the regular spacing between boreholes a semivariogram over a spectrum of separation distances in the horizontal orientation cannot be defined thoroughly the semivariogram for f oc in fig 5 shows the large variability in f oc over short distances and the influence of repetitive lithologic units over the range of h shown in fig 5 the number of data pairs that define the semivariogram vary from 211 to 686 at larger separation distances the diminishing number of data pairs reduces the confidence in the estimate of γ oc at small separation distances γ oc displays a nugget journel and huijbregts 1978 which is about 60 of the variance of f oc table 1 in general the nugget is an indication of the combination of measurement error and the microgeologic structure affecting the rock property journel and huijbregts 1978 we attribute the large nugget relative to the variance to the variability in the depositional conditions that support the retention of organic carbon in addition fig 5 shows the spatial persistence of f oc is confined to separation distances of approximately two meters for h approximately equal to two meters γ oc is approximately equal to the variance of the data set the spatial structure of f oc is also characterized by holes in the semivariogram journel and huijbregts 1978 at separation distances of approximately five and ten meters at these separation distances γ oc decreases to a value approximately equal to the nugget which again is an indication of the underlying variability in the microgeologic structure of the mudstone units the holes in the semivariogram result from the repetitive nature of the rock types and the similarity in f oc in those rock types the periodicity demonstrated in γ oc is an average attribute of the mudstone and is not attributed to a given rock type the holes in the semivariogram are representative of average separation distances where f oc is similar the statistical measures of variability in f oc for the various types of mudstone table 1 and fig 4 and the spatial structure of f oc depicted in the semivariogram fig 5 indicate the dependence of f oc on the mudstone classification and the thickness of the mudstone units the spatial structure of the mudstone rock types is similar to the spatial correlation for f oc which further illustrates the dependence between the depositional environment and f oc this is demonstrated in semivariograms for the mudstone rock types constructed using indicator variables deutsch and journel 1998 where the indicator variable ind i k x is defined as 5 ind i k x 1 rock type k exists at x 0 otherwise where k denotes a given rock type gry mas gry lam or blk fis and x denotes a particular location the semivariogram for ind i k x is defined similarly to eq 4 isaaks and srivastava 1989 6 γ i k h 1 2 n h m 1 n h ind i k x ind i k x h m 2 for comparison with f oc we only consider γ i k h in the vertical orientation based on observations of the rock core rock types were assigned every 0 03 m in the core recovered from 83br 89br shapiro et al 2017 the density of observations for rock type greatly exceeds the data density associated with f oc the density of sampling for f oc in 83br 89br varies from 0 35 to 0 46 m per sample shapiro and brenneis 2018 in addition the rock type is defined over the entire length of the cored boreholes whereas the data for f oc is confined to only those locations where samples of the core were removed for analyses the semivariograms for the indicator variables associated with the three rock types are shown in fig 6 the number of data pairs defining the semivariogram ranges from 20 000 to 60 000 for h shown in fig 6 the semivariograms for the gry mas and gry lam rocks γ i gry mas and γ i gry lam are similar and show characteristics of spatial persistence with a gradual rise over increasing separation distances these semivariograms approach the variance associated with the indicator variables at approximately h 13 m implying that at this separation distance the occurrence of these rock types are uncorrelated for h 13 m not shown in fig 6 the values of the γ i gry mas and γ i gry lam decrease indicating a spatial repetition these observations are generally consistent with the thicknesses of the gry mas and gry lam units observed in the rock cores fig 2 for separation distances h 13 m γ i gry mas and γ i gry lam do not rise monotonically fig 6 at separation distances approximately equal to five and ten meters γ i gry mas and γ i gry lam level off but do not decrease significantly this gives the indication of periodicity in the occurrence of these rock types over these separation distances at similar separation distances there is a strong appearance of periodicity in γ oc fig 6 in comparison γ i blk fis shows a significant decrease at approximately h 5 m and h 10 m fig 6 which is consistent with the characteristics of γ oc in addition γ i blk fis approaches the variance for the indicator variable for small separation distances h 2 m fig 6 similar to the characteristics of γ oc fig 5 indicating that over this separation distance the occurrence of the blk fis rock becomes uncorrelated the similarity in the spatial structure of γ oc and γ i blk fis indicates the strong dependence of lithology and in particular the occurrence of the blk fis rock in defining the spatial variability in f oc 5 effects of variable f oc on retention and release of tce 5 1 model of diffusion and adsorption the effect of spatial variability of f oc in the rock matrix on the retention and release of tce is evaluated by simulating time varying one dimensional tce diffusion and linear equilibrium adsorption in a rock matrix adjacent to a bedding plane fracture boving and grathwohl 2001 7 r x c aq t α d w 2 c aq x 2 0 where c aq is the aqueous phase tce concentration x denotes distance in the rock matrix d w is the free water coefficient of diffusion for tce α is the formation factor that accounts for the diffusion within the tortuous pore space of the rock matrix and r x is the spatially variable retardation factor attributed to the variability in f oc in this discussion we assume that other rock properties n and ρ b are spatially constant see eq 3 in evaluating r additionally we consider conditions driving the distribution of tce in the rock matrix that are attributed to a contamination event of finite duration in these simulations we assume the tce concentration in the rock matrix is initially zero 8 c aq x t 0 0 at t 0 we assume the aqueous tce concentration in a fracture adjacent to the rock matrix is equal the aqueous solubility of tce for 50 years this is followed by conditions where the tce concentration in the adjacent fracture is reduced to zero to simulate the onset of groundwater restoration 9 c aq x 0 t 1 1 x 10 6 μg l 0 t 50 yr 0 μg l t 50 yr in reality the tce concentration in the adjacent fracture following groundwater remediation will be dictated by processes in the fracture and tce diffusion out of the rock matrix we consider the simplistic interpretation of the boundary condition for c aq at the fracture surface to demonstrate the longevity of contamination in the rock matrix following a contamination event furthermore we simulate an infinite domain in the rock matrix where the distance between bedding plane fractures is considered to be large and does not affect the migration of tce into the rock matrix 10 c aq x x t 0 the one dimensional model of diffusion and adsorption into the rock matrix is intended to provide scoping calculations that demonstrate the effect of spatially variable f oc in the rock matrix and comparisons to conceptual models of diffusion and adsorption using spatially uniform representative values of f oc we recognize that spatial variability of f oc both perpendicular and parallel to bedding is complex and the restrictions of the one dimensional diffusion model may over emphasize the significance of large values of f oc in restricting the diffusive transport the model results should therefore be regarded as a restrictive interpretation without additional and more detailed information on the spatial persistence of f oc parallel to bedding more complex multidimensional simulations would be highly speculative eq 7 subject to the initial and boundary conditions given in 8 10 is solved using the finite difference algorithm available in shapiro 2018 to approximate the temporal and spatial derivatives with constant increments in space δx and time δt smith 1965 carnahan et al 1969 the temporal derivative is evaluated using a central difference crank nicholson approximation remson et al 1971 and the x dimension of the modeled domain is specified to be large x 2 5 m to simulate the boundary condition given in eq 10 in conducting a simulation to identify c aq x t in the rock matrix a realization of r x is defined from the variability of f oc and a value of r is assigned to each spatial node in the finite difference grid values of the physical properties and the numerical parameters used in the simulations are given in table 2 in the simulations of the retention and release of tce in the rock matrix we focus our interpretation on bedding plane fractures associated with the blk fis mudstone the bedding plane fractures in the blk fis mudstone have been shown to be the most permeable features responsible for the site wide distribution of tce underlying the nawc tiedeman et al 2010 goode et al 2014 analyzed rock core from coreholes at the nawc for the tce concentration and showed that the extent of tce migration into the rock matrix in the blk fis rock is confined to a narrow region several centimeters around bedding plane fractures simulations conducted in this investigation substantiate those results because of the large f oc associated with the blk fis rock because tce migration in the rock matrix is confined to distances of only several centimeters we do not consider the spatial structure defined by the semivariogram fig 5 in generating realizations of f oc to define r x the large nugget in the semivariogram for f oc fig 5 implies that the variability in f oc is nearly uncorrelated over small distances consequently in generating realizations of r x for the blk fis rock we randomly draw values of f oc from an assumed log normal distribution log10 f oc fig 4 table 1 with mean 1 96 and standard deviation 0 32 to generate spatial realizations of f oc additionally values for n and ρ b used in the calculation of r x are assumed to be constant and equal to average values obtained from analyses of rock core collected from boreholes 83br 89br at the nawc shapiro and evans 2017 shapiro et al 2017 table 2 analyses for ρ b have a narrow range with an average of 2 60 g cm3 values of n for core associated with the blk fis rock show variability between 0 02 and 0 10 shapiro et al 2017 this variability is more narrow than the range associated with the other rock types at the nawc although this variability will influence with calculation of r we focus our investigation on the significance of the variability in f oc on the retention and release of tce in the rock matrix to demonstrate the effect of the variability in f oc on the retention of tce in the rock matrix we consider multiple realizations for r x and compare those result with simulations conducted with spatially uniform f oc in particular we consider three scenarios of spatially uniform f oc these scenarios are 1 f oc is constant and equal to the average of all samples from the blk fis rock 0 0133 f oc bf 2 f oc is constant and equal to the maximum f oc observed in the entire data set 0 0396 f oc max and 3 f oc is constant and equal to the average of all rock samples 0 0064 f oc all additionally the value of f oc all is approximately equal to the minimum value of f oc associated with the blk fis rock fig 4 5 2 simulations of diffusion and adsorption results of simulations are shown in fig 7 at t 50 years at the end of the contamination period and t 80 years 30 years after the start of the groundwater remediation results in fig 7 are shown for the aqueous tce concentration c aq in the rock matrix fig 7a the adsorbed tce concentration c s in the rock matrix fig 7b and the cumulative adsorbed tce mass σc s fig 7c as a function of distance from the bedding plane fracture the results in fig 7 are shown for 10 realizations of spatially variable f oc and simulations using spatially uniform f oc equal to f oc all f oc bf and f oc max at t 50 years c aq monotonically decreases over approximately 6 orders of magnitude in the first 0 20 m from the fracture surface fig 7a for t 50 years tce mass diffuses back to the fracture but the tce distribution in the rock matrix also results in diffusion further from the fracture surface a peak tce concentration occurs a short distance into the rock matrix from the fracture the simulations for f oc being constant and equal to f oc all and f oc max bound the range of simulations for the 10 realizations of spatially variable f oc shown in fig 7a the simulation where f oc is constant and equal to f oc max shows the greatest retardation of the aqueous phase diffusion in the rock matrix and the scenario for f oc all shows the least retardation with tce diffusing farthest into the rock matrix the aqueous concentration for the scenario using f oc bf is encompassed within the range of diffusion fronts simulated from the realizations of spatially variable f oc at t 50 years there is a decreasing trend in the adsorbed tce concentration c s with distance from the fracture surface because c aq decreases with distance from the fracture surface fig 7b however in contrast to the relatively smoothly varying c aq in simulations of spatially variable f oc c s varies significantly from location to location by as much as an order of magnitude fig 7b the variability in c s is driven by the range of values that are drawn from the distribution for f oc for the blk fis rock the simulations using constant f oc equal to f oc all and f oc maxgenerally bound the range of c s at a given location in the rock matrix for the simulations conducted with variable f oc at both t 50 years and t 80 years shown in fig 7b the simulations at t 80 years show a decrease in c s near the fracture surface because of the associated reduction in c aq in response to the boundary condition at x 0 fig 7c shows the cumulative adsorbed mass of tce σc s as a function of distance from the fracture adjacent to the rock matrix the plots shown in fig 7c are the integration of c s in fig 7b as a function of distance from the fracture σc s reaches an asymptotic limit at distances approximately 0 1 m from the fracture surface at t 50 years whereas the asymptotic limit for σc s is achieved at a slightly larger distance approximately 0 12 m into the rock matrix at t 80 years the adsorbed tce mass constitutes the majority of the tce mass in the rock matrix profile table 3 shows a comparison of the total aqueous and total adsorbed tce mass in the rock matrix profile at 50 and 80 years for the simulations shown in fig 7 in general for the range of f oc in the rocks under consideration the adsorbed tce mass constitutes 98 of the tce mass in the rock matrix profile the variability in σc s between different realizations of f oc is dependent on the values of f oc nearest to the fracture surface in one realization values of f oc near the fracture surface are larger than f oc max which yields larger σc s than the simulation using a constant f oc equal to f oc max fig 7c however after the simulated onset of remediation the diffusion out of the rock results in desorption of tce at those locations nearest the fracture surface which reduces σc s at t 80 years σc s for the realizations with variable f oc are bounded by the simulations using constant f oc equal to f oc all and f oc max fig 7c results from the simulations shown in fig 7 can also be investigated to observe the total tce mass that diffuses into and out of the rock matrix as a function of time fig 8 the tce mass in the rock matrix profile increases up to 50 years where it is at a maximum and then decreases after 50 years because of the prescribed condition at the fracture surface for t 50 years only one realization of f oc shows a greater tce mass in the rock matrix profile in comparison to the simulation where f oc is constant and equal to f oc max for t 50 years the total tce mass in the rock matrix from the realizations using variable f oc are bounded by the simulations where f oc is constant and equal to f oc all and f oc max fig 8b shows the fraction of the maximum aqueous and adsorbed tce mass in the rock matrix profile as a function of time in fig 8b the fraction of the tce mass in the rock matrix profile equals one for each simulation at t 50 years the simulations with spatially uniform f oc superimpose on each other indicating the same percentage of the maximum tce mass is in the rock matrix profile at each point in time in these scenarios in comparison for the simulations with variable f oc the fraction of the tce mass in the rock matrix profile depends on the variability of f oc near the fracture surface for example large values of f oc near the fracture surface result in rapidly adsorbing tce mass however after the onset of remediation the adsorbed tce mass desorbs more rapidly near the fracture surface in fig 8 the simulations of tce diffusion into and out of the rock matrix demonstrate the effect of spatially variable f oc on the tce mass retained within the rock matrix over time and bounding calculations for the distribution of tce mass using representative spatially uniform values of f oc these simulations provide evidence of the longevity of contamination that can exist in fractured rock decisions on achieving remedial objectives for tce concentrations in groundwater however would need to consider the time varying mass flux of tce out of the rock matrix during remedial activities the mass flux is proportional to the slope of the curves shown in fig 8 simulation tools that incorporate the mass flux out of the rock matrix with mobile groundwater concentrations in the adjacent fracture would be needed to assess water quality at compliance boundaries or downgradient receptors fig 8 indicates bounding values of f oc that can be used in those calculations of the mass flux out of the rock matrix 5 3 discussion in the simulations of diffusion and adsorption of tce into a rock matrix we focus on rock properties that are representative of the blk fis mudstone underlying the nawc the bedding plane fractures in the blk fis mudstone are highly permeable and are responsible for the site wide distribution of tce simulations show that the magnitude and range of f oc in the blk fis mudstone results in the majority of tce in the rock matrix being adsorbed to solid surfaces in general 98 of the tce mass in the rock matrix is in the adsorbed phase under these conditions applying groundwater restoration strategies that reduce the tce concentration in adjacent fractures to increase the rate of diffusion out of the rock matrix still yields extended residence times for tce in the rock matrix for the conditions associated with the blk fis rock in these simulations 20 of the tce mass remains in the rock matrix after 100 years of remediation fig 8b simulations of tce diffusion and adsorption into a rock matrix with spatially variable f oc will yield spatial variability in the adsorbed tce the magnitude and range of variability in f oc in the blk fis rock results in the adsorbed tce varying as much as an order of magnitude over relative short distances investigations of tce in sedimentary rock conducted by sterling et al 2005 and goode et al 2014 have demonstrated similar results with large variability in the tce content from closely spaced core samples because of the large variability in the adsorbed tce in the rock matrix point concentrations of adsorbed and aqueous tce in the rock matrix at a discrete locations may not provide an accurate measure in evaluating the tce mass in the rock matrix and the longevity of contamination bounds on estimates of the time varying cumulative tce mass in the rock matrix based on interpretations of f oc may serve as a better indicator of the tce mass in the rock matrix for management decisions on remediation in the simulations using realizations of spatially variable f oc in the blk fis rock the tce mass is confined to small distances from the fracture surface 0 10 m from the fracture surface however from the results of the simulations using variable f oc the cumulative tce mass in the rock matrix varies by a factor of three the variability in the cumulative tce mass in the rock matrix is bounded by simulations using a constant f oc the simulation where f oc is constant and equal to f oc max can serve as an upper bound on the cumulative tce mass in the rock matrix realizations of spatially variable f oc where f oc is large near the fracture surface may lead to estimates of the cumulative tce mass greater than that using f oc max however after the onset of remediation the adsorbed tce mass near the fracture surface desorbs rapidly fig 8a simulations with spatially uniform f oc equal to the average of all samples analyzed f oc all including the gry mas and gry lam rocks provides a lower bound on the cumulative tce mass in these simulations in this analysis f oc all is approximately equal to the smallest value of f oc associated with the blk fis rock see fig 4 thus using the maximum and minimum values of f oc for the rock type under consideration places bounds on the tce mass within the rock matrix 6 conclusions although the spatial extent of contaminants in fractured rock is controlled by permeable fractures constituents diffusing into and out of the rock matrix adjacent to fractures can significantly extend contaminant residence times and impact decisions related to groundwater restoration additionally within the rock matrix adsorption of organic contaminants onto aquifer materials containing organic carbon can further extend contaminant residence times quantifying properties of the rock matrix that affect the retention and release of organic contaminants from the rock matrix is important in defining groundwater restoration strategies this investigation of 378 rock samples taken from seven closely spaced boreholes in a mudstone at depths between 15 and 36 m below land surface provides a detailed view of the spatial variability in organic carbon content f oc values of f oc vary over approximately two orders of magnitude in the rock matrix the variability in f oc can be attributed somewhat to the depositional conditions associated with mudstone layers the blk fis mudstone layers associated with deep water depositional conditions generally have the largest values of f oc where as the gry mas mudstone associated with shallow water depositional conditions have the smallest values of f oc the unique statistical descriptions of f oc for the three classifications of mudstone blk fis gry lam and gry mas in the lockatong formation underlying the nawc is further supported by similarities between the spatial correlation associated with f oc and the spatial correlation associated with the occurrence of the mudstone units categorizing depositional conditions that define layers within sedimentary formations is likely to be important in characterizing rock properties that affect the retention and release of organic contaminants attempting to identify representative values of f oc for the entirety of a sedimentary formation may not provide an accurate means of evaluating the longevity of contamination subject to various treatment options additionally it is important to characterize the occurrence of permeable fractures within the sedimentary units as specific units defined by certain deposition conditions may be more susceptible to fracturing in this investigation bedding plane fractures in the blk fis mudstone were identified as being the most permeable features underlying the nawc and were largely responsible for the distribution of contaminants over the site tiedeman et al 2010 the blk fis mudstone was also identified as having the largest f oc although the depositional environment associated with the mudstone units is helpful in inferring the range of f oc there is still large variability in f oc within individual mudstone units the results of this investigation showed that f oc varies over approximately an order of magnitude within mudstone layers that are continuous between boreholes in addition there is large variability in f oc over short distances perpendicular to bedding consequently it is unlikely that one will be able to quantify the spatial variability of f oc in the rock matrix to evaluate the retention and release of organic contaminants for site characterization and evaluating remediation strategies instead it will be necessary to define representative values of f oc that constrain the range of responses in the rock matrix using an average value of the f oc defined from the multiple rock samples does not necessarily provide bounds for quantifying the adsorption of tce in the rock matrix and the longevity of contamination simulations of diffusion and linear equilibrium adsorption conducted with spatially variable f oc associated with the blk fis rock show that the total tce mass in the rock matrix profile can vary by a factor of three among the different realizations instead of using an average value of f oc the range of responses in the rock matrix can be bounded by considering simulations with spatially uniform f oc equal to the maximum and minimum f oc from the analyses of core samples however using a spatially uniform value of f oc to characterize back diffusion does not accurately predict the fraction of the tce mass that remains in the rock matrix as a function of time fig 8b the spatially variable f oc in the rock matrix closest to the fracture surface dictates the changing percentage of the tce mass retained in the rock matrix although estimates of the total mass remaining in the rock matrix provide insight into the longevity of contamination estimates of the mass flux out of the rock matrix using bounding values of f oc are important in evaluating adherence to water quality standards in the mobile groundwater in fractures the large variability in f oc that is noted perpendicular to bedding in the mudstone will also yield large variability in the adsorbed tce concentration in the rock matrix investigations have noted large variability in the tce content of rock cores from closely space samples sterling et al 2005 goode et al 2014 an isolated analysis of a rock core yielding either a large or small tce content may not be indicative of the tce mass at nearby locations in the rock matrix instead estimates of the cumulative tce mass in the rock matrix profile should be used to evaluate processes controlling the retention and release of tce in supporting management decisions estimates of the cumulative tce mass in the rock matrix will require conceptualizing the bounds on f oc through analyses of rock samples and the simulation of diffusion and

1639,contaminants diffusing from fractures into the immobile porosity of the rock matrix are subject to prolonged residence times organic contaminants can adsorb onto organic carbonaceous materials in the matrix extending contaminant retention an investigation of spatial variability of the fraction of organic carbon f oc is conducted on samples of rock core from seven closely spaced boreholes in a mudstone aquifer contaminated with trichloroethene tce a total of 378 samples were analyzed at depths between 14 and 36 m below land surface mudstone units associated with deep water deposition have the largest f oc with a maximum value of 0 0396 and units associated with shallow water deposition have the smallest f oc even though f oc correlates with depositional conditions f oc still varies over more than an order of magnitude in continuous mudstone layers between boreholes and there is large variability in f oc over short distances perpendicular to bedding simulations of diffusion and linear equilibrium adsorption of tce using spatially variable f oc in the rock matrix show order of magnitude variability in the adsorbed tce over short distances in the matrix and residence times extending to hundreds of years following remediation in adjacent fractures simulations using average values of f oc do not capture the range of tce mass that can be retained in a rock matrix characterized by spatially variable f oc bounds on tce mass within the rock matrix can be obtained by simulations with spatially uniform values of f oc equal to the maximum and minimum values of f oc for a given mudstone unit 1 introduction the use of chlorinated solvents at many federal industrial and commercial facilities over the past several decades has resulted in widespread groundwater contamination pankow et al 1996 mccarty 2010 in fractured rock aquifers characterizing the spatial extent and longevity of contamination and designing effective remediation strategies has been particularly challenging nas 2015 fractures control the spatial extent of contamination however aqueous phase constituents can diffuse from fractures into the immobile fluid within the primary porosity of the rock also referred to as the rock matrix when concentration gradients are conducive constituents diffuse back into permeable fractures and migrate down gradient resulting in degraded water quality to down gradient receptors over decades to centuries mutch et al 1993 chapman and parker 2005 sale et al 2008 in addition to diffusive exchange between fractures and the rock matrix the retention of chlorinated solvents in fractured rock is also controlled by adsorption partitioning between the aqueous phase and solid surfaces associated with fracture walls or within the rock matrix a linear equilibrium model is frequently applied in characterizing the adsorption of organic compounds allen king et al 1996 1 c s k d c aq where c s is the concentration of the constituent in the adsorbed phase c aq is the concentration of the constituent in the aqueous phase and k d is the partitioning coefficient defined as cwiertny and scherer 2010 2 k d k oc f oc where k oc is the constituent s equilibrium partitioning coefficient defining its susceptibility to adsorb to organic carbon the equilibrium adsorption model leads to the definition of a retardation factor r domenico and schwartz 1990 3 r 1 ρ b n k d 1 ρ b n k oc f oc where ρ b is the bulk density of the aquifer material and n is the porosity the retardation factor scales the diffusive flux relative to constituents that do not adsorb to aquifer materials freeze and cherry 1979 more complex models of the adsorption have also been proposed to account for the nonlinearity of adsorption over a larger range of aqueous concentrations allen king et al 2002 huang et al 2003 in this investigation however we consider only the application of a linear equilibrium adsorption model identifying f oc is a critical component in site characterization to evaluate the significance of the adsorption of organic contaminants kueper et al 2003 sedimentary rocks can exhibit variations in f oc depending on the rock type gehman 1962 and depositional environment lacombe and burton 2010 calm deep water environments support aquatic life in the water column while providing anoxic conditions upon deposition that suppress the decomposition of organic materials in contrast shallow waters often exhibit turbidity and wave action that limit the growth of aquatic vegetation and promote dissolved oxygen and decomposition thus f oc can vary between classifications of sedimentary rocks depending on the composition of the sediments and the depositional environment associated with those sediments itrc 2015 provides a compilation of values of f oc explicitly noting characteristics of unconsolidated sediments and rock types however even within a given type of sedimentary rock for example sandstone versus mudstone changing depositional conditions can give rise to variations in the content of organic materials in the lithified rock lacombe and burton 2010 the significance of quantifying f oc in sedimentary rocks to evaluate the retention and release of organic contaminants from the rock matrix is widely recognized kueper et al 2003 itrc 2015 in comparing the mass of aqueous and adsorbed tce in a mudstone shapiro et al 2017 concluded that adsorption is responsible for the majority of tce retained in the rock matrix indicating that assigning representative values of f oc is critical in quantifying the retention of organic contaminants in many instances representative values of f oc are determined from a small number of rock samples usually by taking an average and combining those results with representative values of other parameters to estimate a retardation factor associated with the rock matrix kueper et al 2003 sterling et al 2005 several previous investigations have addressed the effect of spatially variable formation properties on the adsorption of chemical constituents however these investigations have focused primarily on the variability of these properties along groundwater flow paths valocchi 1989 cvetkovic and shapiro 1990 rajaram 1997 the retention and release of organic contaminants by diffusion in the matrix of sedimentary rocks due to spatial variability of f oc within the rock matrix has not been fully investigated the purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate the range of spatial variability in f oc in a fractured mudstone aquifer and the control that depositional conditions have on the magnitude and variability of f oc the significance of that variability in the retention and release of tce from the rock matrix is demonstrated through simulations of tce diffusion into and out of the rock matrix and comparisons are made to simulations using average values of f oc this investigation uses f oc analyses from rock samples collected from seven closely spaced boreholes in the upper 36 m of the mudstone aquifer underlying the former naval air warfare center nawc west trenton nj fig 1 variability in f oc with depth in individual boreholes is investigated along with the areal continuity of f oc along continuous mudstone layers in addition a detailed characterization of the rock cores is used to correlate f oc with characteristics of the depositional conditions associated with mudstone layers 2 naval air warfare center the nawc is a 0 24 km2 facility in west trenton nj fig 1 that served as a testing facility for aircraft engines the use of tce at the facility resulted in releases that were later detected in the groundwater lacombe 2000 2011 provides details of the source areas of tce contamination and the subsequent remedial groundwater treatments the nawc is underlain by triassic age rocks of the newark basin olsen et al 1996 a fault zone at the southern extent of the nawc demarks the contact between the stockton and lockatong formations fig 1 however tce has only been detected in the lockatong formation underlying the nawc lacombe 2000 the lockatong formation is classified as a mudstone that is characterized by cyclical transgressive and regressive marine floor conditions during deposition olsen et al 1996 lacombe and burton 2010 four different rock types are discernable as mudstone layers these rock types include light gray massive gry mas and reddish massive red mas mudstone that do not exhibit layering dark gray laminated gry lam mudstone and black carbon rich fissile blk fis mudstone lacombe 2000 lacombe and burton 2010 the gry mas and red mas mudstone are products of shallow water deposition whereas the blk fis mudstone is attributed to deep water depositional conditions and the gry lam mudstone is associated with depositional conditions that transition between shallow and deep water the different mudstone layers are areally continuous and can be correlated between boreholes separated by distances over 100 m lacombe 2000 lacombe and burton 2010 the mudstone strata have an orientation striking n65oe with a dip angle of approximately 25onw hydraulically conductive bedding plane fractures are associated with the rheologically weaker blk fis mudstone lacombe 2000 tiedeman et al 2010 weathering from land surface to depths of approximately 15 m has also induced permeability in the laminated mudstones permeable bedding plane partings are usually not observed in the gry mas and red mas mudstones however regional compression has created vertical jointing perpendicular to bedding in general vertical joints are confined within the individual strata and are less permeable than bedding plane features tiedeman et al 2010 robinson et al 2016 installed seven closely spaced boreholes at the nawc denoted as 83br 89br fig 1 as part of an investigation using geophysical methods to track the introduction of remediation amendments in fractured rock continuous 0 06 m diameter rock core was collected in each borehole up to approximately 36 m below land surface the core was inspected to identify the different types of mudstone as a function of depth in each borehole shapiro and hayes 2017 only the gry mas gry lam and blk fis mudstones were observed in cores from 83br 89br the red mas mudstone occurs at greater depths at this location underlying the nawc following the lithologic inspection of the rock cores samples of rock core from 83br 89br were selected for analyses of n shapiro and evans 2017 shapiro et al 2017 and foc shapiro and brenneis 2018 because the presence of fractures and fissile rocks often provides poor or displaced core recovery results of the borehole wall image logs were used to correct the depths of rock core collected during coring the depths of rock samples were corrected by correlating features observed in the optical televiewer images of the borehole wall with similar features observed in the core natural gamma logs were used to correct for the dip of the sedimentary bedding to compare rock properties between adjacent boreholes the geophysical logs for boreholes 83br 89br are available from the u s geological survey usgs web application usgs geolog locator https webapps usgs gov geologlocator 3 variability of f oc in total 378 samples of rock core from the seven boreholes were selected for analyses of the total carbon fraction f c and f oc analyses for f c were conducted for comparison and as a constraint on results for f oc the details of the sample preparation the methods of analysis and a listing of the results for f c and f oc are given in shapiro and brenneis 2018 the depth in the borehole and the mudstone type associated with each rock sample are also listed values of f oc vary over two orders of magnitude with a standard deviation 0 0068 approximately equal to the mean 0 0064 table 1 fig 2 shows values of f oc and mudstone lithology plotted as a function of depth for each borehole where the depths in each borehole are adjusted to account for the dip of bedding adjusting the elevations to account for the dipping mudstone units shows the continuity of the mudstone layers in particular the continuity of the blk fis mudstone units at depths of approximately 25 30 and 34 m weathering of the rock due to increased groundwater flow and unrecovered sections of core affect interpretations of the continuity of the blk fis mudstone at depths 20 m shapiro et al 2017 fig 2 also shows the largest values of f oc in each borehole appear in close proximity to blk fis mudstone this is also demonstrated in fig 3 where f oc from all the boreholes are merged into a single plot as a function of depth adjusted for the dip of bedding in fig 3 the largest values of f oc are associated with samples of the blk fis mudstone however at those depths where the largest values of f oc are identified there is also large variability in f oc indicating that within continuous mudstone units f oc can vary significantly for both the gry mas and gry lam mudstone strata between the blk fis mudstone units there is also significant variability in f oc fig 3 however the maximum f oc for the gry mas and gry lam mudstones is less than that for the blk fis mudstone the range in f oc associated with each rock type is illustrated in the histogram shown in fig 4 with values of f oc for the gry mas and gry lam rocks ranging over approximately two orders of magnitude and the range associated with the blk fis rock is approximately one order of magnitude in addition there is significant overlap in the ranges associated with the three types of mudstone although the categories assigned to the mudstone are based on observations of color texture and mineral content and attributed to a specific depositional environment there are not necessarily sharp demarcations in the rock characteristics used in assigning these rock types there is likely a spectrum of conditions ranging from deep water deposition to shallow water deposition associated with the mudstone the categorization into three types of mudstone is intended to assist in the interpretation of rock properties but it cannot capture fully the spectrum of depositional conditions the range in f oc for each type of mudstone is likely a reflection of the variability that occurs with the depositional conditions the distribution of f oc shown in fig 4 is bimodal with peaks at approximately 0 001 and 0 01 the abundance of values for f oc of the blk fis mudstone around 0 01 are responsible for the dominant mode of the entire data set the range of the distributions of f oc for both the gry mas and gry lam are similar however the gry mas rocks have a larger number of samples at the lower end of the range whereas the gry lam rocks have a larger number of samples at the upper end of the range this offset in the distributions of the gry mas and gry lam rock types is consistent with the conceptualization that the mudstone depositional environment affects f oc the gry mas rock is associated with a shallow deposition that is least conducive to the retention of organic carbon and thus it has the largest number of samples associated with the lowest values of f oc the gry lam rock is associated with a transitional depositional environment and has a greater number of samples with larger values of f oc in comparison to the gry mas rock this is also reflected in the relation between the average f oc for the gry mas and gry lam rocks table 1 the average f oc for the gry mas and gry lam rocks is 0 0035 and 0 0048 respectively in contrast samples of the blk fis rock dominate the largest values of f oc in the distribution fig 4 this is consistent with the interpretation of blk fis rock being associated with a deep water depositional environment that is conducive to the retention of organic carbon in comparison to the distributions for the gry mas and gry lam rocks the blk fis rock has the smallest standard deviation σ for the log10 f oc table 1 if one considers the statistics of f oc rather than log10 f oc σ associated with the blk fis rock is larger than the other rock types table 1 this implies that the gry mas and gry lam rocks are dominated by small values ranging over many orders of magnitude which skew the magnitude of σ consequently conceptualizing the distribution of f oc from a selected number of samples can affect how one characterizes representative statistics of f oc 4 spatial correlation of f oc the relation between lithology and f oc discussed in the previous section suggests a spatial structure to f oc within the mudstone understanding the spatial characteristics of f oc is potentially important in evaluating rock properties that can affect the retention of organic contaminants the spatial structure of f oc can be investigated by the semivariogram which is a measure of the average dissimilarity in a spatially varying property over increasing separation distances isaaks and srivastava 1989 the semivariogram is defined as deutsch and journel 1998 4 γ oc h 1 2 n h m 1 n h f oc x f oc x h m 2 where γ oc h is the semivariogram of f oc defined as a function of the separation vector h n h represents the total number of data pairs for the separation vector and the subscript m denotes a particular data pair in general over larger separation distances spatially varying rock properties become uncorrelated corresponding to values of γ oc approaching the variance of the data set also the semivariogram can vary according to orientation of the vector h however in this investigation we only consider the evaluation of γ oc in the vertical direction which is approximately perpendicular to the bedding plane fractures the variability of f oc in the horizontal direction can generally be seen in fig 3 because of the limited number of boreholes and the regular spacing between boreholes a semivariogram over a spectrum of separation distances in the horizontal orientation cannot be defined thoroughly the semivariogram for f oc in fig 5 shows the large variability in f oc over short distances and the influence of repetitive lithologic units over the range of h shown in fig 5 the number of data pairs that define the semivariogram vary from 211 to 686 at larger separation distances the diminishing number of data pairs reduces the confidence in the estimate of γ oc at small separation distances γ oc displays a nugget journel and huijbregts 1978 which is about 60 of the variance of f oc table 1 in general the nugget is an indication of the combination of measurement error and the microgeologic structure affecting the rock property journel and huijbregts 1978 we attribute the large nugget relative to the variance to the variability in the depositional conditions that support the retention of organic carbon in addition fig 5 shows the spatial persistence of f oc is confined to separation distances of approximately two meters for h approximately equal to two meters γ oc is approximately equal to the variance of the data set the spatial structure of f oc is also characterized by holes in the semivariogram journel and huijbregts 1978 at separation distances of approximately five and ten meters at these separation distances γ oc decreases to a value approximately equal to the nugget which again is an indication of the underlying variability in the microgeologic structure of the mudstone units the holes in the semivariogram result from the repetitive nature of the rock types and the similarity in f oc in those rock types the periodicity demonstrated in γ oc is an average attribute of the mudstone and is not attributed to a given rock type the holes in the semivariogram are representative of average separation distances where f oc is similar the statistical measures of variability in f oc for the various types of mudstone table 1 and fig 4 and the spatial structure of f oc depicted in the semivariogram fig 5 indicate the dependence of f oc on the mudstone classification and the thickness of the mudstone units the spatial structure of the mudstone rock types is similar to the spatial correlation for f oc which further illustrates the dependence between the depositional environment and f oc this is demonstrated in semivariograms for the mudstone rock types constructed using indicator variables deutsch and journel 1998 where the indicator variable ind i k x is defined as 5 ind i k x 1 rock type k exists at x 0 otherwise where k denotes a given rock type gry mas gry lam or blk fis and x denotes a particular location the semivariogram for ind i k x is defined similarly to eq 4 isaaks and srivastava 1989 6 γ i k h 1 2 n h m 1 n h ind i k x ind i k x h m 2 for comparison with f oc we only consider γ i k h in the vertical orientation based on observations of the rock core rock types were assigned every 0 03 m in the core recovered from 83br 89br shapiro et al 2017 the density of observations for rock type greatly exceeds the data density associated with f oc the density of sampling for f oc in 83br 89br varies from 0 35 to 0 46 m per sample shapiro and brenneis 2018 in addition the rock type is defined over the entire length of the cored boreholes whereas the data for f oc is confined to only those locations where samples of the core were removed for analyses the semivariograms for the indicator variables associated with the three rock types are shown in fig 6 the number of data pairs defining the semivariogram ranges from 20 000 to 60 000 for h shown in fig 6 the semivariograms for the gry mas and gry lam rocks γ i gry mas and γ i gry lam are similar and show characteristics of spatial persistence with a gradual rise over increasing separation distances these semivariograms approach the variance associated with the indicator variables at approximately h 13 m implying that at this separation distance the occurrence of these rock types are uncorrelated for h 13 m not shown in fig 6 the values of the γ i gry mas and γ i gry lam decrease indicating a spatial repetition these observations are generally consistent with the thicknesses of the gry mas and gry lam units observed in the rock cores fig 2 for separation distances h 13 m γ i gry mas and γ i gry lam do not rise monotonically fig 6 at separation distances approximately equal to five and ten meters γ i gry mas and γ i gry lam level off but do not decrease significantly this gives the indication of periodicity in the occurrence of these rock types over these separation distances at similar separation distances there is a strong appearance of periodicity in γ oc fig 6 in comparison γ i blk fis shows a significant decrease at approximately h 5 m and h 10 m fig 6 which is consistent with the characteristics of γ oc in addition γ i blk fis approaches the variance for the indicator variable for small separation distances h 2 m fig 6 similar to the characteristics of γ oc fig 5 indicating that over this separation distance the occurrence of the blk fis rock becomes uncorrelated the similarity in the spatial structure of γ oc and γ i blk fis indicates the strong dependence of lithology and in particular the occurrence of the blk fis rock in defining the spatial variability in f oc 5 effects of variable f oc on retention and release of tce 5 1 model of diffusion and adsorption the effect of spatial variability of f oc in the rock matrix on the retention and release of tce is evaluated by simulating time varying one dimensional tce diffusion and linear equilibrium adsorption in a rock matrix adjacent to a bedding plane fracture boving and grathwohl 2001 7 r x c aq t α d w 2 c aq x 2 0 where c aq is the aqueous phase tce concentration x denotes distance in the rock matrix d w is the free water coefficient of diffusion for tce α is the formation factor that accounts for the diffusion within the tortuous pore space of the rock matrix and r x is the spatially variable retardation factor attributed to the variability in f oc in this discussion we assume that other rock properties n and ρ b are spatially constant see eq 3 in evaluating r additionally we consider conditions driving the distribution of tce in the rock matrix that are attributed to a contamination event of finite duration in these simulations we assume the tce concentration in the rock matrix is initially zero 8 c aq x t 0 0 at t 0 we assume the aqueous tce concentration in a fracture adjacent to the rock matrix is equal the aqueous solubility of tce for 50 years this is followed by conditions where the tce concentration in the adjacent fracture is reduced to zero to simulate the onset of groundwater restoration 9 c aq x 0 t 1 1 x 10 6 μg l 0 t 50 yr 0 μg l t 50 yr in reality the tce concentration in the adjacent fracture following groundwater remediation will be dictated by processes in the fracture and tce diffusion out of the rock matrix we consider the simplistic interpretation of the boundary condition for c aq at the fracture surface to demonstrate the longevity of contamination in the rock matrix following a contamination event furthermore we simulate an infinite domain in the rock matrix where the distance between bedding plane fractures is considered to be large and does not affect the migration of tce into the rock matrix 10 c aq x x t 0 the one dimensional model of diffusion and adsorption into the rock matrix is intended to provide scoping calculations that demonstrate the effect of spatially variable f oc in the rock matrix and comparisons to conceptual models of diffusion and adsorption using spatially uniform representative values of f oc we recognize that spatial variability of f oc both perpendicular and parallel to bedding is complex and the restrictions of the one dimensional diffusion model may over emphasize the significance of large values of f oc in restricting the diffusive transport the model results should therefore be regarded as a restrictive interpretation without additional and more detailed information on the spatial persistence of f oc parallel to bedding more complex multidimensional simulations would be highly speculative eq 7 subject to the initial and boundary conditions given in 8 10 is solved using the finite difference algorithm available in shapiro 2018 to approximate the temporal and spatial derivatives with constant increments in space δx and time δt smith 1965 carnahan et al 1969 the temporal derivative is evaluated using a central difference crank nicholson approximation remson et al 1971 and the x dimension of the modeled domain is specified to be large x 2 5 m to simulate the boundary condition given in eq 10 in conducting a simulation to identify c aq x t in the rock matrix a realization of r x is defined from the variability of f oc and a value of r is assigned to each spatial node in the finite difference grid values of the physical properties and the numerical parameters used in the simulations are given in table 2 in the simulations of the retention and release of tce in the rock matrix we focus our interpretation on bedding plane fractures associated with the blk fis mudstone the bedding plane fractures in the blk fis mudstone have been shown to be the most permeable features responsible for the site wide distribution of tce underlying the nawc tiedeman et al 2010 goode et al 2014 analyzed rock core from coreholes at the nawc for the tce concentration and showed that the extent of tce migration into the rock matrix in the blk fis rock is confined to a narrow region several centimeters around bedding plane fractures simulations conducted in this investigation substantiate those results because of the large f oc associated with the blk fis rock because tce migration in the rock matrix is confined to distances of only several centimeters we do not consider the spatial structure defined by the semivariogram fig 5 in generating realizations of f oc to define r x the large nugget in the semivariogram for f oc fig 5 implies that the variability in f oc is nearly uncorrelated over small distances consequently in generating realizations of r x for the blk fis rock we randomly draw values of f oc from an assumed log normal distribution log10 f oc fig 4 table 1 with mean 1 96 and standard deviation 0 32 to generate spatial realizations of f oc additionally values for n and ρ b used in the calculation of r x are assumed to be constant and equal to average values obtained from analyses of rock core collected from boreholes 83br 89br at the nawc shapiro and evans 2017 shapiro et al 2017 table 2 analyses for ρ b have a narrow range with an average of 2 60 g cm3 values of n for core associated with the blk fis rock show variability between 0 02 and 0 10 shapiro et al 2017 this variability is more narrow than the range associated with the other rock types at the nawc although this variability will influence with calculation of r we focus our investigation on the significance of the variability in f oc on the retention and release of tce in the rock matrix to demonstrate the effect of the variability in f oc on the retention of tce in the rock matrix we consider multiple realizations for r x and compare those result with simulations conducted with spatially uniform f oc in particular we consider three scenarios of spatially uniform f oc these scenarios are 1 f oc is constant and equal to the average of all samples from the blk fis rock 0 0133 f oc bf 2 f oc is constant and equal to the maximum f oc observed in the entire data set 0 0396 f oc max and 3 f oc is constant and equal to the average of all rock samples 0 0064 f oc all additionally the value of f oc all is approximately equal to the minimum value of f oc associated with the blk fis rock fig 4 5 2 simulations of diffusion and adsorption results of simulations are shown in fig 7 at t 50 years at the end of the contamination period and t 80 years 30 years after the start of the groundwater remediation results in fig 7 are shown for the aqueous tce concentration c aq in the rock matrix fig 7a the adsorbed tce concentration c s in the rock matrix fig 7b and the cumulative adsorbed tce mass σc s fig 7c as a function of distance from the bedding plane fracture the results in fig 7 are shown for 10 realizations of spatially variable f oc and simulations using spatially uniform f oc equal to f oc all f oc bf and f oc max at t 50 years c aq monotonically decreases over approximately 6 orders of magnitude in the first 0 20 m from the fracture surface fig 7a for t 50 years tce mass diffuses back to the fracture but the tce distribution in the rock matrix also results in diffusion further from the fracture surface a peak tce concentration occurs a short distance into the rock matrix from the fracture the simulations for f oc being constant and equal to f oc all and f oc max bound the range of simulations for the 10 realizations of spatially variable f oc shown in fig 7a the simulation where f oc is constant and equal to f oc max shows the greatest retardation of the aqueous phase diffusion in the rock matrix and the scenario for f oc all shows the least retardation with tce diffusing farthest into the rock matrix the aqueous concentration for the scenario using f oc bf is encompassed within the range of diffusion fronts simulated from the realizations of spatially variable f oc at t 50 years there is a decreasing trend in the adsorbed tce concentration c s with distance from the fracture surface because c aq decreases with distance from the fracture surface fig 7b however in contrast to the relatively smoothly varying c aq in simulations of spatially variable f oc c s varies significantly from location to location by as much as an order of magnitude fig 7b the variability in c s is driven by the range of values that are drawn from the distribution for f oc for the blk fis rock the simulations using constant f oc equal to f oc all and f oc maxgenerally bound the range of c s at a given location in the rock matrix for the simulations conducted with variable f oc at both t 50 years and t 80 years shown in fig 7b the simulations at t 80 years show a decrease in c s near the fracture surface because of the associated reduction in c aq in response to the boundary condition at x 0 fig 7c shows the cumulative adsorbed mass of tce σc s as a function of distance from the fracture adjacent to the rock matrix the plots shown in fig 7c are the integration of c s in fig 7b as a function of distance from the fracture σc s reaches an asymptotic limit at distances approximately 0 1 m from the fracture surface at t 50 years whereas the asymptotic limit for σc s is achieved at a slightly larger distance approximately 0 12 m into the rock matrix at t 80 years the adsorbed tce mass constitutes the majority of the tce mass in the rock matrix profile table 3 shows a comparison of the total aqueous and total adsorbed tce mass in the rock matrix profile at 50 and 80 years for the simulations shown in fig 7 in general for the range of f oc in the rocks under consideration the adsorbed tce mass constitutes 98 of the tce mass in the rock matrix profile the variability in σc s between different realizations of f oc is dependent on the values of f oc nearest to the fracture surface in one realization values of f oc near the fracture surface are larger than f oc max which yields larger σc s than the simulation using a constant f oc equal to f oc max fig 7c however after the simulated onset of remediation the diffusion out of the rock results in desorption of tce at those locations nearest the fracture surface which reduces σc s at t 80 years σc s for the realizations with variable f oc are bounded by the simulations using constant f oc equal to f oc all and f oc max fig 7c results from the simulations shown in fig 7 can also be investigated to observe the total tce mass that diffuses into and out of the rock matrix as a function of time fig 8 the tce mass in the rock matrix profile increases up to 50 years where it is at a maximum and then decreases after 50 years because of the prescribed condition at the fracture surface for t 50 years only one realization of f oc shows a greater tce mass in the rock matrix profile in comparison to the simulation where f oc is constant and equal to f oc max for t 50 years the total tce mass in the rock matrix from the realizations using variable f oc are bounded by the simulations where f oc is constant and equal to f oc all and f oc max fig 8b shows the fraction of the maximum aqueous and adsorbed tce mass in the rock matrix profile as a function of time in fig 8b the fraction of the tce mass in the rock matrix profile equals one for each simulation at t 50 years the simulations with spatially uniform f oc superimpose on each other indicating the same percentage of the maximum tce mass is in the rock matrix profile at each point in time in these scenarios in comparison for the simulations with variable f oc the fraction of the tce mass in the rock matrix profile depends on the variability of f oc near the fracture surface for example large values of f oc near the fracture surface result in rapidly adsorbing tce mass however after the onset of remediation the adsorbed tce mass desorbs more rapidly near the fracture surface in fig 8 the simulations of tce diffusion into and out of the rock matrix demonstrate the effect of spatially variable f oc on the tce mass retained within the rock matrix over time and bounding calculations for the distribution of tce mass using representative spatially uniform values of f oc these simulations provide evidence of the longevity of contamination that can exist in fractured rock decisions on achieving remedial objectives for tce concentrations in groundwater however would need to consider the time varying mass flux of tce out of the rock matrix during remedial activities the mass flux is proportional to the slope of the curves shown in fig 8 simulation tools that incorporate the mass flux out of the rock matrix with mobile groundwater concentrations in the adjacent fracture would be needed to assess water quality at compliance boundaries or downgradient receptors fig 8 indicates bounding values of f oc that can be used in those calculations of the mass flux out of the rock matrix 5 3 discussion in the simulations of diffusion and adsorption of tce into a rock matrix we focus on rock properties that are representative of the blk fis mudstone underlying the nawc the bedding plane fractures in the blk fis mudstone are highly permeable and are responsible for the site wide distribution of tce simulations show that the magnitude and range of f oc in the blk fis mudstone results in the majority of tce in the rock matrix being adsorbed to solid surfaces in general 98 of the tce mass in the rock matrix is in the adsorbed phase under these conditions applying groundwater restoration strategies that reduce the tce concentration in adjacent fractures to increase the rate of diffusion out of the rock matrix still yields extended residence times for tce in the rock matrix for the conditions associated with the blk fis rock in these simulations 20 of the tce mass remains in the rock matrix after 100 years of remediation fig 8b simulations of tce diffusion and adsorption into a rock matrix with spatially variable f oc will yield spatial variability in the adsorbed tce the magnitude and range of variability in f oc in the blk fis rock results in the adsorbed tce varying as much as an order of magnitude over relative short distances investigations of tce in sedimentary rock conducted by sterling et al 2005 and goode et al 2014 have demonstrated similar results with large variability in the tce content from closely spaced core samples because of the large variability in the adsorbed tce in the rock matrix point concentrations of adsorbed and aqueous tce in the rock matrix at a discrete locations may not provide an accurate measure in evaluating the tce mass in the rock matrix and the longevity of contamination bounds on estimates of the time varying cumulative tce mass in the rock matrix based on interpretations of f oc may serve as a better indicator of the tce mass in the rock matrix for management decisions on remediation in the simulations using realizations of spatially variable f oc in the blk fis rock the tce mass is confined to small distances from the fracture surface 0 10 m from the fracture surface however from the results of the simulations using variable f oc the cumulative tce mass in the rock matrix varies by a factor of three the variability in the cumulative tce mass in the rock matrix is bounded by simulations using a constant f oc the simulation where f oc is constant and equal to f oc max can serve as an upper bound on the cumulative tce mass in the rock matrix realizations of spatially variable f oc where f oc is large near the fracture surface may lead to estimates of the cumulative tce mass greater than that using f oc max however after the onset of remediation the adsorbed tce mass near the fracture surface desorbs rapidly fig 8a simulations with spatially uniform f oc equal to the average of all samples analyzed f oc all including the gry mas and gry lam rocks provides a lower bound on the cumulative tce mass in these simulations in this analysis f oc all is approximately equal to the smallest value of f oc associated with the blk fis rock see fig 4 thus using the maximum and minimum values of f oc for the rock type under consideration places bounds on the tce mass within the rock matrix 6 conclusions although the spatial extent of contaminants in fractured rock is controlled by permeable fractures constituents diffusing into and out of the rock matrix adjacent to fractures can significantly extend contaminant residence times and impact decisions related to groundwater restoration additionally within the rock matrix adsorption of organic contaminants onto aquifer materials containing organic carbon can further extend contaminant residence times quantifying properties of the rock matrix that affect the retention and release of organic contaminants from the rock matrix is important in defining groundwater restoration strategies this investigation of 378 rock samples taken from seven closely spaced boreholes in a mudstone at depths between 15 and 36 m below land surface provides a detailed view of the spatial variability in organic carbon content f oc values of f oc vary over approximately two orders of magnitude in the rock matrix the variability in f oc can be attributed somewhat to the depositional conditions associated with mudstone layers the blk fis mudstone layers associated with deep water depositional conditions generally have the largest values of f oc where as the gry mas mudstone associated with shallow water depositional conditions have the smallest values of f oc the unique statistical descriptions of f oc for the three classifications of mudstone blk fis gry lam and gry mas in the lockatong formation underlying the nawc is further supported by similarities between the spatial correlation associated with f oc and the spatial correlation associated with the occurrence of the mudstone units categorizing depositional conditions that define layers within sedimentary formations is likely to be important in characterizing rock properties that affect the retention and release of organic contaminants attempting to identify representative values of f oc for the entirety of a sedimentary formation may not provide an accurate means of evaluating the longevity of contamination subject to various treatment options additionally it is important to characterize the occurrence of permeable fractures within the sedimentary units as specific units defined by certain deposition conditions may be more susceptible to fracturing in this investigation bedding plane fractures in the blk fis mudstone were identified as being the most permeable features underlying the nawc and were largely responsible for the distribution of contaminants over the site tiedeman et al 2010 the blk fis mudstone was also identified as having the largest f oc although the depositional environment associated with the mudstone units is helpful in inferring the range of f oc there is still large variability in f oc within individual mudstone units the results of this investigation showed that f oc varies over approximately an order of magnitude within mudstone layers that are continuous between boreholes in addition there is large variability in f oc over short distances perpendicular to bedding consequently it is unlikely that one will be able to quantify the spatial variability of f oc in the rock matrix to evaluate the retention and release of organic contaminants for site characterization and evaluating remediation strategies instead it will be necessary to define representative values of f oc that constrain the range of responses in the rock matrix using an average value of the f oc defined from the multiple rock samples does not necessarily provide bounds for quantifying the adsorption of tce in the rock matrix and the longevity of contamination simulations of diffusion and linear equilibrium adsorption conducted with spatially variable f oc associated with the blk fis rock show that the total tce mass in the rock matrix profile can vary by a factor of three among the different realizations instead of using an average value of f oc the range of responses in the rock matrix can be bounded by considering simulations with spatially uniform f oc equal to the maximum and minimum f oc from the analyses of core samples however using a spatially uniform value of f oc to characterize back diffusion does not accurately predict the fraction of the tce mass that remains in the rock matrix as a function of time fig 8b the spatially variable f oc in the rock matrix closest to the fracture surface dictates the changing percentage of the tce mass retained in the rock matrix although estimates of the total mass remaining in the rock matrix provide insight into the longevity of contamination estimates of the mass flux out of the rock matrix using bounding values of f oc are important in evaluating adherence to water quality standards in the mobile groundwater in fractures the large variability in f oc that is noted perpendicular to bedding in the mudstone will also yield large variability in the adsorbed tce concentration in the rock matrix investigations have noted large variability in the tce content of rock cores from closely space samples sterling et al 2005 goode et al 2014 an isolated analysis of a rock core yielding either a large or small tce content may not be indicative of the tce mass at nearby locations in the rock matrix instead estimates of the cumulative tce mass in the rock matrix profile should be used to evaluate processes controlling the retention and release of tce in supporting management decisions estimates of the cumulative tce mass in the rock matrix will require conceptualizing the bounds on f oc through analyses of rock samples and the simulation of diffusion and
