4290,we report on flow channeling and anomalous transport behaviors in a granite tensile fracture subject to increasing surface contacts in this study numerical experiments are conducted to examine the fluid flow and solute transport processes in realistic fracture voids then an effective approach is presented to identify the flow channeling and stagnation zones for studying their associated impacts on flow and transport behaviors from the analysis we show explicitly that the conventional understanding that the flow field is generally aperture dependent can break down when large areas of the fracture are in contact the part of fracture void with large apertures 7 larger than the overall mean aperture and accounts for considerable void area 30 of the total void area can be of negligible contribution to the overall flow when its connectivity to the main flow channels regions is weak we also find that although solute transport can be greatly retarded in stagnation zones stagnation zones with poor connectivity demonstrate quite limited effect on the overall transport process in general stronger flow channeling and anomalous transport can be observed with the increase of surface contact due mainly to the enhanced flow heterogeneity from the complicated fracture void structure with reduced aperture field connectivity the findings of this study may further broaden

surface roughness has been widely appreciated in numerous previous studies on flow and transport in rough walled fractures boutt et al 2006 lee et al 2015 li et al 2020 nazridoust et al 2006 oron and berkowitz 1998 rong et al 2020 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2021 yeo 2001 zimmerman et al 1991 zou et al 2017 for example boutt et al 2006 numerically analyzed the effect of fracture roughness on fluid flow and colloid transport in a single fracture zou et al 2017 simulated flow and transport processes in a rough walled fracture matrix system to examine the roughness effect and rong et al 2020 conducted a series of flow experiments and simulations in rough rock fractures to evaluate the effect of fracture void geometry on the flow behaviors these studies generally found that the flow field can show strong heterogeneity due to the varying nature of fracture aperture originated from rough surfaces resulting in tortuous flow channels and anomalous transport also known as non fickian transport behaviors that cannot be properly described using conventional models in addition to surface roughness subsurface fractures generally contain a certain amount of surface contact that may significantly complicate the fracture void structure kang et al 2016 nemoto et al 2009 wang et al 2020 xiong et al 2018 zimmerman et al 1992 the presence of surface contact can directly alter the flow streamlines leading to strong flow channeling that further enhances velocity heterogeneity previous field tests and lab experiments confirmed that in practice the majority of the flow passes through only 5 20 of the entire fracture area due to flow channeling resulting in a largely reduced fracture permeability kang et al 2016 tsang and tsang 1989 1987 watanabe et al 2009 moreover with the increase of surface contact stagnation zones are often found to emerge near the contact regions to greatly retard the overall transport of solute and cause anomalous transport behaviors kang et al 2016 stoll et al 2019 however in most previous works the rock fractures are either considered to have no little contact areas e g lee et al 2003 qian et al 2011 wang et al 2020 or the fracture voids are synthetically generated using statistical approaches e g kang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 or the flow process is simulated using simplified models e g kang et al 2016 stoll et al 2019 watanabe et al 2009 therefore a comprehensive analysis of accurate flow and transport behaviors is still lacking for rock fractures with realistic void geometries under different surface contacts the objective of this study is to examine flow channeling and anomalous transport in rock fractures with realistic complex voids different from planar plate shaped fractures with little surface contacts under increasing surface contacts since our primary interest is in the fracture void we consider negligible flow and diffusion processes in the matrix of rocks such as granite kang et al 2016 flow and transport simulations were conducted in three dimensional 3 d fracture voids obtained from directly applying different normal displacements to the aperture field measured from a real granite rock fracture an effective approach was presented to identify low flow and stagnation zones to examine their associated impacts on flow and transport processes based on a path searching algorithm with an accurate local flux pressure expression the study differs from the previous works in covering the analysis of an evolving flow channeling and anomalous transport process in realistic rock fractures within a wide range of surface contact from 1 to 45 moreover the proposed identification approach enables direct comparison analyses to examine the effects of flow channeling and stagnation zones on the general flow and transport behaviors in rock fractures with complex void structures 2 flow and transport simulations in 3 d rock fractures 2 1 construction of rock fracture voids in this study we consider rock matrix e g granite to have negligible permeability and diffusivity indicating that the associated flow and transport processes occur solely in fractures the 3 d void of a single rock fracture with its length l 150 mm and width w 100 mm was taken from the scanned surface topography data of a granite tensile fracture studied in wang et al 2020 the aperture spatial distribution of the fracture void is shown in fig 1 a similar to wang et al 2020 and xiong et al 2018 normal displacements of 0 4 0 8 and 1 2 mm were directly applied to the fracture plane to generate fractures with different contact ratios and relative roughness the detailed statistics of the four fractures denoted as f1 f2 f3 and f4 corresponding to the imposed normal displacements from 0 to 1 2 mm are presented in table 1 and the associated aperture distributions are shown in fig 1 b the aperture distributions were shown to skew more toward the smaller apertures as more contact areas were introduced from increasing the normal displacement due to the correlating nature of the aperture field that contact areas are always surrounded by smaller apertures 2 2 governing equations for isothermal steady state and incompressible single phase flow in rock fractures with complex void geometry the governing equations are the 3 d navier stokes equations with mass conservation basha and el asmar 2003 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 as given by 1a ρ u u μ 2 u p 0 1b u 0 where ρ kg m3 is the fluid density u m s is the velocity µ pa s is the fluid dynamic viscosity and p pa is the reduced pressure constant flow rates q m3 s were applied at the inflow boundary with a fixed pressure p out pa for the outflow boundary by considering impermeable walls for low permeability rocks we assigned no slip and no flow conditions for the remaining fracture boundaries the time dependent transport of conservative solute is governed by the advection diffusion equation bodin et al 2003b lee et al 2015 zou et al 2017 as given by 2 c t u c d 2 c 0 where c mol l is the solute concentration t s is the time and d m2 s is the solute diffusion coefficient initially no solute was considered within the fracture with c 0 when t 0 at t 0 a constant solute concentration c c 0 was assigned at the inflow boundary as we considered little diffusion in the rock matrix we also assigned the no flux condition for the fracture walls 2 3 setup of numerical experiments for simulation setup we considered the case of time dependent solute transport under steady state flowing water with the solute diffusion coefficient d 1 10 9 m2 s e g lithium ion water dynamic viscosity μ 0 001 pa s and water density ρ 1000 kg m3 considering a relatively slow flow in subsurface fractured rocks different flow rates were prescribed at the inflow boundary in the simulations with the reynolds number re ρq wμ from 0 0001 to 1 which correspond to the pelect number pe q wd from 0 1 to 1000 for the solute transport process solute with a constant concentration c c 0 were continuously released at the inflow boundary when t 0 the presence of solute in water was considered having trivial effects on the general flow properties and behaviors given its small amount c 0 1 mol l assigned at the inflow boundary i e in infinite dilution the associated governing equations of fluid flow and solute transport were directly solved in comsol multiphysics with the applied boundary conditions on average a total of 5 million tetrahedral elements were generated to reduce mesh related effects for the tested fractures due to the strong anomalous transport behavior solute transport simulations were conducted for a large pore volume pv qt b m lw of 100 for all fracture cases the pressure difference between the inflow and outflow boundaries and the solute concentration at the outflow boundary were directly obtained from the simulations for detailed analyses of the flow and transport behaviors 3 identification of channeling and stagnation zones the void geometry of a rock fracture can be well defined by its measured aperture field on the fracture plane which also inherits the roughness information of both fracture surfaces for a well connected aperture field with little contact and quite evenly distributed flow the low flow zones are generally regions with smaller apertures however for realistic rock fractures especially when considerable surface areas are in contact large aperture regions can also be of extremely low flow velocity when their connections to the main flow are poor see discussion in section 4 to predictively identify these low flow zones we adopted a searching algorithm described by yang et al 1995 yang et al 1993 on the aperture network generated by connecting the adjacent aperture sites nodes along the fracture length and width and the connection between aperture sites is known as the edge based on the accumulated flow resistances the algorithm searches for independent flow paths loops that form the entire aperture network an illustrative example of the approach is presented in appendix and the searching algorithm was developed in matlab following the described procedure the key component for the success of the algorithm is in accurate quantification of the local flux pressure relationship between adjacent apertures as given by 3 p r s q where r s pa s m3 is the local fracture resistance a common approach to derive this local resistance is to use the cubic law cl with the arithmetic mean of the local fracture apertures brown et al 1998 thompson and brown 1991 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 as given by 4 r cl 12 μ l s w s b s 3 in which l s m is the length w s m is the width and b s m is the mean aperture of the local aperture site the path searching algorithm with the cl based local pressure flux relationship has been found to reproduce the overall flow field and can be used to predict the fracture permeability cheng et al 2004 pyrak nolte and nolte 2016 however the cl expression is known to cause inaccuracy as it assumes parallel flat surfaces locally e g zimmerman et al 1991 to account for the effect of local fracture topography for improved flow prediction we applied an approximate analytical flux pressure relationship derived based on perturbation analysis of the creeping flow through two dimensional wedges following mainly the previous work of wang et al 2019 with a further extension to asymmetric geometries we retained the first three main terms of the perturbation solution from the zero to the second order the first order term is effectively zero the local resistance derived from the perturbation solution ps to the problem is given by 5a r ps 12 μ l s w s b ps 3 5b b ps b s 1 ω 2 4 b s 2 2 3 1 5 ψ 2 3 ω 2 20 l s 2 1 3 where ω m is the variation between adjacent local apertures and ψ m is twice the elevation difference between adjacent local aperture midpoints essentially ω accounts for the effect of local aperture variation on flow and ψ is responsible for the local tortuosity the main assumptions for deriving eq 5b include considering a slowly varying nature of the aperture field and the creeping flow condition which are generally believed to hold for flow through rock fractures in many subsurface scenarios basha and el asmar 2003 becker and shapiro 2000 wang et al 2019 watanabe et al 2009 zou et al 2017 when all aperture sites are visited and paths are identified the flow contribution of each path can be solved based on the kirchhoff s second law yang et al 1995 paths with negligible flow contribution low flow zones can then be identified and put aside using a specified threshold e g 1 of the mean flow contribution to form an aperture network with major flow contributions yang et al 1995 note that depending on the assigned flow rate solute transport in low flow regions may be advection dominant diffusion dominant or in between therefore low flow zones in this work are not necessarily the stagnant zones with diffusion dominant transport features however the proposed approach can also be extended to identify stagnant zones simply by incorporating another threshold for pe at local regions e g diffusion dominant when pe 0 1 4 channeling flow behaviors in rock fractures with complex void structures 4 1 flow behaviors in fractures with increasing surface contacts from the flow simulation results it was shown that the fracture s ability to transmit flow can be significantly reduced with the increase of contact areas as presented in table 2 the normalized fracture resistance rn rn r r cl where r and r cl 12 µl wb m 3 are the fracture resistance obtained from the flow simulations and cl respectively was more than doubled from 1 33 f1 to 3 06 f4 this also indicates the failure of the cl in describing the heterogenous flow behaviors induced by surface contacts where the real fracture resistance was three times higher than that derived from the classic cl formulation for f4 to demonstrate the flow behaviors in the tested fractures velocity streamlines were obtained from tracking equally spaced sampling points released at the inflow boundary of the fractures in general flow streamlines were observed to spread through most of the fracture void when the fracture is of little contact as shown for f1 in fig 2 however with the increase of surface contact more flow was shown to be crowded in limited but highly conducive regions that constitute major contributions to the overall flow the flow concentrated area can have significantly high velocity compared to other regions as indicated by the increase of the normalized maximum velocity u n from 6 78 for f1 to over 50 for f4 see table 2 the cause of flow channeling is two fold for fractures with well connected aperture fields flow channeling is due to aperture heterogeneity of the void where local flow contribution is directly controlled by the local aperture keller et al 1999 tsang and tsang 1989 wang et al 2020 this can be observed by comparing the velocity distribution of f1 fig 3 with the spatial aperture distribution fig 1 it was shown that both distributions were of similar patterns where high flow regions were generally of high apertures wang et al 2020 however the fracture void structure becomes increasingly complex as the contact ratio increases which is likely to result in a less connected aperture field with more flow being reorganized to regions that well connect the flow inlet and outlet despite having large volumes with large apertures fracture voids with weak connections to the main flow zone may be responsible only for little flow contribution we demonstrate this by conducting follow up flow simulations in fractures reconstructed by identifying and then removing fracture regions with local flow contribution 1 of the mean flow contribution using the approach presented in section 3 4 2 result comparison against fractures with low flow regions removed our simulation results showed that the flow streamline patterns of the reconstructed fractures in fig 4 are generally identical to their original ones as shown in fig 2 moreover the reconstructed fractures ability to allow fluid flow was found almost identical to their original counterparts with 1 of discrepancy in hydraulic resistance and transmissivity for all fracture pairs the largest amount of removed region occurred for the most contacted facture f4 where the removed area accounted for 30 of the entire fracture void area with a mean aperture of 0 79 mm for f4 although the removed area accounted for large fracture area with its mean aperture higher than the overall mean 0 74 mm it was still nearly non contributing to the overall flow and can be safely neglected when deriving the resistance transmissivity of the entire fracture this clearly demonstrates the importance of aperture field connectivity to fracture hydraulic properties in terms of directly controlling the flow paths making the geometric properties of the low flow regions generally irrelevant to the overall flow therefore for fractures with increasing fracture void complexity and flow channeling the fracture hydraulic properties may relate less directly to many general geometric parameters e g the widely used σ hm for decribing aperture heterogenity as the assumption of the evenly distributed or aperture dependent flow contribution breaks down under the channeling flow condition the detailed flow contributions of local regions need to be carefully evaluated to achieve an accurate description of the flow behavior for realistic rock fractures 5 anomalous transport behaviors in rock fractures with complex void structures at relatively high flow rates e g pe 1000 the general transport behaviors in rock fractures are dictated by velocity heterogeneity caused by the fracture void structure due to channeling effect a portion of the solute travels relatively faster through main flow regions while the rest travels at a slower pace in low flow regions as can be depicted from the distribution of the normalized concentration c c c 0 at 0 5 pv in fig 5 in comparison transport of solute was more evenly spread within fractures f1 and f2 whereas solute had clearly demonstrated faster penetration in fractures f3 and f4 through fast flow channels this macro dispersion of solute can lead to typical anomalous transport behaviors including early arrivals and long tailings as can be observed from the solute breakthrough curves btcs of the tested fractures at pe 1000 in fig 6 a the increasing fracture contact ratio strengthened the channeling effect and the btcs were observed to show an enhanced fast arrival and heavy tailings from the residence time distributions rtds in fig 6 b multiple peaks can be clearly observed for f3 as solute traveled through a few relatively independent flow channels however this multi modal behavior appeared to be less evident for f4 due likely to the joining of flow channels to enhance solute mixing near the flow exit see fig 2 for low flow rates when transport is mainly through diffusion e g pe 0 1 solute concentrations evolved more uniformly for all tested fractures in fig 5 however with the increase of surface contact transport paths became more tortuous and lengthened due to channeling effect which caused later arrivals for solute transport in more contacted fractures e g f3 in fig 6 to illustrate the transport mechanism of rock fractures under increasing contact and flow velocity the distributions of local pe for the four tested fractures are plotted in fig 7 at different flow rates it can be observed that for f1 transport was generally advection dominating throughout the entire fracture void when the overall pe equaled 10 however due to the strong velocity heterogeneity caused by high surface contact ratio transport was still diffusion dominating for over 24 of the total void area of f4 even when the overall pe was as high as 1000 these diffusion dominating zones are effectively the stagnation zones where flow velocity is low and transport is trivial by advection i e pe 0 1 the existence of stagnation zones can actively detain the overall transport of solute at higher pe due to the low flow velocity which caused increasingly stronger tailings for fractures with higher surface contacts and pe as shown in the btcs in fig 6 especially for f4 at pe 1000 c barely reached 0 4 after 100 pv whereas c of f1 exceeded 0 95 at a much smaller pore volume of 2 this extremely heavy tailing phenomenon was also not observed in previous works for rock fractures with no little contact e g lee et al 2003 qian et al 2011 zou et al 2017 to directly and quantitively show the effect of stagnation zones on transport behaviors we again conducted transport simulations in the reconstructed fractures obtained from removing the stagnation zones of f4 at re 1 using the approach presented in section 3 fig 8 shows the btc and rtd of the reconstructed f4 fig 8 a and the distributions of solute concentration at 0 5 and 1 pv fig 8 b in comparison the heavy tailing observed for the btc of f4 at re 1000 in fig 6 a was significantly reduced when the stagnation zones were removed the extent of the reduced tailings was therefore caused by solute retardation in stagnation zones with negligible advection accordingly the rest of the long tailings as compared to solute transport through smooth fractures with a uniform aperture are then due to dispersion within the fracture voids where advection takes over the main transport bodin et al 2003b detwiler et al 2000 despite the critical role of stagnation zones in delaying complete mixing of solute that caused extending tailings stagnation zones with poor connectivity appeared to be less contributive to this anomalous behavior from the bottom figure of fig 6 c for f4 at pe 0 1 although the measured c was already 0 99 at the outflow boundary a portion of the fracture void in blue was shown to have c 0 5 in this case the only connection between this part of fracture void and other parts was through an extremely narrow channel where only a limited amount compared to that crossing the outflow boundary of solute was allowed to pass in each moment therefore it requires a larger time scale to achieve complete mixing in this region than other regions 6 summary nature fractures widely possess complex void structures that can have a major control over the general flow and transport behaviors in a wide range of subsurface processes in this study we conducted flow and transport simulations for rock fractures with increasing void structure complexity due to the presence of surface contact we showed that the overall flow resistance was more than doubled as the contact ratio increased from about 1 to nearly 45 as a result of more flow being forced to limited flow channels beyond a moderate pelect number pe 10 evident anomalous transport behaviors including significant early arrivals and long tailings were observed from the breakthrough curves of the fractures with large contact areas due to strong flow channeling and the presence of large stagnation zones a method was proposed to effectively identify the low flow and stagnation regions for direct analyses of their associated impacts on the flow and transport behaviors in fractures with complex voids finally we found that for the highly contacted fracture f4 with a contact ratio of 45 nearly 30 of the fracture void demonstrated negligible effect on the general flow and over 24 was noncontributing to the general transport these noncontributing voids may further expand as more fracture surfaces are in contact to weaken the connectivity of the aperture field note that in this work the flow and transport processes are not considered in the rock matrix as we are focused on fracture voids of low permeability and low diffusivity rocks such as granite future work may be conducted for rocks with non negligible matrix permeability and diffusivity in general our study demonstrates the critical role of complex fracture void structure caused by contact area on the flow and transport processes on the scale of a discrete fracture as more studies e g frampton et al 2019 huang et al 2018 wu et al 2021 are attempting to incorporate internal aperture variability of individual fractures into fracture network models for larger scale problems our findings may provide fundamental understanding of the relevant physical processes to achieve further progresses in developing more realistic and powerful models credit authorship contribution statement zhihe wang funding acquisition conceptualization

anonyomous reviewers for their valuable suggestions appendix the general idea of the path searching algorithm described in section 3 follows mainly the works of yang et al 1995 yang et al 1993 in this appendix we show briefly the searching process of the most conducive path loop through a simple imaginary fracture case with 3 3 aperture sites represented by circles in fig 9 dimensionless resistances white numbers are assigned to each aperture site and the double arrows represent the connections between the aperture sites for fluid flow at the beginning of the algorithm the three bottom aperture sites are first visited as shown in fig 9 a since the bottom left site has the least resistance of 1 its neighbor sites are then visited represented by blue double arrows and their resistances are accumulated to be 6 and 7 respectively the aperture site is colored in blue when all its neighbor sites are visited and no further searching is to be performed from the site now the next searching starts at the bottom right site as it currently has the least accumulated resistance of 2 following the same procedure the algorithm searches through the three aperture sites to the right of fig 9 b and this path is identified as the most conducive flow path represented by red arrows with the least accumulated resistance of 5 the rest of the less conducive paths can be identified subsequently and more details can be found in yang et al 1993

aperture sites nodes along the fracture length and width and the connection between aperture sites is known as the edge based on the accumulated flow resistances the algorithm searches for independent flow paths loops that form the entire aperture network an illustrative example of the approach is presented in appendix and the searching algorithm was developed in matlab following the described procedure the key component for the success of the algorithm is in accurate quantification of the local flux pressure relationship between adjacent apertures as given by 3 p r s q where r s pa s m3 is the local fracture resistance a common approach to derive this local resistance is to use the cubic law cl with the arithmetic mean of the local fracture apertures brown et al 1998 thompson and brown 1991 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 as given by 4 r cl 12 μ l s w s b s 3 in which l s m is the length w s m is the width and b s m is the mean aperture of the local aperture site the path searching algorithm with the cl based local pressure flux relationship has been found to reproduce the overall flow field and can be used to predict the fracture permeability cheng et al 2004 pyrak nolte and nolte 2016 however the cl expression is known to cause inaccuracy as it assumes parallel flat surfaces locally e g zimmerman et al 1991 to account for the effect of local fracture topography for improved flow prediction we applied an approximate analytical flux pressure relationship derived based on perturbation analysis of the creeping flow through two dimensional wedges following mainly the previous work of wang et al 2019 with a further extension to asymmetric geometries we retained the first three main terms of the perturbation solution from the zero to the second order the first order term is effectively zero the local resistance derived from the perturbation solution ps to the problem is given by 5a r ps 12 μ l s w s b ps 3 5b b ps b s 1 ω 2 4 b s 2 2 3 1 5 ψ 2 3 ω 2 20 l s 2 1 3 where ω m is the variation between adjacent local apertures and ψ m is twice the elevation difference between adjacent local aperture midpoints essentially ω accounts for the effect of local aperture variation on flow and ψ is responsible for the local tortuosity the main assumptions for deriving eq 5b include considering a slowly varying nature of the aperture field and the creeping flow condition which are generally believed to hold for flow through rock fractures in many subsurface scenarios basha and el asmar 2003 becker and shapiro 2000 wang et al 2019 watanabe et al 2009 zou et al 2017 when all aperture sites are visited and paths are identified the flow contribution of each path can be solved based on the kirchhoff s second law yang et al 1995 paths with negligible flow contribution low flow zones can then be identified and put aside using a specified threshold e g 1 of the mean flow contribution to form an aperture network with major flow contributions yang et al 1995 note that depending on the assigned flow rate solute transport in low flow regions may be advection dominant diffusion dominant or in between therefore low flow zones in this work are not necessarily the stagnant zones with diffusion dominant transport features however the proposed approach can also be extended to identify stagnant zones simply by incorporating another threshold for pe at local regions e g diffusion dominant when pe 0 1 4 channeling flow behaviors in rock fractures with complex void structures 4 1 flow behaviors in fractures with increasing surface contacts from the flow simulation results it was shown that the fracture s ability to transmit flow can be significantly reduced with the increase of contact areas as presented in table 2 the normalized fracture resistance rn rn r r cl where r and r cl 12 µl wb m 3 are the fracture resistance obtained from the flow simulations and cl respectively was more than doubled from 1 33 f1 to 3 06 f4 this also indicates the failure of the cl in describing the heterogenous flow behaviors induced by surface contacts where the real fracture resistance was three times higher than that derived from the classic cl formulation for f4 to demonstrate the flow behaviors in the tested fractures velocity streamlines were obtained from tracking equally spaced sampling points released at the inflow boundary of the fractures in general flow streamlines were observed to spread through most of the fracture void when the fracture is of little contact as shown for f1 in fig 2 however with the increase of surface contact more flow was shown to be crowded in limited but highly conducive regions that constitute major contributions to the overall flow the flow concentrated area can have significantly high velocity compared to other regions as indicated by the increase of the normalized maximum velocity u n from 6 78 for f1 to over 50 for f4 see table 2 the cause of flow channeling is two fold for fractures with well connected aperture fields flow channeling is due to aperture heterogeneity of the void where local flow contribution is directly controlled by the local aperture keller et al 1999 tsang and tsang 1989 wang et al 2020 this can be observed by comparing the velocity distribution of f1 fig 3 with the spatial aperture distribution fig 1 it was shown that both distributions were of similar patterns where high flow regions were generally of high apertures wang et al 2020 however the fracture void structure becomes increasingly complex as the contact ratio increases which is likely to result in a less connected aperture field with more flow being reorganized to regions that well connect the flow inlet and outlet despite having large volumes with large apertures fracture voids with weak connections to the main flow zone may be responsible only for little flow contribution we demonstrate this by conducting follow up flow simulations in fractures reconstructed by identifying and then removing fracture regions with local flow contribution 1 of the mean flow contribution using the approach presented in section 3 4 2 result comparison against fractures with low flow regions removed our simulation results showed that the flow streamline patterns of the reconstructed fractures in fig 4 are generally identical to their original ones as shown in fig 2 moreover the reconstructed fractures ability to allow fluid flow was found almost identical to their original counterparts with 1 of discrepancy in hydraulic resistance and transmissivity for all fracture pairs the largest amount of removed region occurred for the most contacted facture f4 where the removed area accounted for 30 of the entire fracture void area with a mean aperture of 0 79 mm for f4 although the removed area accounted for large fracture area with its mean aperture higher than the overall mean 0 74 mm it was still nearly non contributing to the overall flow and can be safely neglected when deriving the resistance transmissivity of the entire fracture this clearly demonstrates the importance of aperture field connectivity to fracture hydraulic properties in terms of directly controlling the flow paths making the geometric properties of the low flow regions generally irrelevant to the overall flow therefore for fractures with increasing fracture void complexity and flow channeling the fracture hydraulic properties may relate less directly to many general geometric parameters e g the widely used σ hm for decribing aperture heterogenity as the assumption of the evenly distributed or aperture dependent flow contribution breaks down under the channeling flow condition the detailed flow contributions of local regions need to be carefully evaluated to achieve an accurate description of the flow behavior for realistic rock fractures 5 anomalous transport behaviors in rock fractures with complex void structures at relatively high flow rates e g pe 1000 the general transport behaviors in rock fractures are dictated by velocity heterogeneity caused by the fracture void structure due to channeling effect a portion of the solute travels relatively faster through main flow regions while the rest travels at a slower pace in low flow regions as can be depicted from the distribution of the normalized concentration c c c 0 at 0 5 pv in fig 5 in comparison transport of solute was more evenly spread within fractures f1 and f2 whereas solute had clearly demonstrated faster penetration in fractures f3 and f4 through fast flow channels this macro dispersion of solute can lead to typical anomalous transport behaviors including early arrivals and long tailings as can be observed from the solute breakthrough curves btcs of the tested fractures at pe 1000 in fig 6 a the increasing fracture contact ratio strengthened the channeling effect and the btcs were observed to show an enhanced fast arrival and heavy tailings from the residence time distributions rtds in fig 6 b multiple peaks can be clearly observed for f3 as solute traveled through a few relatively independent flow channels however this multi modal behavior appeared to be less evident for f4 due likely to the joining of flow channels to enhance solute mixing near the flow exit see fig 2 for low flow rates when transport is mainly through diffusion e g pe 0 1 solute concentrations evolved more uniformly for all tested fractures in fig 5 however with the increase of surface contact transport paths became more tortuous and lengthened due to channeling effect which caused later arrivals for solute transport in more contacted fractures e g f3 in fig 6 to illustrate the transport mechanism of rock fractures under increasing contact and flow velocity the distributions of local pe for the four tested fractures are plotted in fig 7 at different flow rates it can be observed that for f1 transport was generally advection dominating throughout the entire fracture void when the overall pe equaled 10 however due to the strong velocity heterogeneity caused by high surface contact ratio transport was still diffusion dominating for over 24 of the total void area of f4 even when the overall pe was as high as 1000 these diffusion dominating zones are effectively the stagnation zones where flow velocity is low and transport is trivial by advection i e pe 0 1 the existence of stagnation zones can actively detain the overall transport of solute at higher pe due to the low flow velocity which caused increasingly stronger tailings for fractures with higher surface contacts and pe as shown in the btcs in fig 6 especially for f4 at pe 1000 c barely reached 0 4 after 100 pv whereas c of f1 exceeded 0 95 at a much smaller pore volume of 2 this extremely heavy tailing phenomenon was also not observed in previous works for rock fractures with no little contact e g lee et al 2003 qian et al 2011 zou et al 2017 to directly and quantitively show the effect of stagnation zones on transport behaviors we again conducted transport simulations in the reconstructed fractures obtained from removing the stagnation zones of f4 at re 1 using the approach presented in section 3 fig 8 shows the btc and rtd of the reconstructed f4 fig 8 a and the distributions of solute concentration at 0 5 and 1 pv fig 8 b in comparison the heavy tailing observed for the btc of f4 at re 1000 in fig 6 a was significantly reduced when the stagnation zones were removed the extent of the reduced tailings was therefore caused by solute retardation in stagnation zones with negligible advection accordingly the rest of the long tailings as compared to solute transport through smooth fractures with a uniform aperture are then due to dispersion within the fracture voids where advection takes over the main transport bodin et al 2003b detwiler et al 2000 despite the critical role of stagnation zones in delaying complete mixing of solute that caused extending tailings stagnation zones with poor connectivity appeared to be less contributive to this anomalous behavior from the bottom figure of fig 6 c for f4 at pe 0 1 although the measured c was already 0 99 at the outflow boundary a portion of the fracture void in blue was shown to have c 0 5 in this case the only connection between this part of fracture void and other parts was through an extremely narrow channel where only a limited amount compared to that crossing the outflow boundary of solute was allowed to pass in each moment therefore it requires a larger time scale to achieve complete mixing in this region than other regions 6 summary nature fractures widely possess complex void structures that can have a major control over the general flow and transport behaviors in a wide range of subsurface processes in this study we conducted flow and transport simulations for rock fractures with increasing void structure complexity due to the presence of surface contact we showed that the overall flow resistance was more than doubled as the contact ratio increased from about 1 to nearly 45 as a result of more flow being forced to limited flow channels beyond a moderate pelect number pe 10 evident anomalous transport behaviors including significant early arrivals and long tailings were observed from the breakthrough curves of the fractures with large contact areas due to strong flow channeling and the presence of large stagnation zones a method was proposed to effectively identify the low flow and stagnation regions for direct analyses of their associated impacts on the flow and transport behaviors in fractures with complex voids finally we found that for the highly contacted fracture f4 with a contact ratio of 45 nearly 30 of the fracture void demonstrated negligible effect on the general flow and over 24 was noncontributing to the general transport these noncontributing voids may further expand as more fracture surfaces are in contact to weaken the connectivity of the aperture field note that in this work the flow and transport processes are not considered in the rock matrix as we are focused on fracture voids of low permeability and low diffusivity rocks such as granite future work may be conducted for rocks with non negligible matrix permeability and diffusivity in general our study demonstrates the critical role of complex fracture void structure caused by contact area on the flow and transport processes on the scale of a discrete fracture as more studies e g frampton et al 2019 huang et al 2018 wu et al 2021 are attempting to incorporate internal aperture variability of individual fractures into fracture network models for larger scale problems our findings may provide fundamental understanding of the relevant physical processes to achieve further progresses in developing more realistic and powerful models credit authorship contribution statement zhihe wang funding acquisition conceptualization

anonyomous reviewers for their valuable suggestions appendix the general idea of the path searching algorithm described in section 3 follows mainly the works of yang et al 1995 yang et al 1993 in this appendix we show briefly the searching process of the most conducive path loop through a simple imaginary fracture case with 3 3 aperture sites represented by circles in fig 9 dimensionless resistances white numbers are assigned to each aperture site and the double arrows represent the connections between the aperture sites for fluid flow at the beginning of the algorithm the three bottom aperture sites are first visited as shown in fig 9 a since the bottom left site has the least resistance of 1 its neighbor sites are then visited represented by blue double arrows and their resistances are accumulated to be 6 and 7 respectively the aperture site is colored in blue when all its neighbor sites are visited and no further searching is to be performed from the site now the next searching starts at the bottom right site as it currently has the least accumulated resistance of 2 following the same procedure the algorithm searches through the three aperture sites to the right of fig 9 b and this path is identified as the most conducive flow path represented by red arrows with the least accumulated resistance of 5 the rest of the less conducive paths can be identified subsequently and more details can be found in yang et al 1993 
4291,in the majority of studies aiming at stream temperature warming due to climate change just a single water temperature model is used choosing a single model may highly impact the conclusions from the study in this paper four relatively different empirical or semi empirical models perceptron neural networks product unit networks extended logistic regression and air2stream were applied to project the impact of climate change on water temperature in rivers located in temperate climatic zones of the usa and poland the models were driven by daily air temperature and streamflow projected by the rainfall runoff model in the first step the models were calibrated and validated then the projections of water temperature were derived for the historical periods and two future periods taking into account a climate simulations from the cordex initiative na cordex and euro cordex b the gr4j rainfall runoff model and c different water temperature models the obtained results indicate that due to global warming the stream temperatures are expected to increase by about 1 2 c for 2021 2050 and by 2 3 c for 2071 2100 periods these changes are not uniformly distributed throughout the year the largest warming in the usa is found in the summertime in poland in spring and autumn for some months the discrepancies in the projected stream temperature between various stream temperature models are large product unit neural network logistic regression based model or air2stream occasionally led to projections that differ from those obtained by the majority of models even by 2 c we strongly recommend using at least a few stream temperature models for analysing the impact of climate change on water temperatures or the fate of the aquatic ecosystem keywords stream water temperatures climatic change hydrological models neural networks air2stream hydrological projections 1 introduction there is a clear impact of climate change on the thermal regime of streams van vliet et al 2013 ouellet et al 2020 the increase in stream temperatures has already been observed in many countries including austria webb and nobilis 1994 china chen et al 2016 germany arora et al 2016 poland kedra and wiejaczka 2018 graf and wrzesinski 2020 spain soto 2016 uk orr et al 2015 switzerland michel et al 2020 or usa kaushal et al 2010 seekell and pace 2011 isaak et al 2018 however at least for winter spring seasons cooling of streams or rivers has also been noted at some monitoring stations in various parts of the usa kaushal et al 2010 arismendi et al 2012 isaak et al 2018 england and wales orr et al 2015 germany arora et al 2016 switzerland michel et al 2020 poland kedra 2020 graf and wrzesinski 2020 or south korea chang 2008 the observed general warming but also local cooling of water temperatures is also confirmed by some modelling approaches wanders et al 2019 presented a global water temperature model to study trends in stream temperatures over the 1960 2014 period and found that although clear warming predominates cooling has occurred in notable parts of the tropical rivers in some rivers along the border between western canada and the usa and rivers in the southern part of central asia the response of stream temperatures to climate change forcing affects the ecology of aquatic systems jonsson and jonsson 2009 pankhrust and munday 2011 eliason et al 2011 piccolroaz et al 2018a catalan et al 2019 weiskopf et al 2020 many studies aim at linking the future change of climatic conditions with water temperatures in streams and its impact on the fate of various aquatic biotas such as brown trout almodovar et al 2012 cianfrani et al 2015 salmonidaes null et al 2013 striped bass and atlantic salmon dugdale et al 2018 brook charr carlson et al 2019 or zacco platypus morid et al 2020 as well as on the general productivity of aquatic systems song et al 2018 du et al 2019 to make projections of the future water temperature in rivers one needs to apply a chain with three kinds of models the first type of models is used for simulation of the present and the future climatic conditions for the assumed emission scenarios the second type of models is applied for the simulation of river discharge the third type is used for assessing the relationship between the climatic and hydrological conditions and the thermal regimes of rivers at each step the choice of the model may affect the information projections provided for the next stage of the modelling chain which results in the cascade of uncertainty mitchell and hulme 1999 foley 2010 also the choice of the models or their parameterization may highly affect the projected impact of the climatic change on local water resources vaghefi et al 2019 in this paper we are interested in how the choice of stream temperature model affects the river water temperature projections providing that the same climatic and hydrological models are used the chain of modelling starts from the climate models these are considered here as an external source of input information that fed hydrological models the projections from different global and regional circulation models for different greenhouse gases emission scenarios moss et al 2010 are available from various initiatives giorgi et al 2009 kotlarski et al 2014 eyring et al 2019 in the present study we use cordex projections kotlarski et al 2014 as the stream water temperature is related to discharge rainfall runoff models are used to evaluate discharge based on the projections from climate circulation models e g bustillo et al 2014 ficklin et al 2014 du et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 in this study we use a single conceptual rainfall runoff model gr4j perrin et al 2003 that has already been widely used in climate change studies tian et al 2013 brigode et al 2013 cornelissen et al 2013 meresa et al 2017 stephens et al 2018 seo et al 2019 nguyen et al 2020 gao et al 2020 generally in the literature different types of models are used to describe relations between meteorological variables hydrological conditions and stream temperatures the first are physically based models et al 2012 du et al 2019 van vliet et al 2013 null et al 2013 gallice et al 2016 trimmel et al 2018 lee et al 2020 such models are sometimes integrated into more general water quality models dugdale et al 2017 da silva burigato costa et al 2019 another type of models widely used to relate discharge and meteorological conditions with stream temperature are so called data driven models such as linear regression carlson et al 2019 logistic regression mantua et al 2010 van vliet et al 2011 almodovar et al 2012 buccola et al 2016 soto 2018 or neural networks ann jeong et al 2013 stewart et al 2015 liu et al 2018a mitro et al 2019 recently a very promising class of methods that bridge the gap between the physical and empirical models have been proposed by means of physics based modelling within machine often deep learning willard et al 2020 such models were already applied to a lake read et al 2019 or stream jia et al 2020 temperature simulations and may potentially be an important tool for projecting the thermal regimes of rivers in future climatic conditions but such studies are so far lacking finally one may also find physically based models in which physical processes have been highly parameterized an example of such a model is air2stream toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 which has been recently widely used for modelling the impact of climatic change on stream temperatures both in historical cai et al 2018 piccolroaz et al 2016 islam et al 2019 and future periods råman vinnå et al 2018 many papers aimed at comparing of performance between different stream temperature models on historical data morrill et al 2005 hadzima nyarko et al 2014 piotrowski et al 2015 piccolroaz et al 2016 kwak et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 graf et al 2019 sakaa et al 2020 qiu et al 2020b often coming with the conclusion that some models are not worse than the others there is no consensus on the superiority of any kind of models over the others however although there are notable exceptions bustillo et al 2014 lee et al 2020 in a large number of studies addressing the future thermal conditions of rivers just a single stream temperature model is used mantua et al 2010 ficklin et al 2013 2014 cianfrani et al 2015 buccola et al 2016 dugdale et al 2018 mitro et al 2019 du et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 morid et al 2020 this may affect the conclusions of individual studies as 1 often the performance of the selected model is not validated against the others on the historical period and 2 even if the comparison is presented it does not mean that the quality of projections from different stream temperature models for future climatic conditions would be consistent with their past performance the above concerns may be raised for both physical and empirical simple and complex models for example the applicability of simple empirical models for stream temperature projections although frequent has already been criticized leach and moore 2019 found that linear regression models yield milder warming of water temperature than physically based models for future climatic conditions on the contrary lee et al 2020 found little difference in stream temperature projections between the physically based approach sun et al 2015 and the empirical model isaak et al 2017 arismendi et al 2014 showed that logistic regression models that use solely air temperature as an input variable which were proposed by mohseni et al 1998 are unable to capture complex relations between thermal conditions of the air ground and water body some doubts on such approaches have earlier been cast by morrill et al 2005 webb et al 2008 and null et al 2013 nonetheless numerous studies aiming at stream temperature projections in future climatic conditions use either linear almodovar et al 2012 cianfrani et al 2015 carlson et al 2019 or logistic regression models mantua et al 2010 van vliet et al 2011 almodovar et al 2012 buccola et al 2016 soto 2018 and the chosen approach is often a sole model for stream temperature applied in the particular study contrary to linear or logistic regression models neural networks are complex nonlinear modelling tools that may use any kind of numerical input variables however similarly to regression models they capture relations between variables based solely on empirical data without any insight into the physical process apart from the very recently proposed process guided networks read et al 2019 willard et al 2020 which as discussed earlier are a mixed class of models it hence remains unclear to what extent the criticism expressed in arismendi et al 2014 or leach and moore 2019 also points at neural networks it is unknown if some models and which ones properly capture important underlying relations between meteorological variables and stream temperature based on the limited information that may be projected for future climatic conditions from global and regional climate circulation models using at least a few different stream temperature models for future climatic conditions to test the consistency of the results would provide us with some information on the uncertainty associated with the model choice this cannot give us certainty about the future even if a few models show noticeable agreement all could simply lack important information or misunderstood the behaviour of the system however if divergent projections are obtained from a few models that seemed to perform similarly for historical data this may warn us about the reliability of the results one of the main limitations of the applicability of models for future climatic conditions is that various variables related to important processes that occur in a system cannot be easily taken into account information on major variables affecting thermal conditions of rivers like air temperatures discharge e g van vliet et al 2011 or declination of the sun e g piotrowski et al 2020a which may be considered as the simplest substitute for solar radiation may be used as they are either available from observations air temperature or through rainfall runoff modelling discharge from the modelling chain or are easily computable astronomical features declination of the sun however the water temperature of streams is affected by a large number of natural and anthropogenic factors poole and bermann 2001 caissie 2006 hester and doyle 2011 which generally cannot be projected or evaluated in many catchments stream temperature is highly affected by the groundwater temperature poole and bermann 2001 qiu et al 2019 johnson et al 2020 but this link highly depends on the local geological conditions o sullivan et al 2020 where this relationship is high the climate change induced warming of air temperature would have a limited effect on the stream temperature another important factor either natural or human induced is the shading of the riverbed by forests and plants it is of major importance for cooling stream waters chen et al 1998 sun et al 2015 trimmel et al 2018 wondzell et al 2019 qiu et al 2020a but its influence depends on the river size the smaller size of the stream the larger impact of riparian shading geographical location and season higher impact in summer than in winter season the change in shading may be both due to the natural processes or human impact the human impact may be reversible but many years are needed for the ecosystem to recover by natural processes from human logging caissie 2006 even if the particular area is highly modified by human activities managed aquifer recharge actions may be undertaken van kirk et al 2020 and leaving or re introducing the sparse vegetation in purposely chosen locations along the river may to an important degree mitigate the thermal stress garner et al 2017 which human activities will be performed along the stream banks and how they would affect stream shading in the future is however very hard to predict latella et al 2020 another human induced hardly predictable factor affecting stream thermal regime may be the loss of upland vegetation hester and doyle 2011 however its impact is more complicated and catchment dependent than in the case of riparian shading poole and bermann 2001 in general the catchment wide land use change often but not always increases the thermal stress macedo et al 2013 ebersole et al 2020 and its predictions for the future periods are also highly uncertain prestele et al 2016 the change in land use that causes the highest thermal pressure on the stream by various processes is the urbanization of the catchment nelson and palmer 2007 nelson et al 2009 katebchy et al 2019 urbanization implies the reduction in shading increase of ground temperatures emission of heat from artificial sources liu et al 2020 and decrease in discharge note that the impact of the large cities on water regimes may not be limited to the city area only for example as the water quality in cities decrease delpla et al 2009 drinking water may be supplied from sources located far away from the city as such potential sources of water are frequently located upstream their use may lead to the reduction of the river flow in the main channel or tributaries and hence to lower water levels and higher thermal stress null et al 2017 essaid and caldwell 2017 again water use and management in the future is very uncertain wada et al 2016 and depends on many political and economical actions as well as human customs that cannot be anticipated for decades to come another human induced factors that affects the thermal regime of rivers are artificial reservoirs poole and bermann 2001 cai et al 2018 daniels and danner 2020 wang et al 2020 on the contrary to the majority of other human based actions reservoirs are primarily responsible for cooling the river by spilling thermally stratified water cheng et al 2020 however large dams have a more complex impact on the relations between discharge air and stream temperatures liu et al 2018b and the fate of existing and possibility of constructing new dams during the next half a century is hard to predict as may be seen from this brief discussion the overall impact of human activities on the thermal conditions of rivers is complex but generally leads to warming the flowing waters this has been highlighted by culler et al 2018 who confirmed in a field experiment that the thermal conditions of streams flowing in inhabited not necessarily urbanized catchments would differ from those observed in uninhabited catchments human induced factors that affect the thermal stress of rivers are often politically or economically motivated and are strengthen or mitigated by human customs in particular decades and regions of the world hence they cannot be easily implemented into the modelling for future climatic conditions nonetheless we have to bear in mind that the change in human activities in the particular catchment may highly affect the thermal conditions of flowing waters and that any kind of models that are to be used would always be based on a piece of very simplified information about the system under study linking meteorological variables and discharge with stream temperature for future climatic conditions is the main topic of the present study we apply four different empirical and physically based semi empirical stream temperature models for projecting the stream temperatures in five catchments located in the temperate climatic zones in the northwestern usa midwestern usa and poland the main goal is to compare projections obtained by different models and analyze the difference in the results obtained the four models applied include multi layer perceptron neural networks haykin 1999 product unit neural network durbin and rumelhart 1989 multiple logistic regression based nlogr3 model piotrowski and napiorkowski 2019 and air2stream toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 these four models are relatively different but they all are non linear have an empirical form even though air2stream is physically based and require calibration of various parameters 2 study area in this study we consider five catchments three from the northern part of the usa cedar river wa fanno creek or and irondequoit creek ny and two from poland biala tarnowska river and suprasl river all five catchments are located between 43 n and 54 n two catchments cedar river wa and biala tarnowska river are mountainous two others irondequoit creek ny and suprasl are relatively flat the fanno creek catchment or is hilly on each considered catchment during wintertime snowy conditions may occur however with much different frequency snow is rare in the fanno creek or the lower parts of the cedar river but frequent in three other catchments and the upper parts of the cedar river short information on each catchment and historical daily data used for calibration and testing of stream temperature models as well as the rainfall runoff model is given in table 1 more technical details may be found in piotrowski et al 2020a additional information on data sources including appropriate links is given in the supplementary material the catchments under study cannot be considered natural they are affected by various kinds of human activities the fanno creek or is a suburban catchment susceptible to heat sources generated by the local population and the city of portland or to a lesser degree this also applies to the irondequoit creek ny which the lower part lies in the suburban area of rochester ny the cedar river wa also flows through the highly inhabited areas in the lower parts and its upper part is the main source of water for seattle wa conurbation as a result the upper part is a protected area with little human traffic which makes it more resembling of the natural catchment culler et al 2018 but its water budget is highly affected by human demands two polish rivers under study are less influenced by human activities and are located further from larger towns but there are some reservoirs on the biala tarnowska river and agricultural activities prevail in the suprasl catchment data sources for the cedar river fanno creek and irondequoit creek are us geological survey usgs and national centers for environmental information national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the historical daily data t denotes time in days used in this study for different stream temperature models include air temperature t t a precipitation p t discharge q t and stream temperature t t s in addition we also calculate the declination of the sun for every day of the year d s t and the differences in the declination of the sun from the two recent days these are easily computable for both historical and future periods and are used as input variables for stream water temperature modelling as a substitute for solar radiation as discussed in piotrowski et al 2020a as explicitly shown in column 2 of table 1 the historical data used for calibration of the rainfall runoff gr4j model often differs from the historical data used for the calibration of stream temperature models the performance of stream temperature models and rainfall runoff model is also tested on different periods called in this paper as testing data set which is a classical nomenclature in neural networks case as given in column 3 of table 1 this is because for particular catchment often the number of available data for stream temperature modelling differed from the number of available data for rainfall runoff modelling in catchements where meteorological data were available from more than a single station the thiessen polygons method was used to provide a lumped data for stream temperature and rainfall runoff models thiessen and alter 1911 in the case of suprasl river the air temperature was available from bialystok station only but precipitation data were available from five stations located within the catchment in the case of the cedar river wa for stream temperature models air temperature data were collected solely from the seattle int l airport however for computing potential evapotranspiration for rainfall runoff modelling data were collected from all three meteorological stations this is because the air temperatures in mountainous locations impact the evapotranspiration there but mildly affect the water temperature in renton wa where stream temperature is measured however note that even if such differences in handling historical data may affect projected values to some extent the impact would be identical for any stream temperature model hence it is of negligible importance for comparison between projections performed by different stream temperature models the number of historical daily data available for each catchment do vary see table 1 but is not shorter than nine years for each catchment the historical data are chronologically divided into the set used for calibration and the set used for independent testing of optimized models 3 3 methods 3 1 climate simulations in this study four climate models for the usa and five for poland were obtained from the cordex initiative giorgi et al 2009 kotlarski et al 2014 as a source of climate projections the vision of the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex is to advance and coordinate the science and application of regional climate downscaling through global partnerships using an ensemble of models is the best way to reduce the impact of natural variability and particular model features on the results pierce et al 2009 we have chosen global circulation models that provide 365 daily climatic simulations per year those that provide fewer were skipped simulations from different global climate models were selected first as they are the main source of variability osuch et al 2018 for each global circulation model a single regional climate model has been chosen as the latter only refine large scale information provided by the former giorgi 2019 the selected combinations of global regional climate models are cnrm cm5 ouranos crcm5 cnrm mpi esm lr ouranos crcm5v1 mpi noresm1 m gerics remo2015 noresm and uqam gematm esmsea uqam crcm5 uqam for the usa and cnrm cm5 rca4 cnrm ec earth racmo22e ec earth ipsl cm5a mr wrf331f ipsl mpi esm lr cclm4 8 17 mpi and noresm1 m dmi hirham5v2 noresm for poland in brackets we give abbreviations of each selected combination which will be used throughout the paper as we always distinct discussion for polish and us catchments we may keep similar names for both europe and north america the spatial resolution of climate simulations euro cordex for the european domain is 0 11 which corresponds to 12 5 km while for the north american domain na cordex is 0 22 25 km the projected values from each climatic model are used for both rainfall runoff modelling and stream temperature modelling we do not use any data correction procedure for climatic projections as although they can highly improve climate simulations for the historical periods it is highly disputable if such corrections are appropriate for the future climatic conditions ehret et al 2012 maraun 2016 maraun et al 2017 chen et al 2019 in this study we analysed climate simulations for the rcp 8 5 emission scenario for the usa and polish catchments the analyses were carried out for three periods historical period and two future climatic periods the close future 2021 2050 and the far future 2071 2100 3 2 rainfall runoff model the river runoff is an important variable for stream temperature modelling to obtain information on runoff for future climatic conditions we used a lumped conceptual gr4j model perrin et al 2003 to manage snow accumulation and melting the gr4j scheme was implemented with an additional snow module see piotrowski et al 2017 that extends the number of parameters that are to be calibrated to seven for each catchment the gr4j model has been calibrated with genetic learning particle swarm optimization glpso algorithm gong et al 2016 which is a kind of hybrid method linking genetic algorithms holland 1975 with particle swarm optimization pso eberhart and kennedy 1995 the performance of the model has been verified on the independent historical data testing set the one year long model warm up was implemented both during calibration on historical data and during application to future climatic conditions on each catchment the calibration procedure consisted of 30 runs of the glpso algorithm see details in piotrowski et al 2019 in each run up to 30 000 function calls was allowed and population size was set to 50 which is a trade off between a classical setting of 20 40 particles eberhart and kennedy 1995 and recent findings from wide scale studies across versatile kinds of problems that for the majority of applications and pso variants the swarm size should be larger piotrowski et al 2020b only the catchment wise best set of obtained parameters according to the testing data is used for future climatic conditions as an objective function the mean square error mse was selected 1 mse 1 n t 1 n q t sm q t s 2 where n is the number of training validation or testing samples in the particular data set q t sm is the modelled and q t s is the observed value of runoff for historical data for the simulations of future hydrological conditions the calibrated gr4j model was applied with input data air temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from an ensemble of climate simulations as a result for every climate simulation a projection of flows is obtained to feed stream temperature models the potential evapotranspiration is computed according to the classical hamon 1961 method 3 3 stream temperature models in this study to simulate water temperature in five selected catchments four different stream temperature models are used multi layer perceptron neural networks mlp product unit neural networks punn logistic regression approach nlogr3 and physically based model air2stream to compare the performance of stream temperature models on historical data apart from the mse with measured and modelled stream temperatures instead of q three other performance criteria are used the first one is the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 that allows simple inter comparison of performance between different catchments 2 nsc 1 t 1 n t t s t t sm 2 t 1 n t s t t sm 2 where t s is a mean stream hence s temperature during the particular period t t s is a stream temperature measured for day t t t sm is a stream temperature modelled hence sm for day t and n is the number of days in the particular period two further criteria take into account the sample size and the number of parameters but differently we use a version of the akaike information criterion akaike 1973 developed for the least squares approach which is defined as burnham and anderson 2002 3 aic n ln mse 2 k where n is the number of data days in either calibration or validation set k is the number of model parameters 1 and mse is the mean square error obtained for a particular dataset and river by the model the last criterion is a variant of the bayesian information criterion schwartz 1978 for cases when model errors may be assumed to be gaussian priestley 1981 4 bic n ln mse k ln n we remind the readers that slightly different definitions of this criterion exist see faraway and chatfield 1998 in the case of mse aic and bic the lower values of the criterion the better model in the case of nsc the higher value the better model and 1 means a perfect fit to verify the relative contributions of climatic models and water temperature models to the total variability in estimates for the stream temperatures through the year anova yip et al 2011 is applied in a similar way as in osuch et al 2017 3 3 1 multi layer perceptron neural networks to simulate future conditions we use the mlp versions with a deep learning based goodfellow et al 2016 variant of dropout hinton et al 2012 srivastava et al 2014 that was developed in piotrowski et al 2020a for historical stream temperature simulations mlp are composed of three layers as justified by hornik et al 1989 with linear activation functions used by nodes in input and output layers and logistic activation function used by nodes in the hidden layer nodes are the neural network s processing units organized in layers each node transforms the information received from nodes in the preceding layer and passes it further to the nodes located in the subsequent layer nodes located in the same layer do not contact directly with each other haykin 1999 following piotrowski et al 2020a in this study a vector of mlp input nodes xt includes air temperature t t i 1 a from some preceding days i 1 lag discharge from the recent day q t declination of the sun d s t and the difference in declinations of the sun in two recent days the mlp output is composed of a single node stream temperature for the particular day t t sm all input variables are linearly scaled to an 0 1 interval by setting x k t x k t x mink x maxk x mink where xmaxk and xmink are the maximum and the minimum values in the whole data set of k th input variable respectively to prevent overfitting two methods are jointly used in mlp the classical early stopping prechlet 1998 and dropout srivastava et al 2014 early stopping is a classical way to avoid overfitting in shallow neural networks in other words to prevent the network from fitting its output trajectory during training not only to the temperature trajectory but also to a noise presented in the training sample which is harmful for the application on unseen data the early stopping approach tells when to stop training and which solution to choose as the best one dropout introduced by hinton et al 2012 for deep learning models is a very special kind of regularization method when using dropout during training in each iteration with pre defined probability some nodes or connections between nodes in the case of dropconnect variant wan et al 2013 are randomly skipped resulting in processing with a simplified network as in each iteration different nodes or connections may be skipped the whole network is being trained overall but not by the same steps during such training to achieve improvement in a particular iteration the burden of processing information must be relatively evenly distributed between nodes otherwise when especially important nodes are being skipped the error sores the applicability of dropout also to shallow networks was discussed by baldi and sadowski 2014 in piotrowski et al 2020a we have shown how to use dropout together with early stopping for shallow mlp networks applied for stream temperature simulations in the present paper mlp networks were trained by the levenberg marquardt algorithm levenberg 1944 hagan and menhaj 1994 that uses up to 400 iterations with mean square error mse as an objective function levenberg marquardt is a kind of gradient based local search optimization method that speeds up the steepest descent employing approximation of the matrix of the second order derivatives comprehensive details on this algorithm may be found in yu and wilamowski 2011 for mlp training on a particular river the calibration data set was divided into two non overlapping subsets training set composed of chronologically the first 2 3 of measurements included in the calibration set and validation set composed of the remaining 1 3 of measurements prechlet 1998 all mlp architectures with up to 18 different lag values and up to 12 hidden nodes hn hence 18 12 216 versions were tested in piotrowski et al 2020a for each river in the present study for projections of stream temperatures in future climatic conditions we choose only the best architecture for the particular river the choice has been based on the results obtained for the validation data these architectures are defined in table 2 together with the value of mse for the independent testing period the mlp with dropconnect wan et al 2013 which is more efficient than classical dropout piotrowski et al 2020a compute the stream temperature as follows 5 t t s v 0 j 1 hn d 2 j i v j 1 exp w j 0 k 1 in d 1 kj t w kj x k t where v and w are matrixes of mlp parameters that are to be calibrated d1 in hn tr is a binary matrix used for dropping out some connections between input and hidden nodes and d2 hn tr is a binary matrix used for dropping out some connections between the hidden nodes and the single output by in and tr we mark the number of input nodes of the network and training samples size of the training set respectively the probability of generating 1 in each element of matrix d1 and d2 is set to 0 99 and matrixes are generated anew for each iteration finally the modelled output has to be re scaled as 6 t t sm t min s t t s t max s t min s after training all mlp parameters are multiplied by 0 99 the probability of retaining nodes used for dropconnect during training srivastava et al 2014 we run the levenberg marquardt algorithm 50 times for each river to collect a sample of optimized parameters however as the levenberg marquardt algorithm is a local search procedure it may occasionally stick in a very poor local optimum to avoid such poor sets of parameters we select 30 best out of 50 calibrated parameters the results obtained for the testing data set are not used during this choice mlp model with such 30 sets of parameters are then used for each historical and future period hence we obtain 30 simulated stream temperature values for each considered case the performance criteria reported for mlp in table 2 are averaged over all 50 runs the number of parameters used by mlp for each river is given in table 3 3 3 2 product unit neural networks product unit neural networks punn durbin and rumelhart 1989 have rarely been implemented for stream temperature modelling but their very encouraging performance piotrowski et al 2015 justifies their application in this study for punn we use the same input variables and the same division of historical data set into the training validation and testing subsets as in the case of mlp we also use early stopping prechlet 1998 as mlp punn is trained with the levenberg marquardt algorithm levenberg 1944 hagan and menhaj 1994 with mse as the objective function punn consist of both summation and product nodes each input is raised to the power that is a parameter optimized during training as a result for negative inputs and non integer parameters a complex number may be obtained as for the future climatic conditions some extreme projections of air temperatures or discharges may be obtained from climatic or rainfall runoff models we scale the input variables into 0 5 0 9 interval to minimize the possibility of obtaining a negative input 7 x k t 0 5 0 4 x k t x mink x maxk x mink where xmaxk and xmink are the maximum and the minimum values in the whole data set of k th input variable if a complex number is to be found anyway the complex modulus of the output from the network is used as scaling is linear using a different range than in the case of mlp have no impact on the modelling performance there are a few variants of punn martinez estudillo et al 2006 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2012 but here we choose only the simplest one in piotrowski et al 2021 we have analyzed the impact of dropout on punn and found that contrary to the mlp networks dropconnect is not the right choice instead classical dropout srivastava et al 2014 applied solely to input variables leads to the best performance hence the punn variant chosen here with dropout implemented into input variables only looks as follows 8 t t s v 0 j 1 hn v j k 1 in x k t d k t w kj where a single binary matrix d in tr is used the probability of retaining nodes hence the probability that the particular value in the matrix d will be set to 1 is set to 0 99 after training w parameters are multiplied by 0 99 but v ones are not the output from punn is then re scaled 9 t t sm t min s t max s t min s t t s 0 5 0 4 to obtain the projection of stream temperature as in the case of mlp 18 12 216 variants of punn architectures with up to 18 lags most recent values of air temperature used as inputs and 12 hidden nodes were tested following the same criteria as in mlp the chosen punn architectures for each river are given in table 2 the values of mse for the testing set are averaged over all 50 repetitions the number of parameters used by punn for each river is given in table 3 for each punn architecture we have also chosen the best 30 parameter sets for this study 3 3 3 nlogr3 logistic regression approach that links stream temperature solely to air temperature proposed by mohseni et al 1998 is still among the most widely used stream temperature models thackeray et al 2016 meredith et al 2017 shrestha et al 2018 huang et al 2019 abdi et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 despite its below average performance on historical data zhu et al 2018 piotrowski et al 2020a and the lack of capabilities to accommodate changes in the climatic conditions arismendi et al 2014 this model was originally developed for weekly data but is nonetheless frequently used for daily data as well its drawbacks stem mainly from the lack of memory or any kind of information on the past temperatures and the lack of additional variables to address both issues the model proposed by mohseni et al 1998 has been modified several times koch and grunewald 2010 van vliet et al 2011 soto 2018 in the recent modification called nlogr3 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2019 information on air temperatures from the last 30 days as well as on discharge and the declination of the sun were included in the model the nlogr3 approach relates the stream temperature to these variables as follows 10 t i s a g 1 exp h k d s i l 1 exp m n d d s i j 0 lag b j 1 exp c j d j t i j a e j q i j where a g h k l m n b0 blag 1 c0 clag 1 d0 dlag 1 e0 elag 1 are model parameters 127 in our case j is a dummy variable attributed to lag d s i is the declination of the sun at day i and dd s i is the difference in the declination of the sun in the two recent consecutive days i and i 1 respectively following piotrowski and napiorkowski 2019 we have chosen the value of lag 30 for each catchment the parameters of nlogr3 model are calibrated with the levenberg marquardt algorithm levenberg 1944 hagan and menhaj 1994 the calibration procedure is repeated 30 times for each river to obtain 30 sets of nlogr3 model parameters 3 3 4 air2stream contrary to mlp punn and nlogr3 the air2stream model is an example of physically based semi empirical models the performance of the air2stream is competitive with other models on historical data piccolroaz et al 2016 air2stream describes the lumped heat budget exchange between an unknown volume of water in the river in its tributaries and the atmosphere in the following form 11 ρ c p v d t w dt a h ρ c p i q i t w i q t w where v is an unknown volume of water in the river reach a is the surface area of the reach tw is water temperature ρ is water density with specific heat capacity at constant pressure cp h is the net heat flux between air and water qi is the discharge from the i th water source either tributary or groundwater with water temperature twi q is the discharge downstream of the insertion of tributaries and t is time toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 have parameterized the model and obtained an air2stream version with 8 parameters a1 a8 as follows 12 d t w dt 1 θ a 4 a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w θ a 5 a 6 cos 2 π t t y a 7 a 8 t w θ q q q t 2 t 1 1 t 1 t 2 q t d t where ta is the air temperature ty is a length of the year in the same units as t θ is the dimensionless streamflow and q is the mean discharge over the time series from t1 to t2 in this study the whole calibration set following toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 and piccolroaz 2016 eq 12 is solved with the crank nicolson method the modelled stream temperature values are restricted to 0 c 35 c interval although only daily data were available the time step used while solving eq 12 was chosen to be 0 1 days hence 2 4 h with a linear approximation of all variables to alleviate numerical problems for the future climatic conditions as with the other models fitness function eq 1 but with stream temperatures instead of discharges for historical data was computed at a daily scale hence to compute it every 10th step t was used in this paper as the initial condition water temperature measured on the first day of the observations is used and to limit the impact of the initial condition on the model performance a 365 day warm up period is set we have used the differential evolution variant based on covariance matrix learning and bimodal distribution cobide calibration algorithm wang et al 2014 with the same range of parameters as in piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 the maximum number of function calls was set to 100 000 the air2stream was calibrated 30 times for each catchment to give a sample of its parameters 4 results 4 1 comparison of simulations with observations in this section the model simulations are compared with observations we first point at the differences between observations and simulations obtained from climatic models for the same historical period then discuss the performance of the rainfall runoff model and finally compare the simulations of stream temperature models that are either based on the observed data or simulations from climate models we avoid using specific approaches to manage raw data or climate projections diaz nieto and wilby 2005 minville et al 2008 piccolroaz et al 2018b however to what extent particular approach fits the data may depend not only on the model or the calibration method but also on similarity of meteorological and hydrological conditions in particular periods this is why data based models that require calibration of large number of parameters neural networks are used with specific approaches that aim at avoiding overfitting to the calibration sample see also prechlet 1998 baldi and sadowski 2014 piotrowski et al 2020a 4 1 1 climatic data the comparison of the observed mean monthly air temperature and the sum of precipitation for the historical period at selected meteorological stations from each catchment against the values simulated for that period by climate models used in this study is given in fig 1 observed and projected by the climatic models monthly minimum mean and maximum daily averaged temperatures are provided in suppl fig 1 to what extent the simulations from the climatic models fit the measurements depend on the station model and season of the year in the case of the fanno creek catchment or climatic models often underestimate the observed air temperature on the contrary in the rochester ny and the cedar river catchment wa the air temperature is highly overestimated during winter and often underestimated during summer months in the case of the cedar river the results obtained for a single meteorological station see seattle in fig 1 also differ to some extent from the catchment averaged picture see suppl fig 1 as both observations and projections differ highly for stations located on the seaside and in the high mountains in polish catchments the climatic models fit historical observations better but the majority of models project too cold winters especially the mean minimum monthly air temperatures in january and february are simulated well below observations see suppl fig 1 however these findings are model dependent as ec earth racmo22e constantly underestimate air temperature for polish catchments when ipsl cm5a wrf331f simulate too cold winters and too hot summers the precipitation amount is often highly exaggerated in the lowland us catchments and the mountainous part of poland a better fit is obtained for mountainous stations located in the north western usa and lowland stations of north eastern poland of the main concern is however rochester ny for which neither air temperature nor precipitation is correctly simulated by any among considered climatic models too warm winters and too cool summers are simulated and precipitation is highly exaggerated though the whole year apart of the mid summer where it is underestimated climatic models simulate relatively constant precipitation through the year in rochester ny which by no means fits the observations as a result of poor fitting for historical data the projections obtained for the irondequoit creek ny must be taken with extra care in further discussion 4 2 rainfall runoff modelling based on historical and simulated meteorological data the gr4j model is used to simulate discharge for historical periods defined in table 1 from both historical meteorological measurements and simulations obtained from climatic models for respective historical periods for each considered catchment we use a single gr4j model which parameters are optimized for the calibration period on historical data in suppl figs 2 3 we illustrate the averaged over the whole historical period including calibration and testing data the minimum mean and maximum daily discharge for each month our goal is to illustrate to what extend the gr4j rainfall runoff model can match averaged monthly observations when the meteorological data come either from observations see the left column in suppl figs 2 3 or simulations from the climate models see the right column in suppl figs 2 3 the values presented for simulated time series are averaged over all four in the case of the usa or five in the case of poland climatic models for completeness in suppl fig 4 we show the related plots with the catchment averaged monthly minimum mean and maximum values of daily discharge observed and simulated using the gr4j model for each climatic model in these supplementary figures a logarithmic scale is used to improve readability when meteorological observations are used as inputs to the gr4j model the simulated discharge fits observations relatively well in almost all catchments however for the suprasl river summer discharge is twice too high and winter discharge is underestimated for seasons in historical periods that were poorly fitted by climate simulations the discharges modelled using these climate simulations were not always appropriate see fig 1 climatic models simulate too wet spring and summer periods in the suprasl river catchment what leads to the exaggerated discharge simulations see suppl fig 4 in the case of irondequoit creek and the cedar river catchments due to the overestimated precipitation simulated from climatic models during the cold season see fig 1 the runoff was modelled much higher than observed see suppl fig 4 based on the simulated climatic conditions summer discharge is correctly modelled for the cedar river but highly underestimated for the irondequoit and fanno creeks see suppl fig 4 as streams with smaller discharges warm up quicker this may result in much higher modelled thermal stress than actually observed and is some warning for future projections 4 2 1 stream temperature modelling based on measured and simulated meteorological data four water temperature models are applied to simulate the water temperatures in five catchments for historical periods similarly to the procedure used for the rainfall runoff model each stream temperature model was launched with two types of inputs i observed air temperatures and discharge obtained from the gr4j model when gr4j was fed with observed precipitation and air temperatures and ii simulated air temperature and discharge simulated by gr4j model when gr4j was fed with air temperature and precipitation simulations from the same climatic models in figs 2 3 we show the averaged over the historical period both calibration and testing data minimum mean and maximum daily averaged stream temperatures for every month in the left column the modelled stream temperatures based on observations in the right column based on climate models simulations are given we noticed that for both polish rivers the differences between outcomes of different stream temperature models are relatively small and each model fits the observed stream temperature relatively well of the main concern is the 1 2 c underestimation of the mean maximum daily averaged temperatures for the summer months and an underestimation of the mean stream temperatures during springtime in the suprasl river that is observed for both simulated from climatic models and observed data us rivers are much more problematic especially when simulations from climatic models are used right column in fig 3 first we observe the large differences between stream temperature models physically based semi empirical air2stream underestimates the stream temperatures for the cedar river through the year when the model is fed with historical observations interestingly the air2stream model better fits reality when it is fed with air temperatures and discharges coming from climate models simulations the cedar river catchment is composed of two very different parts highly mountainous cool rainy and snowy east and mild snow free and relatively flat west where gauge station is located this may be the reason for the poor performance of physically based air2stream especially that on other catchments it correctly fit observations another approach used nlogr3 also notice some problems as it underestimates the water temperatures in the fanno creek for the late summer when it is fed with simulations from climatic models nlogr2 also underestimates the minimum daily temperatures in the cedar river even when it is fed with observation data mlp and punn models do not note such clear flaws however all models highly underestimate the stream temperature in the fanno creek during the whole year in the irondequoit creek during the summer month and overestimate water temperatures during winter in the irondequoit creek when fed by simulations obtained from climatic circulation models in the case of the cedar river mlp and punn perform well but still overestimate summer stream temperatures when meteorological simulations are used and underestimate it when fed with meteorological measurements based on the above findings one may note an uneven modelling quality of the four models for different rivers to show it more clearly in table 4 we present four model performance criteria obtained for testing data sets for each model fed with meteorological observations for each river mse and nsc are classical hydrological indicators of model performance that account for neither the number of parameters nor the sample size when the sample size is fixed for a particular river both criteria would always yield an equal ranking of models on the contrary aic and bic take into account the number of model s parameters and the sample size but differently see eqs 3 and 4 the ranking of models by means of mse aic and bic may hence be very different the noticeably poor performance of air2stream and nlogr3 on the cedar river is confirmed by mse nsc and aic criteria see table 4 bic which accounts more heavily for the very low number of air2stream parameters does not show that but air2stream remains inferior to punn for that river overall according to mse and nsc punn is the best model for each river apart from irondequoit creek for which it is outperformed only by mlp according to aic punn is the best model for three rivers apart from irondequoit creek and with a marginal difference cedar river for which it is ranked the second and mlp turns out the best according to bic air2stream is the best option for three rivers because it has the lowest number of parameters apart from cedar creek for which punn is the best method and fanno creek in which case air2stream is outperformed by both mlp and punn hence although on average punn seems to be overall the best method considering different rivers and comparison criteria one must note that using different criteria may lead to different conclusions on the ranking of models even for historical data finally we apply anova yip et al 2011 to see whether climatic or stream temperature models have a larger impact on the simulated performance of stream temperatures for historical periods we perform a similar procedure to osuch et al 2017 the relative contributions of climatic models and water temperature models to the total variability in estimates for the stream temperatures through the year are given in table 5 we may note that on three catchments both polish ones and irondequoit creek ny the variability related to the climatic model highly dominates in the case of these three catchements the contribution from the water temperature modes is smaller than 10 for the historical period for fanno creek and cedar river from the northwestern usa the fully opposite results are obtained and the variability related to stream temperature models is much larger 53 and 83 respectively than the variability related to the climatic models 37 and 16 respectively hence the relative contribution to the variability in estimates of stream temperatures highly depends on the catchment this makes the warning that using a single stream temperature model may lead to highly inadequate results for future climatic conditions 4 3 projections of stream temperatures in this section we discuss the projections of water temperatures in rivers in two future periods 2021 2050 and 2071 2100 under the rcp 8 5 emission scenario obtained from four different stream temperature models however first some attention needs to be focused on the projections of air temperatures section 4 2 1 and discharge section 4 2 2 which will be used as input information to stream temperature models this would allow us to note how the projected change in stream temperatures is related to changes in air temperatures and discuss the variability of water temperature projections made by different stream temperature models with relation to the variability of air temperature projections obtained from different climatic models following ehret et al 2012 and maraun et al 2017 we do not use bias correction procedures for the climatic projections 4 3 1 air temperature projections the changes in mean monthly air temperatures between values simulated from climatic models for the historical period see suppl fig 1 and values projected from climatic models for future periods 2021 2050 and 2071 2100 see section 3 1 for details are shown in suppl figs 5 9 each among suppl figs 5 9 consist of six panels in the panels on the left the results of estimated changes in air temperature between the near future and the historical period are presented while in the panels on the right the changes between the far future and the historical period are shown in the three rows the changes in monthly minimum mean and maximum daily averaged air temperatures are presented on average the projected increases of mean monthly air temperatures vary depending on the month catchment and climatic model from 0 c to 3 c for the 2021 2050 period and from 1 5 c to 6 c for the 2071 2100 period one may note the relatively high differences between projections obtained from different climatic models these are noted for all catchments but are slightly lower for lowland suprasl in poland and irondequoit creek in ny usa than for mountainous rivers in the case of the biala tarnowska catchment in extreme cases the projections of mean monthly air temperature warming for the 2071 2100 period see suppl fig 5 a middle picture in the right column may range for february from 8 c from ipsl model to 1 5 c from noresm model for the 2071 2100 period in the cedar river catchment the mean monthly air temperature is projected by uqam and mpi models to increase in march by over 3 c but by the noresm model to marginally decrease see suppl fig 7 middle picture of left column the seasonal variability of warming is fuzzy and catchment dependent in polish two catchments the largest increase in air temperatures is projected for winter and late autumn but such a trend is not confirmed by all climatic models e g noresm does not show that in three us catchments summertime warming looks to be the highest but again this trend highly depends on the catchment and climatic model although the increase in air temperatures is generally projected for all catchments and both analyzed periods nonetheless some climatic models point at possible cooling during various months in the 2021 2050 period in the case of projections for march during the 2021 2050 period on us catchments even the averaged over all climatic models change in air temperature may be negative although for polish catchments some climatic models may also suggest cooling for specific months during the 2021 2050 period the projections averaged over all climatic models show warming of air temperatures for each month the projections show large variability between different seasons but the overall warming during the 2071 2100 period is projected to be more than twice higher than the warming during the 2021 2050 period both in polish and us catchments 4 3 2 projections of discharge the projections of discharge for periods 2021 2050 and 2071 2100 see suppl figs 10 14 are highly uncertain and depending on the climatic model frequently contradictory on average the mean discharge in both polish rivers see suppl figs 10 11 is projected to decrease but more severely on the lowland suprasl than on the mountainous biala tarnowska extreme discharges however may be higher on the biala tarnowska but not on the suprasl in the case of us catchments rather increase in discharge is projected but very uneven through the year summers which are especially important for biological activity in rivers is projected to see little difference on all three considered us catchments see suppl figs 12 14 considering the high uncertainty of the projections and the weak trends observed the impact of the change in discharge on the thermal conditions of rivers is hard to estimate 4 3 3 stream temperature projections in this section we discuss the projected changes in stream water temperatures obtained by four different stream temperature models projections from the same climatic models and the same rainfall runoff model were used for each considered stream temperature model such that the differences may solely be attributed to the latter ones the change in stream temperatures is here understood as the difference between the projected monthly mean maximum or minimum of daily averaged stream temperatures for future climatic conditions and the simulated by the same models monthly mean maximum or minimum of daily averaged stream temperatures for the historical period we consider two future periods the near future 2021 2050 and the far future 2071 2100 for each river the projected changes in stream temperatures are given graphically in figs 4 8 according to the majority of stream temperature models the warming of waters up to 2021 2050 period is expected to be within 1 c for almost every stream and month hence is to be lower than the rise in the air temperatures in two us catchments cases the cedar river and irondequoit creek decreases in the mean monthly stream temperature are projected for the spring season see figs 6 and 8 this is in accordance with projected by various climatic models cooling of the air temperatures in march and april on these two catchments and may be consistent with already observed winter or spring cooling of some rivers in the usa kaushal et al 2010 arismendi et al 2012 isaak et al 2018 or central europe arora et al 2016 kedra 2020 graf and wrzesinski 2020 michel et al 2020 despite that in the vast majority of months warming dominates in each catchment in the northern usa the largest warming is expected in the summer and early winter months see figs 6 8 and there is a good agreement between projected changes in the monthly mean minimum and maximum daily averaged values of water temperatures among the models punn and air2stream projects slightly warmer water in the summertime than mlp and nlogr3 but the differences for mean monthly stream temperatures are relatively low in poland the warming of both catchments for the 2021 2050 period is projected to be slightly higher in spring april and may and autumn september october and november than during the winter or summer months see figs 4 5 the largest warmings of stream temperatures are projected to occur one or two months later than the largest warmings in air temperatures although all the models project relatively similar changes in the monthly mean stream temperatures the projections of the hottest and coolest days during a month do vary see upper and lower pictures in the left side column of figs 4 and 5 until the 2071 2100 period the warming of stream waters is expected to be much larger ranging from 1 c to 3 c for the mean monthly temperatures depending on the river and month it may hence be again as for the 2021 2050 period very roughly assessed to be 50 lower than the rise of air temperatures in poland the rise in monthly mean water temperatures is expected to reach 2 3 5 c during spring and autumn but stay below 2 c during summer and winter months as the largest increase in air temperatures is projected for the winter months in poland this suggests that the warming of waters would be the largest when the effect of warmer winter combine with the higher declination of the sun in early spring in autumn the hotter air is projected to keep water temperatures warm longer than in the historical period warming of waters is projected to be slightly larger in the mountainous biala tarnowska than in the lowland suprasl river in the usa for 2071 2100 period the summer warming is projected to reach or even exceed 3 c but during spring the streams are expected to warm up by less than 2 c in the cedar river during winter months the increase in water temperature is projected to barely exceed 1 c contrary to the case of polish rivers this fully agrees in timing with the projected warming of air temperatures which are also expected in the summer period trends projected for the monthly maximum and minimum daily averaged water temperatures are roughly similar to those obtained for the mean monthly temperatures in the three non mountainous rivers a slightly larger increase in the minimum than in the maximum mean daily temperatures for a particular month is projected but the opposite is generally expected for the biala tarnowska and the cedar river the above discussion reflects the results obtained from the majority of used stream temperature models however when one pays attention to projections made by particular stream temperature models a more divergent picture appears for some months and rivers the projections from one among three models air2stream punn or nlogr3 highly differ from those obtained from other models only mlp seems to be always in agreement with the main pack of models among the three models that do diverge the nlogr3 model projects that the monthly mean stream temperature would rise for 2071 2100 period by over 4 c in irondequoit creek when other models project the rise to be lower than 3 c for the 2021 2050 period on the same stream the nlogr3 projects almost 2 c warming when air2stream projects the rise in water temperatures to stay below 0 5 c on the contrary for the 2071 2100 period the nlogr3 projects by far the lowest warming of the fanno creek waters in august and september and air2stream projects for the majority of months the highest warming for that river for many different months during the 2071 2100 period the air2stream model projects 0 5 1 c higher warming of the biala tarnowska waters than the other models do punn often projects the lowest warming for this river and for the 2021 2050 period even suggest cooling in extremes see upper and lower picture on the left column in fig 4 for the 2071 2100 period punn projects that the rise in summertime monthly mean stream water temperatures on the cedar river would reach 5 c when other models project warming not greater than 3 c interestingly for almost all months apart june september period the warming projected by punn is the lowest in some cases the second lowest among other models when applying anova to see which kind of models climatic or water temperature have a larger impact on the projections of stream temperatures we find very different results to those noted for the historical data see table 5 for the 2021 2050 period the variance related to climatic models is larger in four catchments biala tarnowska supral irondeuoit creek and contrary to the results that were obtaned for the historical period fano creek however the differences are lower than those observed for the historical period for the 2071 2100 period stream temperature models contribute to the higher variability in the case of cedar river and fanno creek for the other three catchments the variability of climatic models remains more important but the relative contribution from stream temperature models increase to 22 38 from 1 to 8 that was noted for historical periods as a result for the 2071 2100 period the averaged over all five catchments impact of climatic models and stream temperature models on the variability of stream tmeperature is roughly similar it confirms the importance of using not only different climatic models but also various stream temperature models in studies aimed at projections of future thermal conditions of rivers 5 discussion the existence of various aquatic biota depends on the thermal conditions of rivers due to global warming the stream temperatures are expected to increase but not uniformly through the year and not at the same rate in each catchment according to our study performed on five selected catchments from temperate climatic conditions of northern usa states of oregon washington and new york and poland that is based on the rcp 8 5 emission scenario for the 2021 2050 period even water cooling may occur in some months on particular sites although unexpected cooling of stream temperatures is not impossible and over the recent decades has already been observed for some catchments in the usa and middle europe kaushal et al 2010 arora et al 2016 isaak et al 2018 graf and wrzesinski 2020 michel et al 2020 part but not all of these cooling trends may be explained by the location of dams above the measurement site e g kaushal et al 2010 arora et al 2018 isaak et al 2018 or the specific regional patterns arismendi et al 2012 the role of reservoirs may continue to be highly influential in the near future however would rather not be sufficient to prevent stream warming in the far future the projections of stream temperatures do depend on the stream temperature model used but on the other hand the differences in the rise of water temperatures obtained from different stream temperature models are lower than the differences in the rise of air temperatures projected by different climatic models hence should we insist on using more than one stream temperature model considering that 1 the climatic models are far more complex and 2 all stream temperature models use the same projections from climatic models the differences in stream temperature projections are relatively large moreover the noted differences in the monthly mean temperatures may occasionally reach e g see fig 4 august the biala tarnowska river the period 2071 2100 or even exceed 2 c e g see fig 7 september the fanno creek the period 2071 2100 or fig 6 august the cedar river the period 2071 2100 such big differences in water temperatures during summer months would be crucial for the fate of various biota living in these aquatic systems this is another warning that using a single stream temperature model may easily hide part of the uncertainty associated with the future thermal regimes of rivers and result in simplified conclusions if the differences between models are skipped under the rcp 8 5 scenario our study finds that on average the warming of stream temperatures is expected to reach annually about 1 c for 2021 2050 and 1 3 c for 2071 2100 periods the projected rise in stream temperatures until the end of xxi century is consistent with a multimodel study by bustillo et al 2014 who expected 2 2 3 5 c warming for the loire river france with mantua et al 2010 who expected warming of streams in washington state by 1 5 c with ficklin et al 2014 who projected on average above 3 c warming for the upper and middle part of the columbia river basin the northwestern usa and southwestern canada with du et al 2019 study on the athabasca river western canada who expected 1 6 3 1 c warming and with dugdale et al 2018 who projected about 2 c warming on the lower saint john river eastern canada our result is also consistent with buccola et al 2016 who expected 2 c warming in the north santiam river in northwestern oregon by 2060 s however contrary to bustillo et al 2014 findings we expect more diversified warming during particular seasons du et al 2019 and ficklin et al 2014 also projected high seasonal variations of stream temperature warming with the highest warming during summertime which is consistent with our results for us rivers but not for polish ones we may also note that although the summertime warming of north western us catchments by 5 c projected by punn is much higher than the warming obtained from three other models used in our study it is consistent with recent lee et al 2020 paper lee et al 2020 used a physically based model and projected that the increase of the annual maximum of stream water temperatures in some catchments from the north western usa may well exceed 4 c in summer until the 2080 s in the extreme case reaching 8 c with the same rcp 8 5 scenario as used in this study mantua et al 2010 also projected stream temperature increase up to 5 c for some streams in the washington state hence some of the extreme projections obtained in our study from one among four models may turn out to be consistent with other modelling tools it is another story to what extent they would be consistent with reality 6 conclusions according to the present research which assumes the rcp 8 5 emission scenario the warming of mean monthly stream waters of five studied catchments located in temperate conditions with high seasonality is on the average expected to reach about 1 c for the 2021 2050 period and 1 3 c for the 2071 2100 period for various catchments these numbers would highly depend on the specific month and the stream temperature model used for specific months on some rivers even a marginal cooling is projected for the 2021 2050 period overall the rise in the water temperatures is expected to be up to 50 lower than the rise in the air temperatures the impact of the stream temperature model used on the projections of water temperatures in rivers is generally a bit lower than the impact of the climatic model however this finding is highly catchment dependent on some catchments the opposite relation is noted nonetheless in specific cases we have found that for the same climatic and hydrological projections that feed stream temperature models the differences in the projected water temperatures only due to the choice of water temperature model may exceed 2 c with huge consequences for aquatic biota considering that often several climatic models are used in studies aimed at climatic change and its impact on biodiversity or human activity in the catchments we strongly suggest using different stream temperature models as well remaining with the results produced by only a single stream temperature model flattens our understanding of possible future and may also offer peculiar projections that could lead to doubtful conclusions author contribution ap

4291,in the majority of studies aiming at stream temperature warming due to climate change just a single water temperature model is used choosing a single model may highly impact the conclusions from the study in this paper four relatively different empirical or semi empirical models perceptron neural networks product unit networks extended logistic regression and air2stream were applied to project the impact of climate change on water temperature in rivers located in temperate climatic zones of the usa and poland the models were driven by daily air temperature and streamflow projected by the rainfall runoff model in the first step the models were calibrated and validated then the projections of water temperature were derived for the historical periods and two future periods taking into account a climate simulations from the cordex initiative na cordex and euro cordex b the gr4j rainfall runoff model and c different water temperature models the obtained results indicate that due to global warming the stream temperatures are expected to increase by about 1 2 c for 2021 2050 and by 2 3 c for 2071 2100 periods these changes are not uniformly distributed throughout the year the largest warming in the usa is found in the summertime in poland in spring and autumn for some months the discrepancies in the projected stream temperature between various stream temperature models are large product unit neural network logistic regression based model or air2stream occasionally led to projections that differ from those obtained by the majority of models even by 2 c we strongly recommend using at least a few stream temperature models for analysing the impact of climate change on water temperatures or the fate of the aquatic ecosystem keywords stream water temperatures climatic change hydrological models neural networks air2stream hydrological projections 1 introduction there is a clear impact of climate change on the thermal regime of streams van vliet et al 2013 ouellet et al 2020 the increase in stream temperatures has already been observed in many countries including austria webb and nobilis 1994 china chen et al 2016 germany arora et al 2016 poland kedra and wiejaczka 2018 graf and wrzesinski 2020 spain soto 2016 uk orr et al 2015 switzerland michel et al 2020 or usa kaushal et al 2010 seekell and pace 2011 isaak et al 2018 however at least for winter spring seasons cooling of streams or rivers has also been noted at some monitoring stations in various parts of the usa kaushal et al 2010 arismendi et al 2012 isaak et al 2018 england and wales orr et al 2015 germany arora et al 2016 switzerland michel et al 2020 poland kedra 2020 graf and wrzesinski 2020 or south korea chang 2008 the observed general warming but also local cooling of water temperatures is also confirmed by some modelling approaches wanders et al 2019 presented a global water temperature model to study trends in stream temperatures over the 1960 2014 period and found that although clear warming predominates cooling has occurred in notable parts of the tropical rivers in some rivers along the border between western canada and the usa and rivers in the southern part of central asia the response of stream temperatures to climate change forcing affects the ecology of aquatic systems jonsson and jonsson 2009 pankhrust and munday 2011 eliason et al 2011 piccolroaz et al 2018a catalan et al 2019 weiskopf et al 2020 many studies aim at linking the future change of climatic conditions with water temperatures in streams and its impact on the fate of various aquatic biotas such as brown trout almodovar et al 2012 cianfrani et al 2015 salmonidaes null et al 2013 striped bass and atlantic salmon dugdale et al 2018 brook charr carlson et al 2019 or zacco platypus morid et al 2020 as well as on the general productivity of aquatic systems song et al 2018 du et al 2019 to make projections of the future water temperature in rivers one needs to apply a chain with three kinds of models the first type of models is used for simulation of the present and the future climatic conditions for the assumed emission scenarios the second type of models is applied for the simulation of river discharge the third type is used for assessing the relationship between the climatic and hydrological conditions and the thermal regimes of rivers at each step the choice of the model may affect the information projections provided for the next stage of the modelling chain which results in the cascade of uncertainty mitchell and hulme 1999 foley 2010 also the choice of the models or their parameterization may highly affect the projected impact of the climatic change on local water resources vaghefi et al 2019 in this paper we are interested in how the choice of stream temperature model affects the river water temperature projections providing that the same climatic and hydrological models are used the chain of modelling starts from the climate models these are considered here as an external source of input information that fed hydrological models the projections from different global and regional circulation models for different greenhouse gases emission scenarios moss et al 2010 are available from various initiatives giorgi et al 2009 kotlarski et al 2014 eyring et al 2019 in the present study we use cordex projections kotlarski et al 2014 as the stream water temperature is related to discharge rainfall runoff models are used to evaluate discharge based on the projections from climate circulation models e g bustillo et al 2014 ficklin et al 2014 du et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 in this study we use a single conceptual rainfall runoff model gr4j perrin et al 2003 that has already been widely used in climate change studies tian et al 2013 brigode et al 2013 cornelissen et al 2013 meresa et al 2017 stephens et al 2018 seo et al 2019 nguyen et al 2020 gao et al 2020 generally in the literature different types of models are used to describe relations between meteorological variables hydrological conditions and stream temperatures the first are physically based models et al 2012 du et al 2019 van vliet et al 2013 null et al 2013 gallice et al 2016 trimmel et al 2018 lee et al 2020 such models are sometimes integrated into more general water quality models dugdale et al 2017 da silva burigato costa et al 2019 another type of models widely used to relate discharge and meteorological conditions with stream temperature are so called data driven models such as linear regression carlson et al 2019 logistic regression mantua et al 2010 van vliet et al 2011 almodovar et al 2012 buccola et al 2016 soto 2018 or neural networks ann jeong et al 2013 stewart et al 2015 liu et al 2018a mitro et al 2019 recently a very promising class of methods that bridge the gap between the physical and empirical models have been proposed by means of physics based modelling within machine often deep learning willard et al 2020 such models were already applied to a lake read et al 2019 or stream jia et al 2020 temperature simulations and may potentially be an important tool for projecting the thermal regimes of rivers in future climatic conditions but such studies are so far lacking finally one may also find physically based models in which physical processes have been highly parameterized an example of such a model is air2stream toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 which has been recently widely used for modelling the impact of climatic change on stream temperatures both in historical cai et al 2018 piccolroaz et al 2016 islam et al 2019 and future periods råman vinnå et al 2018 many papers aimed at comparing of performance between different stream temperature models on historical data morrill et al 2005 hadzima nyarko et al 2014 piotrowski et al 2015 piccolroaz et al 2016 kwak et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 graf et al 2019 sakaa et al 2020 qiu et al 2020b often coming with the conclusion that some models are not worse than the others there is no consensus on the superiority of any kind of models over the others however although there are notable exceptions bustillo et al 2014 lee et al 2020 in a large number of studies addressing the future thermal conditions of rivers just a single stream temperature model is used mantua et al 2010 ficklin et al 2013 2014 cianfrani et al 2015 buccola et al 2016 dugdale et al 2018 mitro et al 2019 du et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 morid et al 2020 this may affect the conclusions of individual studies as 1 often the performance of the selected model is not validated against the others on the historical period and 2 even if the comparison is presented it does not mean that the quality of projections from different stream temperature models for future climatic conditions would be consistent with their past performance the above concerns may be raised for both physical and empirical simple and complex models for example the applicability of simple empirical models for stream temperature projections although frequent has already been criticized leach and moore 2019 found that linear regression models yield milder warming of water temperature than physically based models for future climatic conditions on the contrary lee et al 2020 found little difference in stream temperature projections between the physically based approach sun et al 2015 and the empirical model isaak et al 2017 arismendi et al 2014 showed that logistic regression models that use solely air temperature as an input variable which were proposed by mohseni et al 1998 are unable to capture complex relations between thermal conditions of the air ground and water body some doubts on such approaches have earlier been cast by morrill et al 2005 webb et al 2008 and null et al 2013 nonetheless numerous studies aiming at stream temperature projections in future climatic conditions use either linear almodovar et al 2012 cianfrani et al 2015 carlson et al 2019 or logistic regression models mantua et al 2010 van vliet et al 2011 almodovar et al 2012 buccola et al 2016 soto 2018 and the chosen approach is often a sole model for stream temperature applied in the particular study contrary to linear or logistic regression models neural networks are complex nonlinear modelling tools that may use any kind of numerical input variables however similarly to regression models they capture relations between variables based solely on empirical data without any insight into the physical process apart from the very recently proposed process guided networks read et al 2019 willard et al 2020 which as discussed earlier are a mixed class of models it hence remains unclear to what extent the criticism expressed in arismendi et al 2014 or leach and moore 2019 also points at neural networks it is unknown if some models and which ones properly capture important underlying relations between meteorological variables and stream temperature based on the limited information that may be projected for future climatic conditions from global and regional climate circulation models using at least a few different stream temperature models for future climatic conditions to test the consistency of the results would provide us with some information on the uncertainty associated with the model choice this cannot give us certainty about the future even if a few models show noticeable agreement all could simply lack important information or misunderstood the behaviour of the system however if divergent projections are obtained from a few models that seemed to perform similarly for historical data this may warn us about the reliability of the results one of the main limitations of the applicability of models for future climatic conditions is that various variables related to important processes that occur in a system cannot be easily taken into account information on major variables affecting thermal conditions of rivers like air temperatures discharge e g van vliet et al 2011 or declination of the sun e g piotrowski et al 2020a which may be considered as the simplest substitute for solar radiation may be used as they are either available from observations air temperature or through rainfall runoff modelling discharge from the modelling chain or are easily computable astronomical features declination of the sun however the water temperature of streams is affected by a large number of natural and anthropogenic factors poole and bermann 2001 caissie 2006 hester and doyle 2011 which generally cannot be projected or evaluated in many catchments stream temperature is highly affected by the groundwater temperature poole and bermann 2001 qiu et al 2019 johnson et al 2020 but this link highly depends on the local geological conditions o sullivan et al 2020 where this relationship is high the climate change induced warming of air temperature would have a limited effect on the stream temperature another important factor either natural or human induced is the shading of the riverbed by forests and plants it is of major importance for cooling stream waters chen et al 1998 sun et al 2015 trimmel et al 2018 wondzell et al 2019 qiu et al 2020a but its influence depends on the river size the smaller size of the stream the larger impact of riparian shading geographical location and season higher impact in summer than in winter season the change in shading may be both due to the natural processes or human impact the human impact may be reversible but many years are needed for the ecosystem to recover by natural processes from human logging caissie 2006 even if the particular area is highly modified by human activities managed aquifer recharge actions may be undertaken van kirk et al 2020 and leaving or re introducing the sparse vegetation in purposely chosen locations along the river may to an important degree mitigate the thermal stress garner et al 2017 which human activities will be performed along the stream banks and how they would affect stream shading in the future is however very hard to predict latella et al 2020 another human induced hardly predictable factor affecting stream thermal regime may be the loss of upland vegetation hester and doyle 2011 however its impact is more complicated and catchment dependent than in the case of riparian shading poole and bermann 2001 in general the catchment wide land use change often but not always increases the thermal stress macedo et al 2013 ebersole et al 2020 and its predictions for the future periods are also highly uncertain prestele et al 2016 the change in land use that causes the highest thermal pressure on the stream by various processes is the urbanization of the catchment nelson and palmer 2007 nelson et al 2009 katebchy et al 2019 urbanization implies the reduction in shading increase of ground temperatures emission of heat from artificial sources liu et al 2020 and decrease in discharge note that the impact of the large cities on water regimes may not be limited to the city area only for example as the water quality in cities decrease delpla et al 2009 drinking water may be supplied from sources located far away from the city as such potential sources of water are frequently located upstream their use may lead to the reduction of the river flow in the main channel or tributaries and hence to lower water levels and higher thermal stress null et al 2017 essaid and caldwell 2017 again water use and management in the future is very uncertain wada et al 2016 and depends on many political and economical actions as well as human customs that cannot be anticipated for decades to come another human induced factors that affects the thermal regime of rivers are artificial reservoirs poole and bermann 2001 cai et al 2018 daniels and danner 2020 wang et al 2020 on the contrary to the majority of other human based actions reservoirs are primarily responsible for cooling the river by spilling thermally stratified water cheng et al 2020 however large dams have a more complex impact on the relations between discharge air and stream temperatures liu et al 2018b and the fate of existing and possibility of constructing new dams during the next half a century is hard to predict as may be seen from this brief discussion the overall impact of human activities on the thermal conditions of rivers is complex but generally leads to warming the flowing waters this has been highlighted by culler et al 2018 who confirmed in a field experiment that the thermal conditions of streams flowing in inhabited not necessarily urbanized catchments would differ from those observed in uninhabited catchments human induced factors that affect the thermal stress of rivers are often politically or economically motivated and are strengthen or mitigated by human customs in particular decades and regions of the world hence they cannot be easily implemented into the modelling for future climatic conditions nonetheless we have to bear in mind that the change in human activities in the particular catchment may highly affect the thermal conditions of flowing waters and that any kind of models that are to be used would always be based on a piece of very simplified information about the system under study linking meteorological variables and discharge with stream temperature for future climatic conditions is the main topic of the present study we apply four different empirical and physically based semi empirical stream temperature models for projecting the stream temperatures in five catchments located in the temperate climatic zones in the northwestern usa midwestern usa and poland the main goal is to compare projections obtained by different models and analyze the difference in the results obtained the four models applied include multi layer perceptron neural networks haykin 1999 product unit neural network durbin and rumelhart 1989 multiple logistic regression based nlogr3 model piotrowski and napiorkowski 2019 and air2stream toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 these four models are relatively different but they all are non linear have an empirical form even though air2stream is physically based and require calibration of various parameters 2 study area in this study we consider five catchments three from the northern part of the usa cedar river wa fanno creek or and irondequoit creek ny and two from poland biala tarnowska river and suprasl river all five catchments are located between 43 n and 54 n two catchments cedar river wa and biala tarnowska river are mountainous two others irondequoit creek ny and suprasl are relatively flat the fanno creek catchment or is hilly on each considered catchment during wintertime snowy conditions may occur however with much different frequency snow is rare in the fanno creek or the lower parts of the cedar river but frequent in three other catchments and the upper parts of the cedar river short information on each catchment and historical daily data used for calibration and testing of stream temperature models as well as the rainfall runoff model is given in table 1 more technical details may be found in piotrowski et al 2020a additional information on data sources including appropriate links is given in the supplementary material the catchments under study cannot be considered natural they are affected by various kinds of human activities the fanno creek or is a suburban catchment susceptible to heat sources generated by the local population and the city of portland or to a lesser degree this also applies to the irondequoit creek ny which the lower part lies in the suburban area of rochester ny the cedar river wa also flows through the highly inhabited areas in the lower parts and its upper part is the main source of water for seattle wa conurbation as a result the upper part is a protected area with little human traffic which makes it more resembling of the natural catchment culler et al 2018 but its water budget is highly affected by human demands two polish rivers under study are less influenced by human activities and are located further from larger towns but there are some reservoirs on the biala tarnowska river and agricultural activities prevail in the suprasl catchment data sources for the cedar river fanno creek and irondequoit creek are us geological survey usgs and national centers for environmental information national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the historical daily data t denotes time in days used in this study for different stream temperature models include air temperature t t a precipitation p t discharge q t and stream temperature t t s in addition we also calculate the declination of the sun for every day of the year d s t and the differences in the declination of the sun from the two recent days these are easily computable for both historical and future periods and are used as input variables for stream water temperature modelling as a substitute for solar radiation as discussed in piotrowski et al 2020a as explicitly shown in column 2 of table 1 the historical data used for calibration of the rainfall runoff gr4j model often differs from the historical data used for the calibration of stream temperature models the performance of stream temperature models and rainfall runoff model is also tested on different periods called in this paper as testing data set which is a classical nomenclature in neural networks case as given in column 3 of table 1 this is because for particular catchment often the number of available data for stream temperature modelling differed from the number of available data for rainfall runoff modelling in catchements where meteorological data were available from more than a single station the thiessen polygons method was used to provide a lumped data for stream temperature and rainfall runoff models thiessen and alter 1911 in the case of suprasl river the air temperature was available from bialystok station only but precipitation data were available from five stations located within the catchment in the case of the cedar river wa for stream temperature models air temperature data were collected solely from the seattle int l airport however for computing potential evapotranspiration for rainfall runoff modelling data were collected from all three meteorological stations this is because the air temperatures in mountainous locations impact the evapotranspiration there but mildly affect the water temperature in renton wa where stream temperature is measured however note that even if such differences in handling historical data may affect projected values to some extent the impact would be identical for any stream temperature model hence it is of negligible importance for comparison between projections performed by different stream temperature models the number of historical daily data available for each catchment do vary see table 1 but is not shorter than nine years for each catchment the historical data are chronologically divided into the set used for calibration and the set used for independent testing of optimized models 3 3 methods 3 1 climate simulations in this study four climate models for the usa and five for poland were obtained from the cordex initiative giorgi et al 2009 kotlarski et al 2014 as a source of climate projections the vision of the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex is to advance and coordinate the science and application of regional climate downscaling through global partnerships using an ensemble of models is the best way to reduce the impact of natural variability and particular model features on the results pierce et al 2009 we have chosen global circulation models that provide 365 daily climatic simulations per year those that provide fewer were skipped simulations from different global climate models were selected first as they are the main source of variability osuch et al 2018 for each global circulation model a single regional climate model has been chosen as the latter only refine large scale information provided by the former giorgi 2019 the selected combinations of global regional climate models are cnrm cm5 ouranos crcm5 cnrm mpi esm lr ouranos crcm5v1 mpi noresm1 m gerics remo2015 noresm and uqam gematm esmsea uqam crcm5 uqam for the usa and cnrm cm5 rca4 cnrm ec earth racmo22e ec earth ipsl cm5a mr wrf331f ipsl mpi esm lr cclm4 8 17 mpi and noresm1 m dmi hirham5v2 noresm for poland in brackets we give abbreviations of each selected combination which will be used throughout the paper as we always distinct discussion for polish and us catchments we may keep similar names for both europe and north america the spatial resolution of climate simulations euro cordex for the european domain is 0 11 which corresponds to 12 5 km while for the north american domain na cordex is 0 22 25 km the projected values from each climatic model are used for both rainfall runoff modelling and stream temperature modelling we do not use any data correction procedure for climatic projections as although they can highly improve climate simulations for the historical periods it is highly disputable if such corrections are appropriate for the future climatic conditions ehret et al 2012 maraun 2016 maraun et al 2017 chen et al 2019 in this study we analysed climate simulations for the rcp 8 5 emission scenario for the usa and polish catchments the analyses were carried out for three periods historical period and two future climatic periods the close future 2021 2050 and the far future 2071 2100 3 2 rainfall runoff model the river runoff is an important variable for stream temperature modelling to obtain information on runoff for future climatic conditions we used a lumped conceptual gr4j model perrin et al 2003 to manage snow accumulation and melting the gr4j scheme was implemented with an additional snow module see piotrowski et al 2017 that extends the number of parameters that are to be calibrated to seven for each catchment the gr4j model has been calibrated with genetic learning particle swarm optimization glpso algorithm gong et al 2016 which is a kind of hybrid method linking genetic algorithms holland 1975 with particle swarm optimization pso eberhart and kennedy 1995 the performance of the model has been verified on the independent historical data testing set the one year long model warm up was implemented both during calibration on historical data and during application to future climatic conditions on each catchment the calibration procedure consisted of 30 runs of the glpso algorithm see details in piotrowski et al 2019 in each run up to 30 000 function calls was allowed and population size was set to 50 which is a trade off between a classical setting of 20 40 particles eberhart and kennedy 1995 and recent findings from wide scale studies across versatile kinds of problems that for the majority of applications and pso variants the swarm size should be larger piotrowski et al 2020b only the catchment wise best set of obtained parameters according to the testing data is used for future climatic conditions as an objective function the mean square error mse was selected 1 mse 1 n t 1 n q t sm q t s 2 where n is the number of training validation or testing samples in the particular data set q t sm is the modelled and q t s is the observed value of runoff for historical data for the simulations of future hydrological conditions the calibrated gr4j model was applied with input data air temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration from an ensemble of climate simulations as a result for every climate simulation a projection of flows is obtained to feed stream temperature models the potential evapotranspiration is computed according to the classical hamon 1961 method 3 3 stream temperature models in this study to simulate water temperature in five selected catchments four different stream temperature models are used multi layer perceptron neural networks mlp product unit neural networks punn logistic regression approach nlogr3 and physically based model air2stream to compare the performance of stream temperature models on historical data apart from the mse with measured and modelled stream temperatures instead of q three other performance criteria are used the first one is the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 that allows simple inter comparison of performance between different catchments 2 nsc 1 t 1 n t t s t t sm 2 t 1 n t s t t sm 2 where t s is a mean stream hence s temperature during the particular period t t s is a stream temperature measured for day t t t sm is a stream temperature modelled hence sm for day t and n is the number of days in the particular period two further criteria take into account the sample size and the number of parameters but differently we use a version of the akaike information criterion akaike 1973 developed for the least squares approach which is defined as burnham and anderson 2002 3 aic n ln mse 2 k where n is the number of data days in either calibration or validation set k is the number of model parameters 1 and mse is the mean square error obtained for a particular dataset and river by the model the last criterion is a variant of the bayesian information criterion schwartz 1978 for cases when model errors may be assumed to be gaussian priestley 1981 4 bic n ln mse k ln n we remind the readers that slightly different definitions of this criterion exist see faraway and chatfield 1998 in the case of mse aic and bic the lower values of the criterion the better model in the case of nsc the higher value the better model and 1 means a perfect fit to verify the relative contributions of climatic models and water temperature models to the total variability in estimates for the stream temperatures through the year anova yip et al 2011 is applied in a similar way as in osuch et al 2017 3 3 1 multi layer perceptron neural networks to simulate future conditions we use the mlp versions with a deep learning based goodfellow et al 2016 variant of dropout hinton et al 2012 srivastava et al 2014 that was developed in piotrowski et al 2020a for historical stream temperature simulations mlp are composed of three layers as justified by hornik et al 1989 with linear activation functions used by nodes in input and output layers and logistic activation function used by nodes in the hidden layer nodes are the neural network s processing units organized in layers each node transforms the information received from nodes in the preceding layer and passes it further to the nodes located in the subsequent layer nodes located in the same layer do not contact directly with each other haykin 1999 following piotrowski et al 2020a in this study a vector of mlp input nodes xt includes air temperature t t i 1 a from some preceding days i 1 lag discharge from the recent day q t declination of the sun d s t and the difference in declinations of the sun in two recent days the mlp output is composed of a single node stream temperature for the particular day t t sm all input variables are linearly scaled to an 0 1 interval by setting x k t x k t x mink x maxk x mink where xmaxk and xmink are the maximum and the minimum values in the whole data set of k th input variable respectively to prevent overfitting two methods are jointly used in mlp the classical early stopping prechlet 1998 and dropout srivastava et al 2014 early stopping is a classical way to avoid overfitting in shallow neural networks in other words to prevent the network from fitting its output trajectory during training not only to the temperature trajectory but also to a noise presented in the training sample which is harmful for the application on unseen data the early stopping approach tells when to stop training and which solution to choose as the best one dropout introduced by hinton et al 2012 for deep learning models is a very special kind of regularization method when using dropout during training in each iteration with pre defined probability some nodes or connections between nodes in the case of dropconnect variant wan et al 2013 are randomly skipped resulting in processing with a simplified network as in each iteration different nodes or connections may be skipped the whole network is being trained overall but not by the same steps during such training to achieve improvement in a particular iteration the burden of processing information must be relatively evenly distributed between nodes otherwise when especially important nodes are being skipped the error sores the applicability of dropout also to shallow networks was discussed by baldi and sadowski 2014 in piotrowski et al 2020a we have shown how to use dropout together with early stopping for shallow mlp networks applied for stream temperature simulations in the present paper mlp networks were trained by the levenberg marquardt algorithm levenberg 1944 hagan and menhaj 1994 that uses up to 400 iterations with mean square error mse as an objective function levenberg marquardt is a kind of gradient based local search optimization method that speeds up the steepest descent employing approximation of the matrix of the second order derivatives comprehensive details on this algorithm may be found in yu and wilamowski 2011 for mlp training on a particular river the calibration data set was divided into two non overlapping subsets training set composed of chronologically the first 2 3 of measurements included in the calibration set and validation set composed of the remaining 1 3 of measurements prechlet 1998 all mlp architectures with up to 18 different lag values and up to 12 hidden nodes hn hence 18 12 216 versions were tested in piotrowski et al 2020a for each river in the present study for projections of stream temperatures in future climatic conditions we choose only the best architecture for the particular river the choice has been based on the results obtained for the validation data these architectures are defined in table 2 together with the value of mse for the independent testing period the mlp with dropconnect wan et al 2013 which is more efficient than classical dropout piotrowski et al 2020a compute the stream temperature as follows 5 t t s v 0 j 1 hn d 2 j i v j 1 exp w j 0 k 1 in d 1 kj t w kj x k t where v and w are matrixes of mlp parameters that are to be calibrated d1 in hn tr is a binary matrix used for dropping out some connections between input and hidden nodes and d2 hn tr is a binary matrix used for dropping out some connections between the hidden nodes and the single output by in and tr we mark the number of input nodes of the network and training samples size of the training set respectively the probability of generating 1 in each element of matrix d1 and d2 is set to 0 99 and matrixes are generated anew for each iteration finally the modelled output has to be re scaled as 6 t t sm t min s t t s t max s t min s after training all mlp parameters are multiplied by 0 99 the probability of retaining nodes used for dropconnect during training srivastava et al 2014 we run the levenberg marquardt algorithm 50 times for each river to collect a sample of optimized parameters however as the levenberg marquardt algorithm is a local search procedure it may occasionally stick in a very poor local optimum to avoid such poor sets of parameters we select 30 best out of 50 calibrated parameters the results obtained for the testing data set are not used during this choice mlp model with such 30 sets of parameters are then used for each historical and future period hence we obtain 30 simulated stream temperature values for each considered case the performance criteria reported for mlp in table 2 are averaged over all 50 runs the number of parameters used by mlp for each river is given in table 3 3 3 2 product unit neural networks product unit neural networks punn durbin and rumelhart 1989 have rarely been implemented for stream temperature modelling but their very encouraging performance piotrowski et al 2015 justifies their application in this study for punn we use the same input variables and the same division of historical data set into the training validation and testing subsets as in the case of mlp we also use early stopping prechlet 1998 as mlp punn is trained with the levenberg marquardt algorithm levenberg 1944 hagan and menhaj 1994 with mse as the objective function punn consist of both summation and product nodes each input is raised to the power that is a parameter optimized during training as a result for negative inputs and non integer parameters a complex number may be obtained as for the future climatic conditions some extreme projections of air temperatures or discharges may be obtained from climatic or rainfall runoff models we scale the input variables into 0 5 0 9 interval to minimize the possibility of obtaining a negative input 7 x k t 0 5 0 4 x k t x mink x maxk x mink where xmaxk and xmink are the maximum and the minimum values in the whole data set of k th input variable if a complex number is to be found anyway the complex modulus of the output from the network is used as scaling is linear using a different range than in the case of mlp have no impact on the modelling performance there are a few variants of punn martinez estudillo et al 2006 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2012 but here we choose only the simplest one in piotrowski et al 2021 we have analyzed the impact of dropout on punn and found that contrary to the mlp networks dropconnect is not the right choice instead classical dropout srivastava et al 2014 applied solely to input variables leads to the best performance hence the punn variant chosen here with dropout implemented into input variables only looks as follows 8 t t s v 0 j 1 hn v j k 1 in x k t d k t w kj where a single binary matrix d in tr is used the probability of retaining nodes hence the probability that the particular value in the matrix d will be set to 1 is set to 0 99 after training w parameters are multiplied by 0 99 but v ones are not the output from punn is then re scaled 9 t t sm t min s t max s t min s t t s 0 5 0 4 to obtain the projection of stream temperature as in the case of mlp 18 12 216 variants of punn architectures with up to 18 lags most recent values of air temperature used as inputs and 12 hidden nodes were tested following the same criteria as in mlp the chosen punn architectures for each river are given in table 2 the values of mse for the testing set are averaged over all 50 repetitions the number of parameters used by punn for each river is given in table 3 for each punn architecture we have also chosen the best 30 parameter sets for this study 3 3 3 nlogr3 logistic regression approach that links stream temperature solely to air temperature proposed by mohseni et al 1998 is still among the most widely used stream temperature models thackeray et al 2016 meredith et al 2017 shrestha et al 2018 huang et al 2019 abdi et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 despite its below average performance on historical data zhu et al 2018 piotrowski et al 2020a and the lack of capabilities to accommodate changes in the climatic conditions arismendi et al 2014 this model was originally developed for weekly data but is nonetheless frequently used for daily data as well its drawbacks stem mainly from the lack of memory or any kind of information on the past temperatures and the lack of additional variables to address both issues the model proposed by mohseni et al 1998 has been modified several times koch and grunewald 2010 van vliet et al 2011 soto 2018 in the recent modification called nlogr3 piotrowski and napiorkowski 2019 information on air temperatures from the last 30 days as well as on discharge and the declination of the sun were included in the model the nlogr3 approach relates the stream temperature to these variables as follows 10 t i s a g 1 exp h k d s i l 1 exp m n d d s i j 0 lag b j 1 exp c j d j t i j a e j q i j where a g h k l m n b0 blag 1 c0 clag 1 d0 dlag 1 e0 elag 1 are model parameters 127 in our case j is a dummy variable attributed to lag d s i is the declination of the sun at day i and dd s i is the difference in the declination of the sun in the two recent consecutive days i and i 1 respectively following piotrowski and napiorkowski 2019 we have chosen the value of lag 30 for each catchment the parameters of nlogr3 model are calibrated with the levenberg marquardt algorithm levenberg 1944 hagan and menhaj 1994 the calibration procedure is repeated 30 times for each river to obtain 30 sets of nlogr3 model parameters 3 3 4 air2stream contrary to mlp punn and nlogr3 the air2stream model is an example of physically based semi empirical models the performance of the air2stream is competitive with other models on historical data piccolroaz et al 2016 air2stream describes the lumped heat budget exchange between an unknown volume of water in the river in its tributaries and the atmosphere in the following form 11 ρ c p v d t w dt a h ρ c p i q i t w i q t w where v is an unknown volume of water in the river reach a is the surface area of the reach tw is water temperature ρ is water density with specific heat capacity at constant pressure cp h is the net heat flux between air and water qi is the discharge from the i th water source either tributary or groundwater with water temperature twi q is the discharge downstream of the insertion of tributaries and t is time toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 have parameterized the model and obtained an air2stream version with 8 parameters a1 a8 as follows 12 d t w dt 1 θ a 4 a 1 a 2 t a a 3 t w θ a 5 a 6 cos 2 π t t y a 7 a 8 t w θ q q q t 2 t 1 1 t 1 t 2 q t d t where ta is the air temperature ty is a length of the year in the same units as t θ is the dimensionless streamflow and q is the mean discharge over the time series from t1 to t2 in this study the whole calibration set following toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 and piccolroaz 2016 eq 12 is solved with the crank nicolson method the modelled stream temperature values are restricted to 0 c 35 c interval although only daily data were available the time step used while solving eq 12 was chosen to be 0 1 days hence 2 4 h with a linear approximation of all variables to alleviate numerical problems for the future climatic conditions as with the other models fitness function eq 1 but with stream temperatures instead of discharges for historical data was computed at a daily scale hence to compute it every 10th step t was used in this paper as the initial condition water temperature measured on the first day of the observations is used and to limit the impact of the initial condition on the model performance a 365 day warm up period is set we have used the differential evolution variant based on covariance matrix learning and bimodal distribution cobide calibration algorithm wang et al 2014 with the same range of parameters as in piotrowski and napiorkowski 2018 the maximum number of function calls was set to 100 000 the air2stream was calibrated 30 times for each catchment to give a sample of its parameters 4 results 4 1 comparison of simulations with observations in this section the model simulations are compared with observations we first point at the differences between observations and simulations obtained from climatic models for the same historical period then discuss the performance of the rainfall runoff model and finally compare the simulations of stream temperature models that are either based on the observed data or simulations from climate models we avoid using specific approaches to manage raw data or climate projections diaz nieto and wilby 2005 minville et al 2008 piccolroaz et al 2018b however to what extent particular approach fits the data may depend not only on the model or the calibration method but also on similarity of meteorological and hydrological conditions in particular periods this is why data based models that require calibration of large number of parameters neural networks are used with specific approaches that aim at avoiding overfitting to the calibration sample see also prechlet 1998 baldi and sadowski 2014 piotrowski et al 2020a 4 1 1 climatic data the comparison of the observed mean monthly air temperature and the sum of precipitation for the historical period at selected meteorological stations from each catchment against the values simulated for that period by climate models used in this study is given in fig 1 observed and projected by the climatic models monthly minimum mean and maximum daily averaged temperatures are provided in suppl fig 1 to what extent the simulations from the climatic models fit the measurements depend on the station model and season of the year in the case of the fanno creek catchment or climatic models often underestimate the observed air temperature on the contrary in the rochester ny and the cedar river catchment wa the air temperature is highly overestimated during winter and often underestimated during summer months in the case of the cedar river the results obtained for a single meteorological station see seattle in fig 1 also differ to some extent from the catchment averaged picture see suppl fig 1 as both observations and projections differ highly for stations located on the seaside and in the high mountains in polish catchments the climatic models fit historical observations better but the majority of models project too cold winters especially the mean minimum monthly air temperatures in january and february are simulated well below observations see suppl fig 1 however these findings are model dependent as ec earth racmo22e constantly underestimate air temperature for polish catchments when ipsl cm5a wrf331f simulate too cold winters and too hot summers the precipitation amount is often highly exaggerated in the lowland us catchments and the mountainous part of poland a better fit is obtained for mountainous stations located in the north western usa and lowland stations of north eastern poland of the main concern is however rochester ny for which neither air temperature nor precipitation is correctly simulated by any among considered climatic models too warm winters and too cool summers are simulated and precipitation is highly exaggerated though the whole year apart of the mid summer where it is underestimated climatic models simulate relatively constant precipitation through the year in rochester ny which by no means fits the observations as a result of poor fitting for historical data the projections obtained for the irondequoit creek ny must be taken with extra care in further discussion 4 2 rainfall runoff modelling based on historical and simulated meteorological data the gr4j model is used to simulate discharge for historical periods defined in table 1 from both historical meteorological measurements and simulations obtained from climatic models for respective historical periods for each considered catchment we use a single gr4j model which parameters are optimized for the calibration period on historical data in suppl figs 2 3 we illustrate the averaged over the whole historical period including calibration and testing data the minimum mean and maximum daily discharge for each month our goal is to illustrate to what extend the gr4j rainfall runoff model can match averaged monthly observations when the meteorological data come either from observations see the left column in suppl figs 2 3 or simulations from the climate models see the right column in suppl figs 2 3 the values presented for simulated time series are averaged over all four in the case of the usa or five in the case of poland climatic models for completeness in suppl fig 4 we show the related plots with the catchment averaged monthly minimum mean and maximum values of daily discharge observed and simulated using the gr4j model for each climatic model in these supplementary figures a logarithmic scale is used to improve readability when meteorological observations are used as inputs to the gr4j model the simulated discharge fits observations relatively well in almost all catchments however for the suprasl river summer discharge is twice too high and winter discharge is underestimated for seasons in historical periods that were poorly fitted by climate simulations the discharges modelled using these climate simulations were not always appropriate see fig 1 climatic models simulate too wet spring and summer periods in the suprasl river catchment what leads to the exaggerated discharge simulations see suppl fig 4 in the case of irondequoit creek and the cedar river catchments due to the overestimated precipitation simulated from climatic models during the cold season see fig 1 the runoff was modelled much higher than observed see suppl fig 4 based on the simulated climatic conditions summer discharge is correctly modelled for the cedar river but highly underestimated for the irondequoit and fanno creeks see suppl fig 4 as streams with smaller discharges warm up quicker this may result in much higher modelled thermal stress than actually observed and is some warning for future projections 4 2 1 stream temperature modelling based on measured and simulated meteorological data four water temperature models are applied to simulate the water temperatures in five catchments for historical periods similarly to the procedure used for the rainfall runoff model each stream temperature model was launched with two types of inputs i observed air temperatures and discharge obtained from the gr4j model when gr4j was fed with observed precipitation and air temperatures and ii simulated air temperature and discharge simulated by gr4j model when gr4j was fed with air temperature and precipitation simulations from the same climatic models in figs 2 3 we show the averaged over the historical period both calibration and testing data minimum mean and maximum daily averaged stream temperatures for every month in the left column the modelled stream temperatures based on observations in the right column based on climate models simulations are given we noticed that for both polish rivers the differences between outcomes of different stream temperature models are relatively small and each model fits the observed stream temperature relatively well of the main concern is the 1 2 c underestimation of the mean maximum daily averaged temperatures for the summer months and an underestimation of the mean stream temperatures during springtime in the suprasl river that is observed for both simulated from climatic models and observed data us rivers are much more problematic especially when simulations from climatic models are used right column in fig 3 first we observe the large differences between stream temperature models physically based semi empirical air2stream underestimates the stream temperatures for the cedar river through the year when the model is fed with historical observations interestingly the air2stream model better fits reality when it is fed with air temperatures and discharges coming from climate models simulations the cedar river catchment is composed of two very different parts highly mountainous cool rainy and snowy east and mild snow free and relatively flat west where gauge station is located this may be the reason for the poor performance of physically based air2stream especially that on other catchments it correctly fit observations another approach used nlogr3 also notice some problems as it underestimates the water temperatures in the fanno creek for the late summer when it is fed with simulations from climatic models nlogr2 also underestimates the minimum daily temperatures in the cedar river even when it is fed with observation data mlp and punn models do not note such clear flaws however all models highly underestimate the stream temperature in the fanno creek during the whole year in the irondequoit creek during the summer month and overestimate water temperatures during winter in the irondequoit creek when fed by simulations obtained from climatic circulation models in the case of the cedar river mlp and punn perform well but still overestimate summer stream temperatures when meteorological simulations are used and underestimate it when fed with meteorological measurements based on the above findings one may note an uneven modelling quality of the four models for different rivers to show it more clearly in table 4 we present four model performance criteria obtained for testing data sets for each model fed with meteorological observations for each river mse and nsc are classical hydrological indicators of model performance that account for neither the number of parameters nor the sample size when the sample size is fixed for a particular river both criteria would always yield an equal ranking of models on the contrary aic and bic take into account the number of model s parameters and the sample size but differently see eqs 3 and 4 the ranking of models by means of mse aic and bic may hence be very different the noticeably poor performance of air2stream and nlogr3 on the cedar river is confirmed by mse nsc and aic criteria see table 4 bic which accounts more heavily for the very low number of air2stream parameters does not show that but air2stream remains inferior to punn for that river overall according to mse and nsc punn is the best model for each river apart from irondequoit creek for which it is outperformed only by mlp according to aic punn is the best model for three rivers apart from irondequoit creek and with a marginal difference cedar river for which it is ranked the second and mlp turns out the best according to bic air2stream is the best option for three rivers because it has the lowest number of parameters apart from cedar creek for which punn is the best method and fanno creek in which case air2stream is outperformed by both mlp and punn hence although on average punn seems to be overall the best method considering different rivers and comparison criteria one must note that using different criteria may lead to different conclusions on the ranking of models even for historical data finally we apply anova yip et al 2011 to see whether climatic or stream temperature models have a larger impact on the simulated performance of stream temperatures for historical periods we perform a similar procedure to osuch et al 2017 the relative contributions of climatic models and water temperature models to the total variability in estimates for the stream temperatures through the year are given in table 5 we may note that on three catchments both polish ones and irondequoit creek ny the variability related to the climatic model highly dominates in the case of these three catchements the contribution from the water temperature modes is smaller than 10 for the historical period for fanno creek and cedar river from the northwestern usa the fully opposite results are obtained and the variability related to stream temperature models is much larger 53 and 83 respectively than the variability related to the climatic models 37 and 16 respectively hence the relative contribution to the variability in estimates of stream temperatures highly depends on the catchment this makes the warning that using a single stream temperature model may lead to highly inadequate results for future climatic conditions 4 3 projections of stream temperatures in this section we discuss the projections of water temperatures in rivers in two future periods 2021 2050 and 2071 2100 under the rcp 8 5 emission scenario obtained from four different stream temperature models however first some attention needs to be focused on the projections of air temperatures section 4 2 1 and discharge section 4 2 2 which will be used as input information to stream temperature models this would allow us to note how the projected change in stream temperatures is related to changes in air temperatures and discuss the variability of water temperature projections made by different stream temperature models with relation to the variability of air temperature projections obtained from different climatic models following ehret et al 2012 and maraun et al 2017 we do not use bias correction procedures for the climatic projections 4 3 1 air temperature projections the changes in mean monthly air temperatures between values simulated from climatic models for the historical period see suppl fig 1 and values projected from climatic models for future periods 2021 2050 and 2071 2100 see section 3 1 for details are shown in suppl figs 5 9 each among suppl figs 5 9 consist of six panels in the panels on the left the results of estimated changes in air temperature between the near future and the historical period are presented while in the panels on the right the changes between the far future and the historical period are shown in the three rows the changes in monthly minimum mean and maximum daily averaged air temperatures are presented on average the projected increases of mean monthly air temperatures vary depending on the month catchment and climatic model from 0 c to 3 c for the 2021 2050 period and from 1 5 c to 6 c for the 2071 2100 period one may note the relatively high differences between projections obtained from different climatic models these are noted for all catchments but are slightly lower for lowland suprasl in poland and irondequoit creek in ny usa than for mountainous rivers in the case of the biala tarnowska catchment in extreme cases the projections of mean monthly air temperature warming for the 2071 2100 period see suppl fig 5 a middle picture in the right column may range for february from 8 c from ipsl model to 1 5 c from noresm model for the 2071 2100 period in the cedar river catchment the mean monthly air temperature is projected by uqam and mpi models to increase in march by over 3 c but by the noresm model to marginally decrease see suppl fig 7 middle picture of left column the seasonal variability of warming is fuzzy and catchment dependent in polish two catchments the largest increase in air temperatures is projected for winter and late autumn but such a trend is not confirmed by all climatic models e g noresm does not show that in three us catchments summertime warming looks to be the highest but again this trend highly depends on the catchment and climatic model although the increase in air temperatures is generally projected for all catchments and both analyzed periods nonetheless some climatic models point at possible cooling during various months in the 2021 2050 period in the case of projections for march during the 2021 2050 period on us catchments even the averaged over all climatic models change in air temperature may be negative although for polish catchments some climatic models may also suggest cooling for specific months during the 2021 2050 period the projections averaged over all climatic models show warming of air temperatures for each month the projections show large variability between different seasons but the overall warming during the 2071 2100 period is projected to be more than twice higher than the warming during the 2021 2050 period both in polish and us catchments 4 3 2 projections of discharge the projections of discharge for periods 2021 2050 and 2071 2100 see suppl figs 10 14 are highly uncertain and depending on the climatic model frequently contradictory on average the mean discharge in both polish rivers see suppl figs 10 11 is projected to decrease but more severely on the lowland suprasl than on the mountainous biala tarnowska extreme discharges however may be higher on the biala tarnowska but not on the suprasl in the case of us catchments rather increase in discharge is projected but very uneven through the year summers which are especially important for biological activity in rivers is projected to see little difference on all three considered us catchments see suppl figs 12 14 considering the high uncertainty of the projections and the weak trends observed the impact of the change in discharge on the thermal conditions of rivers is hard to estimate 4 3 3 stream temperature projections in this section we discuss the projected changes in stream water temperatures obtained by four different stream temperature models projections from the same climatic models and the same rainfall runoff model were used for each considered stream temperature model such that the differences may solely be attributed to the latter ones the change in stream temperatures is here understood as the difference between the projected monthly mean maximum or minimum of daily averaged stream temperatures for future climatic conditions and the simulated by the same models monthly mean maximum or minimum of daily averaged stream temperatures for the historical period we consider two future periods the near future 2021 2050 and the far future 2071 2100 for each river the projected changes in stream temperatures are given graphically in figs 4 8 according to the majority of stream temperature models the warming of waters up to 2021 2050 period is expected to be within 1 c for almost every stream and month hence is to be lower than the rise in the air temperatures in two us catchments cases the cedar river and irondequoit creek decreases in the mean monthly stream temperature are projected for the spring season see figs 6 and 8 this is in accordance with projected by various climatic models cooling of the air temperatures in march and april on these two catchments and may be consistent with already observed winter or spring cooling of some rivers in the usa kaushal et al 2010 arismendi et al 2012 isaak et al 2018 or central europe arora et al 2016 kedra 2020 graf and wrzesinski 2020 michel et al 2020 despite that in the vast majority of months warming dominates in each catchment in the northern usa the largest warming is expected in the summer and early winter months see figs 6 8 and there is a good agreement between projected changes in the monthly mean minimum and maximum daily averaged values of water temperatures among the models punn and air2stream projects slightly warmer water in the summertime than mlp and nlogr3 but the differences for mean monthly stream temperatures are relatively low in poland the warming of both catchments for the 2021 2050 period is projected to be slightly higher in spring april and may and autumn september october and november than during the winter or summer months see figs 4 5 the largest warmings of stream temperatures are projected to occur one or two months later than the largest warmings in air temperatures although all the models project relatively similar changes in the monthly mean stream temperatures the projections of the hottest and coolest days during a month do vary see upper and lower pictures in the left side column of figs 4 and 5 until the 2071 2100 period the warming of stream waters is expected to be much larger ranging from 1 c to 3 c for the mean monthly temperatures depending on the river and month it may hence be again as for the 2021 2050 period very roughly assessed to be 50 lower than the rise of air temperatures in poland the rise in monthly mean water temperatures is expected to reach 2 3 5 c during spring and autumn but stay below 2 c during summer and winter months as the largest increase in air temperatures is projected for the winter months in poland this suggests that the warming of waters would be the largest when the effect of warmer winter combine with the higher declination of the sun in early spring in autumn the hotter air is projected to keep water temperatures warm longer than in the historical period warming of waters is projected to be slightly larger in the mountainous biala tarnowska than in the lowland suprasl river in the usa for 2071 2100 period the summer warming is projected to reach or even exceed 3 c but during spring the streams are expected to warm up by less than 2 c in the cedar river during winter months the increase in water temperature is projected to barely exceed 1 c contrary to the case of polish rivers this fully agrees in timing with the projected warming of air temperatures which are also expected in the summer period trends projected for the monthly maximum and minimum daily averaged water temperatures are roughly similar to those obtained for the mean monthly temperatures in the three non mountainous rivers a slightly larger increase in the minimum than in the maximum mean daily temperatures for a particular month is projected but the opposite is generally expected for the biala tarnowska and the cedar river the above discussion reflects the results obtained from the majority of used stream temperature models however when one pays attention to projections made by particular stream temperature models a more divergent picture appears for some months and rivers the projections from one among three models air2stream punn or nlogr3 highly differ from those obtained from other models only mlp seems to be always in agreement with the main pack of models among the three models that do diverge the nlogr3 model projects that the monthly mean stream temperature would rise for 2071 2100 period by over 4 c in irondequoit creek when other models project the rise to be lower than 3 c for the 2021 2050 period on the same stream the nlogr3 projects almost 2 c warming when air2stream projects the rise in water temperatures to stay below 0 5 c on the contrary for the 2071 2100 period the nlogr3 projects by far the lowest warming of the fanno creek waters in august and september and air2stream projects for the majority of months the highest warming for that river for many different months during the 2071 2100 period the air2stream model projects 0 5 1 c higher warming of the biala tarnowska waters than the other models do punn often projects the lowest warming for this river and for the 2021 2050 period even suggest cooling in extremes see upper and lower picture on the left column in fig 4 for the 2071 2100 period punn projects that the rise in summertime monthly mean stream water temperatures on the cedar river would reach 5 c when other models project warming not greater than 3 c interestingly for almost all months apart june september period the warming projected by punn is the lowest in some cases the second lowest among other models when applying anova to see which kind of models climatic or water temperature have a larger impact on the projections of stream temperatures we find very different results to those noted for the historical data see table 5 for the 2021 2050 period the variance related to climatic models is larger in four catchments biala tarnowska supral irondeuoit creek and contrary to the results that were obtaned for the historical period fano creek however the differences are lower than those observed for the historical period for the 2071 2100 period stream temperature models contribute to the higher variability in the case of cedar river and fanno creek for the other three catchments the variability of climatic models remains more important but the relative contribution from stream temperature models increase to 22 38 from 1 to 8 that was noted for historical periods as a result for the 2071 2100 period the averaged over all five catchments impact of climatic models and stream temperature models on the variability of stream tmeperature is roughly similar it confirms the importance of using not only different climatic models but also various stream temperature models in studies aimed at projections of future thermal conditions of rivers 5 discussion the existence of various aquatic biota depends on the thermal conditions of rivers due to global warming the stream temperatures are expected to increase but not uniformly through the year and not at the same rate in each catchment according to our study performed on five selected catchments from temperate climatic conditions of northern usa states of oregon washington and new york and poland that is based on the rcp 8 5 emission scenario for the 2021 2050 period even water cooling may occur in some months on particular sites although unexpected cooling of stream temperatures is not impossible and over the recent decades has already been observed for some catchments in the usa and middle europe kaushal et al 2010 arora et al 2016 isaak et al 2018 graf and wrzesinski 2020 michel et al 2020 part but not all of these cooling trends may be explained by the location of dams above the measurement site e g kaushal et al 2010 arora et al 2018 isaak et al 2018 or the specific regional patterns arismendi et al 2012 the role of reservoirs may continue to be highly influential in the near future however would rather not be sufficient to prevent stream warming in the far future the projections of stream temperatures do depend on the stream temperature model used but on the other hand the differences in the rise of water temperatures obtained from different stream temperature models are lower than the differences in the rise of air temperatures projected by different climatic models hence should we insist on using more than one stream temperature model considering that 1 the climatic models are far more complex and 2 all stream temperature models use the same projections from climatic models the differences in stream temperature projections are relatively large moreover the noted differences in the monthly mean temperatures may occasionally reach e g see fig 4 august the biala tarnowska river the period 2071 2100 or even exceed 2 c e g see fig 7 september the fanno creek the period 2071 2100 or fig 6 august the cedar river the period 2071 2100 such big differences in water temperatures during summer months would be crucial for the fate of various biota living in these aquatic systems this is another warning that using a single stream temperature model may easily hide part of the uncertainty associated with the future thermal regimes of rivers and result in simplified conclusions if the differences between models are skipped under the rcp 8 5 scenario our study finds that on average the warming of stream temperatures is expected to reach annually about 1 c for 2021 2050 and 1 3 c for 2071 2100 periods the projected rise in stream temperatures until the end of xxi century is consistent with a multimodel study by bustillo et al 2014 who expected 2 2 3 5 c warming for the loire river france with mantua et al 2010 who expected warming of streams in washington state by 1 5 c with ficklin et al 2014 who projected on average above 3 c warming for the upper and middle part of the columbia river basin the northwestern usa and southwestern canada with du et al 2019 study on the athabasca river western canada who expected 1 6 3 1 c warming and with dugdale et al 2018 who projected about 2 c warming on the lower saint john river eastern canada our result is also consistent with buccola et al 2016 who expected 2 c warming in the north santiam river in northwestern oregon by 2060 s however contrary to bustillo et al 2014 findings we expect more diversified warming during particular seasons du et al 2019 and ficklin et al 2014 also projected high seasonal variations of stream temperature warming with the highest warming during summertime which is consistent with our results for us rivers but not for polish ones we may also note that although the summertime warming of north western us catchments by 5 c projected by punn is much higher than the warming obtained from three other models used in our study it is consistent with recent lee et al 2020 paper lee et al 2020 used a physically based model and projected that the increase of the annual maximum of stream water temperatures in some catchments from the north western usa may well exceed 4 c in summer until the 2080 s in the extreme case reaching 8 c with the same rcp 8 5 scenario as used in this study mantua et al 2010 also projected stream temperature increase up to 5 c for some streams in the washington state hence some of the extreme projections obtained in our study from one among four models may turn out to be consistent with other modelling tools it is another story to what extent they would be consistent with reality 6 conclusions according to the present research which assumes the rcp 8 5 emission scenario the warming of mean monthly stream waters of five studied catchments located in temperate conditions with high seasonality is on the average expected to reach about 1 c for the 2021 2050 period and 1 3 c for the 2071 2100 period for various catchments these numbers would highly depend on the specific month and the stream temperature model used for specific months on some rivers even a marginal cooling is projected for the 2021 2050 period overall the rise in the water temperatures is expected to be up to 50 lower than the rise in the air temperatures the impact of the stream temperature model used on the projections of water temperatures in rivers is generally a bit lower than the impact of the climatic model however this finding is highly catchment dependent on some catchments the opposite relation is noted nonetheless in specific cases we have found that for the same climatic and hydrological projections that feed stream temperature models the differences in the projected water temperatures only due to the choice of water temperature model may exceed 2 c with huge consequences for aquatic biota considering that often several climatic models are used in studies aimed at climatic change and its impact on biodiversity or human activity in the catchments we strongly suggest using different stream temperature models as well remaining with the results produced by only a single stream temperature model flattens our understanding of possible future and may also offer peculiar projections that could lead to doubtful conclusions author contribution ap

4292,groundwater hydrochemistry evolution in carbonated coastal aquifers is impacted by seawater intrusion a well documented groundwater flow system division is the premise and the key of hydrochemistry evolution or seawater intrusion research under complex geological and topographical conditions in this research the regional groundwater system in the study area is divided into three groundwater flow systems according to topographic geological and hydrodynamic conditions the hydrogeochemistry evolution in the daweijia coastal aquifer is characterized on the basis of the groundwater flow system division the results show that the groundwater hydrochemistry evolution varies in different groundwater flow systems in the daweijia area 1 hydrochemistry evolution in groundwater flow system i si is controlled by lateral recharge dissolution of evaporates and seawater intrusion the hydrochemistry presents characteristic hco3 ca mg cl hco3 ca and cl na ca along the runoff path and seawater intrusion is found 1 3 km inland 2 hydrochemistry composition in groundwater flow system ii sii is influenced by water rock interaction freshwater seawater mixing evaporation and reverse cation exchange additionally human activities are potentially a primary factor in the hydrochemical evolution of sii and cause no3 type groundwater seawater intrusion is found 2 8 km inland with a mixing proportion of 5 3 hydrochemistry evolution in groundwater flow system iii siii is influenced by seawater intrusion local precipitation and a short runoff path a classic seawater intrusion model is present in siii the hydrochemical distribution presents a regular changing pattern following the order hco3 ca and hco3 cl ca freshwater and cl mg ca na ca brackish water the degree of seawater intrusion in siii is more serious than that in the si and sii isotopic results generally reveal that the groundwater is primarily derived from the combination of local precipitation and lateral recharge from the system boundary the study proposes an effective method to analyze groundwater hydrochemical evolution under complex geological conditions in coastal areas keywords carbonate aquifer costal area groundwater flow system hydrochemistry seawater intrusion 1 introduction nearly 44 of the global population lives in coastal regions where the development of economy and agriculture and the ecological balance depend on freshwater availability carol et al 2009 freshwater resources are therefore used intensively and chemically altered by natural processes and human activities many coastal aquifers are undergoing increased salinization due to groundwater exploitation tectonic events climate variations or sea level fluctuations mongelli et al 2013 mollema et al 2013 merchán et al 2015 seawater intrusion is a complex process that evolves through mixing with freshwater water rock interactions hydrogeochemical reactions and groundwater flow khaska et al 2013 sola et al 2014 cary et al 2015 werner et al 2013 seawater intrusion research encompasses a multidisciplinary range of topics due to the complex nature of coastal groundwater flow and transport adrian et al 2013 bakker 2000 carol et al 2009 survey 2012 the well documented and considerable threat posed by seawater intrusion worldwide bakker 2000 moujabber et al 2006 kim et al 2003 liu et al 2017 is expected to be exacerbated by future climate change and associated sea level rise resulting in mounting groundwater management challenges tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 taylor et al 2013 coastal areas in general are under the influence of a combination of sea level rise and more extreme storms as a result of climate change due to saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers triggered by climate change induced sea level rise which may reduce or contaminate groundwater resources because of saline intrusion unesco un water 2020 seawater intrusion primarily occurs in quaternary pore aquifers and karst fissure aquifers through different formation mechanisms the process of seawater intrusion is faster and larger in karst fissure aquifers due to tectonic fissures and karsts which add to the complexity of groundwater chemical evolution in coastal areas where hydrogeological conditions feature large spatiotemporal variations many studies address seawater intrusion in coastal karst aquifers for example in the united states fleury et al 2007 spain martinez santos et al 2005 mexico escolero et al 2006 israel kafri et al 2007 greece nerantzis et al 2018 and china han et al 2014 2015 2016 much research focuses on the optimal use of coastal groundwater evaluation of groundwater quality theoretical chemical composition analysis groundwater management and hydrochemical interaction processes nevertheless the quantification of hydrodynamics in coastal aquifers remains challenging in areas with complex geological structures systematic analysis of geological hydrogeological conditions and groundwater flow systems is the premise and foundation of seawater intrusion research additionally a clear groundwater flow system division is helpful for analyzing the seawater intrusion process and its impact since the 1960 s coastal areas of liaoning province particularly dalian in the south with a coastline of 1906 km have been severely affected by seawater intrusion han et al 2015 karst groundwater in daweijia was the groundwater source for dalian city until the year 2000 fan 1984 extensive groundwater exploitation resulted in severe seawater intrusion therefore after 2001 the supply of groundwater stopped zou et al 2004 song 2013 previous research on the coastal karst fissure aquifer near the long and narrow valley of the daweijia area focuses on the distribution mechanism wu and jin 1990 song 2013 han et al 2015 wu et al 1994 hydrogeochemical interactions and characteristics zou et al 2004 zhao et al 2012 han et al 2016 of seawater intrusion which also affects the northern and southern parts of daweijia where research is not yet comprehensive defined by complex structures and varied lithologies the hydrochemical evolution processes and route of seawater intrusion are primarily controlled by the strata structures and the dynamic groundwater field to analyze the influence trend of hydrochemical evolution and seawater intrusion the conventional method is to draw the contour lines of each index according to the spatial distribution of water samples however this method is only suitable for area with homogeneous quaternary loose rocks pore water but not for area with bedrock fissure karst water due to the significant difference in the flow system using the analysis method of uniformly drawn isopleth to deal with the groundwater system with karst fissures will make a cognitive mistake and then lead to the mismanagement of the seawater intrusion prevention project therefore the classification of the flow system is the premise and key of groundwater environment analysis in in coastal zone with fissure karst moreover analysis of the groundwater hydrochemical evolution is more persuasive and theoretically stringent when closely combined with the hydrodynamic field division of groundwater the significance of the division of groundwater flow systems is not fully addressed in research on groundwater hydrochemical evolution in coastal karst areas in this study a coastal groundwater flow system is analyzed and divided on a relatively large scale and groundwater hydrochemical evolution is discussed based on the groundwater flow system division this study aims to provide an effective solution to analyze groundwater hydrochemistry evolution influenced by seawater intrusion and other hydrogeochemical processes in complex coastal karst areas 2 hydrogeologic settings of study area the study area is located on the coast near bohai bay northeast china special attention is paid to the coastal region of approximately 150 km2 along a coastline of 60 km with a width of 18 km fig 1 in dalian city the geomorphologic type is low mountains and hilly and the complex formation of topography is controlled by geologic structure and lithology highlands are distributed in the south north and east whereas the middle part of the study area contains lowlands the area is characterized by a temperate semi humid monsoon climate the temperature experiences high seasonal variation with an average between 9 3 and 10 5 c song 2013 the average annual precipitation is 634 mm yr averaged from 1951 to 2011 approximately 60 70 of which occurs from june august the annual average evaporation is between 885 and 976 mm yr of which 30 40 occurs in spring and the evaporation in may reaches more than 240 mm the daweijia river is seasonal in this area and originates in the eastern part of the study area the river has a length of 15 5 km zhao et al 2012 and an annual average discharge of approximately 14 106 m3 year li 2004 the geology of the study area records a long history from the archaeozoic to the quaternary resulting in a complex structure and varied lithologies including archaeozoic metamorphic basement composed of gneiss sinian deposits include continental limestone shale marlstone and quartzite cambrian to carboniferous deposits include limestone shale marlstone and quartzite cambrian to carboniferous deposits include limestone argillaceous limestone shale siltstone and sandstone quaternary deposits consist of alluvial deposits eolian deposits proluvial deposits and marine deposits fig 1 the two primary fault zones are the neocathaysian fault zone and a structural thrust fault zone with ne and nw orientations respectively the neocathaysian fault was cut by the structural thrust fault resulting in discontinuous distribution the compresso crushed zone intensified the formation of fissures and karst the laoqianshan overturned anticline and the dongtianjiafang anticline both have a two fold axis and nearly ew orientation the principal aquifer is composed of two domains the upper quaternary aquifer and the lower karst fissure aquifer the aquifers are hydraulically connected the carbonate aquifer is primarily composed of ordovician and cambrian limestone and argillaceous limestone with a buried depth of 30 40 m fig 1 the complexity of stratigraphic and hydrogeological conditions are controlled by the multiple tectonic movement intensifying the spatial structure inhomogeneity and permeability anisotropy of karst water bearing media the development of karst banded along the tectonic zone of fold and fault in the horizontal direction and stratified in the vertical direction calcite and dolomite are the main components of karst water bearing media developed limestone karsts in the study area make the carbonate aquifer rich in water and the aquifer was widely pumped for domestic drinking and agricultural irrigation purposes the water yield of carbonate aquifers in a gully area can reach 500 3000 m3 d whereas that of aquifers in inshore areas is greater than 3000 m3 d the most productive carbonate aquifers are located in the valley along the daweijia river approximately 70 to 80 of the carbonate aquifer is exposed to the surface and directly recharged by rainfall the other aquifer is covered by quaternary sediments of different thicknesses and receives infiltration recharge from the quaternary aquifer further the aquifer is also laterally recharged by bedrock fissure water in the surrounding mountains under natural conditions fresh groundwater flows from east to west through the alluvial sediment and karst fracture toward the coastline precipitation surface water and groundwater are closely related in limestone karst exposed areas from the watershed to the river valley the process of recharge is dominated by alternating vertical and runoff daweijia groundwater was established as the source for dalian city in 1969 and provided water at a pumping rate of 1 2 104 2 4 104 m3 d in the 1970 s the pumping rate continued increasing until 1983 and annual exploitation quantity was reduced by two thirds from 1983 to 1991 with changes to seasonal pumping since 2001 the daweijia groundwater source has ceased to supply water to dalian city but small scale exploitation is retained for local agricultural irrigation zhao et al 2012 during the unrestricted pumping period the average concentration of chloride in the groundwater increased from 198 8 to 1136 8 mg l and was reduced to 559 4 mg l in 1991 due to seasonal pumping the cl values returned to approximately 500 mg l from 1995 to 2000 as the pumping rate decreased in 1994 and 2001 the average cl concentration increased to more than 800 mg l due to increased exploitation during droughts after ceasing to provide urban water the average concentration of cl decreased especially in 2006 after increasing exploitation in 2006 the concentration of cl increased slightly and decreased to 480 mg l in 2010 average cl concentrations were 297 and 257 mg l in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 2 the seawater intrusion area with cl concentration greater than 250 mg l was 23 7 km2 in 1991 and varied from 23 1 to 26 5 km2 from 2001 to 2010 the seawater intrusion distance and area decreased in 2018 and 2019 fig 2 shows that the average cl concentration and seawater intrusion area appear to respond to pumping 3 division of groundwater flow system the division of flow systems in the study area is based on the three following rules 1 the combination of geological topographical and hydrodynamic conditions determines the formation and development of the groundwater flow system 2 the boundary of the groundwater flow system is formed where the surface watershed consists of aquifuge or aquitard stratum 3 permeable strata such as the limestone stratum can also form groundwater flow system boundaries with positive surface topography and under favorable tectonic such as anticlinal ridges and meteorological abundant precipitation conditions overall the terrain in the study area is high in the east low in the west and inclined towards the northwest fig 1 the northern and southern parts of the study area contain ridge lines with high terrain in miao mountain qiding mountain daziying mqd and dongtianjiafang respectively as the dip angle of the stratum is steep the condition is conducive to the formation of surface watersheds fig 3 the stratum outcrops of the mqd anticline include cambrian anticline limestone and sinian shale and marlstone that form the boundary of the groundwater flow system with weak permeability the development of strata in dongtianjiafang includes cambrian limestone shale and siltstone although the permeable limestone serves as the primary strata from the high topography formed by the anticline in the mountain area additional atmospheric precipitation is the primary groundwater recharge source of the groundwater creating a confining boundary in the groundwater flow system fig 3 widely distributed archaeozoic metamorphic rocks constitute the eastern groundwater boundary groundwater elevation contours were drawn according to the measured water table fig 3 fig 3 shows that the flow direction significantly changes throughout the study area however groundwater generally flows from east to west in the north mqd area groundwater flows from south or southeast to north or northwest in the area between mqd and dongtianjiafang groundwater generally flows from southeast to northwest the groundwater flow directions near the common boundary of different groundwater flow systems change significantly in the southern area groundwater flows from northeast to southwest with a short flow path figs 3 and 4 show the divisions of the three different groundwater flow systems a combination of topographic geological and hydrodynamic conditions groundwater flow system i si is distributed in the area north of mqd groundwater flow system ii sii is located in the daweijia area and groundwater flow system iii siii lies in the southern offshore area 4 hydrochemistry characteristics of groundwater flow systems a field investigation was conducted during august 2019 and the water samples were collected a total of 34 groundwater samples were obtained from irrigation and domestic supply wells in the carbonate aquifer one of which is an exposed spring water outcrop of the carbonate aquifer a groundwater sample from the quaternary aquifer and a seawater sample were also collected fig 3 all water samples were analyzed at the ministry of land and resources mlr changchun mineral resources supervision and test center the chemical composition of the collected samples in the coastal aquifer is displayed in table 1 the ph of groundwater from carbonate aquifer ranges from 7 02 to 7 70 with a average of 7 38 while the seawater sample is 7 67 and there is no significant difference were observed in ph between groundwater and seawater total dissolved solids tds are a basic measure of water quality groundwater samples were divided into fresh water tds 1 g l brackish water 1 g l tds 3 g l salt water 3 g l tds 10 g l saline water 10 g l tds 50 g l and brine 50 g l tds according to tds ranges handbook of hydrogeology 2012 in this study groundwater samples were divided into fresh and brackish 4 1 evolution of the hydrochemical types of the groundwater flow systems the groundwater chemical variability of the flow systems is illustrated in the piper diagram fig 5 and the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram fig 6 in si a clear evolution from the low salinity hco3 ca type in the recharge water sc38 to the mixed cl type with increased salinity is observed fig 5 sample sc32 which is enriched in cl and na was collected near the sea and shows direct seawater intrusion impact fig 6 groundwater samples from sii have a larger variation interval than si samples and evolved from the low salinity hco3 ca mg hco3 cl ca type to the cl hco3 ca and cl na ca type with increased salinity all the brackish water samples are located in the field associated with the intrusion phase fig 6 the spring water ss09 presents the cl na ca type which represents a carbonate outcrop close to groundwater and is more affected by seawater intrusion fig 6 additional differences are observed at the sc33 boundary of sii which contains so4 cl type groundwater fig 5 no significant differences are observed for siii which shows hco3 and cl types higher na and cl contents are observed in the quaternary aquifer sample sq13 indicating seawater intrusion impacts different groundwater hydrochemical types partially indicate the extent to which they are affected by seawater intrusion the evolutionary processes of the three groundwater flow systems are generally similar and are identified by inland distal intrusion facies ca mixhco3 which evolves to sub stage of ca mixcl and mixca cl transitions through sub stages of mixna cl and finally becomes na cl which represents the final mixture and tendency of the water components toward seawater fig 6 the spatial distribution and evolution of groundwater hydrochemical types in the three groundwater flow systems are also generally consistent local differences were caused by hydrogeological conditions and human activity fig 2 almost all hco3 type groundwater with low salinity is located in the eastern recharge area and changes to cl type in the western area near the sea in the recharge area groundwater is recharged by precipitation and eastern bedrock fissure water its hydrochemistry type primarily depends on dissolution and filtration in the aquifer hydrochemical facies change to cl hco3 type along the flow path which is the residual effect of previous saline intrusion and the dominant hydrochemical factor in the area near the sea groundwater presents a cl na type with high salinity indicating seawater intrusion and mixing with seawater the hydrochemistry type change is dominated by cl and na additionally special groundwater hydrochemical types occurred in the dalianpao daziying area of sii the groundwater samples are enriched in nitrate with a special no3 type in this area fig 2 according to the field investigation the study area contains many orchards and farmlands the water sources surrounded by orchards and farmlands that nitrogen fertilizers are easily released from agricultural soils to the aquifers which can explain the high no3 concentrations observed in groundwater compared to other nitrogenous species such as nh4 and no2 the concentration of nitrate in most samples is higher indicating a dominant process of nitrification mahlknecht et al 2017 eliapenda and alfred 2016 sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 further the nitrate source and the relationship between no3 and so4 2 is detected when sulfate provided by the theoretical mixing with seawater is removed to confirm this process the difference in concentration δn between the observed values and those expected if mixing with seawater was obtained through the following mixing equation pennisi et al 2006 1 δ n x n x n x f r e s h n cl s n cl f r e s h n x s e a n cl s e a where nx s nx fresh nx sea refer to the concentration of component x in the sample s fresh groundwater fresh and seawater sea fig 6 shows a positive relationship between δso4 2 and δno3 except for special samples sc21 22 23 and 24 the increase in no3 and so4 2 reveals that the application of fertilizers is a major source of nitrate nakano et al 2008 menció et al 2016 the no3 type sc21 22 23 and 24 samples show these characteristics fig 7 and prove that the increase in no3 and so4 2 concentration is caused by the application of sulfate and nitrate fertilizers in agriculture additionally the sc14 15 33 and 34 samples with high so4 2 concentrations greater than300 mg l show different features fig 7 which are more likely attributed to seawater intrusion rather than to agricultural fertilizers fig 6 4 2 indicative components of groundwater flow system variation in the context of seawater intrusion cl and tds are the signature components that indicate the process and degree of seawater intrusion a classification for groundwater based on tds is given in fig 8 tds concentrations of fresh and brackish water in si are 591 968 and 1108 2112 mg l respectively tds concentrations of fresh and brackish water in sii are 401 976 and 1023 2036 mg l respectively the tds concentrations of fresh and brackish water samples in siii are 438 953 and 2740 mg l respectively all brackish water samples are observed in wells near coastal areas and are distributed in strips parallel to the coast fig 8 shows that tds and cl concentrations in the coastal area vary significantly with distance from the coast in si sii and siii samples with low tds and cl concentration are generally located far from the coast whereas samples with higher tds and cl concentration are located near the coast based on these observations seawater intrusion is found 1 3 2 8 km inland as evidenced by cl 250 mg l and tds 1000 mg l in si and sii respectively the distance of seawater intrusion in siii is shorter approximately 1 1 km than in si and sii however siii presents the highest observed tds and cl concentrations of 2740 and 1034 mg l respectively the distance of seawater invasion is generally the longest in sii whereas the groundwater is more influenced by seawater intrusion in siii the groundwater salinization of sii which used to supply dalian city as the daweijia groundwater source is analyzed in detail the sc15 and 16 samples have a relatively high eigenvalue of tds and cl however these samples are farther from the coastline than samples ss09 sc10 18 and 34 fig 8 thus the preferential flow paths in fault zones may be the major factor and could also be caused by the special structure of semi enclosed pocket space likely formed by karst heterogeneity the tds and cl of sii were compared with those reported by han et al 2015 who measured the values of tds and cl of 11 14 and 15 samples investigated from carbonate aquifers in 2008 2009 and 2010 respectively in xiaolianpao daweijia lianfeng fig 3 of sii the result shows that the average concentration of tds and cl in 2019 decreased fig 9 however the concentration of tds and cl are close to or exceed the salinization limit tds 1000 mg l cl 250 mg l despite many years of groundwater abstraction restrictions by the local government in this case the dual porosity medium of karst fissure and pipelines may be the primary factor causing continuous groundwater salinization in a developed structural fracture zone fig 1 mixed seawater in stagnant zones semi enclosed pocket space of the aquifer has almost zero velocity once seawater entered the stagnant zones of the aquifer it will persist much longer and the solute dispersion with the water outside the stagnant zone will continue this process will last a long time and affect the hydrochemical composition of the surrounding groundwater it indicates that groundwater salinization is a lasting process in heterogeneous carbonate aquifers 4 3 major hydrochemical and hydrogeochemical action on groundwater chemical characters chloride is a conservative tracer of water salinization as it is not significantly affected by sorption processes of biological transformations mahlknecht et al 2017 in this sense the relationships between na mg2 ca2 so4 2 and cl are shown in fig 10 logarithmic coordinates are used for analysis and the units are meq l the analysis assessed the hydrochemical processes occurring in aquifers in the study area the na exhibits a positive correlation with cl content and the values of the na cl relationship are close to the line of mixing with seawater in si and siii which is expected for the dissolution of halite and or a conservative mixture of freshwater seawater fig 10a na cl values are generally lower in salinity enriched samples in sii than in si and clearly plot below the seawater mixing line for most of the brackish water fig 10a suggesting that na removing processes occur in sii reverse cation exchange between na and ca2 has been reported in other aquifers affected by seawater intrusion cary et al 2015 the quantity of ca2 in brackish water samples of sii also indicates a supplementary source of cation exchange processes fig 10b whereas the positive relationship between ca2 and cl close to the seawater mixing is line observed in si and siii fig 10b additionally in the scatter plot na k cl vs ca2 mg2 alkalinity so4 2 fig 11 a linear relationship of the groundwater slope close to 1 in sii suggests the participation of na and ca2 in reverse exchange reactions the relationships between mg2 and cl and so4 2 and cl of groundwater in si sii and siii fig 10c 10d show a significantly positive correlation indicating that mg2 and so4 2 in groundwater originate from the dissolution of evaporates additionally higher salinity mg2 and so4 2 evolution is closer to the line of seawater mixing in si sii and siii fig 10c d thus seawater intrusion also contributes to the mg2 and so4 2 however the sc33 sample presents more magnesium than would be expected from seawater contribution in sii fig 10d compared to the seawater mixing and fertilizers input fig 7 the excess so4 2 of sc33 might be attributed to evaporate dissolution fig 10d and explain the so4 cl ca mg type water observed in sample sc33 fig 5 5 aquifer recharge assessment and mixing process in different groundwater flow systems 5 1 groundwater origin and recharge the isotopic composition of groundwater and seawater samples is summarized in table 1 the global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl δd 5 57δ18o 11 4 were obtained from rainwater data sampled at the jinzhou weather station the nearest observation station to daweijia which represents the coastal climate yang 2011 in the si aquifer the δ18o and δd values range from 8 7 to 6 5 and 57 3 to 47 1 respectively and are distributed near the lmwl fig 12 lower than those of the local seawater sample δ18o 1 5 δd 9 8 the results show that groundwater in si is primarily derived from local atmospheric precipitation the δ18o 2 1 to 5 5 and δd 57 3 to 37 3 values of groundwater in sii are more dispersed than in si and are closer to those of gmwl except for ss09 sc10 and sc11 the slope of the local groundwater line lgwl in sii is smaller than that of si and the lmwl indicating sii groundwater is primarily derived from the rainfall infiltration with varying degrees of evaporation the groundwater runoff path of the groundwater flow system is the longest in the study area additionally the ss09 sc10 and sc11 samples from sii are particularly enriched in δ18o compared to the other groundwater samples and deviate significantly from the lmwl fig 12 the ss09 sc10 and sc11 samples were collected from exposed carbonate strata and coincide with the approximate location of the groundwater flow system boundary fig 2 moreover these samples are brackish water which accelerates the dissolution of carbonate with increasing salinity slow circulation speed and amount near the boundary of the groundwater flow system allow the groundwater to stay in the aquifer for sufficient time which is also helpful for water rock interaction in this case enriched δ18o values are attributed to the isotope exchange effect between groundwater and the carbonate reservoir which has little impact on the δd value wang 1991 the spring water ss09 drains from carbonate rocks across a relatively large outcrop suggesting that the evaporation of δ18o and δd is a principal factor in the siii aquifer the δ18o 8 6 to 7 8 and δd 55 2 to 50 9 values of groundwater are more concentrated than that in si and sii and all values are distributed closer to the gmwl the groundwater in siii is primarily derived from rapid infiltration after local precipitation the shortest runoff path is near the sea the local seawater sample sw35 is closer to the gmwl and displays more stable and enriched values fig 12 the composition of δ18o and δd between fresh and brackish water is not generally obvious from examining the lines in the scatter diagram fig 12 and does not tend to transition towards local seawater 5 2 mixing model and process in intrusion impact area the relative contributions of freshwater and seawater to the mixed samples are estimated using two end members based on the mass balance mixing model mixing lines between two end member samples for the hydrochemical indicator are calculated and plotted based on 2 c m c f x c b s 1 x where x is the mixing fraction of freshwater cm is the ion concentration of the mixture sample cf is the ion concentration of freshwater and cb s is the ion concentration of seawater han et al 2014 the chloride content is plotted against δ18o composition in fig 13 to differentiate the mixing trajectory and contribution for the different waters cary et al 2015 most of the groundwater samples appear to generally fit the seawater fresh groundwater mixing trajectory in si si and siii however clear differences are found among the groundwater flow systems in si the largest seawater mixing proportion is approximately 5 of the mixed waters fig 13 in the areas of seawater water intrusion cl and na concentrations increase significantly from fresh to brackish water the hydrochemistry presents characteristics of hco3 ca mg freshwater cl hco3 ca freshwater and cl na ca brackish water fig 6 the lack of correlation between δ18o and cl in fresh groundwater may reflect the complexity of groundwater recharge and flow paths in si lateral recharge from the eastern mountain area and south groundwater boundary and infiltration recharge from atmospheric precipitation itis a simple intrusion process from seawater to fresh water in si the seawater intrusion presents a ribbonlike intrusion model fig 14 a the patterns in sii are more complex the cl concentration of brackish water sample is high and the δ18o value is randomly distributed likely reflecting the complex groundwater dynamic field fig 3 and hydrogeochemistry processes the seawater mixing proportions are generally estimated to be 5 of the mixed waters fig 13 sii shows intrusion processes in sc33 and 34 and in sc18 20 19 and 21 and lateral recharge from the mountain area on the boundary of the system the influence of seawater intrusion is relatively small intrusion also occurs in sc08 15 and 16 and a freshening process is detected in sc05 06 and 07 fig 14b the seawater intrusion presents a ribbonlike intrusion model and the influence of intrusion in sii is more serious than that in si during intrusion the mixing between cl hco3 ca type groundwater fresh water of sc07 and cl na ca type saline water north of sc08 16 and leads to increase in the cl and na concentration fig 14b additionally the high δ18o values observed in brackish samples ss09 sc10 and sc11 with relatively low cl contents fig 3 show that these samples are not the simple products of mixing freshwater and seawater but are probably due to water rock interaction and evaporation the groundwater samples in siii appear to fit the seawater fresh groundwater mixing trajectory better than those of si and sii the largest seawater mixing proportion is estimated to be slightly more than 5 of the mixed waters fig 13 the cl concentrations of samples sc01 02 and 03 increase as the δ18o value of increasing proportions of seawater increases fig 13 which is consistent with gradual mixing between the two end members in the regional groundwater flow direction fig 3 this suggests a classic seawater intrusion model further the influence of seawater intrusion in quaternary groundwater sq14 is less serious than that in carbonate groundwater sc14 6 conclusions the hydrogeochemistry evolution of coastal karst groundwater is a very complicated process due to the variety of geological topographical and hydrodynamic conditions analyses of hydrogeochemistry characteristics must be combined with groundwater flow systems significant differences are found among three flow systems that depend on differences in runoff path recharge source and degree of the impact of seawater intrusion additionally human activities are an important impact factor in hydrogeochemical evolution according to combination of geological topographical and hydrodynamic conditions the groundwater flow system in the daweijia area is divided into three groundwater flow systems si sii and siii the spatial distribution of the groundwater hydrochemical types in the three flow systems is generally homologous and local differences are caused by hydrogeological conditions and human activities almost all the groundwater hco3 type with low salinity is located in the eastern recharge area and changes to cl type in the western area near the sea this hydrochemical change fully reflects seawater intrusion isotopic results reveal that the groundwater is primarily derived from the combination of the local atmospheric precipitation and lateral recharge from boundary of the systems hydrochemical evolution in si is controlled by lateral recharge dissolution of evaporates and seawater intrusion the hydrochemistry presents characteristics of hco3 ca mg freshwater cl hco3 ca freshwater and cl na ca brackish water along the runoff path seawater intrusion is found 1 3 km inland and the largest seawater mixing proportion is approximately 5 hydrochemical data reveal that the hydrochemistry evolution in sii is more complex the local groundwater samples are enriched in nitrate with a special no3 type which is influenced by human activities the occurrence of reverse cation exchange results in a na removing process in brackish water the hydrochemical composition of freshwater is controlled by dissolution of evaporates whereas coastal brackish water undergoes more pronounced seawater intrusion furthermore the isotopic composition is influenced by water rock exchange and evaporation under the complex geological structural background which is different from that of si and siii the hfe diagram and the mixing model reveal intrusion and freshening processes in sii seawater intrusion is found 2 8 km inland the degree of seawater intrusion is lower than before with a seawater mixing proportion of 5 hydrochemistry evolution in siii is influenced by seawater intrusion local precipitation and a short local runoff path a classic seawater intrusion model is present in siii with significant changes in cl and na concentration in the transitional zone between seawater and freshwater the degree of seawater intrusion in siii is more serious than that in si and sii however the inland extent of seawater intrusion is only 1 1 km seawater intrusion is currently effectively controlled through relevant government policies and reduced local groundwater exploitation however human activities such as irrigation and fertilization are potential impact factors for hydrochemical evolution in the study area the groundwater quality demonstrates a deterioration along the flow path thus strictly controlling agricultural fertilization and water use activities is necessary to prevent groundwater pollution and quality degradation in the area for example consider changes in anthropogenic land use patterns to reduce the use of fertilizer and promote clean agricultural reduce the use of inorganic fertilizers and increase the use of organic fertilizers and restrict individual groundwater pumping or changing the irrigation mode for irrigation in the seawater intrusion area also future studies will focus on the interactions with surface water and seawater and more detailed understanding of groundwater vulnerability and pollution risk assessment so as to establish their pathways before groundwater quality protection measures and integrated management of karst aquifers can be applied funding this research did not receive any specific grant from

4292,groundwater hydrochemistry evolution in carbonated coastal aquifers is impacted by seawater intrusion a well documented groundwater flow system division is the premise and the key of hydrochemistry evolution or seawater intrusion research under complex geological and topographical conditions in this research the regional groundwater system in the study area is divided into three groundwater flow systems according to topographic geological and hydrodynamic conditions the hydrogeochemistry evolution in the daweijia coastal aquifer is characterized on the basis of the groundwater flow system division the results show that the groundwater hydrochemistry evolution varies in different groundwater flow systems in the daweijia area 1 hydrochemistry evolution in groundwater flow system i si is controlled by lateral recharge dissolution of evaporates and seawater intrusion the hydrochemistry presents characteristic hco3 ca mg cl hco3 ca and cl na ca along the runoff path and seawater intrusion is found 1 3 km inland 2 hydrochemistry composition in groundwater flow system ii sii is influenced by water rock interaction freshwater seawater mixing evaporation and reverse cation exchange additionally human activities are potentially a primary factor in the hydrochemical evolution of sii and cause no3 type groundwater seawater intrusion is found 2 8 km inland with a mixing proportion of 5 3 hydrochemistry evolution in groundwater flow system iii siii is influenced by seawater intrusion local precipitation and a short runoff path a classic seawater intrusion model is present in siii the hydrochemical distribution presents a regular changing pattern following the order hco3 ca and hco3 cl ca freshwater and cl mg ca na ca brackish water the degree of seawater intrusion in siii is more serious than that in the si and sii isotopic results generally reveal that the groundwater is primarily derived from the combination of local precipitation and lateral recharge from the system boundary the study proposes an effective method to analyze groundwater hydrochemical evolution under complex geological conditions in coastal areas keywords carbonate aquifer costal area groundwater flow system hydrochemistry seawater intrusion 1 introduction nearly 44 of the global population lives in coastal regions where the development of economy and agriculture and the ecological balance depend on freshwater availability carol et al 2009 freshwater resources are therefore used intensively and chemically altered by natural processes and human activities many coastal aquifers are undergoing increased salinization due to groundwater exploitation tectonic events climate variations or sea level fluctuations mongelli et al 2013 mollema et al 2013 merchán et al 2015 seawater intrusion is a complex process that evolves through mixing with freshwater water rock interactions hydrogeochemical reactions and groundwater flow khaska et al 2013 sola et al 2014 cary et al 2015 werner et al 2013 seawater intrusion research encompasses a multidisciplinary range of topics due to the complex nature of coastal groundwater flow and transport adrian et al 2013 bakker 2000 carol et al 2009 survey 2012 the well documented and considerable threat posed by seawater intrusion worldwide bakker 2000 moujabber et al 2006 kim et al 2003 liu et al 2017 is expected to be exacerbated by future climate change and associated sea level rise resulting in mounting groundwater management challenges tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 taylor et al 2013 coastal areas in general are under the influence of a combination of sea level rise and more extreme storms as a result of climate change due to saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers triggered by climate change induced sea level rise which may reduce or contaminate groundwater resources because of saline intrusion unesco un water 2020 seawater intrusion primarily occurs in quaternary pore aquifers and karst fissure aquifers through different formation mechanisms the process of seawater intrusion is faster and larger in karst fissure aquifers due to tectonic fissures and karsts which add to the complexity of groundwater chemical evolution in coastal areas where hydrogeological conditions feature large spatiotemporal variations many studies address seawater intrusion in coastal karst aquifers for example in the united states fleury et al 2007 spain martinez santos et al 2005 mexico escolero et al 2006 israel kafri et al 2007 greece nerantzis et al 2018 and china han et al 2014 2015 2016 much research focuses on the optimal use of coastal groundwater evaluation of groundwater quality theoretical chemical composition analysis groundwater management and hydrochemical interaction processes nevertheless the quantification of hydrodynamics in coastal aquifers remains challenging in areas with complex geological structures systematic analysis of geological hydrogeological conditions and groundwater flow systems is the premise and foundation of seawater intrusion research additionally a clear groundwater flow system division is helpful for analyzing the seawater intrusion process and its impact since the 1960 s coastal areas of liaoning province particularly dalian in the south with a coastline of 1906 km have been severely affected by seawater intrusion han et al 2015 karst groundwater in daweijia was the groundwater source for dalian city until the year 2000 fan 1984 extensive groundwater exploitation resulted in severe seawater intrusion therefore after 2001 the supply of groundwater stopped zou et al 2004 song 2013 previous research on the coastal karst fissure aquifer near the long and narrow valley of the daweijia area focuses on the distribution mechanism wu and jin 1990 song 2013 han et al 2015 wu et al 1994 hydrogeochemical interactions and characteristics zou et al 2004 zhao et al 2012 han et al 2016 of seawater intrusion which also affects the northern and southern parts of daweijia where research is not yet comprehensive defined by complex structures and varied lithologies the hydrochemical evolution processes and route of seawater intrusion are primarily controlled by the strata structures and the dynamic groundwater field to analyze the influence trend of hydrochemical evolution and seawater intrusion the conventional method is to draw the contour lines of each index according to the spatial distribution of water samples however this method is only suitable for area with homogeneous quaternary loose rocks pore water but not for area with bedrock fissure karst water due to the significant difference in the flow system using the analysis method of uniformly drawn isopleth to deal with the groundwater system with karst fissures will make a cognitive mistake and then lead to the mismanagement of the seawater intrusion prevention project therefore the classification of the flow system is the premise and key of groundwater environment analysis in in coastal zone with fissure karst moreover analysis of the groundwater hydrochemical evolution is more persuasive and theoretically stringent when closely combined with the hydrodynamic field division of groundwater the significance of the division of groundwater flow systems is not fully addressed in research on groundwater hydrochemical evolution in coastal karst areas in this study a coastal groundwater flow system is analyzed and divided on a relatively large scale and groundwater hydrochemical evolution is discussed based on the groundwater flow system division this study aims to provide an effective solution to analyze groundwater hydrochemistry evolution influenced by seawater intrusion and other hydrogeochemical processes in complex coastal karst areas 2 hydrogeologic settings of study area the study area is located on the coast near bohai bay northeast china special attention is paid to the coastal region of approximately 150 km2 along a coastline of 60 km with a width of 18 km fig 1 in dalian city the geomorphologic type is low mountains and hilly and the complex formation of topography is controlled by geologic structure and lithology highlands are distributed in the south north and east whereas the middle part of the study area contains lowlands the area is characterized by a temperate semi humid monsoon climate the temperature experiences high seasonal variation with an average between 9 3 and 10 5 c song 2013 the average annual precipitation is 634 mm yr averaged from 1951 to 2011 approximately 60 70 of which occurs from june august the annual average evaporation is between 885 and 976 mm yr of which 30 40 occurs in spring and the evaporation in may reaches more than 240 mm the daweijia river is seasonal in this area and originates in the eastern part of the study area the river has a length of 15 5 km zhao et al 2012 and an annual average discharge of approximately 14 106 m3 year li 2004 the geology of the study area records a long history from the archaeozoic to the quaternary resulting in a complex structure and varied lithologies including archaeozoic metamorphic basement composed of gneiss sinian deposits include continental limestone shale marlstone and quartzite cambrian to carboniferous deposits include limestone shale marlstone and quartzite cambrian to carboniferous deposits include limestone argillaceous limestone shale siltstone and sandstone quaternary deposits consist of alluvial deposits eolian deposits proluvial deposits and marine deposits fig 1 the two primary fault zones are the neocathaysian fault zone and a structural thrust fault zone with ne and nw orientations respectively the neocathaysian fault was cut by the structural thrust fault resulting in discontinuous distribution the compresso crushed zone intensified the formation of fissures and karst the laoqianshan overturned anticline and the dongtianjiafang anticline both have a two fold axis and nearly ew orientation the principal aquifer is composed of two domains the upper quaternary aquifer and the lower karst fissure aquifer the aquifers are hydraulically connected the carbonate aquifer is primarily composed of ordovician and cambrian limestone and argillaceous limestone with a buried depth of 30 40 m fig 1 the complexity of stratigraphic and hydrogeological conditions are controlled by the multiple tectonic movement intensifying the spatial structure inhomogeneity and permeability anisotropy of karst water bearing media the development of karst banded along the tectonic zone of fold and fault in the horizontal direction and stratified in the vertical direction calcite and dolomite are the main components of karst water bearing media developed limestone karsts in the study area make the carbonate aquifer rich in water and the aquifer was widely pumped for domestic drinking and agricultural irrigation purposes the water yield of carbonate aquifers in a gully area can reach 500 3000 m3 d whereas that of aquifers in inshore areas is greater than 3000 m3 d the most productive carbonate aquifers are located in the valley along the daweijia river approximately 70 to 80 of the carbonate aquifer is exposed to the surface and directly recharged by rainfall the other aquifer is covered by quaternary sediments of different thicknesses and receives infiltration recharge from the quaternary aquifer further the aquifer is also laterally recharged by bedrock fissure water in the surrounding mountains under natural conditions fresh groundwater flows from east to west through the alluvial sediment and karst fracture toward the coastline precipitation surface water and groundwater are closely related in limestone karst exposed areas from the watershed to the river valley the process of recharge is dominated by alternating vertical and runoff daweijia groundwater was established as the source for dalian city in 1969 and provided water at a pumping rate of 1 2 104 2 4 104 m3 d in the 1970 s the pumping rate continued increasing until 1983 and annual exploitation quantity was reduced by two thirds from 1983 to 1991 with changes to seasonal pumping since 2001 the daweijia groundwater source has ceased to supply water to dalian city but small scale exploitation is retained for local agricultural irrigation zhao et al 2012 during the unrestricted pumping period the average concentration of chloride in the groundwater increased from 198 8 to 1136 8 mg l and was reduced to 559 4 mg l in 1991 due to seasonal pumping the cl values returned to approximately 500 mg l from 1995 to 2000 as the pumping rate decreased in 1994 and 2001 the average cl concentration increased to more than 800 mg l due to increased exploitation during droughts after ceasing to provide urban water the average concentration of cl decreased especially in 2006 after increasing exploitation in 2006 the concentration of cl increased slightly and decreased to 480 mg l in 2010 average cl concentrations were 297 and 257 mg l in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 2 the seawater intrusion area with cl concentration greater than 250 mg l was 23 7 km2 in 1991 and varied from 23 1 to 26 5 km2 from 2001 to 2010 the seawater intrusion distance and area decreased in 2018 and 2019 fig 2 shows that the average cl concentration and seawater intrusion area appear to respond to pumping 3 division of groundwater flow system the division of flow systems in the study area is based on the three following rules 1 the combination of geological topographical and hydrodynamic conditions determines the formation and development of the groundwater flow system 2 the boundary of the groundwater flow system is formed where the surface watershed consists of aquifuge or aquitard stratum 3 permeable strata such as the limestone stratum can also form groundwater flow system boundaries with positive surface topography and under favorable tectonic such as anticlinal ridges and meteorological abundant precipitation conditions overall the terrain in the study area is high in the east low in the west and inclined towards the northwest fig 1 the northern and southern parts of the study area contain ridge lines with high terrain in miao mountain qiding mountain daziying mqd and dongtianjiafang respectively as the dip angle of the stratum is steep the condition is conducive to the formation of surface watersheds fig 3 the stratum outcrops of the mqd anticline include cambrian anticline limestone and sinian shale and marlstone that form the boundary of the groundwater flow system with weak permeability the development of strata in dongtianjiafang includes cambrian limestone shale and siltstone although the permeable limestone serves as the primary strata from the high topography formed by the anticline in the mountain area additional atmospheric precipitation is the primary groundwater recharge source of the groundwater creating a confining boundary in the groundwater flow system fig 3 widely distributed archaeozoic metamorphic rocks constitute the eastern groundwater boundary groundwater elevation contours were drawn according to the measured water table fig 3 fig 3 shows that the flow direction significantly changes throughout the study area however groundwater generally flows from east to west in the north mqd area groundwater flows from south or southeast to north or northwest in the area between mqd and dongtianjiafang groundwater generally flows from southeast to northwest the groundwater flow directions near the common boundary of different groundwater flow systems change significantly in the southern area groundwater flows from northeast to southwest with a short flow path figs 3 and 4 show the divisions of the three different groundwater flow systems a combination of topographic geological and hydrodynamic conditions groundwater flow system i si is distributed in the area north of mqd groundwater flow system ii sii is located in the daweijia area and groundwater flow system iii siii lies in the southern offshore area 4 hydrochemistry characteristics of groundwater flow systems a field investigation was conducted during august 2019 and the water samples were collected a total of 34 groundwater samples were obtained from irrigation and domestic supply wells in the carbonate aquifer one of which is an exposed spring water outcrop of the carbonate aquifer a groundwater sample from the quaternary aquifer and a seawater sample were also collected fig 3 all water samples were analyzed at the ministry of land and resources mlr changchun mineral resources supervision and test center the chemical composition of the collected samples in the coastal aquifer is displayed in table 1 the ph of groundwater from carbonate aquifer ranges from 7 02 to 7 70 with a average of 7 38 while the seawater sample is 7 67 and there is no significant difference were observed in ph between groundwater and seawater total dissolved solids tds are a basic measure of water quality groundwater samples were divided into fresh water tds 1 g l brackish water 1 g l tds 3 g l salt water 3 g l tds 10 g l saline water 10 g l tds 50 g l and brine 50 g l tds according to tds ranges handbook of hydrogeology 2012 in this study groundwater samples were divided into fresh and brackish 4 1 evolution of the hydrochemical types of the groundwater flow systems the groundwater chemical variability of the flow systems is illustrated in the piper diagram fig 5 and the hydrochemical facies evolution diagram fig 6 in si a clear evolution from the low salinity hco3 ca type in the recharge water sc38 to the mixed cl type with increased salinity is observed fig 5 sample sc32 which is enriched in cl and na was collected near the sea and shows direct seawater intrusion impact fig 6 groundwater samples from sii have a larger variation interval than si samples and evolved from the low salinity hco3 ca mg hco3 cl ca type to the cl hco3 ca and cl na ca type with increased salinity all the brackish water samples are located in the field associated with the intrusion phase fig 6 the spring water ss09 presents the cl na ca type which represents a carbonate outcrop close to groundwater and is more affected by seawater intrusion fig 6 additional differences are observed at the sc33 boundary of sii which contains so4 cl type groundwater fig 5 no significant differences are observed for siii which shows hco3 and cl types higher na and cl contents are observed in the quaternary aquifer sample sq13 indicating seawater intrusion impacts different groundwater hydrochemical types partially indicate the extent to which they are affected by seawater intrusion the evolutionary processes of the three groundwater flow systems are generally similar and are identified by inland distal intrusion facies ca mixhco3 which evolves to sub stage of ca mixcl and mixca cl transitions through sub stages of mixna cl and finally becomes na cl which represents the final mixture and tendency of the water components toward seawater fig 6 the spatial distribution and evolution of groundwater hydrochemical types in the three groundwater flow systems are also generally consistent local differences were caused by hydrogeological conditions and human activity fig 2 almost all hco3 type groundwater with low salinity is located in the eastern recharge area and changes to cl type in the western area near the sea in the recharge area groundwater is recharged by precipitation and eastern bedrock fissure water its hydrochemistry type primarily depends on dissolution and filtration in the aquifer hydrochemical facies change to cl hco3 type along the flow path which is the residual effect of previous saline intrusion and the dominant hydrochemical factor in the area near the sea groundwater presents a cl na type with high salinity indicating seawater intrusion and mixing with seawater the hydrochemistry type change is dominated by cl and na additionally special groundwater hydrochemical types occurred in the dalianpao daziying area of sii the groundwater samples are enriched in nitrate with a special no3 type in this area fig 2 according to the field investigation the study area contains many orchards and farmlands the water sources surrounded by orchards and farmlands that nitrogen fertilizers are easily released from agricultural soils to the aquifers which can explain the high no3 concentrations observed in groundwater compared to other nitrogenous species such as nh4 and no2 the concentration of nitrate in most samples is higher indicating a dominant process of nitrification mahlknecht et al 2017 eliapenda and alfred 2016 sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 further the nitrate source and the relationship between no3 and so4 2 is detected when sulfate provided by the theoretical mixing with seawater is removed to confirm this process the difference in concentration δn between the observed values and those expected if mixing with seawater was obtained through the following mixing equation pennisi et al 2006 1 δ n x n x n x f r e s h n cl s n cl f r e s h n x s e a n cl s e a where nx s nx fresh nx sea refer to the concentration of component x in the sample s fresh groundwater fresh and seawater sea fig 6 shows a positive relationship between δso4 2 and δno3 except for special samples sc21 22 23 and 24 the increase in no3 and so4 2 reveals that the application of fertilizers is a major source of nitrate nakano et al 2008 menció et al 2016 the no3 type sc21 22 23 and 24 samples show these characteristics fig 7 and prove that the increase in no3 and so4 2 concentration is caused by the application of sulfate and nitrate fertilizers in agriculture additionally the sc14 15 33 and 34 samples with high so4 2 concentrations greater than300 mg l show different features fig 7 which are more likely attributed to seawater intrusion rather than to agricultural fertilizers fig 6 4 2 indicative components of groundwater flow system variation in the context of seawater intrusion cl and tds are the signature components that indicate the process and degree of seawater intrusion a classification for groundwater based on tds is given in fig 8 tds concentrations of fresh and brackish water in si are 591 968 and 1108 2112 mg l respectively tds concentrations of fresh and brackish water in sii are 401 976 and 1023 2036 mg l respectively the tds concentrations of fresh and brackish water samples in siii are 438 953 and 2740 mg l respectively all brackish water samples are observed in wells near coastal areas and are distributed in strips parallel to the coast fig 8 shows that tds and cl concentrations in the coastal area vary significantly with distance from the coast in si sii and siii samples with low tds and cl concentration are generally located far from the coast whereas samples with higher tds and cl concentration are located near the coast based on these observations seawater intrusion is found 1 3 2 8 km inland as evidenced by cl 250 mg l and tds 1000 mg l in si and sii respectively the distance of seawater intrusion in siii is shorter approximately 1 1 km than in si and sii however siii presents the highest observed tds and cl concentrations of 2740 and 1034 mg l respectively the distance of seawater invasion is generally the longest in sii whereas the groundwater is more influenced by seawater intrusion in siii the groundwater salinization of sii which used to supply dalian city as the daweijia groundwater source is analyzed in detail the sc15 and 16 samples have a relatively high eigenvalue of tds and cl however these samples are farther from the coastline than samples ss09 sc10 18 and 34 fig 8 thus the preferential flow paths in fault zones may be the major factor and could also be caused by the special structure of semi enclosed pocket space likely formed by karst heterogeneity the tds and cl of sii were compared with those reported by han et al 2015 who measured the values of tds and cl of 11 14 and 15 samples investigated from carbonate aquifers in 2008 2009 and 2010 respectively in xiaolianpao daweijia lianfeng fig 3 of sii the result shows that the average concentration of tds and cl in 2019 decreased fig 9 however the concentration of tds and cl are close to or exceed the salinization limit tds 1000 mg l cl 250 mg l despite many years of groundwater abstraction restrictions by the local government in this case the dual porosity medium of karst fissure and pipelines may be the primary factor causing continuous groundwater salinization in a developed structural fracture zone fig 1 mixed seawater in stagnant zones semi enclosed pocket space of the aquifer has almost zero velocity once seawater entered the stagnant zones of the aquifer it will persist much longer and the solute dispersion with the water outside the stagnant zone will continue this process will last a long time and affect the hydrochemical composition of the surrounding groundwater it indicates that groundwater salinization is a lasting process in heterogeneous carbonate aquifers 4 3 major hydrochemical and hydrogeochemical action on groundwater chemical characters chloride is a conservative tracer of water salinization as it is not significantly affected by sorption processes of biological transformations mahlknecht et al 2017 in this sense the relationships between na mg2 ca2 so4 2 and cl are shown in fig 10 logarithmic coordinates are used for analysis and the units are meq l the analysis assessed the hydrochemical processes occurring in aquifers in the study area the na exhibits a positive correlation with cl content and the values of the na cl relationship are close to the line of mixing with seawater in si and siii which is expected for the dissolution of halite and or a conservative mixture of freshwater seawater fig 10a na cl values are generally lower in salinity enriched samples in sii than in si and clearly plot below the seawater mixing line for most of the brackish water fig 10a suggesting that na removing processes occur in sii reverse cation exchange between na and ca2 has been reported in other aquifers affected by seawater intrusion cary et al 2015 the quantity of ca2 in brackish water samples of sii also indicates a supplementary source of cation exchange processes fig 10b whereas the positive relationship between ca2 and cl close to the seawater mixing is line observed in si and siii fig 10b additionally in the scatter plot na k cl vs ca2 mg2 alkalinity so4 2 fig 11 a linear relationship of the groundwater slope close to 1 in sii suggests the participation of na and ca2 in reverse exchange reactions the relationships between mg2 and cl and so4 2 and cl of groundwater in si sii and siii fig 10c 10d show a significantly positive correlation indicating that mg2 and so4 2 in groundwater originate from the dissolution of evaporates additionally higher salinity mg2 and so4 2 evolution is closer to the line of seawater mixing in si sii and siii fig 10c d thus seawater intrusion also contributes to the mg2 and so4 2 however the sc33 sample presents more magnesium than would be expected from seawater contribution in sii fig 10d compared to the seawater mixing and fertilizers input fig 7 the excess so4 2 of sc33 might be attributed to evaporate dissolution fig 10d and explain the so4 cl ca mg type water observed in sample sc33 fig 5 5 aquifer recharge assessment and mixing process in different groundwater flow systems 5 1 groundwater origin and recharge the isotopic composition of groundwater and seawater samples is summarized in table 1 the global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl δd 5 57δ18o 11 4 were obtained from rainwater data sampled at the jinzhou weather station the nearest observation station to daweijia which represents the coastal climate yang 2011 in the si aquifer the δ18o and δd values range from 8 7 to 6 5 and 57 3 to 47 1 respectively and are distributed near the lmwl fig 12 lower than those of the local seawater sample δ18o 1 5 δd 9 8 the results show that groundwater in si is primarily derived from local atmospheric precipitation the δ18o 2 1 to 5 5 and δd 57 3 to 37 3 values of groundwater in sii are more dispersed than in si and are closer to those of gmwl except for ss09 sc10 and sc11 the slope of the local groundwater line lgwl in sii is smaller than that of si and the lmwl indicating sii groundwater is primarily derived from the rainfall infiltration with varying degrees of evaporation the groundwater runoff path of the groundwater flow system is the longest in the study area additionally the ss09 sc10 and sc11 samples from sii are particularly enriched in δ18o compared to the other groundwater samples and deviate significantly from the lmwl fig 12 the ss09 sc10 and sc11 samples were collected from exposed carbonate strata and coincide with the approximate location of the groundwater flow system boundary fig 2 moreover these samples are brackish water which accelerates the dissolution of carbonate with increasing salinity slow circulation speed and amount near the boundary of the groundwater flow system allow the groundwater to stay in the aquifer for sufficient time which is also helpful for water rock interaction in this case enriched δ18o values are attributed to the isotope exchange effect between groundwater and the carbonate reservoir which has little impact on the δd value wang 1991 the spring water ss09 drains from carbonate rocks across a relatively large outcrop suggesting that the evaporation of δ18o and δd is a principal factor in the siii aquifer the δ18o 8 6 to 7 8 and δd 55 2 to 50 9 values of groundwater are more concentrated than that in si and sii and all values are distributed closer to the gmwl the groundwater in siii is primarily derived from rapid infiltration after local precipitation the shortest runoff path is near the sea the local seawater sample sw35 is closer to the gmwl and displays more stable and enriched values fig 12 the composition of δ18o and δd between fresh and brackish water is not generally obvious from examining the lines in the scatter diagram fig 12 and does not tend to transition towards local seawater 5 2 mixing model and process in intrusion impact area the relative contributions of freshwater and seawater to the mixed samples are estimated using two end members based on the mass balance mixing model mixing lines between two end member samples for the hydrochemical indicator are calculated and plotted based on 2 c m c f x c b s 1 x where x is the mixing fraction of freshwater cm is the ion concentration of the mixture sample cf is the ion concentration of freshwater and cb s is the ion concentration of seawater han et al 2014 the chloride content is plotted against δ18o composition in fig 13 to differentiate the mixing trajectory and contribution for the different waters cary et al 2015 most of the groundwater samples appear to generally fit the seawater fresh groundwater mixing trajectory in si si and siii however clear differences are found among the groundwater flow systems in si the largest seawater mixing proportion is approximately 5 of the mixed waters fig 13 in the areas of seawater water intrusion cl and na concentrations increase significantly from fresh to brackish water the hydrochemistry presents characteristics of hco3 ca mg freshwater cl hco3 ca freshwater and cl na ca brackish water fig 6 the lack of correlation between δ18o and cl in fresh groundwater may reflect the complexity of groundwater recharge and flow paths in si lateral recharge from the eastern mountain area and south groundwater boundary and infiltration recharge from atmospheric precipitation itis a simple intrusion process from seawater to fresh water in si the seawater intrusion presents a ribbonlike intrusion model fig 14 a the patterns in sii are more complex the cl concentration of brackish water sample is high and the δ18o value is randomly distributed likely reflecting the complex groundwater dynamic field fig 3 and hydrogeochemistry processes the seawater mixing proportions are generally estimated to be 5 of the mixed waters fig 13 sii shows intrusion processes in sc33 and 34 and in sc18 20 19 and 21 and lateral recharge from the mountain area on the boundary of the system the influence of seawater intrusion is relatively small intrusion also occurs in sc08 15 and 16 and a freshening process is detected in sc05 06 and 07 fig 14b the seawater intrusion presents a ribbonlike intrusion model and the influence of intrusion in sii is more serious than that in si during intrusion the mixing between cl hco3 ca type groundwater fresh water of sc07 and cl na ca type saline water north of sc08 16 and leads to increase in the cl and na concentration fig 14b additionally the high δ18o values observed in brackish samples ss09 sc10 and sc11 with relatively low cl contents fig 3 show that these samples are not the simple products of mixing freshwater and seawater but are probably due to water rock interaction and evaporation the groundwater samples in siii appear to fit the seawater fresh groundwater mixing trajectory better than those of si and sii the largest seawater mixing proportion is estimated to be slightly more than 5 of the mixed waters fig 13 the cl concentrations of samples sc01 02 and 03 increase as the δ18o value of increasing proportions of seawater increases fig 13 which is consistent with gradual mixing between the two end members in the regional groundwater flow direction fig 3 this suggests a classic seawater intrusion model further the influence of seawater intrusion in quaternary groundwater sq14 is less serious than that in carbonate groundwater sc14 6 conclusions the hydrogeochemistry evolution of coastal karst groundwater is a very complicated process due to the variety of geological topographical and hydrodynamic conditions analyses of hydrogeochemistry characteristics must be combined with groundwater flow systems significant differences are found among three flow systems that depend on differences in runoff path recharge source and degree of the impact of seawater intrusion additionally human activities are an important impact factor in hydrogeochemical evolution according to combination of geological topographical and hydrodynamic conditions the groundwater flow system in the daweijia area is divided into three groundwater flow systems si sii and siii the spatial distribution of the groundwater hydrochemical types in the three flow systems is generally homologous and local differences are caused by hydrogeological conditions and human activities almost all the groundwater hco3 type with low salinity is located in the eastern recharge area and changes to cl type in the western area near the sea this hydrochemical change fully reflects seawater intrusion isotopic results reveal that the groundwater is primarily derived from the combination of the local atmospheric precipitation and lateral recharge from boundary of the systems hydrochemical evolution in si is controlled by lateral recharge dissolution of evaporates and seawater intrusion the hydrochemistry presents characteristics of hco3 ca mg freshwater cl hco3 ca freshwater and cl na ca brackish water along the runoff path seawater intrusion is found 1 3 km inland and the largest seawater mixing proportion is approximately 5 hydrochemical data reveal that the hydrochemistry evolution in sii is more complex the local groundwater samples are enriched in nitrate with a special no3 type which is influenced by human activities the occurrence of reverse cation exchange results in a na removing process in brackish water the hydrochemical composition of freshwater is controlled by dissolution of evaporates whereas coastal brackish water undergoes more pronounced seawater intrusion furthermore the isotopic composition is influenced by water rock exchange and evaporation under the complex geological structural background which is different from that of si and siii the hfe diagram and the mixing model reveal intrusion and freshening processes in sii seawater intrusion is found 2 8 km inland the degree of seawater intrusion is lower than before with a seawater mixing proportion of 5 hydrochemistry evolution in siii is influenced by seawater intrusion local precipitation and a short local runoff path a classic seawater intrusion model is present in siii with significant changes in cl and na concentration in the transitional zone between seawater and freshwater the degree of seawater intrusion in siii is more serious than that in si and sii however the inland extent of seawater intrusion is only 1 1 km seawater intrusion is currently effectively controlled through relevant government policies and reduced local groundwater exploitation however human activities such as irrigation and fertilization are potential impact factors for hydrochemical evolution in the study area the groundwater quality demonstrates a deterioration along the flow path thus strictly controlling agricultural fertilization and water use activities is necessary to prevent groundwater pollution and quality degradation in the area for example consider changes in anthropogenic land use patterns to reduce the use of fertilizer and promote clean agricultural reduce the use of inorganic fertilizers and increase the use of organic fertilizers and restrict individual groundwater pumping or changing the irrigation mode for irrigation in the seawater intrusion area also future studies will focus on the interactions with surface water and seawater and more detailed understanding of groundwater vulnerability and pollution risk assessment so as to establish their pathways before groundwater quality protection measures and integrated management of karst aquifers can be applied funding this research did not receive any specific grant from

4293,karst water in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates is the ecological resources and domestic water in the huainan coalfield anhui province china but it also directly threatens the safe production of coal mines due to the development of paleokarst and karst collapse columns kccs most of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in northern china experienced multistage tectonic movements and were affected by multi type corrosive fluids but very few studies focused on the effect of multistage fluid rock reaction on the formation of paleokarst and kccs to investigate the formation mechanisms and characteristics of paleokarst and kccs this study integrated petrographic studies isotope geochemistry c and o and minor elements ba mn and sr and clarified the sources and types of corrosive fluids through this study meteoric water formation water hydrothermal fluids and mixing fluids were determined as the four main types of corrosive fluids that formed pores vugs fractures caves and kccs in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates the meteoric dissolution is controlled by carbonic acid solution recharge conditions which affect the karst development in the cambrian and ordovician paleoweathering crusts and local carbonate outcrops hydrothermal fluids with high temperature high pressure and high corrosivity can develop a strong hydrothermal pore fracture system in the cambrian carbonate which is the reason that kccs can develop in the cambrian strata in the huainan coalfield the mixing dissolution is controlled by sulfuric acid dissolution and usually occurs in the water tables and the fault and fracture zones which are conducive to the development of caves and kccs in addition to the above four corrosive fluids the development of paleokarst and kccs in the huainan area is also controlled by stratigraphic lithology and geological structures especially for faults and fractures which are the main migration channels of corrosive fluids an evolution model of paleokarst and kccs was established providing a plausible interpretation for better understanding of the spatial distribution of paleokarst and kccs in practice this study provides critical references for predicting the spatial distribution of paleokarst and kccs in northern china coalfields as well as the exploration and development of karst water around the world keywords carbonate corrosive fluids faults meteoric water hydrothermal fluids mixing dissolution 1 introduction carbonate rocks are important reservoirs of oil gas and water which provide 60 of oil and gas outputs and about 20 of drinking water in the world bai 2006 liang et al 2018 liu et al 2017c sun et al 2019 in china karst water in carbonate rocks is an important water resource which accounts for more than 25 of domestic water supply but it also directly threatens the safe production of more than 80 of coal mines in china due to the development of paleokarst and karst collapse columns kccs liang et al 2018 yin et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a kccs are widespread in northern china and the total number of kccs has exceeded 10 000 including 8500 kccs in shanxi province 1200 kccs in hebei province and 300 kccs in other provinces yin et al 2019 since the 1970s there have been 22 accidents of groundwater inrush induced by kccs resulting in economic losses and casualties yin et al 2019 the huainan coalfield with a total area of 2500 km2 is one of the five largest coalfields in northern china zhang et al 2019a the karst water in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield is not only the ecological resources and domestic water supply sources but it also seriously affects the safety production of coal mines in this region for instance from 1970 to 2018 there have been 268 major accidents of karst water inrush in the huainan coalfield zhang et al 2019b with a maximum water inrush flow of 14 520 m3 hr induced by kcc in 2017 gan 2018 given the abundant coal reserves 4 44 108 metric tons in the huainan coalfield it is essential to understand the formation mechanisms and controlling factors of the paleokarst and kccs in middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates which would provide a critical reference for accurately predicting their spatial distribution kccs are a peculiar geological structure in northern china and belong to the category of paleokarst whose roots are usually developed in the ordovician with a small percentage of roots also developed in the cambrian kccs usually develop upward from their roots passing through the carboniferous permian triassic strata and even into the jurassic cretaceous and quaternary loose strata he et al 2005 2009 thus their formation and evolution processes are closely related to the carbonate paleokarst processes previous studies deemed that the formation of paleokarst was closely related to the dissolution of meteoric water and groundwater passed through paleoweathering crusts and fault fracture systems and the formation of kccs is the result of dissolution and collapse of the ordovician carbonate rocks by flowing water he et al 2009 lu et al 2013 sweeting 1995 yin et al 2019 zuo et al 2009 several genesis theories about the ordovician kccs have been put forward such as theory of karst cave formation due to vacuum ablation collapse xu and zhao 1981 theory of formation under gravity collapse shi et al 1998 theory of formation under gypsum dissolution collapse qian 1988 and theory of formation due to groundwater cycle wang et al 2007 however all these theories ignored a fact that the cambrian and ordovician carbonates in china mostly experienced multistage tectonic uplifts subsidence and magmatic activities and developed a multistage multi genesis and multi type of paleokarst cai et al 2008 han et al 2016 jiang et al 2015 liu et al 2017a lu et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 which was caused by meteoric water dissolution and groundwater dissolution as well as organic acids dissolution cai et al 2008 mazzullo and harris 1992 and or hydrothermal fluids dissolution corbella et al 2004 dai et al 2013 teng et al 2020 zhu et al 2015 unfortunately much less attention has been paid to the effect of multistage fluid rock reactions on the formation of paleokarst and kccs in northern china coalfield moreover more than 99 of 10 000 kccs in northern china coalfield were in the ordovician strata yin et al 2019 and some kccs in the huainan coalfield were developed in the cambrian strata zuo et al 2009 the origin of cambrian kccs has been an enigma to geologists for many years because the cambrian strata in northern china usually contain dolomites and dolomitic limestones which are thought to be more difficult to dissolve than the typical ordovician limestones he et al 2009 lu et al 2013 zuo et al 2009 diagenetic fluids corrosive fluids responsible for the generation of fillings in pores fractures and caves usually also have an important effect on the alteration of carbonate rocks chen et al 2004 davies and smith 2006 lonnee and machel 2006 among various methods used for the interpretation of sedimentary diagenetic conditions and environments the carbon and oxygen isotope analysis on the carbonate matrix and karst fillings has been widely employed bai et al 2018 maheshwari et al 1999 oehlert and swart 2014 zhang et al 2018 carbon and oxygen isotopes can provide an important basis for the analysis of issues such as paleoenvironment paleoclimate and origin of carbon and oxygen isotopes han et al 2019 lachniet 2009 zhang et al 2016a 2016b thus have been widely used to trace the fluid origin and flow pathways and to identify the formation environment and processes of paleokarst armstrong altrin et al 2009 budd and land 1990 zhang et al 2021 several studies showed that stable isotope analysis combined with regional geological structure evolution can better clarify corrosive fluids sources and dissolution mechanisms han et al 2019 phillipson 2005 zhang et al 2016a zhu et al 2015 in this study detailed macroscopic and microscopic thin section petrographic observations and isotope geochemistry c and o and minor elements ba mn and sr were carried out on the cored samples and outcrop data from the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield this paper aims to 1 describe the paleokarst and kccs characteristics of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield 2 determine the sources and types of fluids that have altered the carbonate rocks 3 clarify the formation mechanisms and controlling factors for paleokarst and kccs 4 establish an evolution model of the paleokarst and kccs of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates to predict their spatial distribution in the huainan coalfield 2 geological setting 2 1 study area the huainan coalfield chosen as the study area fig 1 a covers a total area of 2500 km2 and is located on the southeast margin of the northern china plate zhang et al 2019a three tectonic units were formed in the huainan coalfield affected by multistage tectonic movements since the middle triassic zhan et al 2017 and they include a gravity slip structure belt in the north a thrust nappe structural belt in the south and a compound syncline tectonic belt in the middle fig 1a in the east part of the study area the shungeng mountain and bagong mountain outcrops expose the entire cambrian and ordovician stratigraphic sections fig 1a while the rest of the study area is covered by the cenozoic strata with a thickness ranging from 80 to 920 m fig 1b like other coal mines in northern china the huainan coalfield mainly exploits carboniferous permian coal measures strata currently there are 14 coal mines being mined in the huainan coalfield namely the panyi pan er pansan panbei zhuji dingji guqiao gubei zhangji xieqiao liuzhuang kouzi banji and yangcun coal mines fig 1a 2 2 depositional setting and stratigraphy during the cambrian and ordovician periods the huainan region was situated at a low latitude close to the equator with a high temperature rainy climate lin 2009 from the early cambrian the progressive transgression builds up a shallow carbonate platform in this region with huge carbonate deposits up to 1000 m thick li et al 1998 the carbonate platform was rimmed from the early cambrian to the early late cambrian which evolved into a silicified evaporation platform system during the late late cambrian li et al 1998 lin 2009 owning to the occurrence of the huaiyuan movement at the end of the cambrian the northern china platform experienced an overall uplift causing the cambrian strata in the huainan region to expose to the land surface with a duration of about 47 ma lin 2009 with the transgression in the early ordovician the study area once again entered into a marine tidal flat sedimentary environment lu et al 1994 yu and meng 1995 this long term transgression culminated in the late early ordovician in the huainan region and was followed by regression accordingly the carbonate depositional system gradually entered a long term weathering and erosion system near the end of the early middle ordovician lasting about 120 ma xiao et al 2019 this study concentrates on the middle cambrian to the lower ordovician carbonate strata including the maozhuang xuzhuang and zhangxia formations of the middle cambrian the gushan and tuba formations of the upper cambrian and the jiawang xiaoxian and majiagou formations of the lower ordovician in ascending order fig 2 the maozhuang xuzhuang and zhangxia formations of the middle cambrian almost completely consist of limestones including dolomitic limestones leopard limestones oolitic limestones and pisolitic limestones with a total thickness of close to 600 m the maozhuang formation conformably overlies the mantou formation of the lower cambrian and the zhangxia formation conformably underlies the gushan formation of the upper cambrian fig 2 in contrast the gushan and tuba formations of the upper cambrian are dominated by dolomites e g dolomites siliceous dolomites and argillaceous dolomites intercalated with minor argillaceous limestones with a total thickness of more than 200 m the tuba formation is unconformably overlaid by the jiawang formation of the lower ordovician fig 2 the jiawang formation is at the bottom of the lower ordovician and is composed of thin shales with an average thickness of 10 m the xiaoxian formation is at the middle of the lower ordovician and is primarily composed of thin to medium thick dolomitic limestones and breccia limestones with an average thickness of 70 m the majiagou formation is at the top of the lower ordovician and is mainly composed of dolomites and minor dolomitic limestones with an average thickness of 70 m fig 2 upwards the carboniferous benxi formation unconformably overlies the majiagou formation and features a dominance of aluminum mudstones with an average thickness of 20 m further upward one can observe the carboniferous taiyuan formation and permian coal measure strata which are mainly composed of coal seams mudstones sandstones and minor thin layer limestones 2 3 burial history and tectonic evolution the buried history of the successions of the middle cambrian to the lower ordovician in the huainan area is shown in fig 3 this diagram shows that the middle cambrian to the lower ordovician carbonates experienced three significant uplifts during burial the first episode of uplift occurred in relation to the early caledonian movement during the late cambrian to the early ordovician with a duration of about 47 ma forming the cambrian paleoweathering crust lin 2009 the second episode in association with the middle late caledonian movement during the middle ordovician to middle carboniferous with a duration of about 120 ma forming the ordovician paleoweathering crust xiao et al 2019 the third one linked to the yanshan movement during the middle jurassic to the late cretaceous with an erosion thickness of more than 2000 m and a duration of about 130 ma li et al 2002 causing the cambrian ordovician strata in the panji and chenqiao anticlines in the study area suffering from weathering and erosion again and eventually being exposed to land surface zhan et al 2017 many deep faults and folds fig 1a and b in the huainan region were developed due to multistage tectonic activities during the indochina and yanshan movements shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 the indochina movement caused north south compression in the study area forming a north south thrust nappe structure the yanshan movement not only revived the early faults but also produced many nne and nnw direction tensile and torsional faults accompanied by multiple phases of magmatic and volcanic activities shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 according to the statistics of gao 2018 three are 718 main faults and 10 main folds developed in the huainan coalfield in which 74 are normal faults among these faults there are 36 faults with a drop of more than 300 m 251 faults with a drop of 300 to100 m and 431 faults with a drop of 100 to 20 m from the late triassic to the early cretaceous the huainan region mainly experienced three periods of magmatic activities the first magmatic activity occurred at 240 ma the late triassic and lasted for 60 120 ma the second magmatic activity occurred at 140 ma the middle jurassic and lasted for 20 60 ma and the third magmatic activity occurred at 120 ma the early cretaceous and lasted for 120 160 ma li et al 2002 zhang et al 2005 a large area of magmatic intrusive rocks was found in the permian coal seams of dingji coal mine pansan coal mine and zhuji coal mine in the huainan coalfield fig 1a chen et al 2017 ding et al 2018 xu et al 2004 showed that the volcanic activity taking place in the early cretaceous was the most intense and its intrusion time was about 115 130 ma based on u pb isotopic dating of zircon grains from diabase 3 materials and methods approximately 60 borehole wells penetrated the lower ordovician and 30 borehole wells penetrated the middle cambrian lower ordovician in the huainan coalfield these wells are distributed across the entire study area and provide a solid foundation for the present study mainly in the form of cores and drilling data in this study the observation and test data from the cambrian and ordovician carbonate outcrops shungeng mountain and bagong mountain see in fig 1a seven discovered kccs fig 1a and six representative wells wells t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 and t6 and wells t2 t3 and t5 are located in kccs 2 3 and 6 respectively see fig 1a with a total core length of 2365 74 m were selected for detailed analysis these core samples are primarily composed of carbonate matrix cm and calcite fillings cfs while these cfs mainly come from pores vugs fractures caves and kccs ninety two samples

mineralogy based on observations of field outcrops and drilling cores the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield is mainly composed of limestones with minor dolomites the limestones mainly including dolomitic limestones fig 4 a breccia limestones fig 4b leopard limestones fig 4f oolitic limestones fig 4c and g and pisolitic limestones are commonly developed in the maozhuang xuzhuang and zhangxia formations of the middle cambrian and the xiaoxian formation of the lower ordovician fig 2 the dolomites mainly including dolomites argillaceous dolomites fig 4d and siliceous dolomites fig 4e are usually developed in the gushan and tuba formations of the upper cambrian and the majiagou formation of the lower ordovician fig 2 based on observations of thin sections the matrix limestones are mainly composed of micro to fine medium to medium coarse crystalline limestones and the calcite contents range from 50 to 80 the matrix dolomites are primarily composed of fine to fine medium to medium crystalline dolomites and the dolomite contents range from 60 to 80 the dolomitic limestones are dominated by micro to medium fine crystal calcites fig s1e containing a large number of micro and fine crystalline dolomite and the calcite contents exceed 60 the breccia limestones are mainly composed of fine to medium coarse crystal calcites fig s1d cemented by carbonate breccias the calcite contents in the breccia limestones vary widely ranging from 50 to 80 the leopard limestones are mainly composed of fine crystal calcites with a calcite content exceeding 50 and contain a large number of micro to fine crystalline dolomite plaques appearing leopard skin the oolitic limestones contain a lot of oolitic particles with a content of more than 50 and the particle size ranges from 0 2 mm to 2 0 mm fig s1c the difference between pisolitic limestones and oolitic limestones is that the particle size of the pisolitic particle is larger than that of oolitic particle and the diameter of the pisolitic particle is commonly greater than 2 0 mm the calcite contents of oolitic and pisolitic limestones are both greater than 50 the dolomites are dominated by fine to medium fine crystal dolomites fig s1b and the dolomite contents are more than 80 the argillaceous dolomites are composed of micro crystal dolomites with

fig s1f with a dolomite content of more than 70 and contain some siliceous bands when the dolomites in the siliceous dolomites are weathered and eroded the remaining siliceous appears as a honeycomb structure 4 2 paleokarst types and characteristics the main types of paleokarst in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield are pores vugs fractures caves and kccs 4 2 1 pores and vugs the pores and vugs are both products of dissolution pores but the vugs have a larger size than pores microscopically the dissolution pores are irregular pores with a diameter of 1 2 mm and are usually full filled with calcites fig 5 a and b or organic matters fig 5d or pyrites or hydrothermal minerals e g quartz flint pyroclastics chalcedony etc fig 5g i macroscopically the vugs are alveolar shaped pores with a size between 5 and 20 mm in the shallow ordovician carbonate rocks vugs are usually full filled or semi filled with quartz or calcites fig 4a while in the deep cambrian carbonate rocks they are commonly unfilled fig 4d or are semi filled with quartz fig 4c the carbonate rocks with dense pores and vugs usually show honeycomb textures and they are generally distributed along fractures fig 4c 4 2 2 fractures the fractures can be divided into diagenetic fractures tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures according to their formation mechanisms diagenetic fractures are cracks during sedimentation and consolidation diagenesis han et al 2019 and their widths are generally at the micron scale such fractures are often irregularly networked and filled with calcites and or residual organic matters fig 5b d the tectonic fractures fig 5e and f are formed by region stress release during tectonic activities and most of the dissolution fractures fig 6 g are the products of tectonic fractures that were dissolved and altered by meteoric water and or groundwater and or hydrothermal fluids the opening aperture of these fractures ranges from a few millimeters to several hundred millimeters fig 5e g and the length ranges from tens of millimeters to several kilometers moreover fractures can also be divided into three types based on the occurrence vertical fractures high angle fractures and low angle fractures the vertical fractures and high angle fractures usually develop near the cambrian and ordovician paleoweathering crusts fig 6e and f faults folds and kccs and most of them are unfilled fig 5l or semi filled with calcites and or hydrothermal minerals fig 5e and f while low angle fractures such as stylolites fig 5d and bedding planes are usually full filled with calcites and or organic matters or hydrothermal minerals or muds fig 5c d g 4 2 3 caves the caves are primarily developed around the paleoweathering crusts faults anticlines and kccs and their sizes vary from a few centimeters to a dozen meters the carbonate outcrops and drilling cores both show that the cavity fillings and filling patterns are complicated and diversified caves in the paleoweathering crusts fig 6a d are generally developed within 30 m below the cambrian and ordovician unconformities which are usually semi filled and cemented by karst breccias and or gray green muds and or calcites according to long term exploration data another type of caves is usually found in the fault and fold zones and around kccs fig 1a and they are generally semi filled with broken surrounding rock breccias and calcites with weak cementation 4 2 4 kccs there are seven kccs found in the huainan coalfield and they are mainly distributed in the pan er pansan gubei zhangji xieqiao and liuzhuang coal mines as shown in fig 1a these kccs roots are developed in the middle cambrian kccs 3 7 or in the lower ordovician carbonate limestones kccs 1 2 and upward passing through the carboniferous and entering the permian strata as shown in fig 7 a three dimensional 3 d seismic exploration shows that the width of kccs in the huainan coalfield becomes progressively larger downward and their vertical height ranges from 187 56 m to 1369 54 m in a planar view most of kccs appear ellipse and the ratio of major axis to minor axis is generally from 1 2 1 to 3 1 however kcc 6 at the xieqiao coal mine is composed of three small kccs which appear as bead shaped in the planar view and hump in the cross sectional profile as shown in fig 7b in the cambrian and ordovician strata the columns of kccs are commonly filled with collapse breccias gigantic calcites pyrite and some hydrothermal minerals figs s2a b d e the breccias are formed by mechanical breaking after the surrounding rock of the cave collapsed the size of these breccias ranges from 1 mm to 300 mm with poor sorting but good roundness sub roundness indicating that these breccias experienced a long term dissolution of groundwater after they collapsed shukla and sharma 2018 the fractures and vugs between the breccia are partially filled and a large number of effective voids remain upward in the carboniferous and permian strata the stratification of rock strata in the columns of kccs are not well developed but the contact interface between the collapse column and the coal seam is clear fig s2f the voids among large blocks are usually filled with small blocks and muddy sand and cemented by calcites fig s2c in the surrounding rocks of kccs high angle fractures 50 85 are well developed which are usually unfilled or semi filled with calcites and or quartz or muds 4 3 geochemistry the carbon and oxygen isotopes and minor elements of 5 carbonate matrix cm including 2 ordovician carbonate matrix ocm and 3 cambrian carbonate matrix ccm and 29 calcite fillings cfs including 14 ordovician calcite fillings ocfs 9 cambrian calcite fillings ccfs and 6 kccs calcite fillings kcfs from the pores vugs fractures caves and kccs were measured the results are listed in table 1 4 3 1 carbon and oxygen isotopes the δ13cpdb values of ccm are higher than those of ocm and cfs the δ13c values of 3 ccm are positive table 1 while the δ13c values of 2 ocm and 29 cfs are all negative table 1 reflecting their different sedimentary and diagenetic environments lachniet 2009 zhang et al 2016a 2016b the δ13cpdb values of 29 cfs are 7 93 to 1 41 with an average of 2 86 table 1 the oxygen isotope values of cm are higher than those of cfs the δ18opdb values of cm are 6 03 to 4 92 with an average of 5 36 table 1 the δ18opdb values of cfs are 17 25 to 6 13 with an average of 11 17 table 1 in general the oxygen isotope is mainly related to water body salinity and environmental temperature during the formation periods of sediments while the carbon isotope is primarily affected by evaporation dynamic fractionation and early carbonate deposition lachniet 2009 zhang et al 2016a 2016b the δ18opdb values of cfs in table 1 are much smaller than those of cm suggesting that the formation of cfs might be affected by many factors such as water leaching and or temperature rising and or burial depth increasing and or hydrothermal activities maheshwari et al 1999 oehlert and swart 2014 zhang et al 2016a 2018 4 3 2 minor elements in this study three minor elements including ba mn and sr were tested and analyzed the minor elements ba mn and sr do not differ greatly in cm but they show significant differences in cfs fig 8 the concentrations of ba in cm are 258 87 ppm to 313 39 ppm with an average of 281 90 ppm table 1 while the concentrations of ba in cfs are 114 92 ppm to 491 18 ppm with an average of 320 12 ppm table 1 the concentrations of mn in cm are 30 40 ppm to 47 01 ppm with an average of 37 21 ppm table 1 while the concentrations of mn in cfs are 11 95 ppm to 338 10 ppm with an average of 153 67 ppm table 1 the concentrations of sr in cm are 66 46 ppm to 88 05 ppm with an average of 79 57 ppm table 1 while the concentrations of sr in cfs are 29 16 ppm to 143 98 ppm with an average of 88 40 ppm table 1 many previous researchers found that the high ba mn and sr concentrations in cfs might be related to hydrothermal fluids cai et al 2008 liu et al 2017b price et al 2013 while the low ba mn and sr concentrations in cfs might be related to long term leaching by meteoric water madukwe 2019 nowrouzi et al 2014 wei et al 2018 zhu et al 2015 therefore the significant changes of minor elements ba mn and sr in cfs fig 8 suggest that cfs might be formed in a complex and changeable environment 5 discussion 5 1 formation environments and sources of diagenetic fluids 5 1 1 paleosalinity and paleotemperature of diagenetic fluids the formation environments of diagenetic fluids corrosive fluids of cm and cfs are an important basis for identifying their sources and types and the carbon and oxygen isotopes are important geochemical tracers which could provide important information of the formation environments of various diagenetic fluids such as paleosalinity paleotemperature etc and determine the sources and types of diagenetic fluid arthur et al 1988 kuypers et al 1999 liu et al 2017a scholle and arthur 1980 zhang et al 2016a 2016b zhu et al 2015 keith and weber 1964 proposed an empirical formula for calculating paleosalinity z based on the values of δ13cpdb and δ18opdb isotopes which have been employed to distinguish between continental and marine sedimentary environments 1 z 2 048 δ 13 c pdb 50 0 498 δ 18 o pdb 50 when z 120 it is marine sediments and when z 120 it is freshwater sediments keith and weber 1964 when z is close to 120 the sediments may be affected by both marine water and freshwater keith and weber 1964 this empirical formula and criterion have been widely used worldwide jiang et al 2015 keith and weber 1964 yin 1991 zhang et al 2016b urey 1948 proposed a method for calculating the paleo ocean temperature t based on the values of δ18opdb isotope which was further elaborated by epstein et al 1953 shao et al 1996 corrected the time effect in the formula proposed by urey 1948 based on the history of geological evolution in china the improved formula proposed by shao et al 1996 has been widely used in china sun et al 2015 yang et al 2019 zhang 1985 so it was also employed in this study the improved formula for calculating the paleotemperature t is as follows 2 t 16 9 4 38 δ 18 o 2 8 0 1 δ 18 o 2 8 2 in summary the z and t values of cm and cfs in the paleokarst and kccs of the middle cambrian lower ordovician in the huainan coalfield can be calculated using equations 1 and 2 respectively and the results are shown in table 1 as seen in table 1 the z values of cm are greater than 120 and their t values range from 26 64 to 32 09 c indicating that they were formed in an open marine sedimentary environment guo et al 2016 qiu et al 2012 however the z and t values of cfs change greatly especially for t values ranging from 32 59 to 101 07 c indicating that the formation environments of cfs were extremely complex thus one probably should determine the sources and types of calcite diagenetic fluids before deciphering their dissolution mechanisms 5 1 2 sources and types of diagenetic fluids to accurately identify the sources and types of diagenetic fluids in the paleokarst and kccs of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield the hierarchical cluster analysis hca method was utilized based on the carbon and oxygen isotopes and minor elements ba mn and sr hca is one of the most widely applied cluster techniques in geochemical analysis which can classify similar observations into different groups to obtain a dendrogram cloutier et al 2008 zhang et al 2020a 2020b using the ward method and euclidean distance liu et al 2017a zhang et al 2019a 2020a 2020b hca yielded the optimum six groups based on the phenon line of 2 0 and the previous results of the cambrian and ordovician carbonate paleokarst in northern china xiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2016a 2016b 2018 the samples of each group are shown in figs 9 and 10 group i includes 3 ccm 2 ocm and 2 ocfs where the z values of 3 ccm and 2 ocm are more than 120 indicating that they both were formed in marine sedimentary environments but 2 ocm might be affected by meteoric water leaching during diagenesis because their δ13c values are negative zhang et al 2016a 2016b in this group the δ13c values of 2 ocfs are negative fig 10 the z values are close to 120 and the t values are close to 35 c indicating that they might be formed in a relatively open and near surface environment keith and weber 1964 thus group i may represent syngenetic karst and gypsum pore and salt pore fig 5a are the typical signs of syngenetic karst however due to the limited subaerial exposure areas in the syngenetic stage and the alteration in the diagenetic stage syngenetic karst was not developed in the huainan region group ⅱ includes 3 ccfs and group iii includes 5 ocfs both showing significant negative drifts of the δ13c and δ18o values fig 10 and sharp drops in concentrations of ba mn and sr fig 8 which are the typical characteristics of paleoweathering crust karst affected by long term meteoric water z 120 and t 43 c see table 1 zhang et al 2016a 2016b thus groups ⅱ and iii may represent the cambrian and ordovician paleoweathering crust karst respectively group ⅳ includes 1 ccfs and 3 ocfs where the δ13c values of 3 ocfs show a slightly positive drift while the δ18o values show a slightly negative drift fig 10 which is the typical characteristics of pressure released water karst li and cai 2017 zhang et al 2016a 2016b the concentrations of ba sr and mn in this group show significant increasing trends fig 8 suggesting that these minerals might come from the overlying coal bearing formation water during diagenetic compaction zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2015 moreover the z 120 and t 45 c in group ⅳ table 1 suggest that they might be formed in a closed and buried environment group ⅴ includes 2 ccfs 2 ocfs and 3 kccs where the δ18o values are all less than 15 fig 10 according to previous results cfs with the δ18o values of less than 15 cannot be formed in meteoric or groundwater environment below 50 c so cfs in group ⅴ are likely precipitated from deep hydrothermal fluids cai et al 2008 han et al 2019 price et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 which are also verified by high concentrations of ba mn and sr liu et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 according to han et al 2019 the hydrothermal fluids can be divided into low temperature 60 140 c medium temperature 140 170 c and high temperature 170 c fluids thus the hydrothermal fluids in the huainan coalfield belong to the low temperature fluids with a temperature between 91 and 101 c table 1 which are very close to the temperature of 110 c measured by apatite fission li et al 2002 group ⅵ includes 3 ccfs 2 ocfs and 3 kccs where the δ13c and δ18o values are all negative fig 10 and z 120 table 1 indicating that their formations might be affected by meteoric water the δ18o values are less than 11 and the t values are higher than 60 c 50 c in group ⅵ table 1 indicating that the formation of cfs in this group is also affected by hydrothermal fluids moreover groups ⅵ and ⅴ are further grouped together fig 9 and the concentrations of ba mn and sr in these two groups are very close to each other fig 8 indicating that the formation of cfs in group ⅵ could also be affected by formation water thus groups ⅵ may represent mixing karst formed by mixing dissolution of meteoric water formation water and hydrothermal fluids given that the regional geothermal gradient was 30 c km and the surface temperature was 25 c guo et al 2016 the formation temperatures and corresponding periods of each group of cfs were calculated and projected onto a burial history map fig 3 as seen in fig 3 group i may represent syngenetic karst formed by meteoric and marine dissolution during the carbonate sedimentary period but we did not consider them in this study because they are not developed in the huainan region group ⅱ may represent the cambrian paleoweathering crust karst formed by meteoric dissolution during the late cambrian to the early ordovician stage i group iii may represent the ordovician paleoweathering crust karst formed by meteoric dissolution during the middle ordovician to the middle carboniferous stage ⅱ group ⅳ may represent the pressure released water karst formed by formation water dissolution in the permian stage iii group ⅴ may represent the hydrothermal karst formed by hydrothermal dissolution during the early cretaceous stage ⅳ group ⅵ may represent the mixing karst formed by mixing dissolution of meteoric water formation water and hydrothermal fluids during the late cretaceous stage ⅴ six cfs samples from kccs no 25 26 27 32 33 34 see table 1 are all grouped into groups ⅴ and ⅵ figs 9 and 10 indicating that the formation of kccs in the huainan coalfield is closely related to hydrothermal dissolution and mixing dissolution 5 2 dissolution mechanisms of corrosive fluids 5 2 1 meteoric dissolution the meteoric dissolution of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield mainly took place in the cambrian paleo weathering crust stage stage i and the ordovician paleo weathering crust stage stage ⅱ in addition the ordovician and cambrian carbonate outcrops in the panji and chenqiao anticlines fig 1 were exposed to land surface again in the late cretaceous stage ⅴ and were subjected to secondary leaching by meteoric water in the fully exposed or partially exposed denudation area fig 13a and b the middle cambrian or and lower ordovician carbonate rocks were completely open and directly leached by atmospheric fresh water thus in these denudation areas many dissolution pores vugs and fractures were first formed and became the original migration channels of atmospheric fresh water carrying a large amount of co2 which enters the shallow carbonate strata although co2 was continuously consumed during the migration process co2 in meteoric water was continuously recharged through the fracture and pore systems thus air water rock reactions continued to move towards the direction of rock dissolution han et al 2019 as shown in equation 3 over time dissolution accelerated with increasing water flow the small dissolution pores vugs and fractures in the carbonate rocks gradually connected and expanded into caves forming paleoweathering crust karst as shown in fig 6a d 3 c a c o 3 c o 2 h 2 o c a 2 2 h c o 3 in the shallow and deep buried areas the carbonate rocks were semi closed and atmospheric fresh water could not directly contact the hidden carbonate rocks however faults and fractures were extensively developed during this period stage ⅴ see fig 13e and fresh water with dissolved co2 can flow to the deep semi closed system through the fault and fracture systems from the surface under the influence of gravity and then dissolve the hidden and buried carbonate rocks directly after mixing with other corrosive fluids e g formation water hydrothermal fluids ect as shown in fig 12 5 2 2 formation water dissolution formation water dissolution also known as pressure released water dissolution refers to some corrosive components generated from hydrocarbon generating formations under the diagenetic compaction occurred in stage iii which corroded and dissolved carbonate rocks li and cai 2017 ma and zhao 2016 mazzullo and harris 1992 pearce et al 2018 at the end of the middle carboniferous affected by the hercynian movement the northern china platform declined overall with accepting deposition yuan and yang 2015 covered by the carboniferous permian strata the cambrian and ordovician strata became a relatively deep closed environment driven by the pressure difference brines organic acid co2 h2s and ch4 produced by the diagenesis of organic matter and thermochemical sulfate reduction tsr of the permian carboniferous strata were continuously squeezed out as shown in fig 13c li and cai 2017 wu et al 2007 zhao et al 2009 these corrosive components penetrate the cambrian and ordovician carbonate rocks through pores vugs fractures and caves producing new pores and fractures where some residual organic matters still remain fig 5b d mazzullo and harris 1992 showed that the δ13c values of cfs formed by formation water from the carboniferous permian strata exhibited a positive drift which could be attributed to the decomposition and methanation ch4 of organic matter caused by methane bacteria the ch4 formed during biochemical processes equation 4 was rich in δ12c whereas the co2 had abundant δ13c mazzullo and harris 1992 zhang et al 2018 thus the sedimentary ocfs in group ⅳ are relatively enriched in δ 13 c showing a slight positive drift relative to ocm in group i fig 10 4 2 ch 2 o fermentation ch 4 co 2 5 2 3 hydrothermal dissolution from the middle triassic to the early cretaceous stage ⅳ multistage tectonic and magmatic activities occurred in the huainan coalfield li et al 2002 zhang et al 2005 which made the whole carbonate strata of the study area enter an intensive strong tectonic hydrothermal karst stage these tectonic and magmatic activities not only brought in the acidic substances with volatile components such as co2 h2s and so2 han et al 2019 directly producing corrosion to the surrounding carbonate rocks but also promoted thermochemical sulfate reduction tsr equation 5 indirectly strengthening the karstification zhu et al 2015 when these hydrothermal fluids with high temperature high pressure and high corrosivity invade upward through faults and fractures the temperature pressure and acidity conditions of the surrounding carbonate rocks changes rapidly resulting in the previously formed pores vugs and fractures being reformed and enlarged and producing new pores vugs and fractures forming a tree like hydrothermal pore fracture system guo et al 2016 as shown in fig 11 5 so 4 2 hydrocrbon organic matters h 2 s co 2 h 2 o as the hydrothermal fluids move from the deep to the shallow the fluid acidity gradually weakens and the calcium carbonate in the solution is gradually saturated and precipitated filling in the pores vugs and fractures han et al 2019 therefore close to the source of hydrothermal fluids the hydrothermal pore fracture system is well developed due to the unsaturation and strong corrosion of hydrothermal fluids fig 11 while in the direction away from the hydrothermal fluids as the hydrothermal fluid corrosion weakens the calcites and other minerals such as silica flint pyroclastics chalcedony etc are gradually saturated and precipitated in the hydrothermal pore fracture system fig 11 this may be the reason that most of the vugs and fractures formed by hydrothermal dissolution in the cambrian carbonate rocks in the study area are unfilled or semi filled fig 5j l while they are full filled with hydrothermal minerals in the ordovician carbonate rocks fig 5g i it is because of the powerful hydrothermal pore fracture system that formed in the cambrian kccs could develop in the middle cambrian carbonates in the huainan coalfield 5 2 4 mixing dissolution the mixing dissolution might occur in the late cretaceous stage ⅴ when meteoric water flowed down from the carbonate outcrops in the panji and chenqiao anticlines fig 1a mixing will take place with formation water and residual hydrothermal fluids that moving upward along faults and fractures and strong karstification by sulfuric acid dissolution will occur as well as shown in fig 12 hydrogen sulfide mainly comes from the gas released by hydrothermal fluids the reduction of organic matters and the thermochemical sulfate reduction tsr han et al 2019 when the solution rich in hydrogen sulfide moves upward and mixes with fresh water e g meteoric water and surface water that moves downward a strong oxidation reaction i e the mixing dissolution or sulfuric acid dissolution will take place producing a large amount of sulfuric acid and dissolving limestones and dolomites the chemical reaction process is shown in equations 6 and 7 as suggested by hill 1995 and ford and williams 2007 6 h 2 s o 2 h hso 2 7 h 2 s hso 4 2h 2 o caco 3 ca 2 so 4 2 co 2 h 2 o the mixing dissolution sulfuric acid dissolution usually occurs in the water tables and the fault and fracture zones fig 12 where oxygen and hydrogen sulfide are easy to mix the mixing dissolution sulfuric acid dissolution was first proposed by egemeier 2011 who and many other scholars have proven that the sulfuric acid dissolution was the genesis of many caves around the world audra et al 2009 egemeier 2011 engel et al 2004 galdenzi and menichetti 1995 hill 2000 hill and polyak 2010 as seen in table 1 all cfs in group ⅵ were taken from caves and kccs and these caves and kccs are distributed in the fault zones around the carbonate outcrops fig 1a indicating that their formations are closely related to faults and sulfuric acid dissolution mixing dissolution 5 3 controlling factors of paleokarst and kccs 5 3 1 stratigraphic lithology and structure the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield are mainly composed of limestones fig 2 which account for more than 80 of the total thickness of the strata as previous studies showed that limestones were more available for dissolution and karstification than dolomites li 2017 liu et al 2005 herman 1982 pokrovsky et al 2005 in this study a large number of dissolution vugs fractures and caves have been found in the limestones of the zhangxia xuzhuang and maozhuang formations as shown in fig 4f and fig 5k l although the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield still contain 20 of the dolomites they were developed on the top of the cambrian and ordovician strata fig 2 and became the paleoweathering crusts where fractures and caves were well developed fig 6a thus compared with other areas in northern china the limestones in the cambrian carbonates in the huainan coalfield have a much larger proportion of limestones and a small amount of the dolomites which are mainly distributed in the cambrian paleoweathering crust such limestones are very conducive to the development of paleokarst and kccs in the cambrian extensive investigations showed that kccs in northern china are normally developed in enormously thick limestone strata above which are massive and complete sets of multi layer coal measure strata i e the carboniferous permian coal measure strata these multi layer coal measures can continuously provide corrosive formation water containing organic acid co2 h2s and ch4 which can easily penetrate the underlying ordovician and cambrian carbonates and promote karstification he et al 2009 lu et al 2013 furthermore researchers also found that these multi layer coal measure strata with a thin thickness well developed bedding and low strength were prone to roof collapse and upward development of kccs yin et al 2004 zuo et al 2009 thus this kind of multi layer coal measure strata not only provides corrosive fluid for karstification but also is conducive to the formation and development of kccs 5 3 2 corrosive fluids meteoric water formation water hydrothermal fluids and mixing fluids are the four main corrosive fluids for karstification in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield in the carbonate outcrops meteoric water is unsaturated and its dissolution capacity mainly comes from co2 in the atmosphere and paleosol han et al 2019 under meteoric water leaching many dissolution pores vugs fractures and caves are first formed on the carbonate surface fig 6a f and become the migration channels of atmospheric water and surface water in the hidden shallow and deep buried areas meteoric water preferentially penetrates the deep carbonate strata along fault and fracture systems under the action of gravity to dissolve the surrounding carbonate rocks and to enlarge the previous pores vugs and fractures as shown in fig 12 formation water is highly corrosive because it contains a lot of organic acids co2 h2s and ch4 which are squeezed out by the diagenetic compaction from the permian carboniferous strata li and cai 2017 wu et al 2007 zhao et al 2009 these acidic materials enter the carbonate rocks through pores fractures bedding planes and stylolites producing a large number of new pores and fractures however most of these pores and fractures are completely filled with calcites and or residual organic matters fig 5b d thus they might have little contribution to the porosity of the ordovician and cambrian carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield the hydrothermal fluids moved along deep faults and fractures from the deep basement to the shallow depth releasing a lot of thermal energy and acidic substances e g co2 h2s and so2 and inducing the thermochemical sulfate reduction tsr to produce more acidic gases e g co2 h2s han et al 2019 zhu et al 2015 these acid gases and solutions due to their strong corrosivity continue to enlarge the previous pores vugs and fractures during upward migration and produce many new pores vugs and fractures under hydraulic fracturing and acid corrosion of hydrothermal fluids fig 11 with the migration of the hydrothermal fluids from the deep to the shallow the dissolution capacity of the hydrothermal fluids gradually decreases while the precipitation and filling effect increases for example pores vugs and fractures formed by hydrothermal dissolution in the deep cambrian carbonate rocks are unfilled or semi filled with hydrothermal minerals fig 4c and d fig 5j l but they are completely filled in the ordovician carbonate rocks fig 4a fig 5g i mixing dissolution mainly occurred in the late cretaceous semi exposed karst stage when the formation water and hydrothermal fluids of rich hydrogen sulfide move upward through the fault and fracture systems and mix with fresh water of rich oxygen that moves downward a strong oxidation reaction will take place fig 12 producing a large amount of sulfuric acid and dissolving limestones and dolomite see equations 6 and 7 compared with the karstification of carbonic acid in the meteoric and formation water sulfuric acid in the mixing water can directly react with carbonate rocks and shows much stronger dissolution ability than carbonic acid many scholars have proven that many caves around the world were formed by sulfuric acid dissolution audra et al 2009 egemeier 2011 engel et al 2004 galdenzi and menichetti 1995 hill 2000 hill and polyak 2010 as mentioned earlier many caves and kccs distributed in the fault zones around the carbonate outcrops in the panji and chenqiao anticlines fig 1a are probably related to sulfuric acid dissolution mixing dissolution 5 3 3 geological structures 5 3 3 1 sedimentary unconformities fig 3 shows that the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield mainly experienced three uplifts during the burial history the first episode of uplift was in association with the early caledonian movement from the late cambrian to the early ordovician forming the cambrian paleoweathering crust karst in the tuba formation fig 13 a the second episode occurred in relation to the middle late caledonian movement from the middle ordovician to the middle carboniferous forming the ordovician paleoweathering crust karst in the majiagou formation fig 13b the third one was linked to the indochina and yanshan movements from the middle triassic to the late cretaceous which made parts of the cambrian ordovician carboniferous and permian strata in the chenqiao and panji anticlines exposed on the land surface again fig 1a due to long term meteoric dissolution of unconformities pores vugs fractures and caves in these paleoweathering crusts are well developed fig 6a c which become migration channels for meteoric water and surface water to move into the shallow and deep buried strata 5 3 3 2 tectonic geomorphology affected by multistage tectonic movements from the middle triassic to the late cretaceous a series of fold structures in the huainan coalfield were formed as shown in fig 1a due to these anticlines and synclines being situated in close proximity and large height difference the drainage system of the study area was significantly affected by the paleo landforms fig 12 according to li et al 2002 the triassic permian and carboniferous strata with a total thickness of more than 2000 m at the panji and chenqiao anticlines were weathered and eroded exposing parts of the ordovician and or cambrian carbonate rocks to the land surface again karstification not only occurred in the carbonate outcrops at the panji and chenqiao anticlines but also in the hidden shallow and deep ordovician and cambrian strata as shown in fig 12 for example many caves are not only found in the wells in the carbonate outcrops at the panji and chenqiao anticlines but also discovered in the wells in the hidden shallow and deep strata as shown in fig 1a 5 3 3 3 faults and fractures fig 1a shows that many caves and kccs are distributed around the fault and fracture zones indicating that their formations are closely related to faults and fractures firstly in the hidden shallow and deep buried regions meteoric water can infiltrate along faults and fractures to the deep of carbonate strata to dissolve the surrounding carbonate rocks fig 12 secondly faults and fractures can provide suitable passages for the downward flow of formation water especially below the carboniferous permian strata where low porosity and low permeability multi layer coals mudstones and sandy mudstone are presented fig 12 thirdly some deep faults and fractures might be the channels for the hydrothermal fluids to move upward fig 11 fig 12 and they connected deep materials with sedimentary formations through thermal convection wu et al 2007 cai et al 2008 li and cai 2017 zhang et al 2017 many hydrothermal minerals e g quartz flint pyroclastics chalcedony and pyrite organic matters muds and calcites are filled in pores vugs fractures caves and kccs in wells t1 t4 and kccs 2 3 6 fig 5g and h table 1 around the fault and fracture zones fig 1a indicating that their formations are all related to faults and fractures 5 4 evolution model of paleokarst and kccs in the huainan coalfield based on the stratigraphic sedimentary and tectonic evolution history of the huainan coalfield combined with the analysis on the dissolution mechanisms of corrosive fluids an evolution model of the paleokarst and kccs in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the study area was established which mainly included the following six stages as shown in fig 13 stage i cambrian paleoweathering crust karst stage the cambrian carbonates in the huainan coalfield were mainly formed in a carbonate platform environment which evolved into a silicified evaporation platform system during the late cambrian affected by the huaiyuan movement the study area was uplifted and exposed to the land surface during the late cambrian to the early ordovician with a duration of about 47 ma lin 2009 meteoric water firstly dissolved the siliceous dolomites at the top tuba formation of the upper cambrian fig 13a forming some dissolution pores vugs fractures fig 6g and caves fig 6a stage ii ordovician paleoweathering crust karst stage affected by the caledonian movement uplifts generally occurred in northern china in the late ordovician lasting about 120 ma xiao et al 2019 the ordovician strata were exposed to the land surface and leached by meteoric water fig 13b many fractures fig 6e and f vugs and caves fig 6b d were formed within 0 30 m below the ordovician unconformities which become the most developed horizon of the ordovician carbonate paleokarst and kccs in northern china stage iii pressure released water karst stage during the permian period the cambrian and ordovician strata entered a relatively deep closed environment driven by the pressure difference acidic materials such as organic acids carbon dioxide hydrogen sulfide methane etc produced by organic matter diagenesis and tsr in the permian carboniferous strata li and cai 2017 wu et al 2007 zhao et al 2009 penetrated the cambrian and ordovician carbonates and produced new pores and fractures fig 13c however most of these pores and fractures were completely filled with calcites and or residual organic matters fig 5b d stage iv hydrothermal karst stage from the middle triassic to late cretaceous the huainan region mainly experienced three magmatic and volcanic activities and the third one that occurred in the early cretaceous about 115 130 ma was the strongest one li et al 2002 zhang et al 2005 the hydrothermal fluids with high temperature and high pressure migrated upward or laterally along the faults and fractures causing the fluid pressure in the fault zones to rise and the fracture zones to expand through hydraulic fracturing fig 11 meanwhile the hydrothermal fluids carried volatile acid substances to flow along the previous pores vugs and fractures dissolving and enlarging them and producing many new pores vugs and fractures fig 13d many hydrothermal minerals such as quartz pyrite giant crystal calcite barite fluorite etc have been found in pores vugs fractures caves and kccs fig 5i fig 9a b d e the roots of kccs began to develop in the cambrian strata stage v mixing dissolution karst stage mixing dissolution primarily occurred in the late cretaceous when part of the ordovician and or cambrian carbonate rocks in the panji and chenqiao anticlines in the huainan coalfield were eroded and exposed on the land surface again fig 13e meteoric water not only leached the carbonate rocks in the carbonate outcrops but also flowed down from these outcrops to the deep carbonate strata through faults fractures caves bedding planes etc when meteoric water with rich oxygen moved downward and mixed with the formation water and hydrothermal fluids with rich hydrogen sulfide a strong oxidation reaction took place producing a large amount of sulfuric acid and forming much stronger dissolution fig 12 many caves and kccs in the fault zones around the panji and chenqiao anticlines fig 1a were both the productions of mixing dissolution stage ⅵ paleokarst and kccs development stagnation stage after the cenozoic strata was deposited the paleokarst of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates gradually stopped developing due to lack of fresh water supply and the roofs of kccs began to collapse downwards under gravity until a new mechanical balance was reached by this time the development of the paleokarst and kccs in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield had basically ended as shown in fig 13f based on the above analysis it can be seen that the formations of caves and kccs in the huainan coalfield was based on ordovician and or cambrian carbonate rocks as the material basis and the multistage and multi type corrosive fluids including meteoric water formation water hydrothermal fluids and mixing fluids as the dissolution dynamic condition and the faults and fractures produced by multistage tectonic movements as fluid migration channels and then caves were first formed under the action of long term dissolution after the caves were formed under the combined action of rock mass stress tectonic stress and vacuum negative pressure in the caves the roof rock of the caves gradually collapsed upwards to form kccs the formation of kccs in the huainan coalfield was mainly related to hydrothermal dissolution and mixing dissolution and the middle triassic to the cenozoic was the key stage of the development of kccs and the fault fracture systems magmatic activities and carbonate outcrops played a key role in the formation and evolution of kccs in the huainan coalfield 5 5 prediction of paleokarst and kccs in the huainan coalfield 5 5 1 spatial distribution prediction based on the above analysis corrosive fluids and geological structures were the two main factors that controlled the development of the paleokarst and kccs of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates geological structures such as unconformities faults folds and fractures provided migration channels for various corrosive fluids and controlled the range and depth of fluid movement and affected the spatial distribution of paleokarst and kccs thus we predicted that the paleokarst and kccs in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield were mostly developed in four locations that is the cambrian and ordovician carbonate paleoweathering crusts the carbonate outcrops in the panji and chenqiao anticlines the fault and fracture zones in anticline slopes and some deep fault and fractures near magmatic rock intrusions the predicted results in this study are consistent with the distributions of caves and kccs that have been already revealed in the huainan coalfield overall as shown in fig 1a 5 5 2 mining and grouting activities impact on paleokarst and kccs with mining drainage activities in recent decades a large volume of groundwater was drained out and the groundwater level dropped sharply especially for the limestone aquifers of the ordovician and cambrian in which the water tables dropped ranging from a few meters to hundreds of meters zhang et al 2019a 2019b the groundwater in the upper aquifer recharged the lower aquifer through faults kccs and other geological structures accelerating the circulation of the entire groundwater system which might trigger a new round of mixing dissolution process zhang et al 2020a 2020b when the groundwaters from different aquifers are mixed the mixed groundwater could become unsaturated with calcite and start to dissolve carbonate rocks in addition coal mines always use grouting to strengthen and or transform the ordovician and or cambrian aquifers or to block the water inrush from kccs however grouting will introduce some fresh water and acid components into these aquifers thus a new kind of unsaturated calcium carbonate aqueous solution will be formed creating a new dissolution effect on the paleokarst and kccs of the middle cambrian lower ordovician therefore mining and grouting activities may cause parts of paleokarst and kccs to revival thereby inducing a new round of karst hydrogeological disasters such as karst collapse kccs karst water inrush and cross contamination of karst water and so on 6 conclusions through a comprehensive analysis using observed and measured datasets through petrological and geochemical methods the following conclusions can be made from this study five types of the paleokarst of the middle cambrian lower ordovician in the huainan coalfield were found which are pores vugs fractures caves and kccs among which kccs are a unique paleokarst geological structure existed in northern china coalfield four types and sources of corrosive fluids dissolving the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks were determined and they are meteoric water formation water hydrothermal fluids and mixing fluids each type of fluid had unique dissolution mechanism as discussed above the formation of cambrian kccs in the huainan coalfield is mainly related to hydrothermal dissolution and mixing dissolution as well as the thick limestones and developed faults and fractures in the cambrian strata stratigraphic lithology corrosive fluids and geological structures are the three main factors that control the development and spatial distribution of the paleokarst and kccs of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield the cambrian and ordovician paleoweathering crusts the carbonate outcrops in anticlines the fault and fracture zones in anticline slopes and the deep fault and fractures near magmatic rock intrusions are the favorite places for paleokarst and kccs development credit authorship contribution statement haitao zhang conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft writing review editing guangquan xu

4293,karst water in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates is the ecological resources and domestic water in the huainan coalfield anhui province china but it also directly threatens the safe production of coal mines due to the development of paleokarst and karst collapse columns kccs most of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in northern china experienced multistage tectonic movements and were affected by multi type corrosive fluids but very few studies focused on the effect of multistage fluid rock reaction on the formation of paleokarst and kccs to investigate the formation mechanisms and characteristics of paleokarst and kccs this study integrated petrographic studies isotope geochemistry c and o and minor elements ba mn and sr and clarified the sources and types of corrosive fluids through this study meteoric water formation water hydrothermal fluids and mixing fluids were determined as the four main types of corrosive fluids that formed pores vugs fractures caves and kccs in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates the meteoric dissolution is controlled by carbonic acid solution recharge conditions which affect the karst development in the cambrian and ordovician paleoweathering crusts and local carbonate outcrops hydrothermal fluids with high temperature high pressure and high corrosivity can develop a strong hydrothermal pore fracture system in the cambrian carbonate which is the reason that kccs can develop in the cambrian strata in the huainan coalfield the mixing dissolution is controlled by sulfuric acid dissolution and usually occurs in the water tables and the fault and fracture zones which are conducive to the development of caves and kccs in addition to the above four corrosive fluids the development of paleokarst and kccs in the huainan area is also controlled by stratigraphic lithology and geological structures especially for faults and fractures which are the main migration channels of corrosive fluids an evolution model of paleokarst and kccs was established providing a plausible interpretation for better understanding of the spatial distribution of paleokarst and kccs in practice this study provides critical references for predicting the spatial distribution of paleokarst and kccs in northern china coalfields as well as the exploration and development of karst water around the world keywords carbonate corrosive fluids faults meteoric water hydrothermal fluids mixing dissolution 1 introduction carbonate rocks are important reservoirs of oil gas and water which provide 60 of oil and gas outputs and about 20 of drinking water in the world bai 2006 liang et al 2018 liu et al 2017c sun et al 2019 in china karst water in carbonate rocks is an important water resource which accounts for more than 25 of domestic water supply but it also directly threatens the safe production of more than 80 of coal mines in china due to the development of paleokarst and karst collapse columns kccs liang et al 2018 yin et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a kccs are widespread in northern china and the total number of kccs has exceeded 10 000 including 8500 kccs in shanxi province 1200 kccs in hebei province and 300 kccs in other provinces yin et al 2019 since the 1970s there have been 22 accidents of groundwater inrush induced by kccs resulting in economic losses and casualties yin et al 2019 the huainan coalfield with a total area of 2500 km2 is one of the five largest coalfields in northern china zhang et al 2019a the karst water in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield is not only the ecological resources and domestic water supply sources but it also seriously affects the safety production of coal mines in this region for instance from 1970 to 2018 there have been 268 major accidents of karst water inrush in the huainan coalfield zhang et al 2019b with a maximum water inrush flow of 14 520 m3 hr induced by kcc in 2017 gan 2018 given the abundant coal reserves 4 44 108 metric tons in the huainan coalfield it is essential to understand the formation mechanisms and controlling factors of the paleokarst and kccs in middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates which would provide a critical reference for accurately predicting their spatial distribution kccs are a peculiar geological structure in northern china and belong to the category of paleokarst whose roots are usually developed in the ordovician with a small percentage of roots also developed in the cambrian kccs usually develop upward from their roots passing through the carboniferous permian triassic strata and even into the jurassic cretaceous and quaternary loose strata he et al 2005 2009 thus their formation and evolution processes are closely related to the carbonate paleokarst processes previous studies deemed that the formation of paleokarst was closely related to the dissolution of meteoric water and groundwater passed through paleoweathering crusts and fault fracture systems and the formation of kccs is the result of dissolution and collapse of the ordovician carbonate rocks by flowing water he et al 2009 lu et al 2013 sweeting 1995 yin et al 2019 zuo et al 2009 several genesis theories about the ordovician kccs have been put forward such as theory of karst cave formation due to vacuum ablation collapse xu and zhao 1981 theory of formation under gravity collapse shi et al 1998 theory of formation under gypsum dissolution collapse qian 1988 and theory of formation due to groundwater cycle wang et al 2007 however all these theories ignored a fact that the cambrian and ordovician carbonates in china mostly experienced multistage tectonic uplifts subsidence and magmatic activities and developed a multistage multi genesis and multi type of paleokarst cai et al 2008 han et al 2016 jiang et al 2015 liu et al 2017a lu et al 2017 xiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 which was caused by meteoric water dissolution and groundwater dissolution as well as organic acids dissolution cai et al 2008 mazzullo and harris 1992 and or hydrothermal fluids dissolution corbella et al 2004 dai et al 2013 teng et al 2020 zhu et al 2015 unfortunately much less attention has been paid to the effect of multistage fluid rock reactions on the formation of paleokarst and kccs in northern china coalfield moreover more than 99 of 10 000 kccs in northern china coalfield were in the ordovician strata yin et al 2019 and some kccs in the huainan coalfield were developed in the cambrian strata zuo et al 2009 the origin of cambrian kccs has been an enigma to geologists for many years because the cambrian strata in northern china usually contain dolomites and dolomitic limestones which are thought to be more difficult to dissolve than the typical ordovician limestones he et al 2009 lu et al 2013 zuo et al 2009 diagenetic fluids corrosive fluids responsible for the generation of fillings in pores fractures and caves usually also have an important effect on the alteration of carbonate rocks chen et al 2004 davies and smith 2006 lonnee and machel 2006 among various methods used for the interpretation of sedimentary diagenetic conditions and environments the carbon and oxygen isotope analysis on the carbonate matrix and karst fillings has been widely employed bai et al 2018 maheshwari et al 1999 oehlert and swart 2014 zhang et al 2018 carbon and oxygen isotopes can provide an important basis for the analysis of issues such as paleoenvironment paleoclimate and origin of carbon and oxygen isotopes han et al 2019 lachniet 2009 zhang et al 2016a 2016b thus have been widely used to trace the fluid origin and flow pathways and to identify the formation environment and processes of paleokarst armstrong altrin et al 2009 budd and land 1990 zhang et al 2021 several studies showed that stable isotope analysis combined with regional geological structure evolution can better clarify corrosive fluids sources and dissolution mechanisms han et al 2019 phillipson 2005 zhang et al 2016a zhu et al 2015 in this study detailed macroscopic and microscopic thin section petrographic observations and isotope geochemistry c and o and minor elements ba mn and sr were carried out on the cored samples and outcrop data from the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield this paper aims to 1 describe the paleokarst and kccs characteristics of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield 2 determine the sources and types of fluids that have altered the carbonate rocks 3 clarify the formation mechanisms and controlling factors for paleokarst and kccs 4 establish an evolution model of the paleokarst and kccs of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates to predict their spatial distribution in the huainan coalfield 2 geological setting 2 1 study area the huainan coalfield chosen as the study area fig 1 a covers a total area of 2500 km2 and is located on the southeast margin of the northern china plate zhang et al 2019a three tectonic units were formed in the huainan coalfield affected by multistage tectonic movements since the middle triassic zhan et al 2017 and they include a gravity slip structure belt in the north a thrust nappe structural belt in the south and a compound syncline tectonic belt in the middle fig 1a in the east part of the study area the shungeng mountain and bagong mountain outcrops expose the entire cambrian and ordovician stratigraphic sections fig 1a while the rest of the study area is covered by the cenozoic strata with a thickness ranging from 80 to 920 m fig 1b like other coal mines in northern china the huainan coalfield mainly exploits carboniferous permian coal measures strata currently there are 14 coal mines being mined in the huainan coalfield namely the panyi pan er pansan panbei zhuji dingji guqiao gubei zhangji xieqiao liuzhuang kouzi banji and yangcun coal mines fig 1a 2 2 depositional setting and stratigraphy during the cambrian and ordovician periods the huainan region was situated at a low latitude close to the equator with a high temperature rainy climate lin 2009 from the early cambrian the progressive transgression builds up a shallow carbonate platform in this region with huge carbonate deposits up to 1000 m thick li et al 1998 the carbonate platform was rimmed from the early cambrian to the early late cambrian which evolved into a silicified evaporation platform system during the late late cambrian li et al 1998 lin 2009 owning to the occurrence of the huaiyuan movement at the end of the cambrian the northern china platform experienced an overall uplift causing the cambrian strata in the huainan region to expose to the land surface with a duration of about 47 ma lin 2009 with the transgression in the early ordovician the study area once again entered into a marine tidal flat sedimentary environment lu et al 1994 yu and meng 1995 this long term transgression culminated in the late early ordovician in the huainan region and was followed by regression accordingly the carbonate depositional system gradually entered a long term weathering and erosion system near the end of the early middle ordovician lasting about 120 ma xiao et al 2019 this study concentrates on the middle cambrian to the lower ordovician carbonate strata including the maozhuang xuzhuang and zhangxia formations of the middle cambrian the gushan and tuba formations of the upper cambrian and the jiawang xiaoxian and majiagou formations of the lower ordovician in ascending order fig 2 the maozhuang xuzhuang and zhangxia formations of the middle cambrian almost completely consist of limestones including dolomitic limestones leopard limestones oolitic limestones and pisolitic limestones with a total thickness of close to 600 m the maozhuang formation conformably overlies the mantou formation of the lower cambrian and the zhangxia formation conformably underlies the gushan formation of the upper cambrian fig 2 in contrast the gushan and tuba formations of the upper cambrian are dominated by dolomites e g dolomites siliceous dolomites and argillaceous dolomites intercalated with minor argillaceous limestones with a total thickness of more than 200 m the tuba formation is unconformably overlaid by the jiawang formation of the lower ordovician fig 2 the jiawang formation is at the bottom of the lower ordovician and is composed of thin shales with an average thickness of 10 m the xiaoxian formation is at the middle of the lower ordovician and is primarily composed of thin to medium thick dolomitic limestones and breccia limestones with an average thickness of 70 m the majiagou formation is at the top of the lower ordovician and is mainly composed of dolomites and minor dolomitic limestones with an average thickness of 70 m fig 2 upwards the carboniferous benxi formation unconformably overlies the majiagou formation and features a dominance of aluminum mudstones with an average thickness of 20 m further upward one can observe the carboniferous taiyuan formation and permian coal measure strata which are mainly composed of coal seams mudstones sandstones and minor thin layer limestones 2 3 burial history and tectonic evolution the buried history of the successions of the middle cambrian to the lower ordovician in the huainan area is shown in fig 3 this diagram shows that the middle cambrian to the lower ordovician carbonates experienced three significant uplifts during burial the first episode of uplift occurred in relation to the early caledonian movement during the late cambrian to the early ordovician with a duration of about 47 ma forming the cambrian paleoweathering crust lin 2009 the second episode in association with the middle late caledonian movement during the middle ordovician to middle carboniferous with a duration of about 120 ma forming the ordovician paleoweathering crust xiao et al 2019 the third one linked to the yanshan movement during the middle jurassic to the late cretaceous with an erosion thickness of more than 2000 m and a duration of about 130 ma li et al 2002 causing the cambrian ordovician strata in the panji and chenqiao anticlines in the study area suffering from weathering and erosion again and eventually being exposed to land surface zhan et al 2017 many deep faults and folds fig 1a and b in the huainan region were developed due to multistage tectonic activities during the indochina and yanshan movements shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 the indochina movement caused north south compression in the study area forming a north south thrust nappe structure the yanshan movement not only revived the early faults but also produced many nne and nnw direction tensile and torsional faults accompanied by multiple phases of magmatic and volcanic activities shu et al 2017 zhan et al 2017 according to the statistics of gao 2018 three are 718 main faults and 10 main folds developed in the huainan coalfield in which 74 are normal faults among these faults there are 36 faults with a drop of more than 300 m 251 faults with a drop of 300 to100 m and 431 faults with a drop of 100 to 20 m from the late triassic to the early cretaceous the huainan region mainly experienced three periods of magmatic activities the first magmatic activity occurred at 240 ma the late triassic and lasted for 60 120 ma the second magmatic activity occurred at 140 ma the middle jurassic and lasted for 20 60 ma and the third magmatic activity occurred at 120 ma the early cretaceous and lasted for 120 160 ma li et al 2002 zhang et al 2005 a large area of magmatic intrusive rocks was found in the permian coal seams of dingji coal mine pansan coal mine and zhuji coal mine in the huainan coalfield fig 1a chen et al 2017 ding et al 2018 xu et al 2004 showed that the volcanic activity taking place in the early cretaceous was the most intense and its intrusion time was about 115 130 ma based on u pb isotopic dating of zircon grains from diabase 3 materials and methods approximately 60 borehole wells penetrated the lower ordovician and 30 borehole wells penetrated the middle cambrian lower ordovician in the huainan coalfield these wells are distributed across the entire study area and provide a solid foundation for the present study mainly in the form of cores and drilling data in this study the observation and test data from the cambrian and ordovician carbonate outcrops shungeng mountain and bagong mountain see in fig 1a seven discovered kccs fig 1a and six representative wells wells t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 and t6 and wells t2 t3 and t5 are located in kccs 2 3 and 6 respectively see fig 1a with a total core length of 2365 74 m were selected for detailed analysis these core samples are primarily composed of carbonate matrix cm and calcite fillings cfs while these cfs mainly come from pores vugs fractures caves and kccs ninety two samples

dolomites fig 4d and siliceous dolomites fig 4e are usually developed in the gushan and tuba formations of the upper cambrian and the majiagou formation of the lower ordovician fig 2 based on observations of thin sections the matrix limestones are mainly composed of micro to fine medium to medium coarse crystalline limestones and the calcite contents range from 50 to 80 the matrix dolomites are primarily composed of fine to fine medium to medium crystalline dolomites and the dolomite contents range from 60 to 80 the dolomitic limestones are dominated by micro to medium fine crystal calcites fig s1e containing a large number of micro and fine crystalline dolomite and the calcite contents exceed 60 the breccia limestones are mainly composed of fine to medium coarse crystal calcites fig s1d cemented by carbonate breccias the calcite contents in the breccia limestones vary widely ranging from 50 to 80 the leopard limestones are mainly composed of fine crystal calcites with a calcite content exceeding 50 and contain a large number of micro to fine crystalline dolomite plaques appearing leopard skin the oolitic limestones contain a lot of oolitic particles with a content of more than 50 and the particle size ranges from 0 2 mm to 2 0 mm fig s1c the difference between pisolitic limestones and oolitic limestones is that the particle size of the pisolitic particle is larger than that of oolitic particle and the diameter of the pisolitic particle is commonly greater than 2 0 mm the calcite contents of oolitic and pisolitic limestones are both greater than 50 the dolomites are dominated by fine to medium fine crystal dolomites fig s1b and the dolomite contents are more than 80 the argillaceous dolomites are composed of micro crystal dolomites with seizes 50 μm fig s1a which contain a small number of calcites and biological debris and the dolomites contents are more than 60 the siliceous dolomites are dominated by micro to fine crystal dolomites fig s1f with a dolomite content of more than 70 and contain some siliceous bands when the dolomites in the siliceous dolomites are weathered and eroded the remaining siliceous appears as a honeycomb structure 4 2 paleokarst types and characteristics the main types of paleokarst in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield are pores vugs fractures caves and kccs 4 2 1 pores and vugs the pores and vugs are both products of dissolution pores but the vugs have a larger size than pores microscopically the dissolution pores are irregular pores with a diameter of 1 2 mm and are usually full filled with calcites fig 5 a and b or organic matters fig 5d or pyrites or hydrothermal minerals e g quartz flint pyroclastics chalcedony etc fig 5g i macroscopically the vugs are alveolar shaped pores with a size between 5 and 20 mm in the shallow ordovician carbonate rocks vugs are usually full filled or semi filled with quartz or calcites fig 4a while in the deep cambrian carbonate rocks they are commonly unfilled fig 4d or are semi filled with quartz fig 4c the carbonate rocks with dense pores and vugs usually show honeycomb textures and they are generally distributed along fractures fig 4c 4 2 2 fractures the fractures can be divided into diagenetic fractures tectonic fractures and dissolution fractures according to their formation mechanisms diagenetic fractures are cracks during sedimentation and consolidation diagenesis han et al 2019 and their widths are generally at the micron scale such fractures are often irregularly networked and filled with calcites and or residual organic matters fig 5b d the tectonic fractures fig 5e and f are formed by region stress release during tectonic activities and most of the dissolution fractures fig 6 g are the products of tectonic fractures that were dissolved and altered by meteoric water and or groundwater and or hydrothermal fluids the opening aperture of these fractures ranges from a few millimeters to several hundred millimeters fig 5e g and the length ranges from tens of millimeters to several kilometers moreover fractures can also be divided into three types based on the occurrence vertical fractures high angle fractures and low angle fractures the vertical fractures and high angle fractures usually develop near the cambrian and ordovician paleoweathering crusts fig 6e and f faults folds and kccs and most of them are unfilled fig 5l or semi filled with calcites and or hydrothermal minerals fig 5e and f while low angle fractures such as stylolites fig 5d and bedding planes are usually full filled with calcites and or organic matters or hydrothermal minerals or muds fig 5c d g 4 2 3 caves the caves are primarily developed around the paleoweathering crusts faults anticlines and kccs and their sizes vary from a few centimeters to a dozen meters the carbonate outcrops and drilling cores both show that the cavity fillings and filling patterns are complicated and diversified caves in the paleoweathering crusts fig 6a d are generally developed within 30 m below the cambrian and ordovician unconformities which are usually semi filled and cemented by karst breccias and or gray green muds and or calcites according to long term exploration data another type of caves is usually found in the fault and fold zones and around kccs fig 1a and they are generally semi filled with broken surrounding rock breccias and calcites with weak cementation 4 2 4 kccs there are seven kccs found in the huainan coalfield and they are mainly distributed in the pan er pansan gubei zhangji xieqiao and liuzhuang coal mines as shown in fig 1a these kccs roots are developed in the middle cambrian kccs 3 7 or in the lower ordovician carbonate limestones kccs 1 2 and upward passing through the carboniferous and entering the permian strata as shown in fig 7 a three dimensional 3 d seismic exploration shows that the width of kccs in the huainan coalfield becomes progressively larger downward and their vertical height ranges from 187 56 m to 1369 54 m in a planar view most of kccs appear ellipse and the ratio of major axis to minor axis is generally from 1 2 1 to 3 1 however kcc 6 at the xieqiao coal mine is composed of three small kccs which appear as bead shaped in the planar view and hump in the cross sectional profile as shown in fig 7b in the cambrian and ordovician strata the columns of kccs are commonly filled with collapse breccias gigantic calcites pyrite and some hydrothermal minerals figs s2a b d e the breccias are formed by mechanical breaking after the surrounding rock of the cave collapsed the size of these breccias ranges from 1 mm to 300 mm with poor sorting but good roundness sub roundness indicating that these breccias experienced a long term dissolution of groundwater after they collapsed shukla and sharma 2018 the fractures and vugs between the breccia are partially filled and a large number of effective voids remain upward in the carboniferous and permian strata the stratification of rock strata in the columns of kccs are not well developed but the contact interface between the collapse column and the coal seam is clear fig s2f the voids among large blocks are usually filled with small blocks and muddy sand and cemented by calcites fig s2c in the surrounding rocks of kccs high angle fractures 50 85 are well developed which are usually unfilled or semi filled with calcites and or quartz or muds 4 3 geochemistry the carbon and oxygen isotopes and minor elements of 5 carbonate matrix cm including 2 ordovician carbonate matrix ocm and 3 cambrian carbonate matrix ccm and 29 calcite fillings cfs including 14 ordovician calcite fillings ocfs 9 cambrian calcite fillings ccfs and 6 kccs calcite fillings kcfs from the pores vugs fractures caves and kccs were measured the results are listed in table 1 4 3 1 carbon and oxygen isotopes the δ13cpdb values of ccm are higher than those of ocm and cfs the δ13c values of 3 ccm are positive table 1 while the δ13c values of 2 ocm and 29 cfs are all negative table 1 reflecting their different sedimentary and diagenetic environments lachniet 2009 zhang et al 2016a 2016b the δ13cpdb values of 29 cfs are 7 93 to 1 41 with an average of 2 86 table 1 the oxygen isotope values of cm are higher than those of cfs the δ18opdb values of cm are 6 03 to 4 92 with an average of 5 36 table 1 the δ18opdb values of cfs are 17 25 to 6 13 with an average of 11 17 table 1 in general the oxygen isotope is mainly related to water body salinity and environmental temperature during the formation periods of sediments while the carbon isotope is primarily affected by evaporation dynamic fractionation and early carbonate deposition lachniet 2009 zhang et al 2016a 2016b the δ18opdb values of cfs in table 1 are much smaller than those of cm suggesting that the formation of cfs might be affected by many factors such as water leaching and or temperature rising and or burial depth increasing and or hydrothermal activities maheshwari et al 1999 oehlert and swart 2014 zhang et al 2016a 2018 4 3 2 minor elements in this study three minor elements including ba mn and sr were tested and analyzed the minor elements ba mn and sr do not differ greatly in cm but they show significant differences in cfs fig 8 the concentrations of ba in cm are 258 87 ppm to 313 39 ppm with an average of 281 90 ppm table 1 while the concentrations of ba in cfs are 114 92 ppm to 491 18 ppm with an average of 320 12 ppm table 1 the concentrations of mn in cm are 30 40 ppm to 47 01 ppm with an average of 37 21 ppm table 1 while the concentrations of mn in cfs are 11 95 ppm to 338 10 ppm with an average of 153 67 ppm table 1 the concentrations of sr in cm are 66 46 ppm to 88 05 ppm with an average of 79 57 ppm table 1 while the concentrations of sr in cfs are 29 16 ppm to 143 98 ppm with an average of 88 40 ppm table 1 many previous researchers found that the high ba mn and sr concentrations in cfs might be related to hydrothermal fluids cai et al 2008 liu et al 2017b price et al 2013 while the low ba mn and sr concentrations in cfs might be related to long term leaching by meteoric water madukwe 2019 nowrouzi et al 2014 wei et al 2018 zhu et al 2015 therefore the significant changes of minor elements ba mn and sr in cfs fig 8 suggest that cfs might be formed in a complex and changeable environment 5 discussion 5 1 formation environments and sources of diagenetic fluids 5 1 1 paleosalinity and paleotemperature of diagenetic fluids the formation environments of diagenetic fluids corrosive fluids of cm and cfs are an important basis for identifying their sources and types and the carbon and oxygen isotopes are important geochemical tracers which could provide important information of the formation environments of various diagenetic fluids such as paleosalinity paleotemperature etc and determine the sources and types of diagenetic fluid arthur et al 1988 kuypers et al 1999 liu et al 2017a scholle and arthur 1980 zhang et al 2016a 2016b zhu et al 2015 keith and weber 1964 proposed an empirical formula for calculating paleosalinity z based on the values of δ13cpdb and δ18opdb isotopes which have been employed to distinguish between continental and marine sedimentary environments 1 z 2 048 δ 13 c pdb 50 0 498 δ 18 o pdb 50 when z 120 it is marine sediments and when z 120 it is freshwater sediments keith and weber 1964 when z is close to 120 the sediments may be affected by both marine water and freshwater keith and weber 1964 this empirical formula and criterion have been widely used worldwide jiang et al 2015 keith and weber 1964 yin 1991 zhang et al 2016b urey 1948 proposed a method for calculating the paleo ocean temperature t based on the values of δ18opdb isotope which was further elaborated by epstein et al 1953 shao et al 1996 corrected the time effect in the formula proposed by urey 1948 based on the history of geological evolution in china the improved formula proposed by shao et al 1996 has been widely used in china sun et al 2015 yang et al 2019 zhang 1985 so it was also employed in this study the improved formula for calculating the paleotemperature t is as follows 2 t 16 9 4 38 δ 18 o 2 8 0 1 δ 18 o 2 8 2 in summary the z and t values of cm and cfs in the paleokarst and kccs of the middle cambrian lower ordovician in the huainan coalfield can be calculated using equations 1 and 2 respectively and the results are shown in table 1 as seen in table 1 the z values of cm are greater than 120 and their t values range from 26 64 to 32 09 c indicating that they were formed in an open marine sedimentary environment guo et al 2016 qiu et al 2012 however the z and t values of cfs change greatly especially for t values ranging from 32 59 to 101 07 c indicating that the formation environments of cfs were extremely complex thus one probably should determine the sources and types of calcite diagenetic fluids before deciphering their dissolution mechanisms 5 1 2 sources and types of diagenetic fluids to accurately identify the sources and types of diagenetic fluids in the paleokarst and kccs of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield the hierarchical cluster analysis hca method was utilized based on the carbon and oxygen isotopes and minor elements ba mn and sr hca is one of the most widely applied cluster techniques in geochemical analysis which can classify similar observations into different groups to obtain a dendrogram cloutier et al 2008 zhang et al 2020a 2020b using the ward method and euclidean distance liu et al 2017a zhang et al 2019a 2020a 2020b hca yielded the optimum six groups based on the phenon line of 2 0 and the previous results of the cambrian and ordovician carbonate paleokarst in northern china xiao et al 2019 zhang et al 2016a 2016b 2018 the samples of each group are shown in figs 9 and 10 group i includes 3 ccm 2 ocm and 2 ocfs where the z values of 3 ccm and 2 ocm are more than 120 indicating that they both were formed in marine sedimentary environments but 2 ocm might be affected by meteoric water leaching during diagenesis because their δ13c values are negative zhang et al 2016a 2016b in this group the δ13c values of 2 ocfs are negative fig 10 the z values are close to 120 and the t values are close to 35 c indicating that they might be formed in a relatively open and near surface environment keith and weber 1964 thus group i may represent syngenetic karst and gypsum pore and salt pore fig 5a are the typical signs of syngenetic karst however due to the limited subaerial exposure areas in the syngenetic stage and the alteration in the diagenetic stage syngenetic karst was not developed in the huainan region group ⅱ includes 3 ccfs and group iii includes 5 ocfs both showing significant negative drifts of the δ13c and δ18o values fig 10 and sharp drops in concentrations of ba mn and sr fig 8 which are the typical characteristics of paleoweathering crust karst affected by long term meteoric water z 120 and t 43 c see table 1 zhang et al 2016a 2016b thus groups ⅱ and iii may represent the cambrian and ordovician paleoweathering crust karst respectively group ⅳ includes 1 ccfs and 3 ocfs where the δ13c values of 3 ocfs show a slightly positive drift while the δ18o values show a slightly negative drift fig 10 which is the typical characteristics of pressure released water karst li and cai 2017 zhang et al 2016a 2016b the concentrations of ba sr and mn in this group show significant increasing trends fig 8 suggesting that these minerals might come from the overlying coal bearing formation water during diagenetic compaction zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2015 moreover the z 120 and t 45 c in group ⅳ table 1 suggest that they might be formed in a closed and buried environment group ⅴ includes 2 ccfs 2 ocfs and 3 kccs where the δ18o values are all less than 15 fig 10 according to previous results cfs with the δ18o values of less than 15 cannot be formed in meteoric or groundwater environment below 50 c so cfs in group ⅴ are likely precipitated from deep hydrothermal fluids cai et al 2008 han et al 2019 price et al 2013 zhu et al 2015 which are also verified by high concentrations of ba mn and sr liu et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 according to han et al 2019 the hydrothermal fluids can be divided into low temperature 60 140 c medium temperature 140 170 c and high temperature 170 c fluids thus the hydrothermal fluids in the huainan coalfield belong to the low temperature fluids with a temperature between 91 and 101 c table 1 which are very close to the temperature of 110 c measured by apatite fission li et al 2002 group ⅵ includes 3 ccfs 2 ocfs and 3 kccs where the δ13c and δ18o values are all negative fig 10 and z 120 table 1 indicating that their formations might be affected by meteoric water the δ18o values are less than 11 and the t values are higher than 60 c 50 c in group ⅵ table 1 indicating that the formation of cfs in this group is also affected by hydrothermal fluids moreover groups ⅵ and ⅴ are further grouped together fig 9 and the concentrations of ba mn and sr in these two groups are very close to each other fig 8 indicating that the formation of cfs in group ⅵ could also be affected by formation water thus groups ⅵ may represent mixing karst formed by mixing dissolution of meteoric water formation water and hydrothermal fluids given that the regional geothermal gradient was 30 c km and the surface temperature was 25 c guo et al 2016 the formation temperatures and corresponding periods of each group of cfs were calculated and projected onto a burial history map fig 3 as seen in fig 3 group i may represent syngenetic karst formed by meteoric and marine dissolution during the carbonate sedimentary period but we did not consider them in this study because they are not developed in the huainan region group ⅱ may represent the cambrian paleoweathering crust karst formed by meteoric dissolution during the late cambrian to the early ordovician stage i group iii may represent the ordovician paleoweathering crust karst formed by meteoric dissolution during the middle ordovician to the middle carboniferous stage ⅱ group ⅳ may represent the pressure released water karst formed by formation water dissolution in the permian stage iii group ⅴ may represent the hydrothermal karst formed by hydrothermal dissolution during the early cretaceous stage ⅳ group ⅵ may represent the mixing karst formed by mixing dissolution of meteoric water formation water and hydrothermal fluids during the late cretaceous stage ⅴ six cfs samples from kccs no 25 26 27 32 33 34 see table 1 are all grouped into groups ⅴ and ⅵ figs 9 and 10 indicating that the formation of kccs in the huainan coalfield is closely related to hydrothermal dissolution and mixing dissolution 5 2 dissolution mechanisms of corrosive fluids 5 2 1 meteoric dissolution the meteoric dissolution of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield mainly took place in the cambrian paleo weathering crust stage stage i and the ordovician paleo weathering crust stage stage ⅱ in addition the ordovician and cambrian carbonate outcrops in the panji and chenqiao anticlines fig 1 were exposed to land surface again in the late cretaceous stage ⅴ and were subjected to secondary leaching by meteoric water in the fully exposed or partially exposed denudation area fig 13a and b the middle cambrian or and lower ordovician carbonate rocks were completely open and directly leached by atmospheric fresh water thus in these denudation areas many dissolution pores vugs and fractures were first formed and became the original migration channels of atmospheric fresh water carrying a large amount of co2 which enters the shallow carbonate strata although co2 was continuously consumed during the migration process co2 in meteoric water was continuously recharged through the fracture and pore systems thus air water rock reactions continued to move towards the direction of rock dissolution han et al 2019 as shown in equation 3 over time dissolution accelerated with increasing water flow the small dissolution pores vugs and fractures in the carbonate rocks gradually connected and expanded into caves forming paleoweathering crust karst as shown in fig 6a d 3 c a c o 3 c o 2 h 2 o c a 2 2 h c o 3 in the shallow and deep buried areas the carbonate rocks were semi closed and atmospheric fresh water could not directly contact the hidden carbonate rocks however faults and fractures were extensively developed during this period stage ⅴ see fig 13e and fresh water with dissolved co2 can flow to the deep semi closed system through the fault and fracture systems from the surface under the influence of gravity and then dissolve the hidden and buried carbonate rocks directly after mixing with other corrosive fluids e g formation water hydrothermal fluids ect as shown in fig 12 5 2 2 formation water dissolution formation water dissolution also known as pressure released water dissolution refers to some corrosive components generated from hydrocarbon generating formations under the diagenetic compaction occurred in stage iii which corroded and dissolved carbonate rocks li and cai 2017 ma and zhao 2016 mazzullo and harris 1992 pearce et al 2018 at the end of the middle carboniferous affected by the hercynian movement the northern china platform declined overall with accepting deposition yuan and yang 2015 covered by the carboniferous permian strata the cambrian and ordovician strata became a relatively deep closed environment driven by the pressure difference brines organic acid co2 h2s and ch4 produced by the diagenesis of organic matter and thermochemical sulfate reduction tsr of the permian carboniferous strata were continuously squeezed out as shown in fig 13c li and cai 2017 wu et al 2007 zhao et al 2009 these corrosive components penetrate the cambrian and ordovician carbonate rocks through pores vugs fractures and caves producing new pores and fractures where some residual organic matters still remain fig 5b d mazzullo and harris 1992 showed that the δ13c values of cfs formed by formation water from the carboniferous permian strata exhibited a positive drift which could be attributed to the decomposition and methanation ch4 of organic matter caused by methane bacteria the ch4 formed during biochemical processes equation 4 was rich in δ12c whereas the co2 had abundant δ13c mazzullo and harris 1992 zhang et al 2018 thus the sedimentary ocfs in group ⅳ are relatively enriched in δ 13 c showing a slight positive drift relative to ocm in group i fig 10 4 2 ch 2 o fermentation ch 4 co 2 5 2 3 hydrothermal dissolution from the middle triassic to the early cretaceous stage ⅳ multistage tectonic and magmatic activities occurred in the huainan coalfield li et al 2002 zhang et al 2005 which made the whole carbonate strata of the study area enter an intensive strong tectonic hydrothermal karst stage these tectonic and magmatic activities not only brought in the acidic substances with volatile components such as co2 h2s and so2 han et al 2019 directly producing corrosion to the surrounding carbonate rocks but also promoted thermochemical sulfate reduction tsr equation 5 indirectly strengthening the karstification zhu et al 2015 when these hydrothermal fluids with high temperature high pressure and high corrosivity invade upward through faults and fractures the temperature pressure and acidity conditions of the surrounding carbonate rocks changes rapidly resulting in the previously formed pores vugs and fractures being reformed and enlarged and producing new pores vugs and fractures forming a tree like hydrothermal pore fracture system guo et al 2016 as shown in fig 11 5 so 4 2 hydrocrbon organic matters h 2 s co 2 h 2 o as the hydrothermal fluids move from the deep to the shallow the fluid acidity gradually weakens and the calcium carbonate in the solution is gradually saturated and precipitated filling in the pores vugs and fractures han et al 2019 therefore close to the source of hydrothermal fluids the hydrothermal pore fracture system is well developed due to the unsaturation and strong corrosion of hydrothermal fluids fig 11 while in the direction away from the hydrothermal fluids as the hydrothermal fluid corrosion weakens the calcites and other minerals such as silica flint pyroclastics chalcedony etc are gradually saturated and precipitated in the hydrothermal pore fracture system fig 11 this may be the reason that most of the vugs and fractures formed by hydrothermal dissolution in the cambrian carbonate rocks in the study area are unfilled or semi filled fig 5j l while they are full filled with hydrothermal minerals in the ordovician carbonate rocks fig 5g i it is because of the powerful hydrothermal pore fracture system that formed in the cambrian kccs could develop in the middle cambrian carbonates in the huainan coalfield 5 2 4 mixing dissolution the mixing dissolution might occur in the late cretaceous stage ⅴ when meteoric water flowed down from the carbonate outcrops in the panji and chenqiao anticlines fig 1a mixing will take place with formation water and residual hydrothermal fluids that moving upward along faults and fractures and strong karstification by sulfuric acid dissolution will occur as well as shown in fig 12 hydrogen sulfide mainly comes from the gas released by hydrothermal fluids the reduction of organic matters and the thermochemical sulfate reduction tsr han et al 2019 when the solution rich in hydrogen sulfide moves upward and mixes with fresh water e g meteoric water and surface water that moves downward a strong oxidation reaction i e the mixing dissolution or sulfuric acid dissolution will take place producing a large amount of sulfuric acid and dissolving limestones and dolomites the chemical reaction process is shown in equations 6 and 7 as suggested by hill 1995 and ford and williams 2007 6 h 2 s o 2 h hso 2 7 h 2 s hso 4 2h 2 o caco 3 ca 2 so 4 2 co 2 h 2 o the mixing dissolution sulfuric acid dissolution usually occurs in the water tables and the fault and fracture zones fig 12 where oxygen and hydrogen sulfide are easy to mix the mixing dissolution sulfuric acid dissolution was first proposed by egemeier 2011 who and many other scholars have proven that the sulfuric acid dissolution was the genesis of many caves around the world audra et al 2009 egemeier 2011 engel et al 2004 galdenzi and menichetti 1995 hill 2000 hill and polyak 2010 as seen in table 1 all cfs in group ⅵ were taken from caves and kccs and these caves and kccs are distributed in the fault zones around the carbonate outcrops fig 1a indicating that their formations are closely related to faults and sulfuric acid dissolution mixing dissolution 5 3 controlling factors of paleokarst and kccs 5 3 1 stratigraphic lithology and structure the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield are mainly composed of limestones fig 2 which account for more than 80 of the total thickness of the strata as previous studies showed that limestones were more available for dissolution and karstification than dolomites li 2017 liu et al 2005 herman 1982 pokrovsky et al 2005 in this study a large number of dissolution vugs fractures and caves have been found in the limestones of the zhangxia xuzhuang and maozhuang formations as shown in fig 4f and fig 5k l although the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield still contain 20 of the dolomites they were developed on the top of the cambrian and ordovician strata fig 2 and became the paleoweathering crusts where fractures and caves were well developed fig 6a thus compared with other areas in northern china the limestones in the cambrian carbonates in the huainan coalfield have a much larger proportion of limestones and a small amount of the dolomites which are mainly distributed in the cambrian paleoweathering crust such limestones are very conducive to the development of paleokarst and kccs in the cambrian extensive investigations showed that kccs in northern china are normally developed in enormously thick limestone strata above which are massive and complete sets of multi layer coal measure strata i e the carboniferous permian coal measure strata these multi layer coal measures can continuously provide corrosive formation water containing organic acid co2 h2s and ch4 which can easily penetrate the underlying ordovician and cambrian carbonates and promote karstification he et al 2009 lu et al 2013 furthermore researchers also found that these multi layer coal measure strata with a thin thickness well developed bedding and low strength were prone to roof collapse and upward development of kccs yin et al 2004 zuo et al 2009 thus this kind of multi layer coal measure strata not only provides corrosive fluid for karstification but also is conducive to the formation and development of kccs 5 3 2 corrosive fluids meteoric water formation water hydrothermal fluids and mixing fluids are the four main corrosive fluids for karstification in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield in the carbonate outcrops meteoric water is unsaturated and its dissolution capacity mainly comes from co2 in the atmosphere and paleosol han et al 2019 under meteoric water leaching many dissolution pores vugs fractures and caves are first formed on the carbonate surface fig 6a f and become the migration channels of atmospheric water and surface water in the hidden shallow and deep buried areas meteoric water preferentially penetrates the deep carbonate strata along fault and fracture systems under the action of gravity to dissolve the surrounding carbonate rocks and to enlarge the previous pores vugs and fractures as shown in fig 12 formation water is highly corrosive because it contains a lot of organic acids co2 h2s and ch4 which are squeezed out by the diagenetic compaction from the permian carboniferous strata li and cai 2017 wu et al 2007 zhao et al 2009 these acidic materials enter the carbonate rocks through pores fractures bedding planes and stylolites producing a large number of new pores and fractures however most of these pores and fractures are completely filled with calcites and or residual organic matters fig 5b d thus they might have little contribution to the porosity of the ordovician and cambrian carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield the hydrothermal fluids moved along deep faults and fractures from the deep basement to the shallow depth releasing a lot of thermal energy and acidic substances e g co2 h2s and so2 and inducing the thermochemical sulfate reduction tsr to produce more acidic gases e g co2 h2s han et al 2019 zhu et al 2015 these acid gases and solutions due to their strong corrosivity continue to enlarge the previous pores vugs and fractures during upward migration and produce many new pores vugs and fractures under hydraulic fracturing and acid corrosion of hydrothermal fluids fig 11 with the migration of the hydrothermal fluids from the deep to the shallow the dissolution capacity of the hydrothermal fluids gradually decreases while the precipitation and filling effect increases for example pores vugs and fractures formed by hydrothermal dissolution in the deep cambrian carbonate rocks are unfilled or semi filled with hydrothermal minerals fig 4c and d fig 5j l but they are completely filled in the ordovician carbonate rocks fig 4a fig 5g i mixing dissolution mainly occurred in the late cretaceous semi exposed karst stage when the formation water and hydrothermal fluids of rich hydrogen sulfide move upward through the fault and fracture systems and mix with fresh water of rich oxygen that moves downward a strong oxidation reaction will take place fig 12 producing a large amount of sulfuric acid and dissolving limestones and dolomite see equations 6 and 7 compared with the karstification of carbonic acid in the meteoric and formation water sulfuric acid in the mixing water can directly react with carbonate rocks and shows much stronger dissolution ability than carbonic acid many scholars have proven that many caves around the world were formed by sulfuric acid dissolution audra et al 2009 egemeier 2011 engel et al 2004 galdenzi and menichetti 1995 hill 2000 hill and polyak 2010 as mentioned earlier many caves and kccs distributed in the fault zones around the carbonate outcrops in the panji and chenqiao anticlines fig 1a are probably related to sulfuric acid dissolution mixing dissolution 5 3 3 geological structures 5 3 3 1 sedimentary unconformities fig 3 shows that the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield mainly experienced three uplifts during the burial history the first episode of uplift was in association with the early caledonian movement from the late cambrian to the early ordovician forming the cambrian paleoweathering crust karst in the tuba formation fig 13 a the second episode occurred in relation to the middle late caledonian movement from the middle ordovician to the middle carboniferous forming the ordovician paleoweathering crust karst in the majiagou formation fig 13b the third one was linked to the indochina and yanshan movements from the middle triassic to the late cretaceous which made parts of the cambrian ordovician carboniferous and permian strata in the chenqiao and panji anticlines exposed on the land surface again fig 1a due to long term meteoric dissolution of unconformities pores vugs fractures and caves in these paleoweathering crusts are well developed fig 6a c which become migration channels for meteoric water and surface water to move into the shallow and deep buried strata 5 3 3 2 tectonic geomorphology affected by multistage tectonic movements from the middle triassic to the late cretaceous a series of fold structures in the huainan coalfield were formed as shown in fig 1a due to these anticlines and synclines being situated in close proximity and large height difference the drainage system of the study area was significantly affected by the paleo landforms fig 12 according to li et al 2002 the triassic permian and carboniferous strata with a total thickness of more than 2000 m at the panji and chenqiao anticlines were weathered and eroded exposing parts of the ordovician and or cambrian carbonate rocks to the land surface again karstification not only occurred in the carbonate outcrops at the panji and chenqiao anticlines but also in the hidden shallow and deep ordovician and cambrian strata as shown in fig 12 for example many caves are not only found in the wells in the carbonate outcrops at the panji and chenqiao anticlines but also discovered in the wells in the hidden shallow and deep strata as shown in fig 1a 5 3 3 3 faults and fractures fig 1a shows that many caves and kccs are distributed around the fault and fracture zones indicating that their formations are closely related to faults and fractures firstly in the hidden shallow and deep buried regions meteoric water can infiltrate along faults and fractures to the deep of carbonate strata to dissolve the surrounding carbonate rocks fig 12 secondly faults and fractures can provide suitable passages for the downward flow of formation water especially below the carboniferous permian strata where low porosity and low permeability multi layer coals mudstones and sandy mudstone are presented fig 12 thirdly some deep faults and fractures might be the channels for the hydrothermal fluids to move upward fig 11 fig 12 and they connected deep materials with sedimentary formations through thermal convection wu et al 2007 cai et al 2008 li and cai 2017 zhang et al 2017 many hydrothermal minerals e g quartz flint pyroclastics chalcedony and pyrite organic matters muds and calcites are filled in pores vugs fractures caves and kccs in wells t1 t4 and kccs 2 3 6 fig 5g and h table 1 around the fault and fracture zones fig 1a indicating that their formations are all related to faults and fractures 5 4 evolution model of paleokarst and kccs in the huainan coalfield based on the stratigraphic sedimentary and tectonic evolution history of the huainan coalfield combined with the analysis on the dissolution mechanisms of corrosive fluids an evolution model of the paleokarst and kccs in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the study area was established which mainly included the following six stages as shown in fig 13 stage i cambrian paleoweathering crust karst stage the cambrian carbonates in the huainan coalfield were mainly formed in a carbonate platform environment which evolved into a silicified evaporation platform system during the late cambrian affected by the huaiyuan movement the study area was uplifted and exposed to the land surface during the late cambrian to the early ordovician with a duration of about 47 ma lin 2009 meteoric water firstly dissolved the siliceous dolomites at the top tuba formation of the upper cambrian fig 13a forming some dissolution pores vugs fractures fig 6g and caves fig 6a stage ii ordovician paleoweathering crust karst stage affected by the caledonian movement uplifts generally occurred in northern china in the late ordovician lasting about 120 ma xiao et al 2019 the ordovician strata were exposed to the land surface and leached by meteoric water fig 13b many fractures fig 6e and f vugs and caves fig 6b d were formed within 0 30 m below the ordovician unconformities which become the most developed horizon of the ordovician carbonate paleokarst and kccs in northern china stage iii pressure released water karst stage during the permian period the cambrian and ordovician strata entered a relatively deep closed environment driven by the pressure difference acidic materials such as organic acids carbon dioxide hydrogen sulfide methane etc produced by organic matter diagenesis and tsr in the permian carboniferous strata li and cai 2017 wu et al 2007 zhao et al 2009 penetrated the cambrian and ordovician carbonates and produced new pores and fractures fig 13c however most of these pores and fractures were completely filled with calcites and or residual organic matters fig 5b d stage iv hydrothermal karst stage from the middle triassic to late cretaceous the huainan region mainly experienced three magmatic and volcanic activities and the third one that occurred in the early cretaceous about 115 130 ma was the strongest one li et al 2002 zhang et al 2005 the hydrothermal fluids with high temperature and high pressure migrated upward or laterally along the faults and fractures causing the fluid pressure in the fault zones to rise and the fracture zones to expand through hydraulic fracturing fig 11 meanwhile the hydrothermal fluids carried volatile acid substances to flow along the previous pores vugs and fractures dissolving and enlarging them and producing many new pores vugs and fractures fig 13d many hydrothermal minerals such as quartz pyrite giant crystal calcite barite fluorite etc have been found in pores vugs fractures caves and kccs fig 5i fig 9a b d e the roots of kccs began to develop in the cambrian strata stage v mixing dissolution karst stage mixing dissolution primarily occurred in the late cretaceous when part of the ordovician and or cambrian carbonate rocks in the panji and chenqiao anticlines in the huainan coalfield were eroded and exposed on the land surface again fig 13e meteoric water not only leached the carbonate rocks in the carbonate outcrops but also flowed down from these outcrops to the deep carbonate strata through faults fractures caves bedding planes etc when meteoric water with rich oxygen moved downward and mixed with the formation water and hydrothermal fluids with rich hydrogen sulfide a strong oxidation reaction took place producing a large amount of sulfuric acid and forming much stronger dissolution fig 12 many caves and kccs in the fault zones around the panji and chenqiao anticlines fig 1a were both the productions of mixing dissolution stage ⅵ paleokarst and kccs development stagnation stage after the cenozoic strata was deposited the paleokarst of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates gradually stopped developing due to lack of fresh water supply and the roofs of kccs began to collapse downwards under gravity until a new mechanical balance was reached by this time the development of the paleokarst and kccs in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates in the huainan coalfield had basically ended as shown in fig 13f based on the above analysis it can be seen that the formations of caves and kccs in the huainan coalfield was based on ordovician and or cambrian carbonate rocks as the material basis and the multistage and multi type corrosive fluids including meteoric water formation water hydrothermal fluids and mixing fluids as the dissolution dynamic condition and the faults and fractures produced by multistage tectonic movements as fluid migration channels and then caves were first formed under the action of long term dissolution after the caves were formed under the combined action of rock mass stress tectonic stress and vacuum negative pressure in the caves the roof rock of the caves gradually collapsed upwards to form kccs the formation of kccs in the huainan coalfield was mainly related to hydrothermal dissolution and mixing dissolution and the middle triassic to the cenozoic was the key stage of the development of kccs and the fault fracture systems magmatic activities and carbonate outcrops played a key role in the formation and evolution of kccs in the huainan coalfield 5 5 prediction of paleokarst and kccs in the huainan coalfield 5 5 1 spatial distribution prediction based on the above analysis corrosive fluids and geological structures were the two main factors that controlled the development of the paleokarst and kccs of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonates geological structures such as unconformities faults folds and fractures provided migration channels for various corrosive fluids and controlled the range and depth of fluid movement and affected the spatial distribution of paleokarst and kccs thus we predicted that the paleokarst and kccs in the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield were mostly developed in four locations that is the cambrian and ordovician carbonate paleoweathering crusts the carbonate outcrops in the panji and chenqiao anticlines the fault and fracture zones in anticline slopes and some deep fault and fractures near magmatic rock intrusions the predicted results in this study are consistent with the distributions of caves and kccs that have been already revealed in the huainan coalfield overall as shown in fig 1a 5 5 2 mining and grouting activities impact on paleokarst and kccs with mining drainage activities in recent decades a large volume of groundwater was drained out and the groundwater level dropped sharply especially for the limestone aquifers of the ordovician and cambrian in which the water tables dropped ranging from a few meters to hundreds of meters zhang et al 2019a 2019b the groundwater in the upper aquifer recharged the lower aquifer through faults kccs and other geological structures accelerating the circulation of the entire groundwater system which might trigger a new round of mixing dissolution process zhang et al 2020a 2020b when the groundwaters from different aquifers are mixed the mixed groundwater could become unsaturated with calcite and start to dissolve carbonate rocks in addition coal mines always use grouting to strengthen and or transform the ordovician and or cambrian aquifers or to block the water inrush from kccs however grouting will introduce some fresh water and acid components into these aquifers thus a new kind of unsaturated calcium carbonate aqueous solution will be formed creating a new dissolution effect on the paleokarst and kccs of the middle cambrian lower ordovician therefore mining and grouting activities may cause parts of paleokarst and kccs to revival thereby inducing a new round of karst hydrogeological disasters such as karst collapse kccs karst water inrush and cross contamination of karst water and so on 6 conclusions through a comprehensive analysis using observed and measured datasets through petrological and geochemical methods the following conclusions can be made from this study five types of the paleokarst of the middle cambrian lower ordovician in the huainan coalfield were found which are pores vugs fractures caves and kccs among which kccs are a unique paleokarst geological structure existed in northern china coalfield four types and sources of corrosive fluids dissolving the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks were determined and they are meteoric water formation water hydrothermal fluids and mixing fluids each type of fluid had unique dissolution mechanism as discussed above the formation of cambrian kccs in the huainan coalfield is mainly related to hydrothermal dissolution and mixing dissolution as well as the thick limestones and developed faults and fractures in the cambrian strata stratigraphic lithology corrosive fluids and geological structures are the three main factors that control the development and spatial distribution of the paleokarst and kccs of the middle cambrian lower ordovician carbonate rocks in the huainan coalfield the cambrian and ordovician paleoweathering crusts the carbonate outcrops in anticlines the fault and fracture zones in anticline slopes and the deep fault and fractures near magmatic rock intrusions are the favorite places for paleokarst and kccs development credit authorship contribution statement haitao zhang conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft writing review editing guangquan xu

4294,the discharge of a significant amount of wastewater from the urban agglomerations in the rivers is the primary cause for the degradation of the river s assimilative capacity the re aeration process represents an interaction among the air water interface to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere and indicates the capacity of the water to hold the oxygen that can be used in the degradation of pollutants without affecting the river s health therefore accurate estimation of re aeration capacity is the prime requirement to maintain the riverine ecosystem in this paper an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis is used to simulate the non linear behaviour of various water quality parameters by estimating the re aeration coefficient of yamuna river delhi the hydraulic and water quality parameters are used to identify the most optimal combination of input parameters for simulation through the takagi sugeno ts anfis model the results of anfis are ensembled with the time series autoregressive integrated moving average arima model to minimize bagging non stationarity and biasing the performance of the anfis models was measured using the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of correlation r the arima models are evaluated based on standard error p value and t test out of the five different anfis models anfis 5 provides the optimal values of r during training and testing of the model as 0 966 and 0 989 respectively and integrated with the arima model to obtain the re aeration coefficient for each sampling location the results indicate that the ensembled anfis arima model reduces the variance significantly with the minimum error of 0 0075 and produces an exceptional improvement in predicting the re aeration coefficient keywords re aeration coefficient yamuna river anfis arima 1 introduction rivers are obstructed regularly to meet the needs of urban and suburban areas the regular abstraction of water from the river for domestic supply and irrigation purposes discharge of industrial and domestic effluents affects the river s hydrology during the lean period the low flow in river discharge of untreated wastewater and runoff from urban areas altered the river hydrology drastically the interaction of physio chemical water quality parameters with impurities enhances the complexity of chemical reactions occurring in river among water quality parameters dissolved oxygen do is the most crucial parameter for determining a river s health the deterioration of do starts when either the treated or untreated wastewater from open drains joins the water body containing organic impurities hanbay et al 2009 and continues until all the organic matter decomposes the do replenishes majorly by atmospheric re aeration process and oxygen generation through photosynthesis in contrast decomposition of organic matter sediment oxygen demand and respiration by aquatic plants are the major sinks of oxygen senhorst and zwolsman 2005 arora and keshari 2018 the dynamics of these water quality parameters and their non linear interactions loperfido et al 2009 ranković et al 2010 and the relation between the hydrological and hydraulic parameters wang et al 2015 ghane et al 2016 zounemat kermani et al 2016 al aboodi et al 2017 2018 arora and keshari 2020 in the riverine ecosystem make it challenging to apply statistical models to predict water quality the location of sparsely located hydrological and metrological stations reliability of data concurrency of data from different sources are the major limitations that necessitate the need for improved models for the prediction of river water quality the application of soft computing techniques data driven models has increased recently in water resource engineering and produce outstanding results in predicting the complex non linear systems singh et al 2004 parmar and bhardwaj 2014 emamgholizadeh et al 2014 zounemat kermani et al 2016 katimon et al 2017 arora and keshari 2018 the artificial neural network ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and support vector machine svm are widely used techniques in the water quality prediction estimation of growth in water demand for various purposes and design of water resource management programs zounemat kermani and scholz 2014 parmar and bhardwaj 2015 sarkar and pandey 2015 yaseen et al 2017 tiyasha et al 2020 anfis requires less time to train the model and define the problem due to the lesser dimensions and better initialization of parameters yaseen et al 2017 bou fakhreddine et al 2018 the combination of fuzzy logic with the neural network technique increases the model accuracy by incorporating fuzzy reasoning parameters aqil et al 2006 mayilvaganan and naidu 2011 it also helps to remove fuzzy logic drawback to generate the systematic control system and provides a better adaptation and design of a well organized input output structure using neural network learning ability chang and chang 2006 arora and keshari 2020 wang et al 2009 utilize ann anfis autoregressive moving average arma and svm to quantify the river discharge and concluded that anfis could design models with greater accuracy over other techniques ranković et al 2012 compared the anfis and radial basis function rbf models to predict the streamflow results indicate that anfis performs better as compared to rbf and produces a model with better efficiency parmar and bhardwaj 2015 applied ann anfis and wavelet couple models to predict the cod of yamuna river india and observed that wavelet coupling with fuzzy proves the highest accuracy the prediction of water quality parameter ebtehaj et al 2017 determined the weir s discharge coefficient using anfis and employed a genetic algorithm ga to identify input parameters in the anfis al aboodi et al 2017 compared the ann anfis and arima to predict river flow they estimated that anfis has better performance over the other two techniques due to the enormous rule base and ability of anfis to perform the database s clustering anfis has the advantage of increasing the model accuracy by selecting an appropriate model or hybrid model to predict various parameters tiwari et al 2018 designed the water quality index wqi for satluj river india using subtractive clustering sc and fuzzy c means fcm methods of anfis the performance evaluation of the two methods of anfis concluded that sc anfis has better prediction efficiency over fcm anfis galavi et al 2013 tiwari et al 2018 elkiran et al 2018 modelled the do of the yamuna river in mathura india using ffnn anfis and multivariate linear regression mlr and found that anfis performed better than the other two methods and can handle the nonlinearity of the dataset accurately ahmed et al 2019 had compared the various modelling techniques such as mlp ann rbf ann anfis and wdt anfis for analyzing the water quality and found that technologies that use fuzzy logic outperform the neural networking methods arima is another growing technique that can predict the time series data arima is a combination of autoregressive ar integrated i and moving average ma that has been applied successfully in water resource applications hanh et al 2010 ullah and choudhury 2013 katimon et al 2017 hanh et al 2010 identifies the combined impact of hydrology and climate on the mekong river s water quality using arima models and produced consistent positive results ömer faruk 2010 predicted the water quality of parameters like temperature dissolved oxygen and boron utilizing the combination of arima features with a neural network to handle both the linear and non linear relationships among parameters irvine et al 2011 also used arima to estimate the water quality using physio chemical parameters and water levels in the mekong river using arima the arima model results successfully predicted the trend for one month ahead valipour et al 2012 compared arima and arma to forecast the water in the reservoir and found that arima produces a better model over arma for time series data analysis arima can generate a new set of time series data from the input data with similar statistical parameters abba et al 2019 compared the linear arima and generalized linear regression and non linear models radial basis function neural network rbfnn and hammerstein weiner model on the kinta river and yamuna river they found that the non linear model outperformed the linear model and rbfnn achieves the highest accuracy it was concluded from the literature review that most of the studies had been carried out considering one or more than one artificial intelligence techniques and various techniques have been compared for different dataset to obtain the highest performing model whereas very few studies were found with an ensemble approach to minimize the drawback of one technique by integrating with another the integration of two approaches is a complex process and significant efforts are required to identify the two techniques complementing each other in obtaining the ensemble model with better performance in this study a model is designed to simulate the re aeration coefficient of yamuna river using the five year dataset the hydraulic and water quality parameters are used in the model s input as both concurrently affect the water quality mohd et al 2012 the best anfis model results are ensembled with the arima model to optimize the water quality simulation the combination of anfis and arima is not being used to generate the re aeration coefficient of the river the accuracy of the model was tested out using root mean square error rmse coefficient of correlation r and coefficient of determination r2 as the sampling sites vary significantly at shorter distances arima is applied to obtain the coefficient specific for each location 2 study area and database 2 1 study area yamuna river originates from yamunotri india located at 31 01 n and 78 46 e and confluences to ganga river in allahabad india after travelling 1376 km from its origin after flowing 114 km from the origin the yamuna river is obstructed by an enormous obstruction on river the hathnikund barrage diverts the water into eastern and western yamuna canals for irrigation purposes of haryana and uttar pradesh before the operation of the hathnikund barrage there was sufficient flow in the yamuna river throughout its length however the hathnikund barrage reduced the flow downstream by abstracting approximately 97 of river water soni et al 2014 after flowing 348 km in himachal pradesh and haryana states of india the yamuna river enters delhi at village palla and runs through the sub urban parts of delhi till wazirabad barrage as shown in fig 1 at the barrage most of the water available in the main river channel gets abstracted for the city s water supply and other needs approximately 950 million litres per day mld of water get abstracted from the river accounting for 95 of available water cpcb 2006 almost no water remains in the river downstream of the barrage the condition of the river becomes threatened in the stretch of 22 km from wazirabad to okhla barrage the downstream of the wazirabad barrage the river receives wastewater from several drains as shown in fig 2 the most substantial drain is the najafgarh drain which discharges about five times the river flow and causes the maximum deterioration of the water quality in between wazirabad and okhla barrage 17 drains discharge themselves at the river s right bank at regular intervals before another abstraction from the river to agra canal four drains also join the agra canal containing effluents of the city agra canal takes the water for irrigation in haryana and no freshwater is left in the river downstream of the okhla barrage shahdara drain containing the effluents from the northeast of delhi discharges the downstream of okhla barrage and further deteriorates the river condition as shown in fig 2 the study area falls into a subtropical zone and observes a long summer season with significant day and night temperature variation delhi receives the average annual precipitation of 790 mm having maximum rainfall in july and august i e around 470 mm followed by 190 mm in june and september hence there are higher chances of diluting the water quality of the yamuna river due to the river s direct flow and runoff the average summer temperature of delhi is around 32 c whereas the maximum reaches up to 45 c during winters the average temperature remains around 12 c and the minimum temperature falls up to 2 c the study area observes the day temperature more than 30 c for about eight months in a year indicates the less solubility of oxygen from the atmosphere to the river which in turn harms the self purification capacity of the river due to the less available oxygen concentration 2 2 data collection and analysis the study was conducted for five years 2006 2010 at the four monitoring stations the first sampling location was just 0 3 km downstream of the wazirabad barrage before the confluence of najafgarh drain into the river at the downstream of the barrage najafgarh drain joins the river at merely 0 5 km and discharges about four times the flow available in the river cpcb 2006 ito bridge nizamuddin and okhla barrage are other monitoring stations as shown in fig 2 after wazirabad two major drains najafgarh drain and supplementary drain and eight minor drains join before the ito at the downstream of ito wastewater from the power plant and domestic drains enters the river at the right bank nizamuddin reflects the characteristics of wastewater received from the drains carrying the domestic and industrial discharge in contrast water quality at the okhla barrage sampling location is diluted due to the confluence of hindon cut canal s into the river at the left bank ito is approximately 11 km downstream of wazirabad nizamuddin is 14 km downstream and okhla is 19 6 km downstream of wazirabad barrage as shown in table 1 the study area observes extreme weather throughout the year the subtropical conditions produce high air temperature during summer and very low winter air temperature the maximum water temperature observed was 11 c and the maximum observed was 32 5 c and no significant difference in the temperature of different sampling locations was observed the minimum ph of the study area was found 6 89 and the maximum value of 8 56 do was found only at wazirabad barrage in the range of 4 5 12 1 mg l whereas at other sampling locations do remains zero throughout the year except for monsoon season low bod was found at the wazirabad barrage in the range of 0 5 7 mg l whereas at other sampling sites the minimum bod was found as 2 0 mg l and maximum rises to 57 mg l similarly low cod ammonia and tkn were observed at wazirabad barrage and high at other locations the maximum cod value was 161 mg l found at nizamuddin however conductivity does not vary significantly in the study area only a few instances of high conductivity were observed during the monsoon season the biological parameters were also found low at wazirabad and high at other locations all these changes in the characteristics of water quality parameters are observed due to the confluence of najafgarh supplementary drain downstream of wazirabad barrage and subsequent smaller drains the variation in water quality parameters is shown in table 2 the monthly samples were collected from each location for 60 months and in situ and ex situ analysis was carried out in cumulative 240 samples were collected from four stations and analyzed as per the apha standard procedure apha 2005 the samples were also preserved using hydrochloric acid to maintain the ph before performing the analysis in the laboratory in the laboratory analysis was carried out within 24 h of sample collection the parameters such as ph temperature c conductivity µs cm and dissolved oxygen do mg l were analyzed on site using a portable instrument in contrast biochemical oxygen demand bod mg l chemical oxygen demand cod mg l ammonia µmol cm total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn µmol cm were determined in the laboratory all the parameters were analyzed using the standard method as recommended by apha 2005 the hydraulic characteristics of rivers such as flow m3 s velocity m s depth m and width m were obtained from the study conducted by parmar and keshari 2012 3 methodology the value of re aeration coefficients is being affected by the cumulative impact of various hydraulic and hydrological parameters the identification of adequate parameters for the estimation of the re aeration coefficient is the prime concern anfis is used to identify the appropriate combination of parameters that can simulate the river s re aeration coefficient the combination of hydraulic as well as water quality parameters considered for the formulation of the optimum model the optimum anfis model results combined with the arima to simulate linear and non linear behaviour of the parameters fig 3 shows the detailed methodology adopted for the study 3 1 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis is a combination of a feed forward neural network and fuzzy inference system can model the system with the arrangement of neurons using neural network and fuzzy logic anfis organizes the input output data selection based on learning techniques and constructs input output mapping using fuzzy rules for the application of fuzzy rules two commonly used fuzzy inference systems fis are mamdani fuzzy inference system m fis and takagi sugeno fuzzy inference system ts fis both the fis have different fuzzification and de fuzzification procedures however ts fis produces more compact and accurate results than m fis takagi and sugeno 1985 el shafie et al 2007 for anfis structure a minimum of two inputs x1 and x2 and two fuzzy if then rule for output y required as shown in fig 4 the rule base presents the feed forward equations of anfis contains two takagi sugeno if then rules as follows if x is a1 and y is b1 then f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 rule 1 if x is a2 and y is b2 then f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 1 rule 2 anfis structure described in 5 layers excluding the input layer toprak 2009 that can be described as a multi layered neural network layer 0 define the input layer with n no of nodes layer 1 it provides the membership function of each node through the fuzzification of gaussian rules as μ a i x e x p x c i a i 2 b i where ai bi and ci are the adaptive parameter functions the values of these functions are assigned based on the algorithm selected during the training of the program these parameters are known as premise parameters after assigning the values to the adaptive parameters each input node is trained against the different membership functions to obtain the value of the premise parameter layer 2 each fuzzified node is passed through and operator to strengthened each node the membership values μ a i x and μ b i y are multiplied to gain the strength where and y are the linguistic values of ai and bi and w i is the antecedent function of rule 1 w i μ a i x μ b i y layer 3 all the nodes are normalized with the provided strength as w i w i j 1 r w j where w i is the sum of the strength of ith operators computed in layer 2 layer 4 each node computes the linear function where the coefficient of functions is calculated using a backpropagation neural network s error w i f i w i p 0 x 0 p 1 x 1 p 2 where pi is the parameter for i input values and w i is the output of layer 3 the model is trained using the least square approximation method layer 5 this represents the summation of outputs of every node obtained from the layer 4 computed as follows and the detailed architecture of anfis shown in fig 4 i w i f i i w i f i i w i input spaces in anfis are divided into different parts to create local spaces while designing the complex non linear models which further employs the local model that becomes linear for each partitioned input space for splitting the anfis input function the model uses fuzzy mfs which covers the input space and activate the several local regions simultaneously using single input by overlapping zounemat kermani and scholz 2014 the number of membership function mf plays a vital role as the mfs controls the resolution of the partitioned input functions and approximation of the anfis model grid partitioning and sub clustering are the commonly used method for fis generation with varying numbers of mfs based on input data triangular and gaussian are widely used mfs with a linear system the optimization method available for the training of mfs is the backpropagation algorithm and hybrid learning algorithm firat and güngör 2007 inference operations are identified through fuzzy if then rules and mfs are used to define the rules each fuzzy unit converts the received input to the fuzzy set and fis receives either fuzzy sets or crisp input to model mfs and delivers the fuzzy sets information to the output layer the de fuzzification interface again converts the fuzzy set into a crisp output nayak et al 2005 out of two commonly available fis for anfis modelling ts fis produces more accurate and simplified results ts fis derive the linear output function using a first order polynomial of the input variables and known as first order ts fis function whereas with constant output function known as zero order ts fis takagi and sugeno 1985 shu and ouarda 2007 the selection of a particular mf and the number of rules plays an integral part in designing anfis architecture researchers have concluded that gaussian mf delivers improved results over triangular mf in practice aqil et al 2006 tiwari et al 2018 and produces the minimum mean square error using different input output pairs 3 2 autoregressive integrated moving average arima is a time series model that represents the data with different stochastic processes arima implements the linear model in the time series and follows the statistical distribution such as the normal distribution parmar and bhardwaj 2015 arima is flexible to build the optimal model with numerous time series variations using box jenkins s methodology an arima n m model is the hybrid model of two generalized forms of models autoregressive ar n and moving average ma m models which are frequently used for univariate non stationary time series modelling ar and mar are the generic models and the combination of both is used to develop the time series model known as the arma model alsudani and liu 2017 arma n m represented using mathematical functions as y t c t i 1 n i y t i j 1 m j y t j y t c 1 y t 1 2 y t 2 n y t n t where n and m represent the autoregressive and moving average terms respectively acf and pacf are used to identify the optimal model of time series data these are the two statistical measures that identify the inter relation between the observations parmar and bhardwaj 2015 to develop the model and predict the variables acf and pacf are plotted against the time lag generated from manipulating the lag operator ranking of the ar and ma models are identified using the plots of acf and pacf backshift in the observations is generated in arma using the lag function the lag function in the model estimated as l y t y t however the arima is an advanced version of the arma model and can handle the non stationarity of data mathematically arima n d m models are represented with the inclusion of lag function as l 1 l d y t θ l ε t 1 i 1 n i l i 1 l d y t 1 j 1 m j l j ε t where n d and m represent the order of autoregressive integrated and moving average functions respectively the value of these functions can be zero or greater than zero the integer d is the crucial function in between the arima and arma models because as and when the value of d becomes zero the arima model reduces to arma for most of the arima model the preferred value of d is equal to one 3 3 evaluation of anfis and arima models water quality and hydraulic parameters were combined to design the various models using anfis and arima models to identify and predict the yamuna river s re aeration coefficient five different combinations of input parameters were used to design the model to simulate the re aeration coefficient with high accuracy and the least deviation from the observed values input parameters considered in study for designing the models are flow m3 s velocity m s depth m bod mg l do mg l and conductivity μs cm whereas re aeration coefficient is taken as output parameter the performance of all the developed models is compared using coefficient correlation r coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse r i 1 n k pi k p k mi k m i 1 n k pi k p 2 i 1 n k mi k m 2 1 2 r 2 1 i 1 n k pi k mi 2 i 1 n k pi k p 2 rmse i 1 n k pi k mi 2 n kp 1 day is the predicted re aeration coefficient and km 1 day is the measured coefficient k p 1 day and k m 1 day are the means of predicted and measured re aeration coefficients respectively for the n number of observations the coefficient of determination is also commonly known as the coefficient of efficiency which may be written in several ways and represents the fraction of variance explained by the regression the coefficient of determination compares the residual and initial variance and could vary depending upon the initial variance of observed data the value of r2 closer to unity indicates a good correlation the correlation coefficient represents the degree of relationship between the observed and estimated values 4 model development and application 4 1 model description the hydraulic and water quality parameters were considered for designing the input parameters of the models the dataset was divided into training and testing in a 70 30 ratio the training part of the dataset is applied to train the model and testing is considered for the model s performance evaluation in this study matlab 2018 is used as a modelling tool to design the anfis models for anfis ts fis is used to study the variation and prediction of the re aeration coefficient gaussian mf is used with three mfs for each input the varying number of inputs with various parameters are the primary criteria for designing the models the grid partitioning gp method was applied to develop if then fuzzy rules for the models with fewer input variables and subtractive clustering was used for the models with significant input parameters anfis gp divides the multidimensional data into similar fuzzy regions using the parallel partition to form the clusters considering the number and type of mfs and designs the fuzzy rules based on the number of input parameters fuzzy logic identifies the center of each cluster with multiple iterations to minimize the center arima is the time series forecasting model and effective in forecasting issues out of the various combinations of anfis models the model with the lowest rmse and highest r2 is selected as an input to the arima model to predict the re aeration coefficient as arima is a univariate technique arima uses the box jenkins method to combine the autoregressive and moving average for the model forecasting the gaussian distribution function used to define the arima model on the different order of differencing autoregressive and moving average the output is calculated using the maximum likelihood criterion used to determine the maximum probability of the parameter that contains the maximum information about the time series 4 2 development of anfis models five different combinations of input parameters depth velocity discharge dissolved oxygen biochemical oxygen demand and conductivity are designed in anfis to predict the impact of parameters on the variation of the re aeration coefficient of the river as shown in table 3 the robustness of the anfis is based on the generation of rule base with the contribution of membership function for each input combination arora and keshari 2020 models were designed using anfis gp algorithms with the linear type gaussian mf and each model runs for 20 epochs anfis consumes the operation time based on the number of input parameters and the number of mfs defined for each input the anfis 1 contains only two input parameters and three mfs of each input which form nine fuzzy rules for deriving the relation between input and output parameters the anfis 5 contains the six input parameters and 3 mfs for each input which generates the 729 fuzzy rules the anfis 5 took the maximum computational space and time to handle the relation between input and output parameters through 729 fuzzy rules as shown in table 4 anfis network uses the integration of least square and backpropagation for the optimization of models the errors in models were minimized by estimating differences between measured and observed values of the re aeration coefficient at each epoch the number of fuzzy rules handling the complexity in a model increase with the input parameters the results obtained from the training and testing of anfis models are shown in table 5 it is evident from the table that anfis 5 performed better than the other models each anfis model reaches minimum error in the different number of epochs the performance of models is evaluated using r r2 and rmse the model with r2 between 0 50 and 0 75 is considered a satisfactory model whereas models with r2 higher than 0 75 are considered a good model among all the models the r2 of anfis 1 during training was found less than 0 75 whereas other models fall into a good category model having r2 greater than 0 75 a significant improvement was observed in anfis model performance from anfis 1 to anfis 5 while increasing the input parameters the addition of discharge and do in anfis 2 and anfis 3 respectively improves the performance marginally compared to the anfis 1 model in contrast a significant change in r and r2 was observed with the inclusion of bod and conductivity in anfis 4 and anfis 5 respectively the minimum enhancement of r2 was found between anfis 1 and anfis 2 in training and testing the model indicating discharge has a low impact on the river s re aeration coefficient compared to velocity and depth the most significant hydraulic parameters are velocity and depth as identified by several researchers for clear rivers for the hydrologically altered rivers receiving significant discharge from multiple points and non point sources hydraulic parameters are not enough to estimate the river s re aeration coefficient the maximum change in model performance was observed with the inclusion of bod as an input parameter in the training of anfis 4 in comparison with anfis 3 at 11 2 however during the model testing the maximum improvement of 13 85 was observed in anfis 5 from anfis 4 such a jump in the model performance suggests the significant impact of bod and conductivity in varying the river s re aeration the anfis 5 comes out with minimum rmse and maximum during both training and testing of the model r2 was found in anfis 5 was 0 933 and 0 978 for training and testing the model respectively which indicates the contribution of water quality parameters in the variation of the re aeration coefficient fig 5 shows the plots of predicted and observed re aeration coefficient where output is the re aeration coefficient and the index is the number of samples the observed data points of the training are represented with a hollow circle and testing are shown with dots blue whereas the predicted results are shown with an asterisk red in training and testing of anfis 5 the observed data points are not visible during model testing indicating highly accurate positioning of predicted data points with the observed data points the high performances by the anfis 5 containing both the hydraulic and water quality parameters are attributed to the fact that the re aeration coefficient is significantly affected by both the hydraulic and water quality parameters especially for the river contains the organic impurities and a significant part of do is consumed to decompose the organic matter these conditions become prevalent when the river s water quality falls in class c or below cpcb 2006 for clear rivers falling in class a or b the hydraulic properties significantly influence the river flow and re aeration can only be determined using velocity and depth however when the organic and other impurities join the river the velocity of flow turbulence in the water and depth of bed are affected by the change in viscosity of water change in slope and silting of impurities at the river bed respectively the bod and conductivity selected in the anfis model represent the organic and inorganic impurities respectively present in water the concentration of impurities directly affects the flow by increasing the viscosity and retard the flow velocity the reduction in flow velocity reduces the turbulence and again reduces the oxygen regeneration capacity of the river hence the presence of impurities consumes available oxygen and reduces the oxygen regeneration capacity therefore in polluted rivers like the yamuna river the role of water quality parameters cannot be ignored while designing the re aeration coefficient of the river otherwise the model would not predict the accurate regeneration capacity of the river and produce inaccurate results 4 3 ensemble model arima implements the linear model in the time series and follows the statistical distribution such as the normal distribution parmar and bhardwaj 2015 the rate of generation of oxygen from the atmosphere at the water surface depends on several processes that could be either linear or non linear in order to either reduce the error involved in the anfis model and to map the linearity function in data series by reducing the non stationarity of the data results obtained from best fit anfis model is considered as input to the arima model to generate the hybrid model for the prediction of re aeration coefficient with high accuracy and precision anfis 5 had the highest accuracy among all the anfis models and residuals of anfis 5 are combined with the arima to further enhance model prediction efficiency the ensemble model would capture both the anfis and arima benefits and generate the results with combined features that would produce a model with high accuracy the structure of the arima model is based on the order of autoregressive p order of moving average q and degree of transformation d the autocorrelation acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf are used to determine the arima model s best structure the acf performs the cutoff at lag q for determining the moving average in contrast pacf performs the cutoff at lag p for determining autoregressive function arima models are generated using the gaussian distribution method with one lag for each data point four arima models are designed with different order autoregressive and moving average functions and degree of transformation as shown in table 6 the l defines the lag operator yt is the actual error ε t is the random error a n d θ are the model parameters and c is a constant to determine the best possible structure of the arima model acf and pacf are used the acf and pacf for the re aeration coefficient are shown in fig 6 the figures indicate that p and q conclude within the sample set without any transformation the lag due to stationary series is determined using autoregressive lag of forecasted errors is determined using moving average and degree of transformation helps to identify the time series lag in arima 1 the zero order autoregressive and moving average function is considered the first order of difference transformation as shown in table 6 similarly other arima models are defined with separate autoregressive and moving average function order and difference transformation the performance of the arima models arima 1 arima 2 arima 3 and arima 4 was evaluated using various statistical techniques and it was found that arima with zero order of autoregressive and moving average function with first order of difference transformation performs better than the higher order functions the autocorrelation results indicate the sample size is adequate concise within the confidence limits the standard error t statistics and p value of arima p d q are taken for the performance evaluation of models are shown in table 7 all the arima models variants produce approximately similar results however arima 1 gives the lowest standard error out of these four models whereas arima 4 gives the better value of the p value in arima 2 a high standard error was observed for ar and ma and produced a nominal p value arima 3 produces a low standard error however the p value was found insignificant similarly a low standard error from ar of arima 4 was found but produced an insignificant p value fig 7 indicates the higher correlation between the observed and predicted re aeration coefficient from different arima models only arima 1 produces both low standard error and significant p value while performing both the first order of autoregressive and moving average the model result deteriorates due to the overstretching as the data set contains the modified values from the anfis it was observed that anfis recorded the non linearity of the data point and the non stationary is handled at the first order of difference transformation the moving average provides adds simple exponential smoothing to model but increases the standard error in observed and predicted values the greater peaks and troughs are observed in arima 2 and arima 4 compared to arima 1 and arima 3 model fig 7 the comparison plot of arima 3 looks similar to arima 1 but having higher value of standard error hence no further autoregressive and moving average are required to minimize the error of transformation hence the arima 1 0 1 0 produces the most optimal results with the least computational space the combination of anfis with arima produces a desirable feature that can be used as a potential tool for identifying the channel s re aeration coefficient for each specific location with significantly varying water quality and hydraulic properties the selection of appropriate parameters for the prediction is the prime requirement the input parameters vary significantly depending upon the characteristics of the study area the re aeration model designed by various researchers is only based on hydraulic parameters arora and keshari 2021 the process of re aeration for hydrologically altered rivers cannot be determined using the hydraulic parameter as the water quality parameters due to the anthropogenic disturbance significantly affect the hydrology of the river the results show that a combination of hydraulic and water quality parameters improves the re aeration modelling efficiency tremendously the ensemble approach further reduces the error significantly in predicting the re aeration coefficient the optimal anfis and arima model in combination can mimic the re aeration process of the river and justifies that the approach is acceptable for policy formulation related to river quality management river water diversion and river maintenance work the amount of wastewater that can be discharged into the river and the level of treatment required before the discharge can also be determined by simulating the water quality using a newly developed re aeration modelling approach 5 conclusion the re aeration coefficient for the polluted stretch of river is determined using the anfis and arima ensemble approach the anfis gp is used to develop the five different models considering the various combinations of input parameters to simulate the re aeration coefficient of the yamuna river the performance of models obtained from the anfis was evaluated using r r2 and rmse to identify the model accuracy anfis 5 which contains the six input parameters generates the optimal model with the least rmse of 0 103 in testing and the highest r2 of 0 933 and 0 978 in model training and testing the combination of hydraulic and water quality parameters improves the prediction efficiency drastically the residuals of anfis are integrated with arima to form the anfis arima ensemble model utilizing the time series forecasting of arima with the if then rule based analysis of anfis the ensembled model was applied to the study area to predict the re aeration coefficient considering both the non linear and linear relationship between the parameters using anfis and arima the results reveal that the hybrid model further reduces the anfis model s errors and significantly improves the model efficiency arima performs the difference operation for non stationary time series data and the combined model utilizes the logic function along with the difference operation to increase the accuracy of the model the study s critical outcome reflects that for the simulation of the re aeration coefficient of rivers which receives wastewater load water quality parameters hold good along with the hydraulic parameters the fast and accurate evaluation of the re aeration coefficient would also support the formulation of water resource management policies which primarily depend upon the river s water quality funding this research did not

4294,the discharge of a significant amount of wastewater from the urban agglomerations in the rivers is the primary cause for the degradation of the river s assimilative capacity the re aeration process represents an interaction among the air water interface to absorb oxygen from the atmosphere and indicates the capacity of the water to hold the oxygen that can be used in the degradation of pollutants without affecting the river s health therefore accurate estimation of re aeration capacity is the prime requirement to maintain the riverine ecosystem in this paper an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis is used to simulate the non linear behaviour of various water quality parameters by estimating the re aeration coefficient of yamuna river delhi the hydraulic and water quality parameters are used to identify the most optimal combination of input parameters for simulation through the takagi sugeno ts anfis model the results of anfis are ensembled with the time series autoregressive integrated moving average arima model to minimize bagging non stationarity and biasing the performance of the anfis models was measured using the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of correlation r the arima models are evaluated based on standard error p value and t test out of the five different anfis models anfis 5 provides the optimal values of r during training and testing of the model as 0 966 and 0 989 respectively and integrated with the arima model to obtain the re aeration coefficient for each sampling location the results indicate that the ensembled anfis arima model reduces the variance significantly with the minimum error of 0 0075 and produces an exceptional improvement in predicting the re aeration coefficient keywords re aeration coefficient yamuna river anfis arima 1 introduction rivers are obstructed regularly to meet the needs of urban and suburban areas the regular abstraction of water from the river for domestic supply and irrigation purposes discharge of industrial and domestic effluents affects the river s hydrology during the lean period the low flow in river discharge of untreated wastewater and runoff from urban areas altered the river hydrology drastically the interaction of physio chemical water quality parameters with impurities enhances the complexity of chemical reactions occurring in river among water quality parameters dissolved oxygen do is the most crucial parameter for determining a river s health the deterioration of do starts when either the treated or untreated wastewater from open drains joins the water body containing organic impurities hanbay et al 2009 and continues until all the organic matter decomposes the do replenishes majorly by atmospheric re aeration process and oxygen generation through photosynthesis in contrast decomposition of organic matter sediment oxygen demand and respiration by aquatic plants are the major sinks of oxygen senhorst and zwolsman 2005 arora and keshari 2018 the dynamics of these water quality parameters and their non linear interactions loperfido et al 2009 ranković et al 2010 and the relation between the hydrological and hydraulic parameters wang et al 2015 ghane et al 2016 zounemat kermani et al 2016 al aboodi et al 2017 2018 arora and keshari 2020 in the riverine ecosystem make it challenging to apply statistical models to predict water quality the location of sparsely located hydrological and metrological stations reliability of data concurrency of data from different sources are the major limitations that necessitate the need for improved models for the prediction of river water quality the application of soft computing techniques data driven models has increased recently in water resource engineering and produce outstanding results in predicting the complex non linear systems singh et al 2004 parmar and bhardwaj 2014 emamgholizadeh et al 2014 zounemat kermani et al 2016 katimon et al 2017 arora and keshari 2018 the artificial neural network ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and support vector machine svm are widely used techniques in the water quality prediction estimation of growth in water demand for various purposes and design of water resource management programs zounemat kermani and scholz 2014 parmar and bhardwaj 2015 sarkar and pandey 2015 yaseen et al 2017 tiyasha et al 2020 anfis requires less time to train the model and define the problem due to the lesser dimensions and better initialization of parameters yaseen et al 2017 bou fakhreddine et al 2018 the combination of fuzzy logic with the neural network technique increases the model accuracy by incorporating fuzzy reasoning parameters aqil et al 2006 mayilvaganan and naidu 2011 it also helps to remove fuzzy logic drawback to generate the systematic control system and provides a better adaptation and design of a well organized input output structure using neural network learning ability chang and chang 2006 arora and keshari 2020 wang et al 2009 utilize ann anfis autoregressive moving average arma and svm to quantify the river discharge and concluded that anfis could design models with greater accuracy over other techniques ranković et al 2012 compared the anfis and radial basis function rbf models to predict the streamflow results indicate that anfis performs better as compared to rbf and produces a model with better efficiency parmar and bhardwaj 2015 applied ann anfis and wavelet couple models to predict the cod of yamuna river india and observed that wavelet coupling with fuzzy proves the highest accuracy the prediction of water quality parameter ebtehaj et al 2017 determined the weir s discharge coefficient using anfis and employed a genetic algorithm ga to identify input parameters in the anfis al aboodi et al 2017 compared the ann anfis and arima to predict river flow they estimated that anfis has better performance over the other two techniques due to the enormous rule base and ability of anfis to perform the database s clustering anfis has the advantage of increasing the model accuracy by selecting an appropriate model or hybrid model to predict various parameters tiwari et al 2018 designed the water quality index wqi for satluj river india using subtractive clustering sc and fuzzy c means fcm methods of anfis the performance evaluation of the two methods of anfis concluded that sc anfis has better prediction efficiency over fcm anfis galavi et al 2013 tiwari et al 2018 elkiran et al 2018 modelled the do of the yamuna river in mathura india using ffnn anfis and multivariate linear regression mlr and found that anfis performed better than the other two methods and can handle the nonlinearity of the dataset accurately ahmed et al 2019 had compared the various modelling techniques such as mlp ann rbf ann anfis and wdt anfis for analyzing the water quality and found that technologies that use fuzzy logic outperform the neural networking methods arima is another growing technique that can predict the time series data arima is a combination of autoregressive ar integrated i and moving average ma that has been applied successfully in water resource applications hanh et al 2010 ullah and choudhury 2013 katimon et al 2017 hanh et al 2010 identifies the combined impact of hydrology and climate on the mekong river s water quality using arima models and produced consistent positive results ömer faruk 2010 predicted the water quality of parameters like temperature dissolved oxygen and boron utilizing the combination of arima features with a neural network to handle both the linear and non linear relationships among parameters irvine et al 2011 also used arima to estimate the water quality using physio chemical parameters and water levels in the mekong river using arima the arima model results successfully predicted the trend for one month ahead valipour et al 2012 compared arima and arma to forecast the water in the reservoir and found that arima produces a better model over arma for time series data analysis arima can generate a new set of time series data from the input data with similar statistical parameters abba et al 2019 compared the linear arima and generalized linear regression and non linear models radial basis function neural network rbfnn and hammerstein weiner model on the kinta river and yamuna river they found that the non linear model outperformed the linear model and rbfnn achieves the highest accuracy it was concluded from the literature review that most of the studies had been carried out considering one or more than one artificial intelligence techniques and various techniques have been compared for different dataset to obtain the highest performing model whereas very few studies were found with an ensemble approach to minimize the drawback of one technique by integrating with another the integration of two approaches is a complex process and significant efforts are required to identify the two techniques complementing each other in obtaining the ensemble model with better performance in this study a model is designed to simulate the re aeration coefficient of yamuna river using the five year dataset the hydraulic and water quality parameters are used in the model s input as both concurrently affect the water quality mohd et al 2012 the best anfis model results are ensembled with the arima model to optimize the water quality simulation the combination of anfis and arima is not being used to generate the re aeration coefficient of the river the accuracy of the model was tested out using root mean square error rmse coefficient of correlation r and coefficient of determination r2 as the sampling sites vary significantly at shorter distances arima is applied to obtain the coefficient specific for each location 2 study area and database 2 1 study area yamuna river originates from yamunotri india located at 31 01 n and 78 46 e and confluences to ganga river in allahabad india after travelling 1376 km from its origin after flowing 114 km from the origin the yamuna river is obstructed by an enormous obstruction on river the hathnikund barrage diverts the water into eastern and western yamuna canals for irrigation purposes of haryana and uttar pradesh before the operation of the hathnikund barrage there was sufficient flow in the yamuna river throughout its length however the hathnikund barrage reduced the flow downstream by abstracting approximately 97 of river water soni et al 2014 after flowing 348 km in himachal pradesh and haryana states of india the yamuna river enters delhi at village palla and runs through the sub urban parts of delhi till wazirabad barrage as shown in fig 1 at the barrage most of the water available in the main river channel gets abstracted for the city s water supply and other needs approximately 950 million litres per day mld of water get abstracted from the river accounting for 95 of available water cpcb 2006 almost no water remains in the river downstream of the barrage the condition of the river becomes threatened in the stretch of 22 km from wazirabad to okhla barrage the downstream of the wazirabad barrage the river receives wastewater from several drains as shown in fig 2 the most substantial drain is the najafgarh drain which discharges about five times the river flow and causes the maximum deterioration of the water quality in between wazirabad and okhla barrage 17 drains discharge themselves at the river s right bank at regular intervals before another abstraction from the river to agra canal four drains also join the agra canal containing effluents of the city agra canal takes the water for irrigation in haryana and no freshwater is left in the river downstream of the okhla barrage shahdara drain containing the effluents from the northeast of delhi discharges the downstream of okhla barrage and further deteriorates the river condition as shown in fig 2 the study area falls into a subtropical zone and observes a long summer season with significant day and night temperature variation delhi receives the average annual precipitation of 790 mm having maximum rainfall in july and august i e around 470 mm followed by 190 mm in june and september hence there are higher chances of diluting the water quality of the yamuna river due to the river s direct flow and runoff the average summer temperature of delhi is around 32 c whereas the maximum reaches up to 45 c during winters the average temperature remains around 12 c and the minimum temperature falls up to 2 c the study area observes the day temperature more than 30 c for about eight months in a year indicates the less solubility of oxygen from the atmosphere to the river which in turn harms the self purification capacity of the river due to the less available oxygen concentration 2 2 data collection and analysis the study was conducted for five years 2006 2010 at the four monitoring stations the first sampling location was just 0 3 km downstream of the wazirabad barrage before the confluence of najafgarh drain into the river at the downstream of the barrage najafgarh drain joins the river at merely 0 5 km and discharges about four times the flow available in the river cpcb 2006 ito bridge nizamuddin and okhla barrage are other monitoring stations as shown in fig 2 after wazirabad two major drains najafgarh drain and supplementary drain and eight minor drains join before the ito at the downstream of ito wastewater from the power plant and domestic drains enters the river at the right bank nizamuddin reflects the characteristics of wastewater received from the drains carrying the domestic and industrial discharge in contrast water quality at the okhla barrage sampling location is diluted due to the confluence of hindon cut canal s into the river at the left bank ito is approximately 11 km downstream of wazirabad nizamuddin is 14 km downstream and okhla is 19 6 km downstream of wazirabad barrage as shown in table 1 the study area observes extreme weather throughout the year the subtropical conditions produce high air temperature during summer and very low winter air temperature the maximum water temperature observed was 11 c and the maximum observed was 32 5 c and no significant difference in the temperature of different sampling locations was observed the minimum ph of the study area was found 6 89 and the maximum value of 8 56 do was found only at wazirabad barrage in the range of 4 5 12 1 mg l whereas at other sampling locations do remains zero throughout the year except for monsoon season low bod was found at the wazirabad barrage in the range of 0 5 7 mg l whereas at other sampling sites the minimum bod was found as 2 0 mg l and maximum rises to 57 mg l similarly low cod ammonia and tkn were observed at wazirabad barrage and high at other locations the maximum cod value was 161 mg l found at nizamuddin however conductivity does not vary significantly in the study area only a few instances of high conductivity were observed during the monsoon season the biological parameters were also found low at wazirabad and high at other locations all these changes in the characteristics of water quality parameters are observed due to the confluence of najafgarh supplementary drain downstream of wazirabad barrage and subsequent smaller drains the variation in water quality parameters is shown in table 2 the monthly samples were collected from each location for 60 months and in situ and ex situ analysis was carried out in cumulative 240 samples were collected from four stations and analyzed as per the apha standard procedure apha 2005 the samples were also preserved using hydrochloric acid to maintain the ph before performing the analysis in the laboratory in the laboratory analysis was carried out within 24 h of sample collection the parameters such as ph temperature c conductivity µs cm and dissolved oxygen do mg l were analyzed on site using a portable instrument in contrast biochemical oxygen demand bod mg l chemical oxygen demand cod mg l ammonia µmol cm total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn µmol cm were determined in the laboratory all the parameters were analyzed using the standard method as recommended by apha 2005 the hydraulic characteristics of rivers such as flow m3 s velocity m s depth m and width m were obtained from the study conducted by parmar and keshari 2012 3 methodology the value of re aeration coefficients is being affected by the cumulative impact of various hydraulic and hydrological parameters the identification of adequate parameters for the estimation of the re aeration coefficient is the prime concern anfis is used to identify the appropriate combination of parameters that can simulate the river s re aeration coefficient the combination of hydraulic as well as water quality parameters considered for the formulation of the optimum model the optimum anfis model results combined with the arima to simulate linear and non linear behaviour of the parameters fig 3 shows the detailed methodology adopted for the study 3 1 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis is a combination of a feed forward neural network and fuzzy inference system can model the system with the arrangement of neurons using neural network and fuzzy logic anfis organizes the input output data selection based on learning techniques and constructs input output mapping using fuzzy rules for the application of fuzzy rules two commonly used fuzzy inference systems fis are mamdani fuzzy inference system m fis and takagi sugeno fuzzy inference system ts fis both the fis have different fuzzification and de fuzzification procedures however ts fis produces more compact and accurate results than m fis takagi and sugeno 1985 el shafie et al 2007 for anfis structure a minimum of two inputs x1 and x2 and two fuzzy if then rule for output y required as shown in fig 4 the rule base presents the feed forward equations of anfis contains two takagi sugeno if then rules as follows if x is a1 and y is b1 then f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 rule 1 if x is a2 and y is b2 then f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 1 rule 2 anfis structure described in 5 layers excluding the input layer toprak 2009 that can be described as a multi layered neural network layer 0 define the input layer with n no of nodes layer 1 it provides the membership function of each node through the fuzzification of gaussian rules as μ a i x e x p x c i a i 2 b i where ai bi and ci are the adaptive parameter functions the values of these functions are assigned based on the algorithm selected during the training of the program these parameters are known as premise parameters after assigning the values to the adaptive parameters each input node is trained against the different membership functions to obtain the value of the premise parameter layer 2 each fuzzified node is passed through and operator to strengthened each node the membership values μ a i x and μ b i y are multiplied to gain the strength where and y are the linguistic values of ai and bi and w i is the antecedent function of rule 1 w i μ a i x μ b i y layer 3 all the nodes are normalized with the provided strength as w i w i j 1 r w j where w i is the sum of the strength of ith operators computed in layer 2 layer 4 each node computes the linear function where the coefficient of functions is calculated using a backpropagation neural network s error w i f i w i p 0 x 0 p 1 x 1 p 2 where pi is the parameter for i input values and w i is the output of layer 3 the model is trained using the least square approximation method layer 5 this represents the summation of outputs of every node obtained from the layer 4 computed as follows and the detailed architecture of anfis shown in fig 4 i w i f i i w i f i i w i input spaces in anfis are divided into different parts to create local spaces while designing the complex non linear models which further employs the local model that becomes linear for each partitioned input space for splitting the anfis input function the model uses fuzzy mfs which covers the input space and activate the several local regions simultaneously using single input by overlapping zounemat kermani and scholz 2014 the number of membership function mf plays a vital role as the mfs controls the resolution of the partitioned input functions and approximation of the anfis model grid partitioning and sub clustering are the commonly used method for fis generation with varying numbers of mfs based on input data triangular and gaussian are widely used mfs with a linear system the optimization method available for the training of mfs is the backpropagation algorithm and hybrid learning algorithm firat and güngör 2007 inference operations are identified through fuzzy if then rules and mfs are used to define the rules each fuzzy unit converts the received input to the fuzzy set and fis receives either fuzzy sets or crisp input to model mfs and delivers the fuzzy sets information to the output layer the de fuzzification interface again converts the fuzzy set into a crisp output nayak et al 2005 out of two commonly available fis for anfis modelling ts fis produces more accurate and simplified results ts fis derive the linear output function using a first order polynomial of the input variables and known as first order ts fis function whereas with constant output function known as zero order ts fis takagi and sugeno 1985 shu and ouarda 2007 the selection of a particular mf and the number of rules plays an integral part in designing anfis architecture researchers have concluded that gaussian mf delivers improved results over triangular mf in practice aqil et al 2006 tiwari et al 2018 and produces the minimum mean square error using different input output pairs 3 2 autoregressive integrated moving average arima is a time series model that represents the data with different stochastic processes arima implements the linear model in the time series and follows the statistical distribution such as the normal distribution parmar and bhardwaj 2015 arima is flexible to build the optimal model with numerous time series variations using box jenkins s methodology an arima n m model is the hybrid model of two generalized forms of models autoregressive ar n and moving average ma m models which are frequently used for univariate non stationary time series modelling ar and mar are the generic models and the combination of both is used to develop the time series model known as the arma model alsudani and liu 2017 arma n m represented using mathematical functions as y t c t i 1 n i y t i j 1 m j y t j y t c 1 y t 1 2 y t 2 n y t n t where n and m represent the autoregressive and moving average terms respectively acf and pacf are used to identify the optimal model of time series data these are the two statistical measures that identify the inter relation between the observations parmar and bhardwaj 2015 to develop the model and predict the variables acf and pacf are plotted against the time lag generated from manipulating the lag operator ranking of the ar and ma models are identified using the plots of acf and pacf backshift in the observations is generated in arma using the lag function the lag function in the model estimated as l y t y t however the arima is an advanced version of the arma model and can handle the non stationarity of data mathematically arima n d m models are represented with the inclusion of lag function as l 1 l d y t θ l ε t 1 i 1 n i l i 1 l d y t 1 j 1 m j l j ε t where n d and m represent the order of autoregressive integrated and moving average functions respectively the value of these functions can be zero or greater than zero the integer d is the crucial function in between the arima and arma models because as and when the value of d becomes zero the arima model reduces to arma for most of the arima model the preferred value of d is equal to one 3 3 evaluation of anfis and arima models water quality and hydraulic parameters were combined to design the various models using anfis and arima models to identify and predict the yamuna river s re aeration coefficient five different combinations of input parameters were used to design the model to simulate the re aeration coefficient with high accuracy and the least deviation from the observed values input parameters considered in study for designing the models are flow m3 s velocity m s depth m bod mg l do mg l and conductivity μs cm whereas re aeration coefficient is taken as output parameter the performance of all the developed models is compared using coefficient correlation r coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse r i 1 n k pi k p k mi k m i 1 n k pi k p 2 i 1 n k mi k m 2 1 2 r 2 1 i 1 n k pi k mi 2 i 1 n k pi k p 2 rmse i 1 n k pi k mi 2 n kp 1 day is the predicted re aeration coefficient and km 1 day is the measured coefficient k p 1 day and k m 1 day are the means of predicted and measured re aeration coefficients respectively for the n number of observations the coefficient of determination is also commonly known as the coefficient of efficiency which may be written in several ways and represents the fraction of variance explained by the regression the coefficient of determination compares the residual and initial variance and could vary depending upon the initial variance of observed data the value of r2 closer to unity indicates a good correlation the correlation coefficient represents the degree of relationship between the observed and estimated values 4 model development and application 4 1 model description the hydraulic and water quality parameters were considered for designing the input parameters of the models the dataset was divided into training and testing in a 70 30 ratio the training part of the dataset is applied to train the model and testing is considered for the model s performance evaluation in this study matlab 2018 is used as a modelling tool to design the anfis models for anfis ts fis is used to study the variation and prediction of the re aeration coefficient gaussian mf is used with three mfs for each input the varying number of inputs with various parameters are the primary criteria for designing the models the grid partitioning gp method was applied to develop if then fuzzy rules for the models with fewer input variables and subtractive clustering was used for the models with significant input parameters anfis gp divides the multidimensional data into similar fuzzy regions using the parallel partition to form the clusters considering the number and type of mfs and designs the fuzzy rules based on the number of input parameters fuzzy logic identifies the center of each cluster with multiple iterations to minimize the center arima is the time series forecasting model and effective in forecasting issues out of the various combinations of anfis models the model with the lowest rmse and highest r2 is selected as an input to the arima model to predict the re aeration coefficient as arima is a univariate technique arima uses the box jenkins method to combine the autoregressive and moving average for the model forecasting the gaussian distribution function used to define the arima model on the different order of differencing autoregressive and moving average the output is calculated using the maximum likelihood criterion used to determine the maximum probability of the parameter that contains the maximum information about the time series 4 2 development of anfis models five different combinations of input parameters depth velocity discharge dissolved oxygen biochemical oxygen demand and conductivity are designed in anfis to predict the impact of parameters on the variation of the re aeration coefficient of the river as shown in table 3 the robustness of the anfis is based on the generation of rule base with the contribution of membership function for each input combination arora and keshari 2020 models were designed using anfis gp algorithms with the linear type gaussian mf and each model runs for 20 epochs anfis consumes the operation time based on the number of input parameters and the number of mfs defined for each input the anfis 1 contains only two input parameters and three mfs of each input which form nine fuzzy rules for deriving the relation between input and output parameters the anfis 5 contains the six input parameters and 3 mfs for each input which generates the 729 fuzzy rules the anfis 5 took the maximum computational space and time to handle the relation between input and output parameters through 729 fuzzy rules as shown in table 4 anfis network uses the integration of least square and backpropagation for the optimization of models the errors in models were minimized by estimating differences between measured and observed values of the re aeration coefficient at each epoch the number of fuzzy rules handling the complexity in a model increase with the input parameters the results obtained from the training and testing of anfis models are shown in table 5 it is evident from the table that anfis 5 performed better than the other models each anfis model reaches minimum error in the different number of epochs the performance of models is evaluated using r r2 and rmse the model with r2 between 0 50 and 0 75 is considered a satisfactory model whereas models with r2 higher than 0 75 are considered a good model among all the models the r2 of anfis 1 during training was found less than 0 75 whereas other models fall into a good category model having r2 greater than 0 75 a significant improvement was observed in anfis model performance from anfis 1 to anfis 5 while increasing the input parameters the addition of discharge and do in anfis 2 and anfis 3 respectively improves the performance marginally compared to the anfis 1 model in contrast a significant change in r and r2 was observed with the inclusion of bod and conductivity in anfis 4 and anfis 5 respectively the minimum enhancement of r2 was found between anfis 1 and anfis 2 in training and testing the model indicating discharge has a low impact on the river s re aeration coefficient compared to velocity and depth the most significant hydraulic parameters are velocity and depth as identified by several researchers for clear rivers for the hydrologically altered rivers receiving significant discharge from multiple points and non point sources hydraulic parameters are not enough to estimate the river s re aeration coefficient the maximum change in model performance was observed with the inclusion of bod as an input parameter in the training of anfis 4 in comparison with anfis 3 at 11 2 however during the model testing the maximum improvement of 13 85 was observed in anfis 5 from anfis 4 such a jump in the model performance suggests the significant impact of bod and conductivity in varying the river s re aeration the anfis 5 comes out with minimum rmse and maximum during both training and testing of the model r2 was found in anfis 5 was 0 933 and 0 978 for training and testing the model respectively which indicates the contribution of water quality parameters in the variation of the re aeration coefficient fig 5 shows the plots of predicted and observed re aeration coefficient where output is the re aeration coefficient and the index is the number of samples the observed data points of the training are represented with a hollow circle and testing are shown with dots blue whereas the predicted results are shown with an asterisk red in training and testing of anfis 5 the observed data points are not visible during model testing indicating highly accurate positioning of predicted data points with the observed data points the high performances by the anfis 5 containing both the hydraulic and water quality parameters are attributed to the fact that the re aeration coefficient is significantly affected by both the hydraulic and water quality parameters especially for the river contains the organic impurities and a significant part of do is consumed to decompose the organic matter these conditions become prevalent when the river s water quality falls in class c or below cpcb 2006 for clear rivers falling in class a or b the hydraulic properties significantly influence the river flow and re aeration can only be determined using velocity and depth however when the organic and other impurities join the river the velocity of flow turbulence in the water and depth of bed are affected by the change in viscosity of water change in slope and silting of impurities at the river bed respectively the bod and conductivity selected in the anfis model represent the organic and inorganic impurities respectively present in water the concentration of impurities directly affects the flow by increasing the viscosity and retard the flow velocity the reduction in flow velocity reduces the turbulence and again reduces the oxygen regeneration capacity of the river hence the presence of impurities consumes available oxygen and reduces the oxygen regeneration capacity therefore in polluted rivers like the yamuna river the role of water quality parameters cannot be ignored while designing the re aeration coefficient of the river otherwise the model would not predict the accurate regeneration capacity of the river and produce inaccurate results 4 3 ensemble model arima implements the linear model in the time series and follows the statistical distribution such as the normal distribution parmar and bhardwaj 2015 the rate of generation of oxygen from the atmosphere at the water surface depends on several processes that could be either linear or non linear in order to either reduce the error involved in the anfis model and to map the linearity function in data series by reducing the non stationarity of the data results obtained from best fit anfis model is considered as input to the arima model to generate the hybrid model for the prediction of re aeration coefficient with high accuracy and precision anfis 5 had the highest accuracy among all the anfis models and residuals of anfis 5 are combined with the arima to further enhance model prediction efficiency the ensemble model would capture both the anfis and arima benefits and generate the results with combined features that would produce a model with high accuracy the structure of the arima model is based on the order of autoregressive p order of moving average q and degree of transformation d the autocorrelation acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf are used to determine the arima model s best structure the acf performs the cutoff at lag q for determining the moving average in contrast pacf performs the cutoff at lag p for determining autoregressive function arima models are generated using the gaussian distribution method with one lag for each data point four arima models are designed with different order autoregressive and moving average functions and degree of transformation as shown in table 6 the l defines the lag operator yt is the actual error ε t is the random error a n d θ are the model parameters and c is a constant to determine the best possible structure of the arima model acf and pacf are used the acf and pacf for the re aeration coefficient are shown in fig 6 the figures indicate that p and q conclude within the sample set without any transformation the lag due to stationary series is determined using autoregressive lag of forecasted errors is determined using moving average and degree of transformation helps to identify the time series lag in arima 1 the zero order autoregressive and moving average function is considered the first order of difference transformation as shown in table 6 similarly other arima models are defined with separate autoregressive and moving average function order and difference transformation the performance of the arima models arima 1 arima 2 arima 3 and arima 4 was evaluated using various statistical techniques and it was found that arima with zero order of autoregressive and moving average function with first order of difference transformation performs better than the higher order functions the autocorrelation results indicate the sample size is adequate concise within the confidence limits the standard error t statistics and p value of arima p d q are taken for the performance evaluation of models are shown in table 7 all the arima models variants produce approximately similar results however arima 1 gives the lowest standard error out of these four models whereas arima 4 gives the better value of the p value in arima 2 a high standard error was observed for ar and ma and produced a nominal p value arima 3 produces a low standard error however the p value was found insignificant similarly a low standard error from ar of arima 4 was found but produced an insignificant p value fig 7 indicates the higher correlation between the observed and predicted re aeration coefficient from different arima models only arima 1 produces both low standard error and significant p value while performing both the first order of autoregressive and moving average the model result deteriorates due to the overstretching as the data set contains the modified values from the anfis it was observed that anfis recorded the non linearity of the data point and the non stationary is handled at the first order of difference transformation the moving average provides adds simple exponential smoothing to model but increases the standard error in observed and predicted values the greater peaks and troughs are observed in arima 2 and arima 4 compared to arima 1 and arima 3 model fig 7 the comparison plot of arima 3 looks similar to arima 1 but having higher value of standard error hence no further autoregressive and moving average are required to minimize the error of transformation hence the arima 1 0 1 0 produces the most optimal results with the least computational space the combination of anfis with arima produces a desirable feature that can be used as a potential tool for identifying the channel s re aeration coefficient for each specific location with significantly varying water quality and hydraulic properties the selection of appropriate parameters for the prediction is the prime requirement the input parameters vary significantly depending upon the characteristics of the study area the re aeration model designed by various researchers is only based on hydraulic parameters arora and keshari 2021 the process of re aeration for hydrologically altered rivers cannot be determined using the hydraulic parameter as the water quality parameters due to the anthropogenic disturbance significantly affect the hydrology of the river the results show that a combination of hydraulic and water quality parameters improves the re aeration modelling efficiency tremendously the ensemble approach further reduces the error significantly in predicting the re aeration coefficient the optimal anfis and arima model in combination can mimic the re aeration process of the river and justifies that the approach is acceptable for policy formulation related to river quality management river water diversion and river maintenance work the amount of wastewater that can be discharged into the river and the level of treatment required before the discharge can also be determined by simulating the water quality using a newly developed re aeration modelling approach 5 conclusion the re aeration coefficient for the polluted stretch of river is determined using the anfis and arima ensemble approach the anfis gp is used to develop the five different models considering the various combinations of input parameters to simulate the re aeration coefficient of the yamuna river the performance of models obtained from the anfis was evaluated using r r2 and rmse to identify the model accuracy anfis 5 which contains the six input parameters generates the optimal model with the least rmse of 0 103 in testing and the highest r2 of 0 933 and 0 978 in model training and testing the combination of hydraulic and water quality parameters improves the prediction efficiency drastically the residuals of anfis are integrated with arima to form the anfis arima ensemble model utilizing the time series forecasting of arima with the if then rule based analysis of anfis the ensembled model was applied to the study area to predict the re aeration coefficient considering both the non linear and linear relationship between the parameters using anfis and arima the results reveal that the hybrid model further reduces the anfis model s errors and significantly improves the model efficiency arima performs the difference operation for non stationary time series data and the combined model utilizes the logic function along with the difference operation to increase the accuracy of the model the study s critical outcome reflects that for the simulation of the re aeration coefficient of rivers which receives wastewater load water quality parameters hold good along with the hydraulic parameters the fast and accurate evaluation of the re aeration coefficient would also support the formulation of water resource management policies which primarily depend upon the river s water quality funding this research did not
